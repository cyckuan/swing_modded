MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said Friday that Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Turkey's
Kurdish Working Party, is not in Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Competent agencies conducted an appropriate investigation
under Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's instructions. It can be
stated officially that Ocalan is not in Russia," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was wanted in Turkey on terrorism charges, left
Italy last Saturday and Turkish authorities said he was heading
for Russia, an assertion Moscow repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Director Valentin Sobolev of Russia's Federal
Security Service, the successor to the Soviet Union's KGB, also
said Ocalan "is not and has not been" in Russia.
</P>
<P>
He said a week ago, pertinent complaints "were lodged with us
by Turkish special services, and Italian special services voiced
their assumptions".
</P>
<P>
"We took all measures to locate Ocalan, and now, after one
week, we can say with enough certainty that he is not in Russia,"
Sobolev said.

<P>
CAIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa stressed Friday the need for an upcoming Arab meeting of
foreign ministers to come out with "a positive stand" on the Iraqi
issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Moussa said that such a stand will be
"benefiting Arab interests and playing in favor of Iraq and its
people."
</P>
<P>
Arab countries initially decided to convene the foreign
ministers' meeting on December 30 to discuss a Yemeni call for an
Arab summit on the Iraqi crisis following the mid-December attack
by the United States and Britain against Iraq for what the
U.S. said Baghdad's failure to comply with the United Nations arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
At the request of Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the meeting was put
off to January 24 for more consultations and better preparations.
</P>
<P>
Moussa disclosed that he discussed the planned meeting with
foreign ministers of several Arab countries in the day, adding
that he will continue the process on Saturday in a bid to reach a
unified Arab stance.
</P>
<P>
The question of convening an Arab summit is likely to be put on
the agenda of the meeting, but it will not be the main issue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The consultative meeting will dwell on discussion of the
current situation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Congo (K) Willing to Sign Ceasefire Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) is ready to sign a ceasefire agreement to end the war in the
country but this should be followed by an immediate withdrawal of
foreign troops, visiting DRC Foreign Minister Jean Lolakombe Okoto
said in Harare on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said it was not the responsibility of the DRC to
push for the signing of the ceasefire agreement but for the
invading forces and their rebel allies.
</P>
<P>
The DRC has censured Rwanda and Uganda to support rebels in the
country trying to topple the DRC President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Okoto said, "We are not the ones who should press for a
ceasefire because we are the victims of these aggressive forces."
</P>
<P>
He was briefing reporters after meeting Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe and his Zimbabwean counterpart Stan Mudenge.
</P>
<P>
Okoto said President Laurent Kabila was ready to talk to the
rebels and their allies but since the problem was unique to the
DRC it had to be resolved within the boundaries of the central
African country.
</P>
<P>
His comment came in the wake of an agreement by countries
involved in the DRC conflict to sign a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was reached at a meeting attended by Zimbabwe,
Uganda, Rwanda, Namibian and Angola in Windhoek, Namibia, this
week.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the role of South Africa in the DRC, Okoto said
Pretoria's stance was ambiguous as it had not offered any tangible
support toward the thwarting of enemy advances.
</P>
<P>
"Our allies are well known and very clear in their
stand-points. South Africa is not very clear," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Not all countries are pleased with the presence of countries
like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad in the DRC. Some of our
African brothers are being used to destabilize other countries,"
said Okoto.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibian and Chad have sent troops to help
the DRC army fight the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The DRC Foreign Minister was in Harare to discuss the Windhoek
summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Home Affairs
Minister Dumiso Dabengwa Friday said the country will put in place
stringent measures to ensure political stability by protecting the
military against bad press.
</P>
<P>
The minister was addressing mourners who gathered at the
Bulawayo provincial heroes acre to witness the burial of two army
officers who died in the Democratic Republic of Congo last Friday,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"I will not sit idle and do nothing while the security of the
army is being undermined by a few misinformed individuals who have
their own hidden agendas," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister was responding to an article published by a local
weekly paper, The Standard, on January 10 alleging 23 army
officers had been held over a foiled coup plot.
</P>
<P>
He said as a result of the article, the ministry realized that
the new law of the Public Order and Security Bill, which awaited
the government gazetting and is meant to replace the Law and Order
Maintenance Act, did not protect the army against such
allegations.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, we have reverted back to the Law and Order
Maintenance Act to deal with the matter and protect the security
of this country, and I will not hesitate to make amendments if
there is need to protect the military," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, I would like to warn the press that granting them the
freedom of expression does not give them the right to publish
lies, with the intention of creating public disorder. We won't
allow that to happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the alleged coup story, editor of the Standard Mark
Chavunduka and senior reporter Ray Choto have been charged by
police for publishing a false story likely to cause alarm and
despondency and have been detained by the military.

MAPUTO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Minister of Economic

many investment opportunities in his country and urged
entrepreneurs from the Republic of Korea (ROK) to invest with
confidence.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to the press after meeting visiting Korean
entrepreneurs.
</P>

The minister noted that the Koreans are interested in
agriculture and commerce. But he said they should also pay
attention to tourism and industry, especially hotel industry, both
of which have witnessed rapid development in the recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to Comiche, the Koreans are quite satisfied with the
investment environment in Mozambique and are mainly concerned at
the moment about choosing the best field for investment.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member ROK delegation arrived here on Thursday evening.
They will pay a 6-day visit to Matola City, a satellite city of
the capital Maputo, at the invitation of Mayor Carlos Tembe.

The delegation is also expected to have talks with relevant

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The British High Commission
expressed regret that both Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash decided not to attend
separate working meals with British diplomats that were scheduled
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The commission said in a written statement that one of the
purposes of the meetings was to hear the views of the two leaders
on efforts to settle the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Clerides announced that he and his top advisors
would not attend a dinner at the commissioner's residence in
reaction to statements by Britain's Cyprus envoy David Hannay.
</P>
<P>
Hannay, who came to Cyprus to consult with British ambassadors
to Cyprus, Greece and Turkey on the Cyprus issue, said Thursday
that there was "excessive concentration on all sides on matters of
forms and not enough focus on matters of substance."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government criticized Hannay's statement for not
being "in the spirit of U.N. resolutions calling for a solution to
the Cyprus issue based on a bizonal, bicommunal federation."
</P>
<P>
Denktash also cancelled the working lunch he was to have with
the British ambassadors, but gave no reason for the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Troops in Lesotho to Stay, S. Africa Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Troops from South Africa
and Botswana would remain in Lesotho until asked by Lesotho
government to leave,

South African presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"At this point there is no withdrawal on the cards," South
African Press Association quoted Mankahlana as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho's opposition alliance Thursday renewed its call for the
troops, under the auspices of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC), to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
The demand was made after the opposition walked out of a
meeting of Lesotho's Interim Political Authority on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC task force was deployed in September last year at the
request of the Lesotho government amid indications of an imminent
coup.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said SADC troops would remain in Lesotho until their
mission to help restore democracy was accomplished.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any mission to keep our troops there
indefinitely, but they have to stay until the Lesotho government
tells them to leave," Mankahlana said.

ATHENS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece opposed the use of force
to end the problem in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Greek
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Reppas stressed that any
intervention which did take place must have the backing of the
United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the circumstances surrounding the
killings of 45 ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had not been fully
clarified, responsibility lay with those who contributed to the
continuation of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Greece urged Belgrade to take all necessary measures to arrest
those responsible for the massacre and to cooperate with the
international community so that the agreements signed between
Belgrade and the parties concerned might be implemented with
consistency, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Athens also opposed the return of
Yugoslav troops to the area from which they withdrew on the basis
of the agreement of October 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
Greek Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos Friday also stressed
the need of seeking a political solution to the Kosovo problem.
</P>

He warned that the worst could happen if a solution to the
Kosovo crisis was not achieved before the end of this Winter.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Tanzania to Meet Over Rwandan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan and Tanzanian officials
are scheduled to meet in the northwestern Tanzanian town of
Arusha next Monday to discuss the issue of Rwandan refugees
allegedly crossing to Tanzania, Ephraim Kabaija, the presidential
advisor and chairman of the Repatriation Commission, told Rwanda
News Agency (RNA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kabaija dismissed recent media reports alleging that 5,400
Rwandans recently crossed to Tanzania, saying these reports amount
to mere misinformation.
</P>
<P>
''It is misinformation,'' Kabaija told RNA. ''The truth is that
these reports refer to the number of people who showed up to
reception centers in Ngara since January 1998,'' he indicated.
</P>
<P>
''The Tanzanian government and the United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) have registered them and they were
given the refugee status,'' Kabaija explained. He added that
these are people who resisted the 1996 massive repatriation and
have been ever since roaming in forests in northwest Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Over 400,000 Rwandans crossed to Tanzania in the wake of the
1994 genocide which claimed more than 500,000 ethnic Tutsis and
opposition Hutus. Most of these refugees who had formed the
world's largest camp at Benako were repatriated in late 1996 in
joint operation involving Rwanda, Tanzania and the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
As for Rwandans who migrated into Kenya in the 1930s and 1940s
to work as laborers in tea plantations and are being expelled,
Kabaija said before putting into execution this order, the Kenyan
government should give them notice, and respect their rights as
workers.
</P>
<P>
The number of Rwandans faced with expulsion orders by the
Kenyan government are believed to be between 250 and 300.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana deplored that these
expulsions are contrary to the pan-Africanism ideals many African
leaders are championing for. He promised to raise the matter
during the forthcoming meetings due in Arusha this weekend on the
lifting of sanctions imposed on Burundi.
</P>
<P>
''What is important is to respect their normal rights as
workers,'' Kabaija told RNA, adding that Rwanda will assist in
their repatriation.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Reiterates Commitment to E. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has reiterated his country's commitment to the objectives
of East African Cooperation and regional economic integration as
well as to peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The president made the commitment when addressing heads of
state of east Africa who convened in Arusha, northern Tanzania
Friday for the third summit of East African Cooperation, a press
release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said progress had been made in promoting the region as
a single trade and investment area and called for the elimination
of any existing constraints to the ultimate objective.
</P>
<P>
The existence of trade imbalances results from structural
differences among the three economies.
</P>
<P>
With the present commitment to integration, the three countries
will be able to overcome these constraints by putting in place a
trade and investment regime that will eventually be favorable to
all member states, Museveni added.
</P>
<P>
He called for more efforts in infrastructural development, as
it will be difficult for the region to effectively compete if high
costs continue to be incurred as a result of the poor and
inadequate infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
This summit reviews the work of the Tripartite Commission and
endorses the agenda for the coming year. It will also discuss
possible lifting of economic sanctions on Burundi.

<HEADLINE> FM: Russia Keeps High Profile in World Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Friday that Russia not only retained its status
as a key player on the international scene but it strengthened it
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The consistent and balanced foreign policy of Russia was a
stabilizing factor in international affairs," Ivanov told a press
conference devoted to the country's foreign policy achievements
last year.
</P>
<P>
"Key contemporary issues can only be solved with Russia's
participation and by taking its interests into account," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Russia's ties with the United States, Ivanov said they
should not be assessed "through the prism of disagreements over
separate problems, notably Kosovo and Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Certain irritants" exist in bilateral relations, Ivanov said.
"These are primarily the actions Russia opposes, including U.S.
air strikes against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov said that "irritants are a temporary factor,
which can usually be done away with if both sides want to," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is important to continue dialogue and constructive
discussion, to prevent such disagreements from evolving into a
confrontation between our countries. We are trying to prevent
this, we are trying, though arguments and discussions, to maintain
our mutual tasks in the strategic partnership sphere," he said.
</P>
<P>
As for Moscow' cooperation with NATO, Ivanov said, "A lot will
depend on the alliance's policy in international affairs, on
whether it will follow the course of creating dividing lines in
Europe."
</P>
<P>
Russia "cannot agree" with NATO's new strategic concept aimed
at the use of force in conflict settlement and its interference
outside its zones of influence without U.N. sanctions, Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
The new concept, which Ivanov said ignores Russia's interests,
may become a source of mutual mistrust, he said. "Russia does not
want that."
</P>
<P>
He warned that a possible use of NATO force in Kosovo would
amount to violation of U.N. rules.
</P>
<P>
"Disrespect for the U.N. Rules would not leave Russia
indifferent and would influence our relations with the alliance,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also talked about the Middle East peace process, saying
that Moscow "is having very intensive contacts with both Israel
and individual Arab countries to sense the possible additional
steps that could give an impetus not only on the
Palestinian-Israeli but also the Israeli-Syrian and
Israeli-Lebanese treks."

<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Regional
Police Chiefs Cooperation Organization (SARPCCO) Friday said it
successfully executed organized crimes in the region last year
recovering stolen property worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Botswana Police Service and Chairman of SARPCCO
Norman Moleboge told a press conference in Harare that crimes were
curbed through three operations code-named Midas, Atlantic and
Sesani.
</P>
<P>
Moleboge said property with an estimated value of 17 million
U.S. Dollars was recovered during operation Midas in Lesotho,
Swaziland, South Africa and Mauritius.
</P>
<P>
The stolen property included motor vehicles and rounds of
ammunition.
</P>
<P>
Operation Sesani, he said, was conducted in Malawi and among
the items recovered were six tons of cannabis from nine fields
with a street value of about seven million U.S. Dollars while 44
home-made guns were seized in Tanzania during the same operation.
</P>
<P>
International organizations were coming forward to sponsor
SARPCCO because of its commitment and efforts in curbing crimes in
the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moleboge is on a familiarization tour to Zimbabwe, Tanzania and
Malawi as chairman of SARPCCO after taking the chairmanship from
George Fivaz of South Africa last year.

<P>
ATHENS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Greek Defense Undersecretary
Dimitris Apostolakis Friday denied a press report that
negotiations were under way for the sale of the Russian-made
anti-aircraft missiles purchased by Cyprus to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Greek Parliament, Apostolakis said that
consultations were in progress with the Russian side about the way
in which the S-300 missiles would be transported to Greece.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen its defense, Cyprus decided in 1997 to purchase
and deploy the S-300 missiles on the divided island, but this has
been opposed by neighboring Turkey, which has threatened to use
force to prevent the missile installation. After consultations
with Greece, Cyprus announced late last year that it would deploy
the missiles on the southern Greek island of Crete instead of
Cyprus itself.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Defense Minister Yiannakis Chryssostomos is expected to
arrive in Athens on February 8 for a four-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he will have talks with his Greek counterpart
Akis Tsohatzopoulos on the transport and deployment of the
missiles on Crete.
</P>
<P>
Currently, military officials of Greece and Cyprus are
continuing talks on the S-300 missiles in Athens.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said Friday Lebanon will follow up unanimous views of Arab
countries regarding a proposed Arab summit on the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
"We support such a summit on the condition that Arab countries
reach a consensus on it," he said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Hoss stressed that Lebanon will determine its position over
the Iraqi issue in the upcoming Arab League foreign ministers'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting, initially scheduled for late December
after the mid-December air strikes by the United States and
Britain on Iraq, was postponed to January 24 amid disagreements
among Arab states over how to handle the Iraqi crisis.
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers are reportedly to discuss a Saudi
Arabian proposal that calls for easing the United Nations
sanctions on Iraq while maintaining strict measures to ensure that
Iraq doesn't acquire weapons or equipment to produce them.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is also expected to focus on a Yemeni call for an
Arab summit to discuss the Iraqi issue.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said that Lebanon will hold continuous consultation over
the matter with its strong ally Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria, with 40,000 troops deployed in Lebanon, has been closely
coordinating with the country on key domestic and foreign
affairs.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM: Kurdish Rebel Leader Not in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov Friday sent a message to his Turkish counterpart Bulent
Ecevit, saying that Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was not
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The message, delivered to the Turkish Foreign Ministry by a
Russian Embassy councillor, said that investigations showed that
Ocalan, leader of the separatist Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK)
outlawed in Turkey, was not in Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey requested the Russian government to continue to make
investigations for the whereabouts of Ocalan after he left Italy,
a Turkish Foreign Ministry statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Faruk
Logoglu summoned Italian Ambassador to Ankara Massimilliano
Bandini, accusing the Italian government of allowing Ocalan to
leave Rome for Russia.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that, accompanied by Italian policemen, Ocalan
left his villa in the town of Infernetto, 30 kilometers south of
Rome and took a plane from Rome's military airport Ciampino to
Moscow last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was sought after by Turkey, was arrested in Rome on
November 12 last year after arriving on a flight from Moscow under
international arrest warrants issued by Germany and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Germany said later that it would not seek extradition of
Ocalan for fear of sparking unrest between its own Kurdish and
Turkish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Italy and Turkey rifted after Italy
rejected Turkey's extradition request on account of Italian law,
which forbids extradition to countries where the death penalty
is in force.

<HEADLINE> France Offers New Proposal on Iraq Before Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- France Friday offered a new
proposal to Arab countries over Iraqi crisis ahead of an upcoming
Arab foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"French ambassadors presented this morning a memorandum to
Arab states' governments containing a French proposal over Iraqi
crisis," Daniel Jouanneau, French Ambassador in Lebanon, told
reporters after submitting the memo to Lebanese Foreign
Ministry's director-general Zafer Hassan.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, some necessary inspections should be
maintained, on the one hand, to make sure that Iraq is unable to
rebuild its arsenal which will bring danger to its neighbors, and
update current inspection system and replace it with a new one.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Jouanneau said, Iraqi people's sufferings
should be halted and they should be given a new hope which could
make them to see light at the end of tunnel, and therefore the
sanctions imposed on them should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that only a political solution could lead to a
way out from the Iraqi crisis," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the proposal was made to Arab countries just
before the Arab League foreign ministers' meeting which is
scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day meeting, Arab foreign ministers will discuss
ways of easing the current Iraqi crisis after the mid-December
air strikes by U.S. and British forces on Iraq for what the
U.S. said Iraq didn't fully comply with its commitment to
cooperate with U.N. weapon inspectors.

The EU said in the declaration that it reaffirms its commitment
to supporting Romania in the ongoing difficult transformation
process. "The European Union recognizes that this process involves
measures which are painful for the people of Romania."
</P>
<P>
"The EU remains fully committed to Romania's accession to the

measures proposed by international institutions, are of utmost
importance for Romania on its way into the European Union."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the EU said it welcomes Rolmania's commitment to
full and coherent implementation of its reform package. This, the
EU said, will be supported by a substantial increase of Phare
financing for economic reform, which is an assigned funding to
assist central and eastern European countries who are applying for
EU membership.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Seek Money to Prevent Computer, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Friday that he will ask Congress for 2.8 billion U.S. dollars
to help the country guard against attacks via computers, viruses
or chemicals.
</P>
<P>
"The enemies of peace realize they cannot defeat us with
traditional means," Clinton said in a speech at the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. has to guard against attacks on the nation's
computer network, banking systems, power grids and other essential
services. Similarly, he said the government must accelerate
research and development into defenses against germ warfare and
chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing everything we can in ways that I can -- and ways
that I cannot -- discuss to try to stop people who would misuse
chemical and biological capacity from getting that capacity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a cause for panic," Clinton added. "It is a cause
for serious, deliberate, disciplined, long-term concern. And I am
absolutely convinced that if we maintain our clear purpose and our
strength of will, we will prevail here. We have better than a good
chance of success but we must be deliberate and we must be
aggressive."
</P>
<P>
Clinton told the newspaper it is "highly likely" that a
terrorist group would launch or threaten a germ or chemical attack
on American soil within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The president warned that any attack would lead to "at least a
proportionate if not a disproportionate response."
</P>
<P>
Clinton's plan, to be included in his fiscal 2000 budget
proposal next month, is intended to ensure the United States is
able to defend against, and ready to respond to, any such
terrorist attacks, national security spokesman David Leavy said.

In his report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said that

Annan recommended that the council respond positively to a
request from the Lebanon government and extend the mission's
mandate for a period of six months.
</P>

government's authority over the southern part of the country after

<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The continued operation of the
Russian space station Mir will require 250 million U.S. dollars in
annual spending from non-budget sources, Interfax reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov signed a government resolution
accepting the proposals of the Russian Space agency and Energia
Space Corporation to prolong the station's operation until 2002.
</P>
<P>
The space station was originally set to be shut down in the
summer of this year.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said prolonging the Mir's service was
economically advantageous for Russia and that it would not violate
the requirements of the international convention for safety in
space activities.
</P>
<P>
Mir will be 13 years old on February 20, but cosmonauts,
engineers, designers and safety experts from the space training
center have confirmed its reliability and readiness for new
scientific experiments, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
The crew of the 27th space mission, due to be launched to the
station on February 2, have confirmed their readiness to stay in
orbit until August instead of July as was initially planned.

<HEADLINE> E. African States to Sign Community Treaty in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Kenya, Uganda
and Tanzania said at the annual one-day summit Friday that they
would sign a long- expected treaty on July 30 as scheduled to
enhance the regional integration level.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique reaching here from Arusha, a northern
Tanzanian town, the presidents of the East African Cooperation
(EAC) states, Daniel Moi of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and
the host Benjamin Mkapa, appreciated a speedy process toward
regional unity, peace, stability and equitable development.
</P>
<P>
They urged the EAC Permanent Tripartite Commission, a standing
ruling body, to complete the remaining stages of the Treaty-making
process which started soon after the EAC was founded in April
1997.
</P>
<P>
The presidents also discussed the on-going fighting in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), reiterating their call for a
peaceful resolution of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
But they did not say if Uganda is ready to withdraw its troops
from the eastern part of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The EAC heads of state also suggested setting up a regional
security mechanism to avert terrorism like the August bombings of
the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that caused
casualties of more than 5,000 people, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
They reviewed the progress in the private sector development
and proposed a regional conference on this issue in October to be
followed by an international investing conference for East Africa
in February next year.
</P>
<P>
The presidents will be joined by their counterparts or their
representatives in Ethiopia, Rwanda, Burundi and Zambia in a
regional summit in Arusha Saturday.
</P>
<P>
They will be briefed by Julius Nyerere, mediator of the Burundi
crisis, on the progress achieved by the warring parties in their
peace talks which have now entered the fourth round since last
June.
</P>
<P>
The possible easing or lifting of the economic sanctions
against Burundi since August 1996 a few days after Pierre Buyoya
assumed power in a bloodless military coup, will also be
discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources said that Rwanda has requested to join the
East African Cooperation but will have to wait until the signing
of the Treaty by the three partner states.
</P>
<P>
They quoted an official at the summit meeting as saying that

<HEADLINE> China Outlines Five Principles in Talks to Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese delegation has
outlined five propositions of principle on the specific issues tobe
discussed by the Subcommittee for Tension Reduction which was
launched during the current session of the Four-Party Talks on the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement by the Chinese delegation issued here
Friday, the five principles are:
</P>
<P>
-- Cooperation in Confidence Building Measures (CBMs) in its
broader sense should be promoted, which includes the establishment
and development of exchanges and mutually-beneficial cooperation
in the political, diplomatic, military, economic and social fields
and the increase of confidence in an all-round way;
</P>
<P>
-- The further improvement of relations among relevant
countries should be supported and the gradual normalization of
relations between the DPRK and the U.S. as well as other countries
would be welcome;
</P>
<P>
-- Relevant parties should conduct multilayered and
multi-formed cooperation in CBMs in the military field;
</P>
<P>
-- In view of the prevailing conditions on the Peninsula, the
parties should take effective and feasible measures to prevent
possible military conflict;
</P>
<P>
-- Each party should refrain from taking any hostile and
provocative military action against the other parties.
</P>
<P>
The fourth session of the Four-Party Talks ended here Friday
and the fifth session is scheduled in mid-April, 1999.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS, U.N.  Agree on More Troops for S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statement by the ECOWAS secretariat in Nigerian capital Abuja
said Friday that the body's Executive Secretary Lansana Kouyate
and U.N. special envoy Francis Okelo met Thursday to review the
situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed on a number of steps that should be taken to
restore peace and stability in Sierra Leone," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the most urgent need is to strengthen the
operational capability of the ECOWAS intervention force ECOMOG,
including donor support for the speedy deployment of additional
troops from Benin, Mali, Gambia and Niger.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, both men approved "the continued
pursuit of the dual track approach, combining military action with
a diplomatic solution."
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic efforts by Togo and Cote d'Ivoire last week to find
a political solution to the crisis in Sierra Leone were stalled
after Nigeria complained that the three countries which
contributed troops to ECOMOG, including Ghana and Guinea, are
being sidelined.
</P>
<P>
Kouyate and Okelo also called for urgent action to address the
severe humanitarian crisis in Freetown, which has been cut off of
normal food supply since the rebels launched their offensive on
January 6.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Miners End Labor Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Protesting Jiu Valley miners
decided Friday evening to end their march to Bucharest and head
back home following successful talks between Prime Minister Radu
Vasile and the miners' delegation headed by Miron Cozma.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure the conflict has been resolved now," the prime
minister told the press following negotiations at Cozia, a village
near Ramnicu Valcea city (180 km northwest of Bucharest), where
the miners spent the night on their march to the capital.
</P>
<P>
"We have agreed on a series of solutions that may lead to the
settlement of the Jiu Valley miners' claims," Radu Vasile said,
adding that a joint commission to comprise trade union members and
members of the administration will be created to come up with a
program for reducing production costs and losses within the
National Coal Administration.
</P>
<P>
The program will be discussed in Bucharest 30 days after
its drawing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Radu Vasile did not tell what concession he had made to Cozma,
but it seems that the miners' claims were mostly satisfied.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that Dalja and Barbateni mines would not
be closed as planned, said Nicolae Staiculescu, secretary of state
to the Industry and Commerce Ministry, who also attended the
negotiations. "It is very likely that the miners will get a 35
percent pay increase as they demanded if they present a program
aimed at reducing losses by 20 percent annually and eliminating
them over the next five years," he added.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations began Friday afternoon at about 2:00 p.m. local
time (1200 GMT). The results of negotiations created the condition
for a peaceful settlement of the conflict. "The declaration of a
state of emergency will no longer be justified, if the miners
observe their promise and return to the Jiu Valley," read a
release by the Presidency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, President Emil Constantinescu declared
to impose a state of emergency across the whole country, if the
miners refused to return home and resume work.
</P>
<P>
The miners' strike broke out on January 4 in the Jiu Valley
area, Romania's largest coal field. On Monday, about 10,000 miners
began a protest march to the capital and arrived in Ramnicu Valcea
Thursday evening.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, U.N. Team Consider Demining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. team of landmine experts
arrived here Friday for a week-long mission to study
possibilities of clearing mines on the Jordanian-Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The five-member group from the United Nations Mine Action
Service (UNMAS) would help the kingdom to determine the
humanitarian and socioeconomic threats to Jordan posed by some
250,000 landmines planted along the border between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. team, headed by Colonel Wolfgang Hirsch, would meet
Jordanian Prince Ra`d Ben Zeid, director of the Hashemite Charity
Society for Soldiers with Special Needs, which extended assistance
to landmine survivors.
</P>
<P>
The UNMAS experts would also meet with members of the Jordanian
armed forces, senior government officials and representatives of
the diplomatic corps, who support initiatives to remove landmines
and assist victims.
</P>
<P>
The experts are expected to prepare for a demining program
after their visit to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Landmines had long constituted a grave threat to the kingdom,
especially in the northern Jordan Valley and the northern
frontier.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian military estimated that over 300,000 landmines
had been planted in the kingdom since 1948, killing 88 civilians
and injuring 400 others up to date.
</P>
<P>
Last July, Jordan became the fifth Arab country to sign the
1997 Ottawa Convention, which prohibits the use, production and
stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines.

LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- European shares declined sharply
Friday amid ongoing concerns about Latin America's potential to
disrupt world markets.
</P>
<P>
Growing fears of Brazil's crisis spilling over into other Latin
American and South East Asian economies took the steam out of
European stock exchanges.
</P>

By 1315 GMT, London's leading FTSE index was 156 points lower
at 5,868 and it closed at 5,861.2 for a decline of 161 points,
nearly 3 percent, on the day.

Credit Suisse First Boston's UK strategist Paul O'Connor said,
"The market's principal obsession is still developments in
emerging markets, and this'll be very much the story carrying on
into next week."
</P>
<P>
German stocks slid at the opening as expected on Wall Street's
weaker settlement, although analysts did appear worried.

The leading Xetra Dax index was down 124 points at 5,032 by

<HEADLINE> EU Wins WTO Case Against Korea's Alcohol Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
here Friday that it won an appeal this week before the World Trade
Organization (WTO) against Republic of Korea's tax system for
spirits.
</P>
<P>
The point at issue was the wide gap between the tax rates
imposed on imported and local spirits. In the Republic of Korea,
imported whisky and brandy face 100 percent tax, vodka, rum, gin
and other white spirits face 80 percent tax while the local soju
spirit only faces a 35 percent tax rate.
</P>
<P>
Now, the European Commission said, Korea must change its law,
pay compensations for the EU, when the original WTO panel found
that Korea's law was in breach of international trade rules.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the EU's executive branch, said it will closely
follow the implementation of the ruling, together with the
European industry. Currently, European exports of spirits amount
to some four billion euro a year and the spirits industry employs
50,000 people in the EU-wide.
</P>
<P>
The EU believes that the spirits industry in its 15 member
states has suffered serious trade damage from the present Korea
regime. The WTO Appellate Body has confirmed that imported spirits
and locally produced soju in Korea are directly competitive or
substitutable products and that the present system of taxation
affords protection to domestic production. Under the WTO
regulation, no further appeal is possible against this ruling.
</P>
<P>
Now, the EU is the world's main producer and exporter of
spirits. The Korean market for alcoholic beverages is worth over
five billion euro per year with soju taking the lead in spirits
segment. And western style spirits are sold in far smaller
quantities than soju in the Korean market.
</P>
<P>
The commission concluded that European producers should be
allowed to compete in the Korean market without facing any kind of
discrimination and trade distortive measures.

<HEADLINE> Russia Registers Major Economic Decline in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russia witnessed grave economic
decline in 1998, with major reductions in production, trade and
mounting jobless rate that threw more people into poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released Friday by the State Statistics
Committee said Friday, Russia's industrial output dropped 5.2
percent from a year before.
</P>
<P>
Grain production, the lowest since 1957, was at only 47.8
million tons, 46.1 percent less than that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of 1998, Russia's foreign trade went
down by 16.1 percent to 121.3 billion U.S. dollars, with export
and import down respectively by 17 percent and 15.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Russians' real income was slashed by 13.8 percent and 27.1
percent of the population were living below the subsistence level.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last December, the country's rank of jobless
swelled to 8.571 million, or 11.8 percent of the labor force.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senators Question Lawyers in Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- After two weeks of mere
observing, U.S. senators posed their first questions to lawyers in
President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial Friday and transformed
the proceeding into a seesaw debate between prosecutors and
presidential lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton wants all the benefits of a criminal trial
without bearing any of its burden," Charles Canady, a Republican
senator, declared as he rejected White House claims that the
impeachment articles were too broad and vague and would never
survive the test of a criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by
the House along partisan lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that President Clinton and his counsel know exactly
what he is being charged with," Canady said. "Impeachment is a
political and not a criminal proceeding."
</P>
<P>
White House Counsel Charles Ruff used an early question to
differentiate between impeachment of a federal judge and that of a
president, arguing the threshold for the latter must be much
higher.
</P>
<P>
"Do you ask the same questions about the trauma the nation
suffers when you are removing a judge as when you are removing a
president?" Ruff said. "That answer must be stunningly different
when you are asked should the president of the United States be
removed and the will of the electorate overturned."
</P>
<P>
Before the questioning began, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
suggested a closed-door meeting of all senators to discuss the
future of the impeachment trial amid indications that Democrats
were holding firm in their support of the president. Far from
giving up, Henry Hyde, head of the House prosecutors, suggested
senators invite the president to testify.
</P>
<P>
The White House has said repeatedly that there are no plans for
Clinton to testify.
</P>
<P>
The question-and-answer debate produced plenty of theater, as
House prosecutors dismissed the White House arguments as "legal
schizophrenia" and presidential lawyers accused the lawmakers of
"straw-man" building. Neither side broke new ground.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the first president in the U.S. to be subjected to a
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868. A two-thirds Senate vote is needed to convict
Clinton and remove him from office. At the moment, no one believes
there are enough votes in the Senate to remove Clinton.

BONN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,500 farmers blocked a

imports of agricultural goods which they charge are destroying
their livelihood.

<HEADLINE> Popular Defense Minister Comes Under Limelight in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- He has been wooed by the
right, the left and the center of the country; U.S. President
Bill Clinton sent him a letter praising him for his role in the
Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking; and Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak invited him to visit Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, probably the most
popular minister in the country, has emerged as a powerful player
in the upcoming elections in May.
</P>
<P>
Results from a public opinion poll issued Friday showed that he
will have a better chance of defeating Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in the coming elections than Amnon Lipkin-Shahak,
another popular former general.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the defense minister might possibly run
for the post of prime minister as the head of a centrist party
co-founded by Shahak and Likud defector Dan Meridor.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Shahak and Meridor have offered Mordechai the
head post if polls indicate he will have the best chance of
success.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has yet to decide whether to quit the ruling Likud
bloc led by Netanyahu. But reports said he has decided to accept
the offer, which was made following several closed-door meetings.
</P>
<P>
His name did not appear on the final list of 87 candidates
competing for Likud seats in the next parliament.
</P>
<P>
Brought by his father to Israel from his birthplace in Iraq at
the age of five, the 55-year-old former major general began his
military career in 1962 and managed since then to rise through the
ranks of the army.
</P>
<P>
Having served consecutively as head of the army's Southern,
Central, and Northern Commands, he was the only general ever to
hold top posts in all the three commands of the country.
</P>
<P>
He retired from the army in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He chosed to join the Likud before the 1996 elections after
former Labor prime minister Shimon Peres declined to guarantee him
a cabinet seat if the Labor won the elections.
</P>
<P>
Serving as defense minister in the Likud government, Mordechai
has been more moderate than most of his right-wing colleagues.
</P>
<P>
He favored the 1993 Oslo peace accord signed by the former
Labor government with the Palestinians and has often conflicted
with Netanyahu over this issue.
</P>
<P>
Seen by many as a clone of late prime minister Yitzhak Rabin in
strategic thinking, he triggered a storm in the political circle
last year with remarks over the Golan Heights, the Syrian
territory seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
He drew wide criticism after he reportedly claimed that Israel
was willing to withdraw from the Golan if Syria agreed to provide
security guarantees, echoing a position held by Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel's parliament decided last month to go ahead with
early elections, the Labor and other parties have been making eyes
at Mordechai, who is seen as an election asset to any party. But
he has left them speculating by keeping a tight lip over his
decision.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu almost seemed to have succeed in persuading the
wavering minister to "stay home" in the Likud till news broke
Thursday about the generous offer made to him by Shahak and
Meridor.
</P>
<P>
With a reputation of being trustworthy, compassionate and
having utter devotion to the security of the state, Mordechai is
widely accepted and respected. This will be a rare unifying factor
in a country severely divided between the rich and poor, left and
right.
</P>
<P>
His leaving will undoubtedly deal a serious blow to the effort
of Netanyahu to seek re-election. The hard-line prime minister
trailed Shahak and Labor leader Ehud Barak in recent opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Mordechai's potential divorce with the Likud,
Barak said that this has proved again that "no one has confidence
in the ability of Netanyahu to govern the country."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador on Current Round of Talks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The fourth session of the
Four-Party Talks on the Korean Peninsula has been mixed with
progress and differences, said head of the Chinese delegation
Ambassador Qian Yongnian here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the fourth session here on Friday, he
said that it was a significant progress that the procedures of the
operation of the two subcommittees, respectively on the
establishment of a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula and
tension reduction there, had been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
"This has made necessary preparation for the discussion of
substantive issues in future rounds of the talks," he said. "We
are pleased with the agreement."
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned, there are still wide differences among
relevant parties on the issues such as how to establish a peace
regime on the peninsula and how to reduce the tension there.
</P>
<P>
Qian said the Chinese side believed that to search for feasible
ways, to narrow the differences, and to embark on solving the
existing problems would be an important part in the next step.
</P>
<P>
"China, as one of the parties in the Four-Party Talks, will
continue to play a constructive role in maintaining peace and
stability on the Korean Peninsula with full cooperation with other
parties in an active, practical and constructive approach," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The talks aiming to reach a lasting peace settlement on the
Korean Peninsula were launched in December 1997 in Geneva. The
four countries involved in the peace process include the People's
Republic of China, the Democratic Republic of Korea, Republic of
Korea, and the United States of America.

LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The lawyer for the five Britons
who are being detained in Yemen on charges of sabotage was
allowed to visit his clients on Saturday, a British government
official said.
</P>
<P>
"The lawyer saw the detainees this morning in a private
meeting. We have been told that there were no representatives of
the Yemen authorities present," the official said.
</P>
<P>
No details were given of the meeting between the lawyer and
the five detainees, who are of Pakistani and Yemeni origin living
in the English city of Birmingham and now jailed in Yemen prisons.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Britain and Yemen have soured since three
Britons and an Australian were killed last month when Yemeni
troops exchanged fire with an alleged Islamic anti-government
guerrilla group which was holding Western tourists as hostages.

Much of the British media coverage subsequently accused the
Yemenis of bungling the rescue operation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Draws 7.8 Million Tourists Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand last year attracted
7,790,639 foreign tourists and reaped 272 billion baht (7.55
billion U.S. dollars) in tourism revenue, Thai News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This was very successful performance. I am satisfied that
Thailand was one of the only two countries in Asia which saw a
rise in tourist arrivals last year," Pitak Intrawityanunt,
minister attached to the Prime Minister's Office, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourist arrivals in Thailand were 7.8 percent above
target, despite economic woes in other sectors, Pitak said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand floated the baht in July 1997. The weak baht, which
has fallen from 26 baht to the dollar in the pre-devaluation
period to about 36 baht to the greenback now, proved a major boom
to the tourist industry last year.
</P>
<P>
Pitak, who is in charge of tourism affairs, said Thailand
benefited in 1998 from the influx of tourists taking advantage of
the devaluated baht, from the Asian Games which Bangkok hosted
last December and from the "Amazing Thailand" promotion campaign.
</P>
<P>
Pitak predicted that Thailand would attract 8.28 million
tourists in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Arrives in Madagascar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
Vice-President Hu Jintao arrived in Antananarivo Saturday to start
his three-day official visit to the island country of Madagascar,
the first leg of his 13-day four- nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Vice-President came to this world's fourth biggest
island, his first trip to Africa, from China by special plane as
guest of the Madagascar government.
</P>
<P>
Hu is one of the top Chinese leaders to visit Africa in recent
years, following the African trips by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, former Premier Li Peng and Premier Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
In his written statement upon arrival, Hu said his current
African visit is to "make friends, increase understanding, deepen
friendship and expand cooperation".
</P>
<P>
This is also aimed to further consolidate and develop the
Sino-African traditional friendly relations of cooperation under
new circumstances, Hu said, adding his visit would serve as a good
beginning for his 13-day four- nation African tour.
</P>
<P>
He said that although China and Madagascar are far away from
each other, friendship between the two peoples can long be traced
back.
</P>
<P>
Since the two forged diplomatic ties in 1972, bilateral
friendly relations of cooperation have been proceeding in a steady
way and both sides support each other in international affairs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hu was greeted at the airport by Prime Minister Tantely
Andrianarivo and some other senior Madagascar officials. In his
company, Hu reviewed the guards of honor of the three services of
the army.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Hu on the current African visit are vice foreign
minister Ji Peiding and some other senior Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Hu is expected to meet Ange C.F. Andrianarisoa,
President of Madagascar National Assembly, and have working talks
with Andrianarivo on promoting the China-Madagascar relations and
on other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
After the visit here, Hu will proceed to Ghana on January 26 to
continue his African tour. The other two African nations that Hu
will soon visit are Cote d'Ivoire and South Africa.

KUWAIT CITY, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait denied Saturday
reports that Iraq has massed its troops along the Kuwaiti-Iraqi
borders, the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our reports indicate that there is no Iraqi massing of troops
on the Kuwaiti borders beyond the normal level," said Kuwaiti
First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad
Al-Sabah before departing to Cairo for the Arab foreign ministers
meeting on the Iraqi issue scheduled Sunday.

the southern no-fly zone imposed by the West.

The reports quoted a British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC)
correspondent as saying that he saw a constant stream of armor and
guns moving down the road towards the southern Iraqi city of Basra.
</P>
<P>
Sabah said "Kuwait supports any initiative that aims at ending
the sufferings of the Iraqi people, but within the context of
international resolutions."
</P>
<P>
On the Cairo meeting, Sabah said Kuwait hopes the meeting will
be the "beginning of welfare for the Iraqi people and for easing
their sufferings."
</P>
<P>
He denied the presentation of "any Kuwait work paper," noting
that only "ideas" will be raised during the meeting by Arab Gulf
states.

OTTAWA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Canada will restore full
diplomatic relations with Nigeria next week after a two-year
suspension, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>

Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy will

Ottawa closed the mission in Nigeria in March 1997 in a bitter
diplomatic row when the military regime said it could no longer
guarantee the protection of Canadian diplomats, who had helped
political dissidents flee the country.
</P>
<P>
Although Canada withdrew its high commissioner in 1997,
diplomatic relations between the two countries were not severed
completely. Nigeria kept its high commission open in Ottawa, the
capital of Canada.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Post Billions of Baht in Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's commercial banks
have announced billions of baht in net losses, signaling the
country's financial crisis still looming, Thai News Agency
reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers Bank and Siam Commercial Bank
recorded dramatic losses in 1998 as they struggled to meet tough
new government provisioning standards amid the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Bank, the country's flagship commercial
institution, posted an unaudited loss for 1998 of 49.5 billion
baht (1.37 billion U.S. dollar) against a 4.1 billion baht (113
million dollar) profit in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The bank said 48.8 billion baht (1.35 billion dollars) went
into reserves to cover an expected blow-out in non-performing
loans (NPL).
</P>
<P>
The Farmers Bank posted a net loss of 39.88 billion baht (1.1
billion dollars), also due to massive NPL provisioning of 38.58
billion baht (1.07 billion dollars). The loss compared to a profit
of 800.78 million baht (22.2 million dollars) in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The Siam Commercial Bank's result was 12.86 billion baht (357
million dollars) in the red, against a profit of 3.19 billion baht
(96.6 million dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Bank President Chartsiri Sophonpanitch said the
outcomes were in line with market forecasts given the economic
environment in 1998. He said there were some encouraging signs for
1999.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the results mirror the performance of the Thai
banking sector and the Thai economy as a whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The drop in lending (interest) rates late in 1998 will
encourage new lending and make it easier for existing borrowers to
service their loans. As a result, we would anticipate growth in
non-performing loans slowing over time," he said.

<HEADLINE> Transport on Halt in S. Somalia as Inter-Clan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The public and commercial
transport to the regions of Bay, Bakol and Gedo in southern
Somalia was on halt Saturday with the drivers expressing concern
over the security of the road leading to Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
The people in southern Somalia are especially suffering from
inter-clan feuds which are further contributing to the
displacement of thousands of people from the regions of Bay, Bakol
and Lower Jubba.
</P>
<P>
The civil strive in southern Somalia seems to be involving new
clans which have never been engaged in the civil strive in the
past eight years.
</P>
<P>
After 17 days of lull in the fighting for control of the
southern port town of Kismaio between the Majerten and Marehan
clansmen, new animosity has sprung up between new clans from the
main Hawiye tribe in the neighboring town of Jamama in Lower
Jubba, just about 60 kilometers northeast of Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports reaching here in Mogadishu from Jamama indicate
that fighting between the Shikahal and Biyomal clans is also
intensifying with the number of militiamen and weaponry involved
from both sides increasing.
</P>
<P>
Radio VHF reports said at least seven people were killed and
more than eight others were wounded when the two sides exchanged
gun fire in the town and its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting is not known yet. However, people
in Jamama town said that it began after members from the Shikhal
clan killed a man and his wife for what was described as internal
dispute.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Summarizes, Looks Ahead on Cultural Perspectives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Culture
Sun Jiazheng stressed today at an annual meeting of officials
from the country's cultural sector that spreading culture
nationwide should be under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's Theory
and the Party line.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Sun said, China enjoyed a booming cultural
diversity in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The stunning concert commemorating the 20th anniversary of
China's reform and opening up and the gala charity show which
collected 630 million yuan for flood victims have had an enormous
impact socially as well as within the cultural field.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Peking Opera Festival and the national dancing
and acrobatics competitions also represented the major successes
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The preservation of cultural relics, the nurturing of
community culture in the countryside and culture-related legal
regulations were also top of last year's agenda.
</P>
<P>
Sun also pointed out that there were a few problems to tackle,
including the relatively backward quality of cultural works, the
disparity between the availability of cultural activities and
increasing public demand along with the significant lack of
cultural events in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
As for cultural activities in 1999, Sun said that they should
focus on such momentous occasions as the 50th anniversary of the
founding of New China, the return of Macao and the welcoming in
of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to increase foreign cooperation in
the cultural sector.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Striking Miners to Resume Work on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Jiu Valley miners will
soon return home and resume work on Monday (January 25),
following successful negotiations with a delegation of the
Romanian Government led by Prime Minister Radu Vasile himself,
Rompres news agency Saturday cited the miners' leader Miron Cozma
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cozma promised that the miners will work overtime to recoup
losses recorded during their two-week strike and carry out the
provisions in their delivery contract with national CONEL power pu
blic utility.
</P>
<P>
Miron Cozma said he had reached an agreement with Prime
Minister Vasile for the Dalja and Barbateni mines not to be
closed and 200 million U.S. dollars of EU funds be allotted for
the miners.
</P>
<P>
"The miners have proved by their action that they only wanted
their union claims to be settle through dialogue," Cozma stressed.
</P>
<P>
He contended that the miners' strike was legal. It was a
development of the unresolved labor conflict that broke out in
August 1998, and the law allows the miners to take a general
strike as a last resort, he argued.
</P>
<P>
The miners' strike broke out in January 4 in the Jiu Valley
area, Romania's largest coal field. On Monday, about 10,000
miners began a protest march to the capital. The miners had some
bloody clash with the police forces who tried to stop their
advance, causing sustain injuries and material losses.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Probes into Shoddy Expressway Bridges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A top level investigation
has been launched into the reasons why the surfaces of fourteen
relatively new bridges out of a total 17 along the Foshan-Kaiping
expressway were breaking up only three months after the route o
pened to traffic in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Guangdong Province's road and transport
administration have begun their inquiries into what has been
attacked as poor engineering work on the World Bank financed
expressway project connecting the two major cities.
</P>
<P>
The 80-kilometer expressway was listed as a state major
construction project and cost 3.29 billion yuan (about 400
million U.S. dollars), partly provided by the World Bank. It was
also the first high-grade road built with funding from non-go
vernment sectors.
</P>
<P>
So far, the province has been forced to spend 37 million yuan
mending the cracks and rebuilding surfaces of the bridges.
</P>
<P>
According to Wen Faming, chief engineer with Guangdong's
communication department, the building firm commissioned to carry
out the work did not use the correct materials to pave the
bridges as required, believing other cheaper materials it had
arbitrarily chosen would speed up the construction while reducing
the cost.
</P>
<P>
The length of building time for many major constructions in
China is always rushed to celebrate certain occasions, at the
cost of building quality, Wen pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The quality of both the expressway and the bridges is
basically up to standard, he added.
</P>
<P>
The province's road administrations is now re-examining the
whole construction process including the allocation of contracts,
and officials said they would take legal action against any dirty
deals or corruption that might be unearthed by the
probe.

ISLAMABAD, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban militia have
asked neighboring countries to resume power supply to Afghanistan,
which has been disconnected since August, 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Afghan sources in Pakistan's northwestern city of
Peshawar on Saturday, the militia contacted Uzbekistan,
Turkmenistan and Iran last week, asking for resumption or an
increase in the electricity flow to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have either reduced or completely

Afghanistan side since August 8, last year when the Taliban took
control of Mazar-e-Sharif, stronghold of Uzbek warlord Rashid
Dostum, said the sources.

Six dams in Afghanistan are not producing enough electricity to
meet the needs of the war-ravaged country, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Decides to Stop Use of Lead-Content Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
decided
to stop the use of petroleum mixed with lead, the mental
identified as
the main culprit for Dhaka's increasingly polluted air, a senior
official
of the Energy Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken a clear decision that this business of lead
pollution
must be stopped as immediate as possible," he was quoted by the
official
BSS news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is an emergency, and the Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation
has
been asked to take all necessary steps in this regard without any
delay,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The decision came after experts were alarmed over increased
complaints
of airborne health hazards, particularly among children with a
child
hospital reporting "toxic gas" victims among its patients in
recent days,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka Children Hospital recently said blood samples of
children,
reporting to them with complaints like nervous disorders and
epilepsy,
showed presence of lead at least eight times the limit determined
by the
World Health Organization.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Electoral Body Overrules Common Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Independent National
Electoral Commission (INEC) of Nigeria has overruled a decision of
two political parties to present a common candidate for the
presidential election, describing it as illegal and unethical.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and All People's
Party (APP), INEC Secretary Alhaji Bawa Mua'zu said that they
could not present a candidate under a common logo because
different identities were approved for them after their
registration.
</P>
<P>
Mua'zu pointed out that there was no way they could use a joint
logo for either the presidential or national assembly polls to be
held on February 27 and 20 respectively, Daily Times newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The alliance negotiating committee of AD and APP, two of three
major political parties in the west African country, sent a letter
to the INEC earlier this week, informing the commission that the
two parties would present common logo for the forthcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
AD National Secretary Udenta Udenta said Thursday that the
alliance of the two parties would present a joint candidate for
the February 27 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the alliance would unfold its strategies for
the presidential election and announce its presidential candidate
and the running mate next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to a proposed arrangement of the alliance, the AD
will produce the alliance's presidential candidate from the south
while the APP will produce the running mate from the north.
</P>
<P>
However, APP's five presidential aspirants from the southern
part of the country said Friday that the party would not allow the
AD to present the candidate under the proposed alliance.
</P>
<P>
INEC Chairman Ephraim Akpata has said earlier this week that a
presidential candidate can only run the platform of one party.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Four unidentified assailants
shot dead three drug smugglers Friday afternoon in Zahedan in
Iran's southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan, an Iranian
security official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Commander of provincial security forces Brigadier General Naser
Shabani told the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) that the
three were killed for financial disputes with their creditors.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the killed had been taken captive by the
creditors for 22 days.
</P>
<P>
A relative of one of the slain smugglers said they owed
1,700 million rials (about 280,000 U.S. dollars) to their
creditors, the official added.
</P>
<P>
A witness said the four gunmen in a car stopped the vehicle of
the smugglers at noon on Friday, spraying bullets on them with
Kalashnikov rifles and then fled the scene immediately.
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, two smugglers were killed in Zahedan because
they owed 450 million rials (about 75,000 dollars) to the
creditors.
</P>
<P>
Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Pakistan and
Afghanistan, is one of the main transits for drug smugglers to
transfer narcotics from Afghanistan to Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. president Jimmy
Carter ended his three-day visit to Nigeria Friday, a trip aimed
at assessing Nigeria's transition to civil rule program, local
media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the media in Lagos at the end of his visit, Carter
denied the allegation that he is supporting General Olusegun
Obasanjo, former Nigerian military leader and a presidential
aspirant of the People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president acknowledged that he has a friendship
with Obasanjo since 1978, when he visited Nigeria while the later
was in power, but added that it does not mean he is supporting the
general to the detriment of other aspirants in the election.
</P>
<P>
"The matter of who will be the next Nigerian president and
National Assembly members is absolutely a choice to be made by
Nigerians alone and I and other observers are only interested in
the success of the transition program," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Carter met with leaders of the political
parties, officials of the Independent National Electoral
Commission (INEC) and all the presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
He also met with Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam
Abubakar. Carter said that during their meeting, the general
gave him a personal commitment to the success of the transition
program.
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president said from what he has seen so far on
ground, he is convinced of the general's sincerity.
</P>
<P>
He commended the INEC for doing a good job and said that he is
happy that the recommendations made by his international observers
to the INEC after earlier elections will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
According to Carter, the INEC has agreed to increase the number
of independent observers to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S.-based National Democratic Institute
for International Affairs is now training about 600 Nigerian
observers, who will in turn train 10,000.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Build Downtown Museum for Ancient Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Authorities in China's capital
have announced that they are to build an underground museum in a
downtown commercial area to house ancient relics dating back to
some 20,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The relics, including stoneware and fragments of animal
fossils which scientists say are from the early Stone Age, were
unearthed more than two years ago at the construction site of the
Oriental Plaza in Wangfujing, a well known commercial street in
downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Discovered some 12 meters underground, the relics are the
oldest evidence of ancient man's activities ever found in the
core area of Beijing, as well as in a capital city anywhere in
the world. Archaeologists believe that they could indicate when
man moved out of caves and started to live on the plains.
</P>
<P>
However, after months of excavation, all the relics and
fossils unearthed were boxed and moved to a suburban museum to
give way to the construction of the Oriental Plaza, a real estate
project involving an overseas investment of 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars. This triggered a heated debate on how to balance
economic development with protecting these precious relics.
</P>
<P>
As the construction work on the Plaza is expected to be
largely completed before October 1 this year, when the People's
Republic will celebrate its 50th founding anniversary, the
Beijing government pledged today that it would build an
underground museum near the former excavation site and move all
the relics back.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the museum, which will be 16.5 meters
underground with a floor space of over 400 square meters, is
scheduled to start early next month, said a local official,
adding that the site of the museum will be some 160 meters to the
southwest of the original excavation site.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Former leader of the
United Democratic Movement (UDM) in South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal
midlands, Sifiso Nkabinde, was shot and killed in a shooting
incident Saturday morning, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nkabinde was critically injured when an unknown number of
gunmen opened fire on him outside a supermarket in Richmond,
KwaZulu-Natal, police said.
</P>
<P>
He was confirmed dead at 8:40 a.m. (06:40 gmt) at a
Pietermaritzburg clinic, some 40 kilometers away from Richmond.

<HEADLINE> OAU Panel on Rwanda Genocide to Be Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 23 (xinhua) -- The International Panel of
Eminent Personalities (IPEP) set up by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) to investigate the 1994 genocide in Rwanda will begin
its inaugural session in Addis Ababa Monday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here Saturday by the IPEP said that the
Inauguration will be under the patronage of OAU Secretary-General
Salim Ahmed Salim, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and
Chairman of the Panel Sir Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
The six-member IPEP, set up by the OAU in June 1998 in
Burkinabe capital Ouagadougou, established its secretariat in
Addis Ababa when it held a three-day meeting from October 26-28,
1998.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the January 25-30 opening session will be the
launching of an appeal for "cooperation and support" from OAU
member states and the international community in the search for
truth about the Rwanda genocide and the surrounding events.
</P>
<P>
"A working visit of the Panel to Rwanda will also follow this
meeting, because of the high expectation of Africa and the world
at large on the Panel's final report, and the need to maintain
transparency," the press release said.

<HEADLINE> Airport Inquiry Report Positively Received </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The report released by the
Commission of Inquiry on Friday concerning the chaos at the Chek
Lap Kok New Airport when it opened on July 6, 1998, was
positively received by various quarters and the media here in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals (HACTL)
Anthony Charter said that the company was fully committed to
re-building its reputation in the industry and with its
customers.
</P>
<P>
HACTL was cited by the inquiry report as one of those being
overconfident and not paying sufficient attention to the risks
involved in the construction in both the passenger terminal
building and Super Terminal 1.
</P>
<P>
"The start-up problems surrounding Super Terminal 1 have had a
major and sobering impact on all management, and we will continue
to channel all our efforts into rebuilding relationships with
customers and bringing efficiency levels up to and beyond those
achieved at Kai Tak," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Lessons have been learnt by all involved and this will help
all parties greatly in their future operations," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that over the last six months, HACTL has worked
hard to ensure the efficient operation of the Terminal and recent
performance statistics indicate HACTL has made tremendous
progress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
A peak daily tonnage record of 5,376 tons was handled on
November 22, and reliability standards at Super Terminal 1 are
also now extremely high, with just six consignments mishandled
out of 181,778 shipments during December, showing that only one
consignment was mismanaged for every 30,926 shipments handled.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary entitled "Draw Lessons, and Improve Management
Level", Wen Wei Po (Daily) said today that it would be more
significant and positive if the inquiry report was regarded as a
teaching material for drawing lessons and improving management
level.
</P>
<P>
If lessons can be drawn from the new airport incident,
accidents can be avoided for all other construction projects in
the future, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In another commentary, Ta Kung Pao (Daily) said that the
inquiry report was objective, impartial and responsible.
</P>
<P>
Problems are over and the new airport has received the highest
appraisal worldwide, which is enough to fill the people in Hong
Kong with pride and joy. What is more important now is to further
enhance the coordination level among various aspects, further
improve the equipment and service levels of the airport so that
it will make a greater contribution to the development of the
economy in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Iran Turns Down U.S. Appeal on Ties Resumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Saturday turned down an appeal by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on resumption of
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that due to lack of practical changes in the
U.S. behavior toward Iran, no new development has taken place in
Tehran-Washington relations, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Albright Thursday reiterated that Washington is ready to
resume ties with Iran under certain conditions, said IRNA. But it
did not give details of Albright's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Asefi said that despite some positive remarks made by U.S.
officials every now and then, there are still contradictions
between their words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
Since the interview of Iranian President Mohammad Khatami with
the CNN in January, 1998, top U.S. officials have voiced
Washington's readiness to open a new chapter for Washington-Tehran
ties.
</P>
<P>
In his ground-breaking interview, Khatami called for exchanges
between peoples of the two nations to pave the way for a
rapprochement. But Iranian leaders later set the conditions that
the U.S. must change its policy toward Iran.

LONDON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Two masked thieves robbed more
than 500,000 pounds (830,000 U.S. dollars) worth of paintings in
an armed raid Friday on a York art gallery, BBC reported on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The robbers carrying a sawed-off shotgun and an automatic
pistol threatened staff at York City Art Gallery in central
England as they were closing in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The pair took at least 16 works of art, among them were two
14th Century gold panels of St. Peter and St. Paul by Martino De
Bartolomeo.
</P>
<P>
"Both men were carrying black sports type bags and spoke with
local accents. The stolen property, which was of great artistic
value, may be taken out of the country," BBC quoted a police
spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police said one of the raiders was in his 30s, wearing a black
leather jacket, and the other was in his mid 40s, wearing dark

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Ease in Singapore Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer price eased
marginally in Singapore last year on a year-on-year basis, falling
by 0.3 percent over 1997 and slipping into its first annual
decline since 1986, the country's Department of Statistics
announced Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The department said the consumer price gyrated from positive to
negative territory in 1998 after a two-percent rise in 1997 and
this was the first annual decline since 1986 when the price index
registered a fall of 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The decline in 1998 was contributed mainly by lower costs of
transport and communication, and to a smaller extent, cheaper
clothing and miscellaneous items, the department said .
</P>
<P>
These declines, partially offset by higher costs of housing,
education and health care, reflected easing capacity utilization
and growing competitive retail pressures in the city-state.
</P>
<P>
According to data released by the department, costs of
transport and communication registered the largest decline of 5.6
percent in Singapore in 1998 while prices of clothing and
miscellaneous items dropped by 1.5 percent and 0.7 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, costs for health care and education rose by
4.5 and 3.6 percent respectively while housing costs and food
prices edged up 2.0 and 0.2 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Reports Denied on Change of Jordanian King's Heir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's informed sources termed
as "groundless" reports by some international news agencies that
King Hussein is removing his brother Hassan as heir to the throne,
the semi-official Jordan Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed sources did not disclose details about a meeting
Friday between Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan, but they denied
the reports that the monarch had later sent Royal envoys to inform
Hassan he was being removed as successor to the throne to pave the
way for one of the king's sons.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with CNN last Wednesday, one day after his
return home from a six-month cancer treatment in the U.S., Hussein
said his decision in 1965 to name Hassan as the crown prince
was prompted by the fact "there was no substitute but to find a
member of the family close by to take over."
</P>
<P>
"But that did not mean at all that is the end of the story (of
succession)." he said.
</P>
<P>
Hussein`s remarks sparked widespread speculations in Amman that
the king intends to revert to the original constitutional
provision prior to 1965, according to which his eldest son
Abdullah Ibn Talal should inherit the throne.
</P>
<P>
Prince Abdullah, who turns 37 on January 30, is Hussein`s son
from his second marriage to British Tony Bardiner, who adopted
the name of Mona when she converted to Islam upon her marriage to
the king in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah is an army major general and in charge of a special
force that is responsible for the security of the Royal Court.
</P>
<P>
Hussein is expected to make a public speech concerning the
succession to the throne soon.

<HEADLINE> Confidence Returns to Malaysia's Stock Market: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Second Finance
Minister Mustapa Mohamed said Saturday investors are firmly
convinced of the country's rapid economic recovery prospects and
so now back in the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) market.
</P>
<P>
He said this was evident in the upward swing of the KLSE
Composite Index to 618.54 points Friday compared to 262 on
September 1 last year when Malaysia imposed "selected" capital
controls.
</P>
<P>
The minister said market capitalization on the KLSE also rose
from 180 billion ringgit (47.368 billion U.S. dollars) on
September 1 to 400 billion ringgit (105.263 billion U.S. dollars)
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The renewed confidence was in the wake of the government's
efforts to revive the economy such as through the implementation
of selected capital controls, Mustapa told reporters after
attending a function in Pengkalan Kubor, the northern state of
Kelantan, according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Mustapa said the government encouraged foreign investors to
make long-term investments in the various sectors of the Malaysian
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was not interested in short-term
investments such as entering and leaving the stock market over
short intervals as this created problems to the economy.

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Further Aid for Flood Victims in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) has
approved a further package of humanitarian aid worth 305 million
taka (6.3 million U.S. dollars) for victims of last year's floods
in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
This aid, managed by the European Community Humanitarian Office
(ECHO), will enable humanitarian organizations to continue to
provide relief to the victims of the floods, said an official
press release available here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It undertakes to link relief with rehabilitation and
development, seeking to reduce dependency on emergency aid.
</P>
<P>
The ECHO's partners for this program are several
non-governmental organizations, and their principal activities
undertaken will include projects such as crop recovery, occupation
rehabilitation, housing, the supply of clean water and sanitation.
</P>
<P>
As an immediate response to the crisis, the ECHO approved a
package worth 56 million taka (1.15 million dollars) in September
and a further 110 million taka (2.27 million dollars) in October
last year, and these grants focused on food, medical support,
purification of water supplies, sanitation services and shelter.
</P>
<P>
The new aid package takes the total of ECHO's humanitarian aid
for Bangladesh since last year's floods to 470 million taka (9.7
million dollars), and this is in addition to an increase of 1.73
billion taka (35.7 million dollars) in food aid, bringing the
total contribution of the EC for relief and rehabilitation since
the floods to 2.2 billion taka (45.4 million dollars), the release
added.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Sends Giant Ozone Testing Balloon Aloft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A gigantic balloon carrying
the mission to collect data on the ozone layer was released at
noon today in Huizhou City of south China's booming province of
Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Made of polythene plastic film, the balloon can contain 30,000
cubic meters of helium and has the same height as a 40-storey
building when fully charged. It was said to be the world's
largest balloon for scientific use.
</P>
<P>
The balloon, which can reach a height of 30,000 meters, was
designed and produced in China, and today's activity was part of
a series of scientific studies launched since December last year
at the joint sponsorship of the State Environmental Protection
Administration, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of
Science and Technology, and other organizations.
</P>
<P>
Latest report said that the balloon had safely landed after a
two-hour flight in the air, and scientists from Beijing would
make careful analysis of all data it collected.
</P>
<P>
A Beijing source said that another ozone testing balloon will
go aloft during the traditional Chinese Spring Festival, which
falls in mid February.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Build Organic Fertilizer Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- An organic fertilizer
factory will be built adjacent to the Addis Ababa sewerage
treatment plant in Kaliti District of the capital city, The
Ethiopian Herald newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A memorandum of understanding was signed here between the Addis
Ababa Water and Sewerage Authority and the Modern Ecological
Industries, an Ethiopian-based U.S. company.
</P>
<P>
The treatment facility, which was built approximately 15 years
ago at a cost of 20 million U.S. Dollars, is said to be using the
conventional methods to treat waste water, much of which
eventually ends up in the Akaki River, polluting the environment.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the upgrading of the facility
through the installation of more modern technology will reduce the
contamination of effluent to a minimum standard established by the
World Bank with no further additives in treating it.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Modern Ecological Industries will build and
operate an organic fertilizer factory which utilizes the processed
waste as a primary input to produce 200 to 600 tons of fertilizer
daily, meeting over 30 percent of the country's need.
</P>
<P>
The new factory is estimated to cost about 11 million U.S.
Dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scientists Urged to Help Science Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANAHEIM, California, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S.
scientist Saturday urged her colleagues to become directly
involved in efforts to improve science education at schools.
</P>
<P>
"We can already see indications that the next generation is
not receiving the preparation necessary to maintain the
excellence that U.S. science currently enjoys," M.R.C. Greenwood,
president of the American Association for the Advancement of
Science (AAAS), said at the on-going annual meeting of the AAAS.
</P>
<P>
She pointed to the results of recent surveys that show, for
example, 12th graders in the United States near the bottom in
international comparisons of science and math ability.
</P>
<P>
Greenwood urged scientists, engineers and other scientifically
literate professionals to get involved in kindergarten through
12th grade education by serving on school boards.
</P>
<P>
She proposed an AAAS program called "Project 20/20" to sustain
and support these school board members with information and
advice to help them protect and enhance scientific content and
accuracy in schools.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. education system is faltering in colleges and
graduate schools, too, said Greenwood, who is also the chancellor
of the University of California at Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
She suggested improvements in undergraduate education to
ensure that all students leave college with some expertise in the
sciences for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
She also called for changes in graduate education to give
young scientists the training they need to pursue a broad array
of career opportunities in addition to traditional academic
careers.
</P>
<P>
"The real challenge is to prepare graduate students for a
changing job market," Greenwood said, disputing the notion that
universities are overproducing Ph.D. scientists.
</P>
<P>
Not only future scientists, but all citizens need to have a
solid understanding of science, she emphasized, hoping U.S.
scientific community to offer help in this field.

LHASA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are some facts and
figures indicating the rapid economic development for the Tibet
Autonomous Region over the past four decades since the Democratic
Reform was carried out there in 1959:
</P>
<P>
Since 1987 Tibet has reaped good harvests for 11 years in
succession. The total grain output was 840,000 tons in 1998, the
highest output in history and an increase of 44.8 percent
compared to the 580,000 tons in 1991. The output of meat was
121,500 tons in 1998, an increase of 26.5 percent compared to
1991.
</P>
<P>
Now there are scheduled flights to other cities in China from
airports in Tibet every day and some weekly international
flights. A comprehensive network of communications and
transportation consisting of air routes and highways has been
basically completed in Tibet. The volume of goods transported via
highways in the Region increased by 14.6 times in 1997 compared
to 1965 and the number of highway passengers increased by 27.9
times in the same period. The average number of passengers
transported by airplanes is 160,700 each year. So transportation
conditions have been greatly improved, in striking contrast to
the old days when the region was very hard to reach and goods had
to be carried in on the backs of animals or people.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Offers Students Textbooks, Desks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Some 7.8 million textbooks and
400,000 desks will be distributed to public school students in the
Philippines for the June opening of school year, government
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The textbook project would let the government narrow gap of
book to pupil from the present ratio of one book for every six
students to one book for four pupils in the next school year, they
said.
</P>
<P>
Congress of the Philippines has given the government an
allotment of 504.5 million pesos (12.6 million U.S. dollars) for
textbook procurement under the 1999 budget.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the ratio of one book for every student, the
government needs some 7 billion pesos (175 million U.S. dollars),
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said the government has another 295 million pesos (7.4
million U.S. dollars) under the 1999 budget for this year's
purchase of desks.
</P>
<P>
With the shortage of desks, they said, the students are forced
to bring their own improvised armchairs or share desks with their
classmates.

No levies have been imposed on the peasants and herdsmen in
Tibet since 1980 and there is no compulsory state purchase of
grain there. The income that Tibetan peasants and herdsmen earn
is entirely their own. In recent years the central government has
allocated upwards of 1.2 billion yuan each year to Tibet as a
financial subsidy, and other favorable measures have been
adopted, such as lightening its financial burdens, preferential
investment, investment in skill training and an aid-the-poor
program.
</P>
<P>
From the early 1950s to 1997 the Central Government allocated
more than 40 billion yuan for Tibet, and from 1959 to 1996
allotted 6.74 million tons of materials. Among the latter were
1.1 million tons of commercial materials, 1.3 million tons of
grain and 1.48 million tons of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
In 1984 some 43 projects were built for Tibet by nine
provinces and municipalities mobilized and directed by the
Central Government, and in 1994 the Central Government decided to
build gratis another 62 projects for Tibet within three or four
years, also with the cooperation of other provinces and
municipalities of the country, involving agriculture and water
conservancy, energy, communications and telecommunications,
industry, and social welfare and municipal engineering.
</P>
<P>
Now almost all the projects have been completed and put into
use. The actual total investment was 3.66 billion yuan, much more
than the planned investment of 2.38 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The comprehensive project for the development of the middle
valleys of the Yarlungzangbo, Lhasa and Nyangqu rivers, in which
the Central Government invested a fund to the tune of one billion
yuan, was put into practice in 1991, and since then both the
grain yield and the net per-capita income of the peasants and
herdsmen in the development area have increased by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
The Yamzhoyum Lake pumped-storage power station, a project
with state investments running to 2.014 billion yuan, was
completed and put into operation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In recent years another 151 projects have been built or are
being built in Tibet by 14 other provinces and municipalities,
with a total investment of 490 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Thai Major Banks Cut Lending Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Bangkok and Thai
Farmers Bank, two of the country's largest banks, have decided to
cut their prime lending rates by another half percentage point to
between 10.5 and 11 percent, bank sources said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move was intended to help quicken economic recovery in
response to the Finance Ministry's policy to stimulate the economy
this year.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Hubert Neiss, director of the
Asia-Pacific Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
said in Bangkok earlier in the week that interest rates could come
down further if signs of economic recovery were not clear.
</P>
<P>
The sources said on condition of anonymity that Neiss and his
delegation discussed with Thai government officials the conditions
Thailand should meet before the seventh letter of intent was
issued.
</P>
<P>
Thailand and the IMF have issued six letters of intent, under
which the IMF released its promised aid in batches to the
crisis-stricken country. The IMF promised Thailand a rescue
package totaling 17.2 billion U.S. dollars after the country
plunged into a financial crisis in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the IMF asked Thailand to present a
report on the progress of financial reforms and speed up the
privatization process, but the IMF would not impose tight
macro-economic measures on Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The announcement to cut lending rates did not take analysts by
surprise. Thai banks, still reeling under the crisis and
undercapitalized, have been reluctant to lend. However, lower
deposit and lending rates could divert funds for consumption and
direct investment and spur the capital market.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Bangkok would reduce the minimum lending rate (MLR)
from 11.50 to 11 percent, the minimum overdraft rate (MOR) down
from 12.25 to 11.75 percent and the minimum retail rate (MRR) from
12.25 to 11.75 percent. The rates become effective from Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bank's fixed rates for three-, six- and 12-month deposits
will be cut from 6 to 5.75 percent, also effective on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Farmers Bank would reduce the MLR from 11 to
10.50 percent, the MOR from 11.50 to 11.0 percent and MRR from
11.50 to 11 percent. The cuts will be effective on February 1.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Aid to California Citrus Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of
Agriculture has declared 18 California counties that suffered
crop-killing freeze damage last month as federal disaster areas,
Vice President Al Gore said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I want to let California farmers know that the federal
government will not let the hardships beyond their control put
them out of business," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Four days of bitter-cold temperatures in late December caused
an estimated 656 million U.S. dollars in damage. The lemon crop wa
s wiped out and oranges were almost totally lost. Packing houses
shut down and thousands of workers are out of jobs.
</P>
<P>
The designation will clear the way for loans and other
programs for farmers and related businesses in the nation's
leading agricultural state.
</P>
<P>
California Governor Gray Davis said he has also asked Gore to
help secure a presidential declaration, which would open the door
to unemployment insurance for farm workers.
</P>
<P>
The Agriculture Department's declaration will provide
emergency low-interest loans from the department of up to half a
million dollars and aid to farmers who are not covered by federal
disaster insurance.
</P>
<P>
It also includes funds for a program that pays for vines or
trees destroyed by a natural disaster.

Since then, South Africa, Niger, the Central African Republic
and Guinea-Bissau established or restored diplomatic relations wit
h China. In addition, Madagascar abolished the "Special
Arrangement" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The development of political relations between China and
African nations provides new opportunities for bilateral
cooperation in the realm of economy, trade, technology, equipment
and natural resources exploitation.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs, trade volume between China and
Africa reached approximately 5 billion U.S. dollars in the first
11 months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
China has offered unconditional economic assistance for Afr
ican nations, and made efforts to expand areas of cooperation of
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
China has provided various kinds of assistance for 53 African
nations and established more than 600 set projects up to last
April. Moreover, China signed assistance agreements with 41
African countries in 1997 alone.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that both China and African nations are
determined to promote Sino-African partnership, and that such a
partnership will play a positive role in forming a new
international order.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Entrepreneurs Urged to Reclaim Wasteland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar leader Senior Gen. Than
Shwe has urged entrepreneurs to reclaim wetlands, vacant, virgin
and fallow land in efforts to feed the country's relatively fast
growing population.
</P>
<P>
Senior Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, made the call Friday during an inspection
tour of Yangon Division.
</P>
<P>
As Myanmar lacks technology and capital, it is difficult for
farmers to cultivate and produce on commercial scale, he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he urged entrepreneurs, who have capital, management
skills, techniques and know-how, to fulfill the tasks with the
emergence of modern private farms.
</P>
<P>
A total of 171,307 hectares of reclaimed vacant, fallow and
virgin land as well as wetlands in three divisions have been
granted by the government to local private entrepreneurs for
extended cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The entrepreneurs will be allowed to export half of the rice
produced to earn hard currency for importing farm machinery, he
said.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 8.9 million hectares of such unreclaimed
land in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the 1997-98 fiscal year,
there were 1.1 million hectares of fallow land and 7.89 million
hectares of cultivable wasteland in the country.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production has been dropping steadily in the
past few years, falling from 19 million tons in 1995-96 to 17.66
million tons in 1996-97 and again to 17.3 million tons in 1997-98.
In the meantime, rice exports dropped from 354,000 tons to 93,100
tons and then to 28,300 tons.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the country's population is estimated to
have reached 46.4 million in 1997-98, growing by 1.84 percent
annually.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture accounts for 36 percent of the GDP and 35
percent of export value.

</P>
<P>
The sixth-seeded Seles had some trouble in the second set but
still managed a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 victory over Belgian Sabine
Appelmans.
</P>
<P>
Seles has yet to lose a match at Melbourne Park in five starts

France's Sandrine Testud beat Williams thanks to an overruled
serve with a narrow victory 6-2, 2-6, 9-7.
</P>

After a poor first set, the 17-year-old Williams powered back
into the match and looked almost to claim victory late in the
third set when she hit a forehand winner down the line on match
point on Testud's serve.
</P>
<P>
But her victory celebration vanished when the chair umpire
overruled the linesman calls and said the ball was out, and
helped Testud to claim the victory.
</P>

The 14th seed Testud will meet sixth-seeded former champion
Monica Seles in the fourth round.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Offers Bribes to Win Right to Host 2000 Olympics, Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian Olympic Committee
(AOC) has admitted Sydney won the right to host the Olympic Games
after offering 50,000 Australian dollars (30,000 U.S. dollars)
inducements to two African International Olympic Committee mem
bers, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The inducements were offered just hours before they voted to
decide which city would host the games, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper said AOC President John Coates revealed on Friday
night that he offered the money to the National Olympic
Committees (NOCs) of Kenya and Uganda through their respective
IOC members Charles Mukora and Major-General Francis Nyangwego.
</P>
<P>
The offer was made at a dinner in Monte Carlo on September 22,
the night before the IOC vote to pick the 2000 host.
</P>
<P>
Coates quashed suggestions on Saturday that he would resign
over the payments made to the African IOC members.
</P>
<P>
The AOC released documents on Friday night detailing payments
of over 2 million Australian dollars (1.2 million U.S. dollars),
the majority of which went to host athletes from 11 African
countries at the Australian Institute of Sport.
</P>
<P>
Coates said he had offered the money in the hope that it would
help persuade the two IOC members to vote for Sydney.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was necessary for us to show our commitment to
those NOC's with a view to winning those votes... my view was it
might encourage them to consider their votes for Sydney," the
president was quoted as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that the money was a bribe and said it would go
towards helping sports in Kenya and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Details of the offers by Coates to the two countries are
contained in a package of previously confidential documents
surrounding the Sydney Games, which were released on Friday by
Coates.
</P>
<P>
The documents include copies of 14 separate contracts between
the AOC and the Olympic committees in 11 African countries and
the Olympic committees of Thailand, Argentina and Colombia, as
well as copies of the two letters to the African IOC members
setting out the offers.
</P>
<P>
Both letters are dated September 23, 1993, the day of the IOC
vote which picked Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The letter to Major-General Nyangweso says that "if Sydney is
successful" the AOC will pay 5,000 U.S. dollars a year to
Uganda's NOC up to and including 2000 to help support the Uganda
National Games, the Sydney paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The letter to Mukora refers to the Uganda offer and says that
if Sydney's bid to host the games was successful, the AOC would
pay the same amount for any similar project.
</P>
<P>
"If you have a similar project, then we would be happy to
provide similar assistance."
</P>
<P>
The paper said Coates is known to believe that the last-minute
offers of financial assistance was successful in securing one of
those two votes.
</P>
<P>
He made the offer to the two IOC members after inviting them
to join him at his table at the big ceremonial dinner the night
before the vote.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Coates said he had no regrets about making
the offers and would have had regrets only if Sydney had lost.

COLOMBO, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's North Western
Province has been the political hub of the country during the past
month, with a crucial provincial poll due on next Monday, January
25.
</P>
<P>
Since nominations were called for elections to the North
Western Provincial Council (NWPC) last December, election
campaigns have been bitterly and violently launched, because the
results are expected to signal winners of future polls in other
five provinces.
</P>
<P>
For the People's Alliance (PA) government all other matters,
including negotiations with Tamil rebels and even the recently
Free Trade Agreement with India, have receded into the background
with the intensifying of the election campaign which ended at
midnight Friday.
</P>
<P>
For the main opposition United National Party (UNP) it is
essential to hold the NWPC which it won in 1994 and additionally
establish the unpopularity of the government which is now in its
fifth year in office.
</P>
<P>
The North Western Province is one of Sri Lanka's nine
provinces, comprising the two administrative districts of
Kurunegala and Puttalam. It has a population of 2.2 million out of
the country's 18.5 million people.
</P>
<P>
The province is rich in agricultural produce, mainly rice and
coconut and more recently it has also turned to industry with 113
industrial locations up from 39 in 1970. The rural population
comprises the bulk of both the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts.
</P>
<P>
The province comprises 26 District Secretariats which
administer the area. It is represented in Parliament by 22
Members, 15 from the Kurunegala District and seven from the
Puttalam District.
</P>
<P>
The NWPC consists of 50 elected members and 2 nominated on a
bonus basis according to the number of votes won by each party. Of
this number 35 elected members are from Kurunegala and 15 from
Puttalam.
</P>
<P>
The last NWPC was ruled by the UNP which won 27 seats at the
elections and obtained both the bonus seats.
</P>
<P>
The ruling PA was able to win 17 seats in all the elections
while the balance six seats were won by the Democratic United
National Front, which is now a constituent partner in the ruling
PA government.
</P>
<P>
The run-up to the current NWPC elections has been riddled with
violence. According to the Special Elections Monitoring Unit of
the police, over 650 election-related incidents of violence has
been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The main contenders, the PA and the UNP have been accusing each
other for fomenting the violence against each other's candidates.
</P>
<P>
However, the other five parties and three independent groups
contesting the elections have also been affected by the violence.
More violence is expected on and after the polling day, analysts
here said.
</P>
<P>
The nature of the violence stretches from murder (two so far)
to attempted murders, incidents of hurt, assaults, threats and
intimidation, mischief, arson and damage to property. The bulk of
the charges have been against the government.
</P>
<P>
The main plank in the PA's campaign was "vote for us to develop
the country further" while the UNP called for the people vote to
preserve democracy.
</P>
<P>
However, the third largest party the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna
(People's Liberation Front) told the voters that this was an
opportunity to get rid of the stale two party system which
prevailed for decades.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Martina
Hingis breezed into the fourth round of the Australian Open on
Saturday with a 6-1, 6-2 victory over local favorite Jelena Dokic.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, 18, showed she was too strong for her younger opponent
as she outplayed Dokic in just 48 minutes on Melbourne Park's
Center Court.
</P>
<P>
Ranked as the best female junior in the world, 15-year-old
Dokic was always struggling against the Swiss world number two.
</P>
<P>
Hingis advanced to the Round of 16 against either Amanda
Coetzer of South Africa or Chinese Taipei's Janet Lee.
</P>
<P>
Hingis can regain the world number one ranking she lost to
Lindsay Davenport by winning the Australian Open.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Houston Rockets signed
Scottie Pippen Friday with a five-year, $67.2 million contract in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
"I'd sleep for an hour and the vice president Robert Barr
would wake me up and I'd pray. This is like a dream come true,"
said coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
"I'll have no problem putting on this jersey," said Pippen,
who had been with the Chicago Bulls throughout his career. "I'm
very comfortable with it. In fact, I'm going to sleep in it
tonight."
</P>
<P>
The Rockets had to miss their first two workouts while waiting
for Pippen to sign the contract. This will clear the rest of the
Rockets free agents to sign their contracts.
</P>
<P>
Hakeem Olajuwon, Brent Price, Rodrick Rhodes and Charles
Barkley, who signed Thursday for $1 million, are the only Rockets
players under contract.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Two-time title holder Jim
Courier has been forced out of the Australian Open in Melbourne
during his third round match against Russia's Yevgeny Kafelnikov.
</P>
<P>
Courier, who won in Melbourne in 1992 and 1993, was down 2-1
and 3-0 when he was hit by severe leg cramps.
</P>
<P>
The American appeared to have been troubled by the problem
earlier in the match, but it became worse as he stretched for a
ball during the fourth game of the fourth set.
</P>
<P>
After being treated for several minutes at courtside, Courier
decided the problem was too severe to allow him continue.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov is now set to make the most of the absence of
seeded players in his section of the draw.
</P>
<P>
His next opponent will be either Andrei Pavel of Romania or
American qualifier Paul Goldstein.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Shaping Future-Oriented Sino-African Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the beginning of January, Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan made fresh efforts to cement time-honored Sino-African
friendship by making a five-nation visit to the African
continent. Moreover, Vice Chairman Xu Jialu of China's National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee is also now visiting
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Tao, deputy director of the African Affairs Department
in the Chinese Foreign Ministry, told Xinhua that this series of
visits reflect the continuity of China's policies toward Africa
and the great importance placed by China on it.
</P>
<P>
The visits also show that under the circumstances of
accelerating multipolarization and economic globalization, China
hopes to shape future-oriented Sino-African ties of long-term
stability and comprehensive cooperation by pursuing continued
policies toward Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, China and African nations have established
sincere friendship by supporting each other in their respective
construction and in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
The two are still faced with the same aspirations of
developing themselves and better safeguarding the rights and
interests of developing countries, despite the fact that the
international situation has undergone profound changes, including
reshaped relations among powers.
</P>
<P>
During Hu's African trip, which will take him to Madagascar,
Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and South Africa, the Chinese vice president
will meet with heads of state and government and parliament
leaders of the four countries, and will also deliver a key-note
speech on Sino-African relations in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, China and relevant countries are scheduled to
sign a series of agreements on economic, trade and technological
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said he believes that Vice President Hu's visit will
play an important role in promoting Sino-African relations geared
to the 21st century.

MANILA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Saturday that negotiations with the heirs of the late
president Ferdinand Marcos to recover their assets remain in the
preliminary stage.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio-TV program, he reiterated his assurance that
any compromise agreement with the Marcoses will be transparent and
above board.
</P>
<P>
"As of now, everything is preliminary. There are no serious
talks, no commitments yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he would submit the details of the compromise agreement
for the scrutiny by Congress, the Commission on Audit and the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Because of the preliminary nature of the talks, it is still too
early for anyone to speculate on how the government and the
Marcoses plan to share their recovered wealth, he added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Food Security Poor, Says Early Warning Unit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
 Community (SADC) Early Warning Unit said that food security in
southern Africa remains unsatisfactory as the region faces an
overall deficit of 727, 000 tons of cereal for the 1998/99
marketing year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest SADC Food Security bulletin released in
Harare Friday, the deficit was evidenced by total regional cereal
supplies amounting to only 25.26 million tons, being insufficient
to meet regional requirements of 25.99 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"The current deficit is, however, sightly higher than the
deficit of 510, 000 tons assessed in June but still lower than the
1997/98 shortfall of 1.83 million tons, given a significant
increase in maize opening stocks and reduced wheat production in
South Africa and an upward revision in maize production in
Lesotho," said the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin noted that an overall regional maize surplus of
1.29 million tons was assessed for the current marketing year,
representing a slight increase from the 1.22 million tons surplus
assessed earlier in June.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin attributed the increase in maize supplies to
changes in maize opening stocks in South Africa and in the maize
harvest for Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, increased production of rice in Tanzania, Mozambique
and Malawi had resulted in a regional rice surplus of 28,000 tons,
with wheat and sorghum reflecting regional deficits of 1.79
million tons and 256,000 tons respectively.

<P>
PYONGYANG, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Pyongyang's official
newspaper Rodong Sinmun condemned the United States on Saturday
for its threat of "nuclear punishment" against the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
A commentary in the newspaper said the United States made the
threat at the 20th Military Committee Meeting with South Korea
earlier this week by agreeing to launch a Combined Psychological
Operations Task Force against the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The United States has obviously drawn up a nuclear war t
imetable and is seeking pretexts to strike the DPRK with nuclear
weapons, said the commentary.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stressed that as long as Washington does not
renounce its ambition to overthrow the DPRK government with
force, armed conflicts and even nuclear war will be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
It warned that if the United States should finally choose
nuclear confrontation, the DPRK would have to take reciprocal
measures while the United States would have to take all the
consequences.

<HEADLINE> Slow Progress in Bangladesh Food for Work Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Food for Work
schemes (FFW) targeted to support the post-flood rehabilitation
program across the country has been progressing slowly because of
too much red tape at the district level.
</P>
<P>
Eight percent of the projects under the FFW were yet to start
off although the Agriculture Ministry had made necessary
allocations, ministry officials said, according to the Bangladesh
Observer daily newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"And progress of the rest 20 percent projects is also very
slow," said an official of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry had sent urgent messages to deputy commissioners
of the districts for pushing the FFW program, attuned to the
emergency rehabilitation operation. "Even the high officials of
the ministry are making phone calls to the deputy commissioners to
spur the program," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The district administrations were making the implementation
process difficult, said an official of the Local Government and
Rural Development (LGRD) Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is not necessary or compulsory that all the
projects be approved by the minister in charge of the concerned
district, the deputy commissioners are sending projects to them
seeking their approval," he said.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, the projects sent to the ministers in charge of
the districts were already endorsed by the LGRD Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for a second approval," said the official, as
"this is creating serious complications in implementing the FFW
program in the rural areas and ultimately slowing down the whole
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has already allocated 260,000 tons of wheat for
the FFW projects.
</P>
<P>
Works under the FFW were supposed to start in a full swing
immediately after the receding of the flood water, which engulfed
about two-thirds of Bangladesh last year, to generate seasonal
employment in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The government decided to implement the Food for Work Program
extensively this year as a means to help the flood-stricken
villagers through creating huge jobs as the deluge washed away
their crops.
</P>
<P>
The floods between July and September last year killed more
than 1,500 people, damaged houses, roads and rail lines, and
destroyed more than 2 million tons of rice in the fields,
inflicting an estimated loss of 4.3 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Population Increase Threatens Vietnam's Food Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Population control is crucial for
Vietnam's long-term food security, although Vietnam's food
security program has made much progress in the past 10 years,
Vietnam's English daily Vietnam News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's food production has increased three times that of the
population growth rate in the past 10 years, but problems remain,
threatening the stability of the nation's food production, Vietnam
News quoted Nguyen Sinh Cuc, deputy head of Agriculture Division
under Vietnam's General Statistics Office, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth in Vietnam's population, which shows few signs
of slowing down, has averaged 1.8 percent in the past three years,
and the total population is expected to reach nearly 81 million by
the year 2000 from the present 78 million, said Cuc.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems is the lack of crop cultivation areas,
especially land for planting paddy. Vietnam's General Department
of Land Administration says that only 191,000 hectares of
cultivable land for agricultural production are available
throughout Cuu Long, the country's largest rice production region.
</P>
<P>
Rapid urbanization and industrialization is also constricting
the availability of suitable cultivation areas.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the per capita food growth rate will not be
increased in the next century because the country's population
growth rate is expected to remain at the same level.
</P>
<P>
Cuc said Vietnam needed an effective and integrated food
security strategy. He quoted international monetary fund officials
as saying that the country's birth rate should drop to below 17
per thousand, decreasing the natural population growth rate to
below 10 per thousand per year.
</P>
<P>
This will help ensure long-term food security and keep Vietnam
as one of the world's leading rice exporters, added Cuc.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Coal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China is pinning its hopes on
coal exports to reduce oversupply in the domestic coal market and
is expected to sell more than 38.5 million tons of coal abroad
this year.
</P>
<P>
The China National Coal Import and Export (Group) Corp.
(CNCIEC) will take up the major part of the task, today's China
Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
CNCIEC exported a record 29.25 million tons of coal last year,
or 90 percent of the country's total exported coal.
</P>
<P>
The company earned 962.49 million U.S. dollars, 9.5 percent
above its target.
</P>
<P>
This year, the company will take measures to open up new
markets including South America and South Asia, while
consolidating market share in its traditional ones in Asia and
Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The international undersea
optical fiber cableline sea-me-we-3 (SMW3) and continental ground
optical fiber cableline (CGC) linking up with Vietnam are expected
to become operational in 1999, according to an official report
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 39,000 km-long SMW3 stretches from Western Europe to the
Middle East, Australia, Southeast and Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
It is the largest international optical fiber system ever
linked to Vietnam, one of the 40 onshore stations of SMW3
globally.
</P>
<P>
The system, with a total investment of 1.4 billion U.S.
dollars, including 33 million U.S. dollars from Vietnam, involves
92 telecommunications companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
The 7,000 km-long CGC runs through China, Vietnam, Laos,
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore, with 600 km in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
When these optical fiber cablelines become operational, Vietnam
will directly link up with the other countries involved.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam now has 5,013 international telecommunications
channels, up 2.7 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, Vietnam upgraded 4 international switchboards in
Hanoi, Da  Nang and Ho Chi Minh City to boost high-quality
services and open more channels to India, Laos, the United States,
Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country earned 253 million U.S. dollars from
international postal charges, a 12 percent increase over 1997.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and the European
Union (EU) concluded the second round of trade talks in Brussels
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jaime Zabludovsky, head of the Mexican delegation, said in a
statement in Brussels that no definite results have been reached
in the talks that started on January 18.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks, which will focus on the timing and
extent of tariff exemptions, a key issue in the free trade talks,
will be held in Brussels in March, Zabludovsky said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will continue to discuss trade in goods and
services in the next round. Zabludovsky declined to comment on
whether the EU wants to compromise in the audio-visual sector and
Mexico in the air traffic sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Mexico wants to postpone the liberalization of
industrial and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
The EU wants Mexico to eliminate the raise of tariffs to
products it commercializes, sources close to the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
An earlier report said EU delegates have requested Mexico to
revoke tariff rise of between 3 percent and 10 percent it set for
European products on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Mexico's second largest trading partner after the
United States. But bilateral trade has shrunk since Mexico
entered the North American Free Trade Agreement. Both sides are
keen to reverse the unfavorable trend.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar-Japan Galvanizing Factory Opens in Yangon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 23 (Xinhua) -- A galvanizing factory jointly
constructed by Myanmar and Japanese Companies was opened here
Friday in efforts to reduce the imports of galvanized iron sheets
widely used in the country.
</P>
<P>
The factory, established by Myanma General and Maintenance
Industries of the Ministry of Industry-1, Myanmar ACE Mining Co
Ltd and Sumitomo Corporation of Japan, has a designed capacity of
producing 15,000 metric tons of galvanized sheets in the first
year, 18,000 metric tons in the second year and 24,000 metric tons
beginning the third year.
</P>
<P>
It occupies one hectare of land on Thanlyin Industrial Zone in
Thanlyin township, about 16 kilometers south of Yangon.
</P>
<P>
Last September, a Myanmar military-run company -- the Union of
Myanmar Economic Holding Ltd -- and the Pohang Iron and Steel Co.
Ltd of South Korea reached an agreement to build a galvanized iron
sheet factory in Pyinmabin Industrial Zone in the Mingaladon
township, about 20 kilometers north of Yangon.

<HEADLINE> Further Tests Continue to Italian Volleyballer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Further medical tests are
required to the Italian player who tested positive with an
urinary epitestosterone during the Volleyball World Championships
held in Japan last November.
</P>
<P>
FIVB, the world volleyball governing body, confirmed in
Lausanne that the B sample, which was analyzed by an IOC
laboratory in Tokyo in December in the presence of an offical
delegation of the Italian Volleyball Federation and a
representative of the player, remained the same as the first concl
usion.
</P>
<P>
To determine whether this illegal value of epitestosterone is
caused by the use of a masking agent or by specific pathological
conditions of the player causing an hormonal alteration, a
further endocrinologic test is required in accordance with the
IOC medical code.
</P>
<P>
This medical examination of the athlete has been prepared by
the Medical Commission of the FIVB and will take place in Paris,
before the end of January. Afterwards, the player will undergo
random doping tests over three-month period to verify the results
as decided by the Medical Commission.
</P>
<P>
No offical statement will be made by the FIVB before the
result of this test procedure.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Fight Against Kashin-Beck Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China is determined to push
ahead with research into Kashin-Beck disease to bring about its
eradication in the 21st century, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Yin Dakui, vice-minister of health, said Friday at an Internati
onal Symposium on Kashin-Beck Disease and Related Disorders that
there are currently 2.5 million people suffering from the disease
in China, according to the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The Kashin-Beck disease mainly affects the growth of articular
cartilages in children, resulting in stunted growth, arthritic
pain and restricted movement of the arms and legs. The disease is
endemic to Northeast China, Sichuan Province and the Tibet
Plateau in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, China set up a special fund of 350 million
yuan (about 42 million US dollars) and has carried out a great
deal of prevention work (against the disease)," Wang Zhao, head
of the Health Ministry's Department of Disease Control, which
organized the symposium, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The symposium attracted more than 150 experts from China,
Belgium and other countries and international organizations, and
collected at least 200 papers on how to eliminate the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Deformed joints cannot be cured, so early-stage prevention is
the key to controlling the disease," Wang told the China Daily,
adding that the prevention and control of the disease should be
combined with help for those in need, for the disease occurs
mainly in economically backward places.
</P>
<P>
In its research into the disease, China has been given
considerable support from various international organizations
such as the World Health Organization and Medecins Sans
Frontieres, receiving equipment and funds, said China Daily.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Government is
turning to leading-edge technology in its efforts to reinforce
river dykes.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, a coordination group has
been established with officials from several state departments to
promote the use of new materials and technology.
</P>
<P>
"It's apparent to all that advanced technology can play a
significant role in guaranteeing the quality of construction
projects. And we are eager to learn from the successful
experiences and expertise of other countries in this respect,"
Sheng Huaren, minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A Sino-Dutch seminar was held here recently on geotextile
application and dyke reinforcement technology.
</P>
<P>
Two Dutch technologists were invited to discuss application of
mature technologies, including the use of geotextile, a special
construction material used to better prevent water from leaking
through levees.
</P>
<P>
They will also conduct studies with Chinese engineers on
problems which emerged in river dykes during last summer's
flooding in China, and develop solutions to prevent their
recurrence.
</P>
<P>
During last summer's devastating flooding, many river dykes
and banks were seriously damaged after long periods of soaking.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN-EU Meeting Postponed Indefinitely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 23 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has announced an
indefinite postponement of the 13th ASEAN-EU Joint Cooperation
Committee meeting scheduled for Monday, after they disagreed on
conditions for Myanmar's participation, the Bangkok Post reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The postponement was made because "the two sides cannot find a
resolution on the meeting formality," Thai Foreign Ministry deputy
spokesman Kitti Wasinondh was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Friday's announcement came after the latest effort of Thailand,
Which proposed that Myanmar and Laos sit behind a plaque that
reads "non-signatory."
</P>
<P>
Thailand circulated the proposal Friday but the two groupings
could not reach agreement in time.
</P>
<P>
The Thai proposal primarily aims to counter that of the
European Union (EU) which wants a plaque reading "new member" to
be placed in front of the seats of the Laotian and Myanmar
representatives.
</P>
<P>
Kitti said the EU proposal was unacceptable as there were no
longer new members in ASEAN, which the two countries joined some
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Friday's abrupt cancellation was the second time after the EU
called for postponement of the meeting in November 1997, when
ASEAN insisted on Myanmar's participation as an observer.

<HEADLINE> Arbitration Settling More Trade Disputes in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- When business disputes arose
some two decades ago, the parties involved would resort to a
judge to settle their problem.
</P>
<P>
But now they are more likely to turn to arbitration, according
to a report in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"China's arbitration centers are attracting more users
worldwide thanks to their independence, impartiality and
inexpensiveness," Zhu Jianlin, secretary-general of the China
International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission(CIETAC),
was cited as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commission is a permanent arbitration institution
established within the China Chamber of International Commerce.
It deals mainly with international or foreign-related economic
and trade disputes.
</P>
<P>
The commission has grown into a major international commercial
arbitration center and has one of the heaviest caseloads in the
world, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>

WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Sacramento Kings, who

<HEADLINE> China Not to Open Up Internet Phone, Fax Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Information
Industry (MII) Friday reiterated that China would not open up
Internet telephone and fax services for the time being, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A strict permit-issuing system will be introduced when
conditions are ripe, the Ministry told the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In what appears to be the government's first response to a
Fuzhou court ruling on Wednesday that Internet Protocol (IP)
phone services come under the category of computer information
services, open to the public, an MII official told China Daily
that only the Internet information services, excluding IP phone
and fax, are currently open.
</P>
<P>
"We are stilling building and improving facilities for the new
business, and studying how to run and manage it," Xu Mutu,
director of the Market Administration of the Telecom Bureau under
the MII, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Xu's remarks came only two days after the Fuzhou Intermediate
People's Court in east China's Fujian Province decided in favor
of Chen Yan and Chen Zhui, who were charged with "illegally
setting up an international telephone service on the Internet."
</P>
<P>
The court verdict indicated that the IP phone service, which
allows people to "call global and pay local", is just one of many
computer information services, which, according to a State
Council circular issued in 1993, are not a monopoly business.
</P>
<P>
Xu argued that the IP phone service in China should be
administered by the unified State telecommunications department,
and that no one would be allowed to run an IP phone business
without prior examination of their qualifications and grant of a
business permit from the authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said that some firms now use the country's Internet
infrastructure -- in the construction and maintenance of which
the State invests heavily -- to run their IP phone business, only
paying the fee for conventional telephones and an Internet
service provider. This is detrimental to the interests of the
State.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhang Dongsheng, an official with the State
Development Planning Commission, told China Daily that the
country should encourage the growth of the IP phone service to
improve the choice for international callers.

<HEADLINE> China's State Council to Trim Logistics Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
cabinet, has decided to trim its gigantic logistics units, with
the aim of cutting government budgets and increasing government
efficiency, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The efficiency-oriented reform will make State-funded
logistics units "economically independent" in the immediate
future, Jiao Huancheng, director of the Bureau of Government
Offices Administration, told the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to a pilot plan agreed by the State Council,
logistics units will be given a free hand to manage their own
affairs from this year. Most are expected to become economically
independent by year 2001, said China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It added that the reform would also highlight the systematic
and scientific management of logistics affairs, reduce
bureaucracy and smooth out wrinkles in logistics administration.
</P>
<P>
China now has 29 ministries and commissions, each with its own
logistics service center, costing the State millions of yuan
annually.
</P>
<P>
The reform will be a bold step on the way to better logistics
services, including government procurement, housing reform and
official car use, said China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It quoted some analysts as saying that the move is another
crucial step in the ambitious drive to downsize government
offices and personnel. Thousands of officials who left their
posts have started new jobs or are receiving training to adjust
to the changes.
</P>
<P>
The State Council will also tighten the supervision of
logistics management in its ministries and commissions and lay
down standard procedures in logistics administration, the
newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Uses Radar in Fight Against Drug-Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- An air defense radar
has been installed in Colombia to trace covert flights that
transport drugs, Colombian President Andres Pastrana announced
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He warned drug-traffickers that Colombia and the whole world
will use all resources to defeat them in the war against drug.
</P>
<P>
He made the warning at the inaugural ceremony of the radar of
the "General Joaquin Paris" Battalion at San Jose del Guaviare.
</P>
<P>
"We Colombians are aware of the big damage caused by drugs,
and we assume it as a challenge to us and to the international
community," said the president.
</P>
<P>
"I can tell Colombians that our sky has now one more
guardian," said Pastrana, who explained that the radar facility
will monitor an extensive territory of the country from now on to
track aircraft that are engaged in illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
The radar station is part of a development project started in
1989 by the Colombian Air Force to strength air defense ability.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Curtis Kamman said at the ceremony
that the radar facility is a symbol of the joint efforts by the
United States and Colombia to fight drug-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Kamman said the U.S. spent 20 million U.S. dollars on the
construction of the radar communication system.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Chairman Says Charges Against Serb Police Based on Emotions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- OSCE chief inspector in
Kosovo William Walker might have spoken emotionally when accusing
Serbian police of massacring 45 ethnic Albanian civilians in
Racak village a week ago, OSCE chairman Norwegian Foreign
Minister Knut Vollebaek said in Pristina Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Kosovo's capital, Vollebaek
said Walker's remarks, which enraged Belgrade and led to an
expulsion order on him, were "based on emotions."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would make no conclusion on the
killings before forensic doctors finish the autopsy work on the
bodies from Racak.
</P>
<P>
At the same press conference, Walker acknowledged that he
might have made a hasty accusation as he had not realized the
complexity of the matter at the moment. He noted that a Finnish
forensic group now working in Kosovo would make final
verification on whether the bodies belonged to civilians or armed
fighters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vollebaek said he was satisfied with his talks
Thursday with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as well as
Belgrade's freezing of its decision to expel Walker.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the OSCE verifiers in Kosovo is to create
conditions for a political solution to the Kosovo crisis, he
stressed.

<HEADLINE> China to Consolidate Stimulation Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to
consolidate its consumption policies this year in a bid to
further stimulate domestic demand, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will abandon traditional policies that do not suit the
market economy and take creative measures to expand consumption,"
Chen Bangzhu, vice-minister of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Expanding domestic demand was regarded as the main component
in the nation's efforts to boost economic growth last year. Yet
the efforts to stimulate consumption were not totally successful
due to a lack of basic policy support.
</P>
<P>
The consumption areas targeted by the new policy include
residential housing, cars and information technology-related
products.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector should co-operate with banks to expand the
use of credit, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Mortgages were introduced in the early 1990s, but have not
worked effectively since regulations were so restrictive that few
customers could meet them. This was one of the reasons for the
rise in the stock of unoccupied residential housing.
</P>
<P>
"Trial loan operations for household products and large
agricultural machinery will be initiated this year, while the
criteria for car loans will be loosened," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Leasing will be another priority this year.
</P>
<P>
The country has also decided on several measures to tap the
extensive rural market, where nearly 900 million inhabitants have
a huge consumption potential.

<HEADLINE> Italy Reports Trade Surplus in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Italy had a trade surplus of
about 40 trillion lire (24 billion U.S. dollars) in 1998 despite
the impact of the crises in Asia and Russia, Foreign Trade
Minister Piero Fassino said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on "globalization of Italian trade,"
Fassino noted that the ratio between Italy's trade surplus and
gross domestic product (GDP) is higher than any other
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
He said that Italy is very strong in exports, but needs to
expand production capacity and investments abroad.
</P>
<P>
Italy is the world's fourth exporter in terms of volume but
ranks only 12th in investments abroad.
</P>
<P>
Quoting figures showing the penetration of Italy's small and
medium-sized businesses in foreign markets, Fassino said some 98
percent of the companies operating in foreign markets had less
than 200 employees while 57 percent of them had sales of less
than 30,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"This means that small and even tiny companies are now the
core of the globalization process," he said.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Gentle Starving May Lead to Longer Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANAHEIM, CALIFORNIA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- People may be able
to extend their lives by eating smaller amounts of food rich in
vitamins and other nutrients, scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
An unplanned experiment on people shows that following a
lifetime diet about 30 percent lower in calories than the average
American diet can set in motion physical responses that help the
body resist aging, Dr. Roy Walford of the University of
California at Los Angeles, told the annual meeting of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
The study data covers eight individuals, Walford himself
included, who spent two years in a giant, hermetically sealed
greenhouse -- known as Biosphere Two -- in the Arizona desert.
They were all forced to exist on limited, albeit highly
nutritious rations.
</P>
<P>
Professor Walford monitored their physiology both before and
during the experiment and said changes in cholesterol levels,
body weight and blood pressure -- among other factors -- mimicked
those seen in long-lived rodents on severely restricted diets.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory research has also shown that rats given half the
food a normal rat would choose to eat live up to 70 percent
longer than usual. They are also physically and mentally more
active for much longer.
</P>
<P>
This knowledge, combined with data gained in Biophere Two, has
now led scientists to argue that a similar postponement of aging
could be possible in humans.
</P>
<P>
Walford conceded his results were preliminary but claimed a
clearer picture will emerge from on-going experiments in monkeys
in about five years.
</P>
<P>
Asked to explain the shorter life expectancies of less
well-fed populations in developing countries, he said they were
partly the result of nutritionally poor diets, not small diets.
</P>
<P>
People who want to try this low-calorie diet cannot simply eat
less, but have to eat better, Walford said.

<P>
ROME, January 22 (Xinhua) -- NATO Supreme Commander General
Wesley Clark warned Friday that NATO forces are ready to strike
against pinpointed military targets in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic must respect the Kosovo
cease-fire agreement and reduce his military presence there "if
he wants to avoid attack", Clark told reporters at the end of a
two-day visit to the NATO's Mediterranean headquarters in Naples
of southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Yugoslav government has nine battalions in
Kosovo, not three as Milosevic had promised in October. Police
have also been given heavy weapons to use against Kosovo Albanian
homes and villages, he said.
</P>
<P>
During Clark's visit in Naples, he conferred with the
commander of NATO forces for Southern Europe, the commander of
air forces and the commander of naval forces in Southern Europe.
Military sources said that the top agenda in their talks was the
preparation for an eventual strike against Yugoslavia.

UNITED NATIONS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan recommended Friday to extend the mandate of the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) for a further period of
six months until July 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the U.N. Security Council, Annan said during
the past six months, fighting in south Lebanon continued at an
increased pace and the situation in the area remained volatile
and dangerous with a heightened risk of escalation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said civilians were again killed and injured
and as before, UNIFIL did its best to limit the conflict and to
protect the inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Annan recommended that the Council respond positively to a
request from the Lebanese government and extend the mission's
mandate for a period of six months.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL was established in 1978 to restore the Lebanese
government's authority over the southern part of the country
after an Israeli incursion against Palestinian guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> China's State Council to Trim Logistics Units </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 23 (Xinhua) -- The State Council, China's
cabinet, has decided to trim its gigantic logistics units, with
the aim of cutting government budgets and increasing government
efficiency, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The efficiency-oriented reform will make State-funded
logistics units "economically independent" in the immediate
future, Jiao Huancheng, director of the Bureau of Government
Offices Administration, told the English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to a pilot plan agreed by the State Council,
logistics units will be given a free hand to manage their own
affairs from this year. Most are expected to become economically
independent by year 2001, said China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It added that the reform would also highlight the systematic
and scientific management of logistics affairs, reduce
bureaucracy and smooth out wrinkles in logistics administration.
</P>
<P>
China now has 29 ministries and commissions, each with its own
logistics service center, costing the State millions of yuan
annually.
</P>
<P>
The reform will be a bold step on the way to better logistics
services, including government procurement, housing reform and
official car use, said China Daily.
</P>
<P>
It quoted some analysts as saying that the move is another
crucial step in the ambitious drive to downsize government
offices and personnel. Thousands of officials who left their
posts have started new jobs or are receiving training to adjust
to the changes.
</P>
<P>
The State Council will also tighten the supervision of
logistics management in its ministries and commissions and lay
down standard procedures in logistics administration, the
newspaper added.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Real Rises Against Dollar After Bank Intervention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's currency, the
real, rose against the U.S. dollar Friday morning after the
Brazilian Central Bank intervened in the exchange market for the
first time since last Friday, when it adopted a free fluctuation f
or the real-to-dollar exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the dollar gained 4 percent to reach
1.77 reals when the market opened, but the exchange rate soon
fell to 1.65 reals.
</P>
<P>
The rate change indicated that the government has intervened
by selling dollars, they said.
</P>
<P>
The real has fallen about 30 percent since last week, when the
Central Bank stopped spending dollars to support its value. Bank
President Francisco Lopes said the monetary authority would allow
the real to float but might step in to avoid exaggerated swings.
</P>
<P>
The government maintains an interbank interest rate of 32.50
percent.

BRUSSELS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Dutch Minister of Transport
Tineke Netelenbos has urged the situation of foreign partners and
competitors also to be examined when searching for solutions to
the millennium bug relating to chips and computers.
</P>
<P>
According to news from The Hague Friday, the Dutch minister
said that at present half the publicly vital objects of the
Transport Ministry have been rendered millennium-compliant.
</P>
<P>
Netelenbos made a speech Thursday at the Millennium Emergency
Plans Symposium, calling on all departments concerned to make
efforts for solving the year 2000 computing problem, the so-called
Millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
As one of the 15 European Union (EU) members, the Netherlands
has started preparations for examination of the Millennium issue
in public administrations.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has expressed
concerns about the issue and adopted a report for submission to
the EU Vienna Council meeting last December. The European Council,
the EU's policy-making body, welcomed the commission's report on
the century data-change problem and urged member states to
implement timely plans for the protection of their own
infrastructure and to continue to raise awareness across all
sectors, focusing in particular on the public sector and small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in its Presidency Conclusions at the Vienna Summit
that the relevant authorities in member states are urged to
examine closely the implications of the problem of supply-chain
failures outside the EU, to elaborate contingency plans to address
this, and to exchange information with their counterparts in other
member states.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc also calls on the commission to convene a
meeting of representatives of the public infrastructure providers
from the member states to establish whether the cross-border
dependencies within the EU in areas such as transport, energy and
water supply are being adequately addressed and to recommend
appropriate action.

<HEADLINE> Accurate Radiation Cuts Side-Effects of Cancer Treatments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A new radiotherapy for prostate
cancer has successfully reduced the risk of side-effects in trials
and could save many lives when introduced, British doctors said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The treatment, known as conformal radiotherapy, can "shape"
beams of radiation so that they hit only the tumor and not the
surrounding tissue, no matter how irregular its shape.
</P>
<P>
This has been achieved by creating three-dimensional images of
the tumor on the computer beforehand, researchers from the
Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden Trust reported
in The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
After trials on 225 patients, the researchers have found that
men receiving the shaped dose develop far fewer side-effects, and
therefore may be able to tolerate up to three times the radiation
dose.
</P>
<P>
Prostate patients given conventional radiotherapy are at high
risk of developing rectal inflammation and bleeding, which can be
so severe that it is necessary to limit the radiation, leaving the
cancer not properly destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The new radiotherapy could also be used to improve treatment
for many other cancers, the researchers believed.

systems Russia and the U.S. can deploy to intercept incoming
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Russia said that it was not ready to amend the treaty. Some
Russian officials warned of a possible new arms race.
</P>
<P>
Albright noted that the U.S. needs to prepare for missiles fired
by accident or by new nuclear states.
</P>
<P>
"We have many new threats with which to deal and we need to
make sure that we are able to fulfill our responsibilities
regarding our own defense," she said.
</P>
<P>
"There need to be concerns about withdrawal... The ABM is the
basis for most of our strategic thinking," she added.

On Wednesday, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen noted that
the U.S. might pull out of the treaty if Russia does not agree

<HEADLINE> U.N. Should Do More to Help Africa, IPA Officials Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
International Peace Academy (IPA) Friday called upon the United
Nations to do more to help Africa out of conflicts and poverty,
rather than pulling its peacekeepers out of Angola.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Magret Vogt, director of
the IPA's Africa Program, voiced her disagreement with the
decision by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to withdraw the U.N.
Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) from the southwest African
country.
</P>
<P>
It is time for the world body to learn lessons from its past
mistakes in Africa, for instance, the failure of the U.N.
peacekeeping operations in Somalia, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The political engagement of the United Nations in Africa is
more important," she said. Otherwise, "how many places are we
going to withdraw from?" she asked.
</P>
<P>
In a January 17 report to the Security Council, Annan cited the
non-cooperation from the warring Angolan parties and the worsening
political and security situation in the country as the two major
reasons to support his recommendation that the United Nations shut
down its peacekeeping operations in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council unanimously called Thursday for a
U.N. presence in Angola.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has the responsibility (to help
Africa) because Africa is part of the world," she said, adding
that "Africa is asking for proper and equal partnership."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Musifiky Mwanasali, associate of the IPA's Africa
Program, said that African soldiers have rendered competent
service outside Africa in peacekeeping operations. "Why can't the
others come to us and help us solve our problems," he asked.
</P>
<P>
The IPA is an independent, non-partisan, international
institution dedicated to promoting the prevention and settlement
of armed conflicts between and within states.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, people come to Africa to teach Africans
something, instead of learning something, even though they
themselves do not know much of the continent, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Africans are asked to vote when they are hungry," Vogt said,
urging the outside world to have a better understanding of what
Africa really needs.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, Africans like to vote, but first they like to have
food because they are hungry," she said. "But foreigners tell
Africans to vote before they can get food."

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Warns Belgrade of Looming Military Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke said on Friday that Belgrade must make more concessions
to avoid military action of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) over the war-ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
"It is not sufficient simply to suspend the expulsion order of
(U.S.) Ambassador (William) Walker. Action to full compliance is
necessary and we are moving ahead with NATO this morning to
prepare for military action." he told ABC's Good Morning America.
</P>
<P>
Walker, head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE) team of peace monitors in Kosovo, had been
ordered to leave Yugoslavia after he accused Serbian security
forces of the massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic suspended the expulsion
order on Thursday, but U.S. officials say he is not complying with
other terms of last October's agreement, including the removal of
Yugoslav forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said he spoke Thursday to NATO commander Gen. Wesley
Clarke and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. "The targets
have been refined and once NATO makes the decision we will be
ready to act, if it is necessary," Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke said the October agreement he brokered with Milosevic
had succeeded in saving 150,000 Kosovo Albanians from freezing to
death in the Kosovo hills, but "then the agreement began to
erode."
</P>
<P>
"It (the agreement) didn't have teeth," Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said NATO would continue
to maintain its threat of military action.
</P>
<P>
He said the next steps depended on the outcome of a meeting on
Friday in London of the six-nation Contact Group on former
Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> German Budget Has More than 10 Billion Dollars Shortfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 federal budget posed from
the Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's German government has a more
than 10 billion dollars shortfall and will need topping up by
mid-year, a budget policy spokesman of the Green Party Oswald
Metyger said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is a provisional budget. The new net borrowing limit will
not be overshot but we have a 12 billion dollar deficit," said the
Green Party's finance expert.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine has ruled out tax
increases and Metyger said in an German ARD television interview
the government would be seeking new spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
He also said trimming state subsidies, benefits for government
ministers and generous financial packages for retired
parliamentary deputies would all have to be considered.
</P>
<P>
The draft German federal budget of the year 1999 published from
the Schroeder's government on Wednesday is set at more than 290.50
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Prince Edward, Sophie Name Date of Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The wedding of Prince Edward,
the youngest son of Queen Elizabeth, and Sophie Rhys-Jones will
take place at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, Saturday, 19
June, the Buckingham Palace announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The occasion will be a family wedding in accordance with the
couple's wishes, said the palace.
</P>
<P>
The date of the wedding had earlier been predicted by the Sun
newspaper, which broke the news of the engagement on 6 January.
</P>
<P>
The Sun newspaper said the ceremony will be attended by 500
guests.
</P>
<P>
A further 500 guests will attend a buffet reception in the
castle's St George's Grand Hall, and invitations will be sent out
within weeks, it added.
</P>
<P>
It said that Sophie, 33, and Edward, 34, picked a date which
did not clash with official duties by senior royals.
</P>
<P>
The date follows Royal Ascot week -- one of the busiest periods
in the Queen's calendar. Sophie is likely to join the royal party
at the races in the run-up to the big day.
</P>
<P>
While Edward and Sophie are thought to want a "family and
friends" ceremony, tens of thousands of people are expected to
line the streets surrounding Windsor Castle for a glimpse of the
couple.
</P>
<P>
The wedding is likely to see the largest gathering of Royals
since the Queen and Prince Philip's golden wedding celebrations in
November 1997.
