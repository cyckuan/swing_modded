<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Home Sales Up by 1.4 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of previously owned homes
in U.S. rose by 1.4 percent last month despite the rising of
mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Association of Realtors reported today that
sales of existing single-family homes totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 4.26 million in May, matching the record
set in December 1993.
</P>
<P>
It was the third advance in four months and the sales in May
were up 17.7 percent from the May 1995 rate. That left an
inventory of just 2.12 million, representing a six-month supply at
the May sales rate.
</P>
<P>
But activity was mixed regionally in the country, with sales
rising in the Midwest and South while falling in the Northeast and
West.
</P>
<P>
The increase of existing home sales occurred despite the rising
of mortgage rates in the nation. Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages
averaged 8.07 percent in May, up from 7.93 percent in April and
7.03 percent as recently as January. Still, rates were not much
higher than the 7.91 percent average in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Realtors expect sales to cool off this summer because of
the recent rise in rates.
</P>
<P>
"But the market's health is not in any jeopardy," said Realtors
President Art Godi.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Department reported earlier this month that the
housing starts in the country dropped by 4.7 percent in May, a
sign that the U.S. housing market was cooling down as the mortgage
rates were rising from the beginning of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is expecting a bumper
harvest and improved quality of tobacco this year.
</P>
<P>
Today's Financial Mail quoted Executive Director of the
Tobacco Association of Zambia (TZA) Graham Wallace as saying that
favorable weather conditions have improved both quantity and
quality of the commodity.
</P>
<P>
He said marketing of tobacco looks very promising as the world
consumption outstriped production for the last three years.
</P>
<P>
Zambian tobacco growers sold about 760 tons of Virginia
tobacco and 36,000 kilograms of Burley tobacco up to June 17 from
May 20, this year, when tobacco sales began, with a total value
of two million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zambia will now be able to hold at least one's year's supply
to allow maturation and buffer the supply and demand on the world
market.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 20 years, the TZA has negotiated a full
regional price on the country's tobacco, which was set 10 percent
below the market price previously.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and Malawi auction floors have opened with prices
rising by 20 percent over the last season's opening prices.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Parliament Ready to Boost Ties with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin's
current visit to Spain will help push friendly bilateral
cooperation a step further, Senate president Juan Ignacio Barrer
said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony held jointly by the Congress of Deputies and the
Senate to welcome the Chinese president, Barrer said there have
been friendly, high-level visits between Spain and China, and
Jiang's visit has turned a new page in the history of
Spanish-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
"China has made great achievements in its economic development,
and we are glad to see such development and progress in China," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the parliament will fully support the efforts of
the Spanish government in strengthening ties with China, and at
the same time, will make its own efforts to advance political,
economic and cultural cooperation between Spain and China.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Spanish parliament, Jiang said that
Sino-Spanish relations have developed smoothly in recent years and
contacts between the parliaments of the two countries have also
increased steadily. This has contributed greatly to the
understanding and friendly cooperation between the two countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese National People's Congress treasures the
friendship between the two parliaments and is ready to continue
its efforts in further strengthening mutual friendly cooperation
and contacts," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace with
the initiative in its own hands. China is ready to develop
friendly and cooperative relations with all other countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the purpose of his current visit was to "promote
understanding, strengthen confidence, expand common ground and
push forward cooperation in order to raise the current good
relations between the two countries to a new level."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived here Monday for a four-day state
visit to the country, the first leg of his six-nation European
and Asian tour, which will also take him to Norway, Romania,
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
He will leave for Oslo, Norway, on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Visits Cyprus to Learn About Its Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary-General's
special representative for Cyprus Han Sung-Joo arrived here today
to learn about the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
This is his first visit to the island since his appointment in
May to replace Joe Clark, former Canadian Prime Minister, who
failed to bring the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides closer to
settlement during his three-year term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival at Larnaca Airport, Han noted his
goal is "to find a way of addressing to the concerned
requirements, anxieties and interests of the communities."
</P>
<P>
He said he is here "to find out as much as possible the
concerns and the requirements of each side and how the other side
can address itself to that particular problem."
</P>
<P>
"We have a goal, I think the important thing is to find the
strategy to get the goal and that I consider as my mission and
objective," the former Foreign Minister of the Republic of Korea
added.
</P>
<P>
Later today, Han will be received by President Glafcos
Clerides, who will fly to Athens Wednesday to attend the funeral
of late Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
During his six-day visit, the U.N. envoy will also meet
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash in the Turkish-controlled
northern part of Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. and I think the parties that are involved in this
(the Cyprus problem) know what they would like to see, and that is
a productive and peaceful resolution of the issue and the problem
is how to get there," Han said, reassuring he will do his best.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the important thing is to deal with the
real situation and see if we can find a common ground."
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment on the fact that many people consider his
mission "impossible," Han said "it depends on how you define the
mission."
</P>
<P>
"If the mission is to find a magic formula that will
resolve the issue in one big sweep, I think it is in fact
a mission impossible," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that "if we take off the mission as
something that will range from improving the situation towards a
rather permanent and final resolution of the issue, I think
there is room for a contribution to be made."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said that after Cyprus he will also be
visiting other European capitals, including Athens and Ankara,
before returning to New York to report to the Secretary-General
about his trip.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Social Security Burden under European Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The social security burden in the
Netherlands, which was 45.9 percent of domestic product in 1995,
is under the European average.
</P>
<P>
This is revealed in a study into the position of the Dutch
welfare state in comparison with eight other industrial countries,
to be published next week.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that the social security burden in the
Netherlands is substantially higher than in the United States,
Japan and the United Kingdom, but lower than in Belgium, Sweden
and Denmark, "while Germany is close to the Dutch level".
</P>
<P>
The costs of the social security system(18 percent of domestic
product) are also below the European average.
</P>
<P>
As far as wage costs are concerned the Netherlands is more
expensive than the Anglo-Saxon countries, but cheaper than the
European industrial countries and Japan; in relation to Germany
the Netherland is in fact 26 percent cheaper.
</P>
<P>
Dutch Minister for Social Affairs Mr Ad Melkert cited these
figures yesterday during a debate in Amsterdam, drawing the
conclusion that internationally the Netherlands was no longer "out
of step".

<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher will arrive here Wednesday for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Christopher held a three-hour meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem today to discuss the
future of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who just attended the Arab summit here on Saturday and
Sunday, is due to return here Wednesday. He will also meet Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will discuss with Christopher Israel's withdrawal from
the West Bank town of Hebron and the resumption of the
Palestinian-Israeli talks for a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on expanding
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, Israel should have
redeployed its troops in Hebron last March. But Israel has delayed
the redeployment following a series of suicide bombings carried
out by Palestinian extremists in Israel in February and March.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is expected to brief Mubarak on his meeting with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also cover the Arab summit, which urged
Israel to continue the peace process based on the principle of
land-for-peace, local press said today.

<P>
TOKYO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 people were injured when
an express train derailed during torrential rains in central Japan
Tuesday, the Kyodo news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Hida 15 express, carrying 108 passengers from the central
city of Nagoya to the mountain resort of Takayama, derailed at
about 9:15 p.m.(1215 GMT) after it rammed into a huge rock that
had fallen in a landslide caused by heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
Two of the train's five cars jumped the tracks and overturned.
The injured, including the driver, were taken to hospital, Kyodo
said.
</P>
<P>
There have been no reports of deaths so far.
</P>
<P>
Rescue workers have rushed to the site, in Gifu prefecture 220
kilometers west of Tokyo, along with some 50 members of the

</P>
<P>
Officials at the Meteorological Agency said a village about 40
kilometers from the site recorded rainfall of 244 millimeters
between midnight Monday and mid-Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's TB Situation Worst in world </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Pretoria, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The tuberculosis (TB) epidemic
has been worse in South Africa than in any other country in the
world, according to the findings of an extensive review released
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Review of the National TB Control Program in South Africa
was conducted by international experts from the World Health
Organization (WHO) and local officials from the Department of
Health.
</P>
<P>
Releasing the findings of the Review at a press conference in
Pretoria, Director-general of the Department Dr. Olive Shisana
said more new TB cases have been reported in South Africa
annually than in any other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
About 140,000 people had been infected with TB last year
throughout the country, with the highest occurrence in the
Western Cape Province where 490 infections per 100,000 people had
been reported, said the Review.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the crisis will become much more severe in the next
ten years if we don't take dramatic steps to control the epidemic
now," said Shisana.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the Department has started implementing an
internationally recommended strategy known as the Directly
Observed Treatment Short-course (DOTS), which entailed health
workers watching a TB patient swallowing every dose of medicine.
</P>
<P>
Also at the conference, International Union Against TB and
Lung Disease Director Dr. Donald Enarson said South Africa's
infection rate compared badly to those of Mozambique and Tanzania
which were respectively well below a half and a third of South
Africa's 311 per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"I have investigated the TB situation in over 150 countries,
and South Africa's epidemic is the most frightening situation I
have ever encountered," said Dr. Enarson.
</P>
<P>
However, Shisana said South Africa's high infection rate could
largely be attributed to the fact that the country had been
isolated from international health organizations for many years.
</P>
<P>
Of those infected last year, 2,000 had contracted
multidrug-resistant TB, a strain which killed almost 80 percent
of its victims, the Review disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Shisana also warned that multidrug-resistant TB, for which
there is virtually no cure, would increase to frightening new
levels "if action is not taken now."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Enarson added DOTS should prevent
multidrug-resistant TB from developing since it is a disease
caused by incorrect treatment.
</P>
<P>
"Implementation of the DOTS strategy must be quickly
accelerated throughout South Africa if the nation is to avoid an
unmitigated tuberculosis disaster," the Review noted.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Searching for Arms Smuggled in Monrovia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
known as ECOMOG has began an "intensive" search of residential
quarters in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, for arms and ammunition
smuggled in by the warring factions during recent fightings.
</P>
<P>
The operation, tagged "Cordon and Search", is part of the
efforts by ECOMOG to ensure normalcy and safety of lives and
property in the city and its environs, said ECOMOG Field
Commander Major-General John Inienger, quoted by the News Agency
of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
Since it was kicked off on Monday, the operation has yielded a
lot of dividend as arms and some war like materials have been
recovered, he said. But he did not disclose the number and
varieties of the weapons that have been confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The commander blamed some faction leaders on having involved
in arms smuggling, saying they abused the privilege given by
leaders of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)
by smuggling arms into Monrovia in their official vehicles.
</P>
<P>
As they are members of the interim government of Liberia,
ECOMOG could not search their vehicles whenever they move around
the country.
</P>
<P>
But the peacekeeping force promptly informed ECOWAS when it
was established that the faction leaders were smuggling in arms,
the commander added.

<P>
PYONGYANG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) today called on the United States to disband the
U.N. Forces Command stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum issued on the eve of the 46th anniversary of
the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War, the DPRK's Foreign
Ministry also said that the United Nations' flag had been usurped
by the United States and the U.N. should take it back.

The U.N. Forces Command has become a subsidiary to the Joint

peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It added that it is pressing for the scrapping of the
U.N. Forces Command and the establishment of a new mechanism to
guarantee peace on the peninsula.

The DPRK government will do its utmost for the creation of this
new mechanism to prevent any outbreak of armed conflict or war on
the peninsula, said the memorandum, as quoted by the Korean

<HEADLINE> UK Students Choose Jobs over Classes: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 24 (Xinhua) -- More and more British students are
taking up part-time work and damaging their studies in the
process. Yet the reason for this is not financial hardship,
according to a report today on students and employment.
</P>
<P>
The report by Dr Catherine Hakim, a senior academic at the
London School of Economics, says that the number of British
students with part-time jobs has doubled over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Between 1984 and 1994 those with part-time jobs jumped from
343,000 to 671,000 and from seven percent to 11 percent of the
workforce.
</P>
<P>
However, the main reason for this dramatic rise is not
financial, but social and cultural.
</P>
<P>
The report, the result of a two-year study funded by the
Economic and Social Research Council, says that the jobs the
students take are mainly in catering, sales and other service jobs
such as cleaners and shelf-fillers in supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
White students, the report says, are almost twice as likely as
those from ethnic minorities, particularly Chinese and Asian, to
undertake paid work while in full-time education. Working students
are not more likely to come from poorer families.
</P>
<P>
Dr Hakim argues that any differences must lie in their
attitudes to work, money and education.
</P>
<P>
"Ethnic minority groups generally are less well off than the
dominant white community, yet they are more likely to ensure that
their children devote themselves exclusively to their studies,"
she said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Spanish Foreign Ministers Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen and his Spanish counterpart Abel Matutes today pledged to
continue joint efforts to boost political and economic relations
between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also a Vice Premier, is accompanying Chinese
President Jiang Zemin on his first visit to Spain.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Qian, Matutes said satisfactory progress has
been made in Sino-EU relations on the basis of mutual
understanding in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said the Spanish government would encourage Spanish
investment in China and seek ways to give momentum to bilateral
trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Spain will now try to match Spanish-Asian trade and economic
ties with their excellent political relations, Matutes added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Spanish and Chinese businessmen to deepen mutual
understanding and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that Sino-Spanish economic cooperation, which has
developed rapidly since formal relations were set up in 1973, is
helpful to China's modernization drive and facilitates the entry
of Spanish products and technology into the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
"President Jiang's visit to Spain is the most important event
in recent years and it is expected to further upgrade bilateral
relations," Qian added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share many views as well as interests in
safeguarding world peace and enhancing development and there is
great potential for future cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as long as the two sides follow the principles
of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and seeking common
ground while shelving differences, our good political and economic
relations can be maintained and developed," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian invited Matutes to visit China, which Matutes accepted.

<HEADLINE> More Hospitals Promote Breastfeeding Around World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of Baby-Friendly
Hospitals around the world has almost doubled from 4,282 at the
end of 1995 to 7,779 now, according to the United Nations
Childrend's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, a UNICEF/WHO joint
endeavor, is aimed at encouraging hospitals to promote exclusive
breastfeeding through specific practices such as rooming-in and
the prohibition of free and low-cost supplies of breastmilk
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF estimates that over 1 million infants die every year and
millions more succumb to illness and malnutrition because they are
not adequately breastfed.
</P>
<P>
Since the launch of the campaign in 1992, the Baby-Friendly
Hospital Initiative has been embraced by 171 countries, with
numbers of hospitals designated as Baby-Friendly more than
doubling each year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here tonight that China is willing to continue unremitting
efforts, together with Spain, for the establishment of long-term,
stable friendly and cooperative bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president made the remarks at a banquet hosted in
his honor by King Juan Carlos I of Spain here today. Jiang and his
wife arrived here earlier today on a four-day state visit at the
invitation of the Spanish king. Spain is the first leg of his six
European and central Asian nation tour which will also take him to
Norway, Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that Spain has a long history and splendid culture
and has made outstanding contributions to human
civilization. "Spain is no stranger to the Chinese people although
it is far apart," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he made a working visit to Spain 10 years
ago. "Now revisiting it, I was deeply impressed by your
achievements in economic and social development," he noted.
</P>
<P>
China always attaches great importance to developing friendly
cooperation with Spain, Jiang said. "We are pleased to see that
cooperation between the two countries in the fields such as
politics, economy, trade, science and technology and culture has
been expanded," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the two visits to China by the Spanish king and queen
had contributed a great deal to the friendship between the two
peoples and friendly cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is my belief that my current visit to Spain will deepen
mutual understanding and help bring our friendly cooperation to a
higher level," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
King Juan Carlos I said that the enhancement of friendly
relations with China is one of the priorities of the Spanish
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries have expanded their relations over
the past few years in the political, economic and trade domains
and Spanish entrepreneurs have developed their business in the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
However, "it would be more desirable if we tap the potential to
improve our cooperation in the fields of science, education, art,
sports and culture, and further consolidate our friendship," he
said.
</P>
<P>
King Juan Carlos I said China has sustained its unprecedented
economic growth, and its vast market prospects and favorable
economic policies have made the country a great attraction to
foreign investors and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The king said that the Asian-Pacific region, owing to its
culture, economy and population, has played a key role in the 20th
century, and it is expected to become even more important in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
He said that Spain and China have developed good relations over
the past few years. However, he said, "our initial contact
actually began several hundred years ago."
</P>
<P>
"We must spare no efforts to reduce arms and commit ourselves
to justice and peace in the international community. I believe
this is also China's goal and it will play an excellent role in
the world in the future," the king said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The self-styled Bosnian Serb
president, Radovan Karadzic, is prepared to leave his office as
demanded by the Dayton peace agreement, a senior Bosnian Serb
official said today.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb parliamentary speaker Momcilo Krajisnik said
Karadzic "would be ready to sacrifice his power if that is in the
interest of the Serb people."
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik was speaking to reporters after meeting international
mediator Carl Bildt in Pale, the seat for the Serb government 15
kilometers east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Bildt arrived in Pale from Belgrade, where he held talks with
Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia's Serbian Republic, in
a fresh effort to unseat Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
Without giving details of his meeting with Milosevic, Bildt
warned that Karadzic's refusal to step down before the planned
Bosnian elections was "dangerous for the future of Republika
Srpska (the Serb entity)."
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Serb parliament was to to meet later today.
</P>
<P>
The West has insisted Karadzic should step down under the
Dayton peace agreement, because of his indictment by the U.N. War
Crimes Tribunal in The Hague for war crimes committed in the war.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace pact provides for Karadzic's ouster and bans
him from running public office.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu told visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher he will renew peace talks with Arab neighbors, but he
refrained from committing himself to the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, after meeting Christopher for over two hours this
afternoon, told a joint news conference that he would resume
peace negotiations with Syrian, Lebanon and other Arab states and
the Palestinian Authority (PA) without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
But he conditioned the progress in Israeli-Arab peace talks on
the fight against terrorism to meet the "security needs" of the
Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister said: "We received a clear mandate from
our people, who want peace and security. We have to underline
that terrorism is incompatible with the advancement toward
peace."
</P>
<P>
Christopher, arriving here this morning as the first senior
U.S. official since Netanyahu's May 29 election victory, said that
he and Netanyahu held "useful" discussions on a wide-range of
issues.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the importance of maintaining what he called
"unshakable," special, friendly and strategic relationship between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirmed the central importance of (bilateral) strategic
relationship between the United States and Israel, and our
commitments to maintain friendship between our two nations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher said that the prime goals of his visit are to
prepare for Netanyahu's first official visit to Washington, due
on July 9, and emphasize the commitments to continue pursuing
peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Netanyahu focused special attention on the
Israeli-Arab peace process, saying the bilateral talks will
continue during the latter's scheduled meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton in July.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging the achievements made in the Israeli-Arab
peace process in the past years, Christopher said that "enemies of
the peace still abound," hence the need to combat
terrorism.

However, Netanyahu refrained from committing to the principle
of land-for-peace which has been the basis of the ongoing peace
process and endorsed by the Arab countries as well as the United
States.
</P>
<P>
On the thorny issue of Israeli troops pullout from Hebron,
Netanyahu said that he was studying carefully the complicated
problem before he would make a decision.
</P>
<P>
Hebron pullout, required under the Israeli-Palestinian Oslo
accords, is regarded as a test of Netanyahu's promise of
continuing the peace process. Israel should have completed the
withdrawal in late March, which was delayed because of a series of
suicide bombing attacks by Islamic militants from February to
March.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would meet Palestinian Authority (PA) President
Yasser Arafat, Netanyahu stressed the PA should prove its
capability to fight terrorism in order to achieve progress in the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He said he has opened several channels of contacts with the PA,
adding "if it is essential to the security of Israeli people, I
would consider it." In the past, Netanyahu claimed that he
refused to talk to Arafat.

Christopher is to hold further talks with Netanyahu and Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy, before flying to Cairo Wednesday,
where he will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
and Arafat to discuss the current situation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is here in an urgent mission to ensure the
continuation of the Middle East peace process, now overshadowed
by the change of the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, widely perceived as a hardliner, has clearly ruled
out any compromise on the status of Jerusalem, the establishment
of a Palestinian state and the return of the Golan Heights to
Syria, although he has called on the Arab neighbors to hold talks
with him without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
The victory by Netanyahu has alarmed both the Arab world and
the U.S., which did not conceal its preference for a win by
Netanyahu's rival and former Premier Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Peres, like his slain predecessor Yitzhak Rabin, has fostered
a close personal relationship with both U.S. President Clinton
and Christopher in his quest of peace with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Washington hoped that Peres' reelection would accelerate the
pace of peace process which will lead to a lasting, comprehensive
peace in the region, where it has vital strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Arab world could not wait till Netanyahu
officially assumed his office in arranging several bilateral,
multilateral summit meetings aimed at urging Netanyahu to continue
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Last week, leaders 21 Arab countries held the first Arab summit
in six years in Cairo to discuss Arab solidarity and the peace
process, and issued a warning that they would reconsider their
stance toward Israel if the new Israeli government deviates from
the land-for-peace principle on which the peace process was built.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu denounced the Arab summit for "setting
preconditions" for the peace negotiations, saying "peace should
not be made hostage to prior conditions."

<HEADLINE> France Gears Up for Atlanta Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- France has been gearing up for the
Olympic Games in Atlanta by dispatching 320 or 330 athletes to
compete in 21 or 22 out of the 26 sports in the centenary games,
officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They will compete in the track and field, rowing, boxing,
canoe, cycling, equestrian, fencing, soccer, gymnastics, handball,
weightlifting, judo, wrestling, swimming, modern pentathlon,
tennis, table tennis, shooting, archery, yachting and beach
volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Yet, their preparation work started in June 1994 when France
sent its inspection team to tour the competition venues in
Atlanta, and even requested French to be one of the official
languages in the games.
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, France is not to be considered as a sport power and
still not ready to compete against the United States, Russia and
Germany, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1988 Seoul Games, France ranked 10th in the tally with
16 medals including six golds, and jumped to the seventh spot four
years later in Barcelona on 29 medals including eight golds.
</P>
<P>
The gold medals for France in Barcelona were from their
traditional sports of fencing, yachting, equestrain and judo.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, they also hoped to make breakthrough in cycling,
canoe and handball.
</P>
<P>
Aiming to encourage its athletes to win medals in the games,
the French Olympic Committee offers 250,000 francs (50,000 US
dollars) for the gold medalist, with the second-placer getting
120,000 francs (24,000 US dollars) and the bronze medalist bagging
80,000 francs (some 16,000 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes 170 Tons of Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that it
confiscated 170 tons of narcotics in the last Iranian calendar
year ending on March 19 and is to burn 28 tons Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said at a press
conference that Iran will make further efforts in the
anti-narcotics battle across the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is ready to sign agreements or memorandums of
understanding with countries in the Persian Gulf and the Central
Asia in a joint effort to stop the flow of drugs.
</P>
<P>
"We have signed MOU with many countries in Europe such as
France, Greece and Spain and some countries in the region,
including Pakistan and Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran will soon sign an agreement with Qatar for
the cooperation in the anti-narcotic drive.
</P>
<P>
Drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems of
Iran since it is one of the best transit for drug to Europe and
is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area between
Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest drug-producing
center in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were caught
with more than 30 grams of heroine or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, Iran has executed some 4,000 drug
traffickers since 1988 and there are still 12,500 foreign
smugglers in the Iranian jails.

<HEADLINE> UK Women Lead a Harder Life than Their EU Counterparts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- British women are working harder,
divorcing more frequently and dying younger than any of their
counterparts in Western Europe, according to a survey of the
latest European statistics published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by Market Assessment Publications,
shows that while British women marry at the youngest age, on
average at 25.6 years, compared with 26.1 in France and 25.9
across the European Union (EU), they have the highest number of
break-ups.
</P>
<P>
Four in every seven British marriages end in divorce compared
with an EU average of one in three. This is why Britain has the
highest level of one-parent families in the EU, with 14 percent of
children being brought up by one adult, compared with an EU
average of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
British women tend either to have more children than in any
other country or, in larger numbers than anywhere else, to have no
children at all.
</P>
<P>
They now enjoy the highest fertility rate in the EU of 1.75
children per woman. However, 39 percent of British couples are
childless compared with an EU average of 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even in education British women appear worse off, being less
likely to go to university than women in any other major European
nation except Germany.
</P>
<P>
British women have the lowest life expectancy at 79 years
compared to 81.4 in France, 81 in Spain and the EU average of 79.4
years.
</P>
<P>
The employment statistics show that British women are easily
the most likely to have a job. Compared with an EU average of 55.2
percent in work, in Britain 65.9 percent have a job.
</P>
<P>
The figures suggest that the battle for women's rights in
Britain is far from won.
</P>
<P>
Steve Cordingley, a spokesman for Market Assessment
Publications, said: "It does appear that women in Britain have had
the worst deal from feminism in the last 10 years".

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Install More Telephones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Transport and
Communications Abdul Mejid Hussein said today the Ethiopian
telecommunications authority has finalized preparations to
install 420,000 telephone lines in the coming three years.
</P>
<P>
In his report delivered to the House of the People's
Representatives or parliament, the minister said the authority in
the last century has installed only 165,000 telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are only three telephones per 1,000
inhabitants in the country which is very low even compared with
the standard in the rest of Africa.
</P>
<P>
The demand for telephone lines is fast growing in Ethiopia.
There are about 147,000 applicants waiting to install telephone
lines, 107,000 of whom are in Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Minister Abdul Mejid said in his report that clients at one
time were forced to pay about 3,000 Birr (about 476 dollars) to
get a telephone service and that this practice has now been
halted thanks to the efforts made by the authority's trade union.
</P>
<P>
He said the purchase of appliances is underway to implement
the expansion of telephones to 159 towns in rural areas of
various states.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Failures Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Fresh evidence of the slowdown in
the UK business sector emerged Monday after a credit insurer said
that business failures had risen for the first time in four years.
</P>
<P>
According to Trade Indemnity, one of the UK's largest credit
insurers, business failures and bad debts rose by six percent
between the first quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996.
This was the first year-on-year rise since 1992 and followed
several quarters of significant decreases.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that most failures occurred in the wholesale
and retailing sector, with 245 in the last quarter, slightly up on
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The building and construction sector recorded 235 failures in
the first quarter, again higher than a year before. In the
engineering and metals sector 119 companies were reported as bad
debtors or business failures, a slight improvement. In the general
service sector the proportion was 125, markedly higher than a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The data showed that the north-west had the sharpest increase
in failures, 22 percent on the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the level of business failures is still far lower than
it was between 1991 and 1993. The current level is comparable to
that during the boom of 1989. Nevertheless, the change in the
trend is likely to fuel fears that the recent slowdown in
manufacturing will affect a range of businesses.
</P>
<P>
Although recent business surveys have shown that companies have
become markedly more gloomy, until recently it appeared that many
manufacturers did not expect such a sharp slowdown.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Sees Three Messages From Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz said here today there are three messages coming from the
Arab summit in Cairo: Arab solidarity, the Arabs' commitment to
the peace process and their opposition to terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, the Lebanese
foreign minister said that the first message sent out by the
summit was "the unity of the Arab ranks which constitutes a cover
for any peace decision and from which any peace process will
benefit."
</P>
<P>
The second message is the Arab commitment to the peace process
from which they will never retreat, Boueiz said, noting that the
Arabs are committed only to a peace process "different from what
the (new) Israeli government suggested."
</P>
<P>
The third message from the summit is that the Arabs are against
terrorism and are ready to do anything against it on condition
that a distinction should be drawn between terrorism and the
legitimate resistance on the occupied lands, he added.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz described the atmosphere of the Arab summit which ended
Sunday as "rational and positive."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on reactions of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and his foreign minister, David Levy, to the Arab
summit, Boueiz said, "in line with the Israeli gauges, anything
different from a full surrender is negative."
</P>
<P>
Reacting to a communique issued by Arab leaders at the end of
their summit in Cairo, Netanyahu rejected Arab demands to give up
more land and dismantle Jewish settlements, meanwhile Levy said
that Israel "does not accept Arab dictates."
</P>
<P>
The Arab summit, prompted by the latest radical developments
in the region especially the recent change in the Israeli
government, was the first in six years and it was attended by
leaders of 21 Arab countries except Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab position was very clear in the summit by announcing
their commitment to the peace process based on the principles
determined (in the 1991 peace conference) in Madrid," the Lebanese
official added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the United States to pressure Israel to stick to
the land-for-peace principle.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The state of child health in
Zambia has improved in the past years, said Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba here today.
</P>
<P>
In commemorating the Day of the African Child, Chiluba said
that over 80 percent of the children in the country had ben
immunized against the major infant killer diseases and at least
another 80 percent of children under two years were receiving
adequate Vitamin A and 40 percent hospitals had achieved the
baby-friendly status of exclusive breast-feeding for six months.
</P>
<P>
The immediate challenge that laid ahead of the government in
health was to eradicate polio from Zambia for ever, Chiluba said,
the first round of the polio immunization program by the Ministry
of Health would be launched in July and would be spread across
the country to ensure complete success.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged all parents to take advantage of the program and
immunize their children against polio.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chiluba stressed the need to fully eradicate
malnutrition in both rural and urban areas, to improve education
and to provide safe and clean drinking water and access to good
sanitation.

<HEADLINE> ABSA To Reduce Interest, Home Loan Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Amalgamated Banks of South
Africa (ABSA) today announced the group will reduce its interest and
home loan rates by one percent from July 1.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg, an ABSA spokesman said the
prime rate will drop from its present 20.5 percent to 19.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
ABSA consists of United Bank, Trust Bank, Volkskas and Allied
Bank.
</P>
<P>
ABSA said the reduction has been made possible by the easing and
''an expectation of further softening'' of money market conditions.
</P>
<P>
Other considerations have been the stabilization of the local
currency Rand and the ''favourable reception of the government's
economic policy'' in South Africa and abroad, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, no other leading South African banks are able to say
whether they will follow ABSA's lead thus far.
</P>
<P>
On May 20, South Africa's four banking groups, including ABSA,
announced a one percent increase in lending and home loan rates
following one percent increase by the Reserve Bank on April 29.

<HEADLINE> Moussa: Netanyahu's Remarks Necessitate Arabs' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks
today necessitate concern which the Arabs feel about the future of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talk about resuming Arab-Israeli negotiations
without preconditions refers to Israel's attempt to go back on the
principles of the Middle East peace process, which were agreed
upon at the 1991 Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said at a joint press conference with visiting
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Jerusalem today that
he will renew peace talks with Israel's Arab neighbors, but he
refrained from committing himself to the principle of exchanging
occupied Arab land for peace.
</P>
<P>
He also conditioned the progress in Israeli-Arab peace talks on
the fight against terrorism to meet the "security needs" of the
Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described Netanyahu's stance as a "negative tendency" on
the part of Israel, saying that it will be discussed in detail
during a meeting between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Christopher in Cairo Wednesday, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Also in Cairo Wednesday, Christopher will meet with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to discuss Israel's withdrawal from the West
Bank town of Hebron and the resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli
final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Welcomes Former Generals'Letter to Truth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The acceptance of
responsibility for past human rights offences by leading former
government members will ease the task of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, President Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to reports that a group of former security force
generals are prepared to take responsibility for some violations,
Mandela told reporters in Pretoria: ''I am sure many people will
welcome the initiative taken by the generals,'' said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there was an advantage in political
organisations and members of former government going to the truth
commission and saying: ''We take responsibility for having
adopted this policy and instructing those who were working under
us to commit these offences.''
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the truth commission, those generals, including
former Police Commissioner Van Der Merwe, said they will accept
''collective responsibility'' for 20 human rights violations
during the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the African National Congress (ANC) also welcomed
the generals' aproach to the truth commission, saying such a move
will contribute towards healing the nation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg, the ANC reiterated its
appeal to all former security force members with knowledge of
human rights violations to come forward with the information.
</P>
<P>
''We urge them to make a decisive break with the past and make
use of the opportunity which the commission provides,'' said the
statement.

<P>
CAIRO, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An official Jordanian delegation
will go to Kuwait on July 10 to prepare for the reopening of the
Jordanian Embassy in Kuwait, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
(MENA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first such visit by an official delegation of
Jordan since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Jordan refused to join the U.S.-led coalition against Iraq in
1990. But, Jordanian King Hussein said his country's stance in the
1990-1991 Gulf crisis was "mis-interpreted."
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the Jordanian Embassy in Kuwait coincides with
the resumption of air traffic between the two countries and with
the prospect for the return of Jordanian workforce in Kuwait, MENA
said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has asked its labor minister to
contact the Kuwait government and examine the possibility of the
return of the Jordanian workers, the news agency said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua)--The leaders of the G-7 industrial
nations will focus their 22nd Summit discussions on the global
economic growth, international situation and assistance for
world's poor countries, the French Presidential spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna said here today.
</P>
<P>
While announcing at a press briefing held at the Presidential
palace, Colonna said, the 3-day meeting from June 27 to 29 in Lyon

affairs. The participants will take the globalization as their
semi-conductor line in their economic issue consultations.
</P>
<P>
France held that the economic globalization has brought both
negative and positive results, the spokeswoman stated. Noticing
its positive impact on technical development and innovation as
well as giving a big push for economic liberalization and growth,
it is also posing a threat for those nations which have failed to
catch up with the global development pace and increasingly
competitive world market, and thus creating unemployment and
economic growth slowering down.
</P>
<P>
According to the French official, the key issue on the Lyon
Summit agenda is how to effectively control and reduce the
globalization's impact on employment, financing stability,
international trade and assistance programs for world's poor
nations. The Lyon Summit will adopt an economic communique for
success of the economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman noted that leaders of the United States,
Britain, Germany, France, Canada, Italy, Japan and Russia will
take part in the political consultations, concentrating on issues
of Bosnia, Russia, the Middle-East peace process, peaceful
utilization of nuclear power generation, environmental protection,
combat against drug trafficking and terrorism. At the conclusion
of the meeting, a political statement will be adopted.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the participants are scheduled to hold working
meetings over assistance and development issues with leaders of
the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the spokeswoman said.

Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
"He will be making stops in Zagreb, Belgrade and Sarajevo
before joining the secretary (of state Warren Christopher) at Lyon
for the G-7 summit," Department spokesman Glyn Davies told a press
briefing here.
</P>
<P>
Davies disclosed that the U.S. Bosnia envoy "will be going to

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering to expand its military drills in Australia to include
large-scale amphibious exercises, the U.S. Defense Secretary
William Perry said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He was revealing the U.S. plan at the Pentagon when entering
talks on the issue with Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
"There is much more space than there is in any other base that
we have access to in the western Pacific," he said.
</P>
<P>
The plan was proposed by Gen Charles Krulak, commandant of the
Marine Corps, who has suggested U.S. and Australia to bolster the
drill by including mock assault training with amphibious craft.
</P>
<P>
The largest military facilities the Pentagon has access to in
the western Pacific are in Okinawa, Japan and in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
But the space on Okinawa is limited and does not allow for
large amphibious assault training while such kind of maneuvers are
prevented to conduct in South Korea as are possible to give rise
to tension in the Korean Peninsula, said an observer.
</P>
<P>
Australia has thousands of miles of beaches and many are
uninhabited, ideal for amphibious assault training, a Pentagon
official said.

AZRAQ, JORDAN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian-U.S. joint
military exercises which started in mid-April concluded today in
Azraq Air Base, 100 kilometers north of the capital city of Amman.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Domestic Savings Remain Low: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The level of savings in
South Africa remained low in the first quarter of 1996, placing
pressure on the ability of the economy to fund further
investment, said the Reserve Bank's quarterly bulletin released
here today.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the bulletin, the ratio of domestic savings to
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) remained on the low level of 16.5
percent in the first three months of the year, marginally below
the savings level in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The poor overall savings level of the economy was largely due
to low personal savings and dissaving by the government, said the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, South Africa had had to rely on foreign funds to
finance a gap of 11 percent between domestic savings and
investment.
</P>
<P>
However, the ratio of personal savings to personal disposable
income remained virtually unchanged at only one percent.
</P>
<P>
As a result of rapid rise in current expenditure, the ratio of
net dissaving by the government to GDP also remained virtually
unchanged at 3.5 percent during that period, said the bulletin.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sticks to Railway Pact With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Railway Corporation
will not go back on the decision to involve Chinese experts in
the revitalisation of the country's rail system, company
officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
the federal government has taken a lot of factors into
consideration before it finally decided to settle for the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
All the countries that lobbied for the contract, including the
United States, India and Pakistan, expressed strong desire to
win, but only China offered to give full assistance at a very
cheap rate, they said.
</P>
<P>
''Apart from the price factor,'' they said, ''China has
qualified experts who can really change the nation's rail
system''.
</P>
<P>
Since Nigeria signed a 30-month agreement with China on
December 5, 1995, for the revitalisation of the country's rail
system, the federal government has come under severe criticism
from the public who wondered why Nigeria has to seek assistance
from another third world country, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigeria representative office of the China
Civil Engineering Construction Corporation, which is in charge of
the project in Nigeria, there are now more than 200 Chinese
experts working in Nigeria. So far, they have completed the
survey of 3,205 km of the rail network, leaving only 300 km.
</P>
<P>
They are currently undertaking the design and re-alignment of
the rail tracks.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Chinese will supply the Nigerian
Railway Corporation 50 locomotives, 400 wagons and 150 coaches.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Mine Workers to Apply For S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A large number of migrant
Lesotho mine workers working in South Africa are seeking
permanent residence in the country, the South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted Radio Lesotho in Maseru as saying that the
Department of Home Affairs in Pretoria was processing about
15,200 applications from Lesotho citizens, and more than 16,000
applications had already been approved.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Lesotho citizens working in South Africa were
offered permanent residence status in the republic, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
It is also believed that more Lesotho mine workers would opt
for permanent residence in South Africa because the mountain
kingdom's economy was ''inextricably interwoven with the South
African economy'', and the tiny kingdom was heavily dependent on
South Africa for employment, particularly in the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
According to the Lesotho Bureau of Statistics, more lesothos
had been employed in South Africa's mining industry than in all
of its own formal sector.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Urges Spanish Businessmen to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin today called on the Spanish businessmen to invest in China,
especially in its central and western parts.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with local entrepreneurs and financiers this
afternoon, Jiang said Sino-Spanish economic and trade cooperation
has laid a solid basis for developing friendly ties between the
two countries in all fields, and he was satisfied with the good
momentum of the development of bilateral economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"With your help and efforts, the past few years have witnessed
rapid development of economic cooperation between the two
countries," he told the local business and financial leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said the investment environment in China has been greatly
improved in the past 15 years and Spanish entrepreneurs have
gained some experience in their access to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Jiang also urged Spanish businessmen to seek
cooperation opportunities in central and western China and hoped
they can catch chances.
</P>
<P>
"I believe with the support of the governments and efforts of
entrepreneurs of the two countries, bilateral economic cooperation
will be raised to a new level," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also noted that the development of economic
cooperation between China and Spain on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit has vast vistas as the two countries are
complementary in economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Spain possesses advanced industrial technology and good
management while China has a vast market, abundant human and
natural resources and multilateral requirement," the president
explained.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Spanish Entrepreneurs' Association
Jose Maria Cuevas said at the meeting that President Jiang's
meeting with Spanish entrepreneurs today indicates the fact that
China attaches great importance to the cooperation between
industrial circles of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Praising China's economic achievements in recent years, Cuevas
said China's success in economic restructuring offers many
opportunities and good conditions for the cooperation between the
two countries' entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
"Such cooperation is an important element in strengthened
bilateral relations, which cannot be neglected," he said, adding
that Spanish industrialists and businessmen have made remarkable
contributions.
</P>
<P>
"We are not only attentive to economic and trade cooperation
with China's coastal areas, but also willing to develop
collaboration with other regions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Madrid strongly supports its entrepreneurs'
participation in China's economic construction, while Beijing is
active in facilitating their cooperation with Chinese partners.
</P>
<P>
"All these are invaluable to the entrepreneurs in the two
countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
In order to sum up the experiences of cooperation and explore
new frontiers, the Spanish Entrepreneurs' Association will send a
delegation to China soon, Cuevas said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the upcoming visit will enable Spanish entrepreneurs
to know more about China's rapid growing economy and to find more
opportunities for cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said China's membership in the World Trade Organization is
very important to the development of world economy. He pledged
Spanish entrepreneurs' determined support for China's entry into
the WTO as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 Spanish business and financial leaders attended
the meeting with the Chinese president who is in Madrid on a
four-day state visit to Spain. Jiang will leave for Oslo, Norway,
Thursday to continue his six European and central Asian nation
tour, which will also take him to Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz and
Kazakhstan.

<HEADLINE> Australian Parliament Passes Labor Market Reform Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian coalition
government has pushed ahead its radical labor market reform when
the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment bill was
passed in parliament tonight.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by the House of Representatives after time
allotted for the bill's consideration expired tonight.
</P>
<P>
The bill, the founding block of the government's proposed plan
to liberalize the labor market, features greater flexibility for
employers to sign individual contract with employees and
limitation of trade unions' role in enterprise bargaining.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Labor Party tried to block the bill in the lower
house by preparing 335 amendments, including an amendment to the
objects clause. However, the government foiled Labor's attempt by
setting time limit for debate on the bill. The Labor was able to
raise only one of its 335 amendments for debate today.
</P>
<P>
The government made two major amendments to the bill, including
a state agreement on overriding federal awards and part-time
worker provisions.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith said that the
government would consider several of Labor's amendments when the
bill was studied by a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that many of Labor's amendments aimed to maintain the
status quo of the employment system and that the government did
not support them.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Labor Party said the party was disappointed
that the government gagged the debate on its amendments.
</P>
<P>
Labor MP Martin Ferguson said that the bill would rip apart the
texture of fairness at Australian workplaces and harm low-income
people such as women, migrants, young people, rural and casual
workers.
</P>
<P>
The bill was sent to a Senate committee for a report on August
22 and public hearings on the bill will begin next week.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to meet strong opposition in the Senate,
where non-government parties hold the majority. However, the Labor
will have to obtain the support of the Australian Democrats and
other independent members in the Senate to sink the bill.

<HEADLINE> Space Probe Galileo Closes In On Jupiter's Biggest Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Spacecraft Galileo will close
in on Jupiter's biggest moon Ganymede early Thursday morning to
gather the most detailed information ever obtained about the icy
satellite, according to a NASA report.
</P>
<P>
Equipped with 10 scientific instruments, Galileo, the 2.5-ton
unmanned probe launched in October 1989, will fly only 840
kilometers above Ganymede's surface at 2:29 a.m. Eastern
Daylight-Saving Time (EDT), or 0629 GMT Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Galileo will return high-resolution images showing features on
Ganymede as small as 10 meters across. It will also assess the
moon's surface chemistry and search for signs of an atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
If Galileo's operations and the subsequent transmission of data
to Earth occur as planned, NASA said, selected images of Ganymede
will be released in a televised news conference on July 10.
</P>
<P>
Galileo's Ganymede encounter marks the start of a steady stream
of data to be returned to Earth throughout its two-year tour of
the Jovian system. The data return will include an average of two
to three images per day before December 1997, NASA said.
</P>
<P>
Galileo's other studies will include a search for auroral
activity on Jupiter's nightside and observations of other Jovian
moons, such as Io, Europa and Callisto.
</P>
<P>
With a diameter of 5,230 kilometers, Ganymede is the largest
satellite in the solar system -- bigger than Mercury and about
three-fourths the size of Mars. It has a variety of Earth-like
geological formations and is believed to be about half water-ice
and half rock.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable Goods Orders At Record High in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories for
durable goods surged by 3.3 percent in May to the highest level on
record, a report from the Commerce Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders of durable goods totaled a
seasonally adjusted 171.8 billion U.S. dollars in May, up from
166.3 billion in April and the highest since the government began
tracking durable goods orders in 1958.
</P>
<P>
The increase was the steepest since a 5.1 percent advance last
August and the latest sign of a rebounding manufacturing sector in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Orders are considered a key gauge of the manufacturing sector,
and an increase could lead to greater production and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The report said much of the May gain was in orders for aircraft
that boosted transportation bookings by 12.2 percent, the second
increase in three months. Transportation orders had fallen 12.1
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
But excluding the volatile transportation sector, orders rose
0.7 percent, the fifth increase in the last six months. The 129
billion dollars in non-transportation orders also was the highest
on record.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders increased 0.3 percent, the
eighth gain in nine months. A growing backlog suggests businesses
may require additional production facilities and manpower to meet
demand.
</P>
<P>
Shipments, a measure of current activity, rose 1.9 percent
following a 2.1 percent increase in April.
</P>
<P>
U.S. manufacturing was weak for several months late last year
and earlier this year. The latest reports show that it is
rebounding quickly, including solid gains in industrial production
in April and May.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India Discuss Water Resources Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop opened here
today to discuss sustainable ways to develop water resources in
Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, jointly organized by Nepal's Water and Energy
Commission and India's Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI), is
attended by nearly 50 government officials and experts from the
two neighboring countries in a bid to work out policy options for
healthy development of hydro-electricity.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the workshop today, Nepali Water Resources
Minister Pashupati Shumshere J.B. Rana said Nepal is committed to
harnessing its water resources through implementing either big or
small projects.
</P>
<P>
He said a developing country with vast water resources like
Nepal could focus on economic development through developing and
exporting hydro-electricity.
</P>
<P>
He called on India's cooperation in Nepal's water resources
development on the basis of mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to a TERI official, India is facing an acute shortage
of power supply and its domestic resources could not meet the
growing demand of power.
</P>
<P>
India will need 118,000 megawatts of electricity in the next 10
years while Nepal has the potential to meet the supply deficit by
exporting its hydro-electricity to India, Indian Ambassador K.V.
Rajan said at the workshop.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indian envoy, India at present utilized around
23 percent of its hydropower potential, while Nepal only harnessed
less than one percent of its 83,000-megawatt potential.

<P>
YANGZHOU, Jiangsu Province, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese men
paddlers will spare no effort to bring home both the singles and
doubles gold medals, head coach Cai Zhenhua said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cai, who led his squad to a clean sweep in the 43rd World Table
Tennis Tournament in Tianjin last May, said his disciples have
kept up with their European peers with the great efforts over the
past years and even enjoyed an upper hand for "they are younger."
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, China will line up world champions Wang Tao, Kong
Linghui, Liu Guo Liang and Lu Lin to the Olympics, with Wang,
Kong, Liu vying for the singles title.
</P>
<P>
Liu and Kong, with defending champion Wang and Lu, will fight
for the doubles trophy which was won by China in the Seoul 1988
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Although China failed to win the men's singles title in both
the Seoul and Barcelona games, there is a chance for China to make
a breakthrough in Atlanta after Kong's triumph in Tianjin last
year, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
However, the harvest in Tianjin was achieved on a home
advantage, said Cai who hoped the newly-crowned paddlers should be
mentally ready and make more efforts to achieve the feats.

<HEADLINE> India Fighting Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian Welfare Minister B.S.
Ramoowalia today said that his ministry has adopted a
community-based approach towards prevention of the drug abuse with
the participation of non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
In his message on the International Day Against Drug Abuse and
Illicit Trafficking, he said that his ministry was committed to
fighting the menace, but it would require support of all sections
of the community.
</P>
<P>
The minister said drug abuse was no longer confined to any
cultural or socio-economic strata of the society and another
serious problem was the growing incidence of HIV/AIDS cases among
drug users.
</P>
<P>
"This is eating into the vitals of our youths, destroying their
productive life and seriously impairing the social and economic
fabric as well as prosperity of the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse in India, especially in the northeast areas, is
witnessing an increasing trend. According to figures available
from an NGO, India had 290,628 substantial users in 1993-94. India
has been used as a trade route for drug smuggling and drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government, with the help of 278 NGOs, has set up

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan plays an important
role in maintaining peace and stability in Central Asia, according
to Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali expressed support for Kazakhstan President
Nursultan Nazarbayev's proposal that an international conference
should be convened to build trust among Asian countries, the
Kazakhstan Telegraph Agency quoted the U.N. chief as saying in an
exclusive interview with the agency in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Asia needs an effective and reliable security structure that
conforms to the interests of all Asian countries, Boutros-Ghali
said.
</P>
<P>
The continent currently has no mechanism to coordinate diverse
security interests, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. is committed to providing economic
assistance to its new member states -- former republics of the
Soviet Union -- which are carrying out economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. should also help those republics to resolve their
disputes through peaceful negotiations and support their political
independence and territorial integrity, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.N. will seek close cooperation with the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general also said that the reform of the United
Nations is aimed at revitalizing the international organization. A
reformed U.N. will pay more attention to safeguarding the
interests of medium-sized and small countries, he added.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the Chinese government attaches great importance
to economic relations with Spain, which is the cornerstone in
building long-term, stable and cooperative ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar this
evening, Jiang said that although China and Spain differ in social
system, cultural tradition and economic development level, they
can push their relations forward steadily if the two sides abide
by the principles of seeking common ground while reserving
differences, strengthening cooperation, equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that China and Spain must handle their relations from
the high plane of strategy and have their eyes on the 21st
century. We are willing, together with Spain, to forge long-term,
stable and mutually beneficial cooperative relations between the
two countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived here Monday for a four-day state
visit to Spain, the first leg of his current six European and
central Asian nation tour which will also take him to Norway,
Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhastan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Spain has played a more and more important role in
the international arena these years and China and Spain have
shared identical or similar views on many major international
issues.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Spanish government will make new efforts in
promoting friendly relations between the two countries in all
domains, thus raising bilateral cooperation to a new level both in
depth and width," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also noted the Chinese and Spanish economies are
complementary to each other with huge potential remaining to be
tapped. "We hope that both sides will make joint efforts to
explore and probe new domains and ways in cooperation to further
enhance economic and trade relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Spain, President Jiang has held talks with
Spanish parliament leaders and met with local business and
financial leaders.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Hails Arab Summit as 'Positive and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan praised today
the two-day Arab summit held in Cairo last weekend as "positive
and promising," saying it has opened the way for new Arab meetings.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an inauguration ceremony of a military course for
senior army officers, the king said Jordan's participation in the
summit embodied its conviction and solid belief in the unity of
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
It was the first public comment by the monarch on the Arab
summit since he returned to the kingdom from the Cairo summit on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's position during the two-day meeting was "principled,
sincere and clear as it has always been," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The king pointed out Jordan is in favor of the Arab nation's
unity and supports all its national issues.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Jordan's position of not interfering in the
internal affairs of any Arab country, stressing at the same time
that no one would be allowed to meddle in its affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he told Arab leaders at the summit Jordan backed a
comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the international
legitimacy and the principle of land-for-peace.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the peace process has covered a long stride
on the path of a final settlement, noting that the process should
continue and that all parties should demonstrate their commitment
to what has been agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
On Iraq, the king said that its conditions will not allow
it to take part in the recent Arab gathering, adding that
he was looking forward to seeing Iraq overcoming its current
difficulties and getting rid of all reasons of its suffering.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges G7 to Give More Aid to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called on western leaders attending Friday's G7 summit in
Lyons, France, to pledge more aid to the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told reporters that industrialized powers should realize
that it is their duty to channel more assistance to the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to do his utmost to press his counterparts from the
Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized nations -- the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Canada and Britain, Italy -- into
digging deeper into their pockets.
</P>
<P>
Aid from Western nations has been on the decline for two years
running, a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) said in early June.
</P>
<P>
Last year, developed countries within the OECD provided 59
billion U.S. dollars in aid to the developing ones, 9.3 percent
less than in 1994, which was already 8 percent down on 1993.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette in a speech to the
National Assembly notably criticized the United States for its
continued slashing of its foreign aid program.
</P>
<P>
The United States, offering only 7.3 billion dollars of aid
last year, made the deepest cut in its foreign aid program.
</P>
<P>
France was the second largest aid donor among all Western
nations with a 8.4 billion dollar program in 1995, following Japan
which provided 14.5 billion dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China and Portugal today signed a
summary of talks on four air agreements concerning Macao and four
nations.
</P>
<P>
The summary was signed here at the two-day 26th session of the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG), which started today.
The air transportation agreements were reached between Macao with
the Republic of Korea, Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
Guo Jiading, chief representative of the Chinese team on the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, told reporters that a number of important
issues were also discussed at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We have always taken the three major issues -- the
localization of civil servants, the localization of law and the
use of Chinese as a standard language -- as the most important
questions for Macao's transitional period," he said. "The issues
should be resolved at a faster pace."
</P>
<P>
Guo said that although some progress has been made in the three
issues, it still lags far behind the requirements for a smooth
handover of power in 1999, which is only three and half years
away.
</P>
<P>
"The resolving of these issues should be stepped up," he
stressed. "Concrete measures should be taken so that substantial
progress can be achieved."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the so-called "Oriental Foundation," an organ
diverting money from Macao to Portugal, Guo said that China's
position on this matter has never changed and a flexible and
pragmatic proposal has been made.
</P>
<P>
"There are some disparities between the Chinese proposal and
the proposal from the Portuguese side," he said. "We hope that we
can reach a common stand through friendly cooperation and mutual
respect."
</P>
<P>
Antonio Santana Carlos, chief representative of the Portuguese
team on the Sino-Portuguese JLG, said that resolving the three
major issues is in the interest of both sides.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the two sides can continue consultation on the
issues so that a stable transition period of Macao will appear
before 1999," said Carlos.

<P>
Christopher came here after his one-day visit to Israel, where
he held a three-hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin

BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Haiji, director of the Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Education
Commission, said that his office invited more than 1,100 people
from Hong Kong last year, and sent 2,300 people from the
universities directly under the SEC to Hong Kong for academic
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches importance to visits by people

A large number of teachers, students and people from education
circles in Hong Kong have also come to the mainland for camping
holidays and get-togethers.
</P>
<P>
With the educational exchanges, the number of students from
Hong Kong coming to the mainland to study is on the rise. The

Macao and Taiwan has increased to 64, from only seven colleges in
1985. There were nearly a thousand students from Hong Kong
studying in mainland colleges at the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Takes Steps to Check Drug Abuse: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
fully aware of the problem of drug abuse and trafficking and has
provided the necessary legal and administrative framework to
control them, Interior Minister Nasirullah Babar said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a function on the occasion of the International Day
against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, he said that with the
financial assistance of UN organizations, the Narcotics Control
Division of the government has prepared a comprehensive master
plan for drug abuse control in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
This plan, he said, is intended to provide clear direction to
the government's policies and efforts aimed at eradication of
drugs from the country.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the efforts of the Narcotics Control Division
and advised them not to content with the measures already taken
but to think of what further steps are required.
</P>
<P>
"We need to inject far more dynamism in our policies and
efforts not only to contain the spread of drug abuse but to
realize the ultimate objective of creating a drug free human
society," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Secretary of the Narcotics Control Board Muhammad
Afzal Kahut said that Pakistan will have a fifth successive annual
decline in opium poppy cultivation in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He added that there was an area of 80,500 acres under poppy
cultivation in Pakistan and a production of 800 tons in 1979 when
the problem first surfaced, the poppy-cultivated area in 1994-95
in the country had been reduced to 12,886 acres and the estimated
yield of opium to 110 tons.

<HEADLINE> Christopher: Both Israelis, Arabs Committed to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said here today that both Israelis and the Arabs are
committed to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Both Israelis and the Arabs have made a fundamental commitment
to peace," said Christopher following his meetings with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. The
meetings focused on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Arafat and Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, Christopher said efforts must be made to
implement the Palestinian-Israeli agreements.
</P>
<P>
"We must all work to preserve, implement agreements that have
been already reached between the Palestinians and Israelis," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he told Mubarak and Arafat that Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu "understands his obligation to honor all
agreements."
</P>
<P>
"He wants to development good working relations with the
Palestinians," he added. "He intends to take proper steps in this
direction."
</P>
<P>
Arafat told the press conference that Israel should "fulfill
and implement all what has been agreed upon and signed."
</P>
<P>
He affirmed the Palestinians' commitment to the peace process
and said that Israel should also have such a commitment.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who was criticized by Egypt's state-run press
today for what it called acting solely in the interests of Israel,
said the United States would "continue to maintain the positions
that go back to the the Madrid (peace) conference" in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has had a policy, and continues to have a
policy of land-for-peace," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the most important for realizing peace is
hard work.
</P>
<P>
"Generalities don't produce peace agreements, what produce
peace agreements are the difficult negotiations between the
parties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa described the meetings between Mubarak and Christopher
and between Arafat and Christopher as "fruitful" and "important."
</P>
<P>
He said that the peace process still needs the United States to
be an honest and fair mediator.
</P>
<P>
"We all need the role of the United States as an honest broker,
a fair mediator in the peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak did not speak to reporters after his meeting with
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said upon arrival in Cairo this morning that Israel
should abide by all the agreements signed with the Palestinians
and stop building or expanding settlements on the Palestinian
territories.
</P>
<P>
"Among those agreements is that the construction of settlements
is completely disallowed in the interim period, which has gone on
for too long," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Tuesday that the Jewish people has the right to
settle in the Palestinian-controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived in Cairo this morning from Israel, where he
held talks with Netanyahu and other senior Israeli officials. His
brief trip to the Middle East is aimed at resuming Mideast peace
talks, particularly on the Palestinian-Israeli track, and
preparing for Netanyahu's visit to Washington next month.
</P>
<P>
Christopher headed for Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, immediately after
the press conference to inspect the scene where a truck bomb
killed at least 19 Americans and injured more than 200 others.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also ended his short visit to Cairo today.

<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The third session of the Legal
Panel of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region was held here June 25th and 26th.
</P>
<P>
Discussions centered on how to implement Article 24 of the
Basic Law for permanent Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that the Nationality Law of the People's Republic
of China and the explanations on how to implement it in Hong Kong
made by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
in addition to Article 24 of the Basic Law have clarified the
nationality issue for Hong Kong SAR residents and the identity of
permanent Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
These stipulations are related to Hong Kong's smooth transition
and the interests of Hong Kong residents, and will have a direct
effect on the preparatory work for the SAR, members said.
</P>
<P>
They also said that there are problems in implementing these,
and that these problems will be submitted at the panel's next
session for discussion.
</P>
<P>
They commented on a revised regulation published by the Hong
Kong authorities on transportation in Hong Kong to take effect on
July 1, 1997, saying that the Sino-British Joint Declaration
states that the British government's administration of Hong Kong
will end on June 30, 1997, and the British Hong Kong authorities
have no right to pass laws to take effect on July 1, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) today called on the United States to disband the
U.N. Forces Command stationed in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
In a memorandum issued on the eve of the 46th anniversary of
the outbreak of the 1950-53 Korean War, the DPRK's Foreign
Ministry also said that the United Nations' flag had been usurped
by the United States and the U.N. should take it back.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Forces Command has become a subsidiary to the Joint
South Korean-U.S. Command and poses an obstacle and a threat to
peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It added that it is pressing for the scrapping of the
U.N. Forces Command and the establishment of a new mechanism to
guarantee peace on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK government will do its utmost for the creation of this
new mechanism to prevent any outbreak of armed conflict or war on
the peninsula, said the memorandum, as quoted by the Korean
Central News Agency.

<HEADLINE> UK Women Lead a Harder Life than Their EU Counterparts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- British women are working harder,
divorcing more frequently and dying younger than any of their
counterparts in Western Europe, according to a survey of the
latest European statistics published Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by Market Assessment Publications,
shows that while British women marry at the youngest age, on
average at 25.6 years, compared with 26.1 in France and 25.9
across the European Union (EU), they have the highest number of
break-ups.
</P>
<P>
Four in every seven British marriages end in divorce compared
with an EU average of one in three. This is why Britain has the
highest level of one-parent families in the EU, with 14 percent of
children being brought up by one adult, compared with an EU
average of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
British women tend either to have more children than in any
other country or, in larger numbers than anywhere else, to have no
children at all.
</P>
<P>
They now enjoy the highest fertility rate in the EU of 1.75
children per woman. However, 39 percent of British couples are
childless compared with an EU average of 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Even in education British women appear worse off, being less
likely to go to university than women in any other major European
nation except Germany.
</P>
<P>
British women have the lowest life expectancy at 79 years
compared to 81.4 in France, 81 in Spain and the EU average of 79.4
years.
</P>
<P>
The employment statistics show that British women are easily
the most likely to have a job. Compared with an EU average of 55.2
percent in work, in Britain 65.9 percent have a job.
</P>
<P>
The figures suggest that the battle for women's rights in
Britain is far from won.
</P>
<P>
Steve Cordingley, a spokesman for Market Assessment
Publications, said: "It does appear that women in Britain have had
the worst deal from feminism in the last 10 years".

<HEADLINE> Australia Concerned Over US Export Subsidies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Australia is concerned over the
US export subsidies that may harm Australia's interests, according
to a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Australian Trade Minister Tim Fisher said in the statement that
Australian officials, at the annual consultation meeting here
Tuesday with their US counterparts, had strongly reiterated their
concerns over the US Export Enhancement Program (EEP) for grains
and the Dairy Export Incentive Program (DEIP), which subsidize
American exports.
</P>
<P>
"We are concerned that future allocations under these programs,
expected to be made in Washington in the next week or so, will
include a regional allocation for Asia under the EEP for grains,
and the introduction of new markets for DEIP," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The US side was left in no doubt that we expect them to honor
President Clinton's assurance -- most recently reiterated by Vice
President Gore -- that Australia's interests will be taken into
account in the operations of these programs," the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Will Remain Top Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will maintain its lead
among central and eastern European nations in attracting foreign
investment for a long time to come, Industry and Commerce Minister
Dnoi Imre was quoted as saying in an interview published today.
</P>
<P>
Imre told the Nepszabadag newspaper that frequent contacts with
Western countries had convinced him that Hungary would still be
able to draw two to 2.5 billion U.S. dollars in foreign investment
per year after completing its privatization program.
</P>
<P>
Imre said this level of foreign funding would make up for
Hungary's annual deficits in international payments and help
curb the year-by-year increase of its foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
But the minister said that foreign investment was so far
concentrated in Budapest and the region west of the Danube River,
which are relatively developed.
</P>
<P>
Efforts would be made to modernize infrastructure in other,
relatively backward, areas of the country to make them more
attractive to foreign investors, Imre added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Hungary stood at 12.8 billion dollars at
the end of 1995, accounting for 43 percent of the total foreign
investment in central and eastern Europe.

<P>
JAKARTA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Iraq have begun
talks to explore the possibility of Iraqi oil exports in exchange
for food imports from Indonesia, Industry and Trade Minister Tunky
Ariwibowo said here today.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of food and medicine we can sell to Iraq,"
Ariwibowo told newsmen after preliminary talks with visiting Iraqi
Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The talks followed Iraq's signing of an oil-for-food agreement
with the United Nations on May 20, which allows Baghdad to sell 2
billion US dollars worth of crude oil for six months to buy
badly-needed food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The UN imposed trade sanctions on Iraq following its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia imported some 30,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude
oil from Iraq before the sanction took effect.

CHANGCHUN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Efforts must be made to build up
the Communist Party of China in order to meet China's 21st century
goals, a senior party official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came from Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee,
who toured Jilin, Changchun, and several other cities in northeast
China's Jilin Province from July 21 to 26.
</P>
<P>
After touring Jilin Petrochemical and the No.1 Automobile
Manufacturing Works, two large state-owned firms, Hu said that
enterprise reforms can not get away from building up the party's
grass-roots organizations.
</P>
<P>
"We must not deviate from the politically central role of the
party organizations," Hu pointed out.
</P>
<P>
In Dehui City, Hu said that the party's grass-roots
organizations in rural areas must center on developing the rural
economy and helping farmers have a relatively comfortable life.
</P>
<P>
"We must do a good job in improving the quality of party
members and recruiting new party members among young farmers," he
said. "Efforts must be made to increase the rallying power of the
party organizations among the masses and improve their capacity to
serve the masses."
</P>
<P>
In Jilin, Hu urged party leaders at all levels to fully
understand the long-term nature and the difficulty, as well as the
complexity of the fight against crime.
</P>
<P>
"We should take full advantage of the current favorable
circumstances and consolidate the party's grass-roots
organizations so as to improve public security," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the importance of training and promoting
young, capable cadres.
</P>
<P>
"Young cadres should be tempered in the grass-roots areas, in
places where hardship and difficulties abound and in places where
they are badly needed by the party and the masses," Hu said.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks Down on Drug Criminals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China today launched its biggest
ever public crackdown on drug crime by sentencing over 760
traffickers and dealers to death or life behind bars.
</P>
<P>
Simultaneous public rallies across the country were attended by
1.75 million people as law officials handed out tough sentences to
1,725 criminals involved in drug related offences.
</P>
<P>
The massive show of determination by the state was part of
China's response to International Day Against Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Beijing today the Supreme People's
Court of China announced that it had ordered all courts across the
country to launch a major anti-drug campaign today by sentencing
drug criminals at public rallies at almost the same time.
</P>
<P>
Courts in China's 27 provinces, autonomous regions, and
municipalities held 262 public rallies to announce sentences in
939 drug cases.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,725 criminals sentenced today, 769 received severe
punishments of life imprisonment or the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiachen, vice president of the Supreme People's Court,
cited as examples four major cases of drug smuggling, trafficking,
selling, and production.
</P>
<P>
"Fourteen of the 18 criminals involved in these four cases, who
had committed extremely serious crimes, were sentenced to death
and deprivation of political rights for the rest of their lives,
while four of them were given death sentence with two-year
probation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The capital punishment fell on Liang Zhenyi and Du Shaojian,
both Hong Kong residents, and Macao resident Zeng Jiwei, who in
September, 1995 produced 86,000 grams of the designer drug "ice",
and was caught by the police while trying to sell the drug in
Guangzhou, capital of southeast China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The other 11 criminals sentenced to death came from Yunnan
Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in southwest China,
Henan Province in central China, and Gansu Province and Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region in northwest China. They took jobs like
ordinary workers, farmers, private businessmen, salesmen, and
company managers.
</P>
<P>
The death sentences on all 14 criminals were carried out this
morning by the Intermediate People's Courts in Zhaoqing City in
Guangdong Province, Dali Bai Nationality Autonomous Prefecture in
Yunnan Province, Qingyang Prefecture in Gansu Province, and
Liuzhou City in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
He said that other courts across the country today also
executed a number of drug criminals sentenced to death, and
transferred all the sentenced criminals to the prison authorities.
</P>
<P>
A total of 559.5 kilograms of drugs were burned at a public
gathering held in Nanning, capital of the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, and at a public gathering in east China's
Fujian Province, 861.6 kilograms of drugs, including 731 kg of the
drug "ice," were burned.

<HEADLINE> China to Inspect Packages of Exported Dangerous Goods by Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China is to start inspecting
packages of dangerous goods exported by land transportation in the
near future, said a government official today.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Administration for the Inspection of
Import and Export Commodities, China began to inspect on sea
packages of such goods in 1986 and those sent by air in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The official with the Administration said that they are
studying international regulations on the issue, and are
consulting with other government departments such as the State
Planning Commission, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economy
Cooperation and the Ministry of Transport.

A series of administrative regulations are expected to be
worked out by the four departments by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Senior Judge Calls for Tougher Action Against Drug Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- It is very important and also
imperative to arouse the whole nation into an all-round battle
against drugs, a senior Chinese judge said today.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiachen, vice-president of the Supreme People's Court of
China, described the country's current fight against drugs as
"critical to the survival of the nation."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference in Beijing given by
his court to mark "International Day Against Drug Abuse."
</P>
<P>
While claiming a huge success for China's anti-drug efforts in
the past few years, he conceded that the situation remains severe.
</P>
<P>
"Driven by the huge profits of drug business, many criminals
defy the law and are ready to risk their lives, making drug abuse
an incurable disease of the world," he said. "Therefore, it is
impossible for drugs to disappear within a short period of time."
</P>
<P>
He said there are some new characteristics for drug-related
crimes in China today.
</P>
<P>
"First, the number of large and serious cases is on the
rise. In recent years we have frequently unearthed cases involving
tens of thousands of grams of heroin," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Cross-border drug smuggling is also thriving in China, which
borders the world's largest drug producing area, the "Golden
Triangle," causing a sharp increase in the number of
foreign-related drug cases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, to survive the serious blows from the legal
authorities, drug traffickers and dealers work hand in glove and
tend to form groups, and often carry firearms to resist searches
and arrest by the police.
</P>
<P>
He also sent the alarm that drug-related crimes are gradually
invading the Chinese inland areas from border areas and ports of
entry.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, he said, drugs mainly haunted the southern
provinces like Guangdong and Fujian, and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region, as well as parts of the southwestern and
northwestern areas, while most drugs seized in China were on their
way to other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Now a large proportion of these drugs are sold directly to the
inland provinces of our country," he warned.
</P>
<P>
According to him, courts of China have always focused their
work on striking hard at drug-related crimes, and will adhere to
the principle of dealing a prompt and severe blow on any drug
criminals.
</P>
<P>
"We shall have not the slightest hesitation to severely punish
these drug dealers according to law," he vowed.

BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A liquid tonic made with pearl, a
traditional Chinese medicine, has entered the world market, and
its export volume topped one million US dollars in the past twelve
months.
</P>
<P>
China Duobao Pearl Liquid, currently available in Japan,

In China, pearl has been used as medicine for more than 2,000
years, and many ancient medical books recorded its uses.
</P>
<P>
The pearl product, which contains more than 10 amino acids and
over 20 trace elements, can be used as a sedative, to reduce fever

<HEADLINE> US Embassy in Riyadh Confirms 17 Americans killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A statement released by the
U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia today confirmed that so far
17 Americans were killed and over 230 others injured in the blast
Tuesday night at a U.S. military compound in the eastern Saudi
city of Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
The local Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) said the statement claimed
that "as a result of the explosion, 17 Americans are confirmed
dead, though the death toll may rise as the search of the
targeted building continues."
</P>
<P>
"At least 80 Americans were taken to local Saudi hospitals for
treatment and well over 150 personnel were treated at the scene
and released," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said, "Both the embassy and the U.S. military component of
the coalition are working closedly with Saudi authorities to deal
with the aftermath of this tragedy."
</P>
<P>
So far no one claimed responsibility to the explosion.
</P>
<P>
The embassy pledged to work with Saudi officials to ensure
that additional measures are taken to protect the security of
American citizens in Saudi Arabia, KUNA said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 40,000 Americans working in Saudi Arabia, and
around 5,000 are believed to be military personnel.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged all Americans in Saudi Arabia to pull
together in the face of "this latest outrage."
</P>
<P>
U.S. forces which led an international coalition force
operating from Saudi Arabia in the 1990-91 Gulf War remain in the
kingdom, which angers Moslem militants who oppose any Western
presence in the kingdom, home to Islam's holiest shrines.
</P>
<P>
The blast came seven months after a car bomb which was
detonated outside a U.S.-run military building in Riyadh last
November, killing five Americans and two Indians.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night's explosion was the worst blast involving
Americans in the Middle East since the 1983 bombing in Beirut,
Lebanon, that killed 241 American servicemen.

HONG KONG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong needs to expand its
overall hotel capacity by 2004 to cope with the 17.2 million
visitors expected to arrive in the territory that year.
</P>

transportation is still not able to keep up with the needs
produced by rapid economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Sends Condolences to Clinton over Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian King Fahd
telephoned U.S. President Bill Clinton today to express his
condolences over the death of the Americans killed in a truck bomb
explosion at a U.S. military compound in the Kingdom Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The strong explosion, which took place at a U.S. military
housing complex belonging to the Saudi Defense and Aviation
Ministry in the Eastern region of Al-Khobar, killed at least
23 Americans and injured more than 300 others, reports reaching
here said today.
</P>
<P>
The explosion destroyed an eight-story building where the
American military personnel were living and also damaged the
neighboring buildings.
</P>
<P>
So far no groups have claimed responsibility for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, a car bomb explosion at the Saudi
National Guard training center in Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia,
killed five Americans and two Indians. Militant Islamic groups
claimed responsibility for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
On may 31, four Saudi Arabians were convicted of the November
bombing and beheaded.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh recently received anonymous
threatening telephone calls after the four Saudi Arabians accused
were executed.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, President Bill Clinton said the explosion
"appears to be the work of terrorists" and vowed to bring those
responsible to justice.

ISLAMABAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The troops loyal to Afghan
President Burhanuddin Rabbani today launched air raids on Taliban
positions south of Kabul, retaliating Taliban's shelling on the
capital this morning.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here said that Rabbani's troops were trying
hard to pave the way for the return of Hezb-i-Islami Chief
Gulbudding Hekmatyar who is scheduled to take oath as prime
minister of a new coalition government today.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of officials and diplomats were expected to attend the
oath-taking ceremony to be held in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Taliban unleashed a massive shell attack on
central Kabul in a bid to prevent Hekmatyar from entering the
city.
</P>
<P>
Three people were killed and nine others injured during that
one-hour-long shelling which also forced some local
non-governmental organizations to suspend operations and send
their staff home.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Hekmatyar would be sworn in this afternoon
shortly after his arrival in Kabul, but no details of the
timetable are available so far.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Holds Talks with Arafat in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher held talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat here
today after his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
which lasted about one hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
His talks with the two leaders focused on the Middle East peace
process, particularly Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Christopher arrived in Cairo earlier today from Israel, where
he held talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and other
senior Israeli officials. His brief trip to the Middle East is
aimed at urging both the Palestinian and Israeli sides to commit
themselves to peace and preparing for Netanyahu's visit to
Washington next month.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival, Christopher was greeted not only by Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, but also editorials carried by
Egypt's state-run press that criticized his statements at a joint
press with Netanyahu in Jerusalem Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The two Cairo leading newspapers Al-Ahram and Al-Akhbar today
described Christopher's comments as "shameful," saying that he is
not an honest broker in the Middle East peace talks by acting
solely in Israel's interests.
</P>
<P>
Christopher endorsed Netanyahu's statement that peace
negotiations should be resumed without preconditions. The Arab
states have regarded such a statement as going back on the
land-for-peace principle, which has been a ground rule for the
peace process since its inception in 1991.
</P>
<P>
At the Arab summit which ended in Cairo Sunday, Arab leaders
urged Israel to stick to the principle, embodied in U.N. Security
Council resolutions. They said in a final communique that if
Israel fails to do so, they will reconsider their stance toward
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Arafat had been expected to discuss with Christopher mainly
Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron and the
resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli talks for a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on expanding
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, Israel should have
redeployed its troops in Hebron in March. But Israel has delayed
the redeployment following a series of suicide bombings carried
out by Palestinian extremists in Israel in February and March.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: C'wealth-Nigeria Talks End in Hope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The meeting between of Nigeria and
the Commonwealth ministerial action group concluded in London
on Tuesday with signs of hope for an improved relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth decision of no new sanctions on Nigeria,
according to analysts here, shows that Nigeria has scored a
diplomatic victory at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the two-day meeting acknowledged the
Nigerian government's explanation of its efforts in improving the
human rights situation in the country and the pursuit of its
transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
Although the existing Commonwealth sanctions against Nigeria
including its suspension from the 53-nation organization remain,
no further actions have been announced to toughen the relations
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Both parties agreed to continue constructive dialogue in order
to resolve areas of conflict. They also agreed to meet in
September to review the situation in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
However, "a lot of contentious issues remain unresolved,''
the reports said, quoting diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the meeting on Monday, Nigerian Foreign
Affairs Minister Tom Ikimi handed a four-point agenda, which
outlines Nigeria's demands as follows:
</P>
<P>
Lifting of the suspension of Nigeria's membership of the
Commonwealth, lifting of other sanctions against Nigeria,
supporting the government's transition program and holding more
high level negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Only the last issue was fully agreed upon. The second was
somewhat postponed, while the other two remain unchanged,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
But they believe if both sides keep contact, improvement
in bilateral relations is expected. The just concluded meeting
is a beginning to a better relation. As Ikimi said, the important
thing is that the impasse between Nigeria and the Commonwealth
has been broken.

TOKYO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investors boosted their
share holdings in 45 percent of listed Japanese companies during
fiscal 1995 ending March 31, Kyodo News Service quoted an economic
daily as reporting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to increased selling by Japanese institutional
investors and companies, foreign investors raised their holdings
in 993 of the 2,218 companies listed as of the end of fiscal 1995,
the Nihon Keizai Shimbun report said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign holdings exceeded 20 percent at 74 companies at the end
of fiscal 1995, up 18 from the end of the previous fiscal year,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that foreigners tend to focus on return on
equity (ROE) when buying stocks, and that holdings are increasing
in companies such as DDI Corp. and Sankyo Co., where the ROE is
more than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of shares owned by foreigners to all outstanding

<HEADLINE> People's Lifestyles Improve Due to Three Gorges Resettlement (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Large scale resettlement has provided a historic opportunity to
develop the economy in the project's reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
After the project is completed in 2009, the reservoir will
submerge 632 square kilometers in 21 counties and cities in Hubei
and Sichuan provinces. More than one million people will have to
be resettled.
</P>
<P>
Rural economy in the reservoir area is behind the times. In 1990,
the Gross National Product (GNP) of local people only accounted for
54.9 percent of the country's average figure, and the net income of
farmers in the area was not more than half of the country's
average.
</P>
<P>
In order to provide a better life for the resettlers, the
Chinese government has adopted measures to develop the economy in
the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
The country is working to develop abundant natural resources in
the reservoir area.
</P>
<P>
Other measures to raise resettler's incomes include building
grain, fruit and forestry bases on the barren hills and available
grasslands, engaging in aquatic production in hundreds of rivers
after the reservoir fills up, and strengthening infrastructure
construction. Officials also plan to develop township enterprises
and the service industry with the help of the government's
resettlement fund and with support from other areas.
</P>
<P>
State investment in the Three Gorges Project, the world's
largest of its kind, was 90 billion yuan. Of this amount, 40
billion yuan (about 482 million US dollars) was used for
resettlement.

URUMQI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The People's Square, located in the
central part of Urumqi, become a playground for thousands of local
residents during summer nights.
</P>
<P>
Some of them take walks in the square, and others sing. Every
evening at 8, more than 1,000 people form a large square and
exercise by dancing.
</P>
<P>
Ma Guilan, 60, is the lead dancer of this group. Three months
ago, she said, there were fewer than 100 dancers. Then more
people, both young and old -- sometimes whole families -- joined
in, and now the number of dancers exceeds 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Ma, an ex-service woman who has lived in Xinjiang for more than
40 years, used the word "earth-shattering" to describe the great
changes taking place in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in
northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to a skyscraper nearby, Ma said that there are many
such high buildings, while in 1953, the highest building was only
three stories tall.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that this progress is the result of government policies
that produced a stable political environment and helped people get
rich.
</P>
<P>
At 9:30, Yangko dancers move toward the stage to the beating of
drums. White-haired Chen Fengying organized this 100-member
dancing group. Many of them are over 50.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the dancers' purpose is to enjoy themselves and
their audience.
</P>
<P>
Every time they dance, Chen's group attracts at least 3,000
people.
</P>
<P>
Opposite these noisy Yangko dancers, at the northeast corner of
the square, is a group of modern dancers.
</P>
<P>
An 80-year old Jewish man provided the sound equipment for
these dancers. He lives 10 kilometers away from the square and
comes every evening to dance.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, the old man came to China from the former Soviet
Union and has lived in Xinjiang ever since. He speaks five
languages and was an interpreter before he retired.
</P>
<P>
To the south of this dancing ground are performances of famous
Chinese operas, including the Beijing Opera, and the Yuju Opera of
Henan Province. Musicians also play many other traditional Chinese
musical instruments there.
</P>
<P>
There are a dozen photographers at the square every night. A
photographer said that she usually uses three to four rolls of
film every evening during holidays, and often works until midnight.
</P>
<P>
People leave the square to go home after 1 o'clock in the
morning.

<HEADLINE> Birdman Zhang Raoxin Creates His Own Flying Kingdom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Raoxin is known as the
Birdman of Goucan village. Ironically he lives in an area where
birds have a valuable place in history - once being credited with
saving the life of an emperor almost 2000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The 43 year-old birdman is devoted to helping save and look
after his feathered friends. He tells moving stories about how he
protects birds and how he also encourages other people to watch
out for them.
</P>
<P>
Zhang lives in Goucun village, in Mengjin county of Luoyang in
central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
One day his young son brought home a nest of tits. He instantly
admonished his son and ordered him to return the nest and its
young occupants.
</P>
<P>
Once he stopped one of his brothers from killing birds and
another time, Zhang, holding several dead birds in his hands, told
his neighbors in a tearful voice about how many worms a woodpecker
can eat during one day, and how many mice an owl can eat during a
night.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's action moved his neighbors, and also provided a good
wildlife lesson to his children. He not only loves and protects
birds, but also creates comfortable "homes" for birds on trees.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's family contracted some six hectares of trees, where
various kinds of birds fly leisurely.
</P>
<P>
Zhang has also built nests and a drinking pond for birds.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has never used pesticides in his "bird
kingdom", and he has a good theory on protecting birds.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that "birds are best friends of mankind. If there
are no trees and birds, there will be no human beings. I won't
allow anyone to kill birds."
</P>
<P>
"During summer, I provide water for birds and, when there is
snow during winter, I give them some of my family's unhusked rice."
</P>
<P>
Luoyang is a famous ancient city in China, which was once the
capital of nine dynasties in Chinese history. The city has many
beautiful legendary stories about birds.
</P>
<P>
The first emperor of East Han Dynasty (25-220) Liu Xiu, who was
said to have once been saved by birds, was buried in a place
covered with one thousand cypress trees.
</P>
<P>
There is a typical phenomenon in this place. When somebody
stands at the northwest corner of the forest and claps his hands,
he can hear the singing of birds in the air. Local residents said
that the singing birds are those who saved the life of Liu Xiu.
</P>
<P>
One kilometer away to the northwest of Liu Xiu's cemetery is the
south bank of the Yellow River, where Henan province's wet land
water birds protection zone is situated.
</P>
<P>
Surrounding the 84 sq km protection zone there is 78 sq km
protection belt.
</P>
<P>
The protection zone is a winter habitat for migratory birds,
usually tens of thousands in number. More than 20 varieties of
birds such as white crane, red-crowned crane and grey crane are
under state protection; and there are approximately 10,000 water
fowl under the protection of a Sino-Japanese transient birds
protection agreement.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Enterprises Receive Lifeline Bank Loan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Managers of cash-starved
state-owned enterprises in northeast China's Liaoning Province
have won lifeline loans of 1.5 billion yuan from a local bank.
</P>
<P>
The Commercial and Industrial Bank of China's Liaoning branch
issued the biggest loans in its history to 12 large state-owned
enterprises in Liaoning Province, where there are one tenth of the
country's state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The 12 enterprises includes Benxi Iron and Steel Corporation,
Fushun Petro-Chemical Corporation, and the Liaohe Oil Fields. Each
of them have been listed among the 300 key state-owned enterprises
that will be supported by the government in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
However what makes a difference is that the bank has signed a
contract with the enterprises that sets both the duty and rights
on both sides to reduce the risks for the bank, and to improve the
enterprises' economic performances.
</P>
<P>
Guo Tingbiao, the province's vice-governor in charge of
industries, said it is a rare opportunity for local enterprises to
receive support both from the government and the banks.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises who have received the loans should pay more
attention to the management of the loans, and repay them on time,
Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Another 12 enterprises will also be given large loans from
local banks soon.

CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
arrived here this morning to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>

Arafat would mainly discuss with Mubarak and Christopher the
Palestinian track of the Middle East peace process, particularly
Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron and the
resumption of the Palestinian-Israeli talks for a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on expanding the

the redeployment following a series of suicide bombings carried
out by Palestinian extremists in Israel in February and March.

Christopher, who arrived here earlier today, held a three-hour
meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in
Jerusalem Tuesday to discuss the future of Arab-Israeli peace

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Shells Kabul Before New PM's Arrival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
unleashed a massive shell attack on the capital city of Kabul this
morning before the arrival of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who is
scheduled to be sworn in as prime minister of a new coalition
government, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
At least three persons were killed and nine injured in the
attack, which was aimed at preventing Hekmatyar, head of
Hezb-i-Islami, from entering the capital, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The one-hour-long shell attack mainly targeted the Bagha Bala
area in central Kabul where Hekmatyar will take oath later today.
</P>
<P>
Taliban also fired 35 rockets on the main road between Kabul
and Hekmatyar's base at Sarobi, about 50 kilometers east of Kabul,
as the route is expected to be used by Hekmatyar on his way to the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, once an arch rival of Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, has reconciliated with Rabbani since May 24 this year
when an agreement on their alliance was signed in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The new Hekmatyar-Rabbani alliance has put great pressure on
Taliban that has been attacking Kabul in the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
Taliban warned foreigners to leave Kabul and Kabul residents to
stay at home last night as they said the situation would be
"dangerous" in the capital today.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korean corporations are
increasing the issuance of foreign-exchange-denominated securities
overseas, according to a Yonhap News Agency report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Such foreign-exchange funds amounted to a total of 9.77 billion
U.S. dollars last year, the report quoted the Bank of Korea as
saying.
</P>
<P>
And such funds raised in the first five months of this year
amounted to 4.86 billion dollars, up 34.2 percent from the 3.62
billion dollars raised in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was due to the cheaper cost of raising funds
overseas, in addition to the deregulation of trans-border capital
movement, said the report.

<HEADLINE> France Imports Uranium From S.Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- France has bought hundreds
of metric tons of uranium from South Africa each year since 1977,
a local daily "The Citizen" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Outgoing South African Mineral and Energy Affairs Minister Pik
Botha disclosed the uranium deal with France in a written
response to questions by senior African National Congress member
Willie Hoffmeyer, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Botha said modern nuclear weapons, such as those recently
tested by France, use plutonium instead of uranium because of the
much smaller and quantities needed.
</P>
<P>
"It is consequently highly improbable that South African uranium
could have been used in the recent French nuclear weapons tests,"
said Botha.
</P>
<P>
South African uranium was exported to France in two forms, as
ore concentrates, known as yellowcake, and as uranium
hexafluorides, the outgoing minister said.
</P>
<P>
Between 1977 and 1994, a total of 15829 tons of yellowcake
were exported to France, with figures varying from a low of 100
tons in 1990 to 3057 tons in 1980.
</P>
<P>
In addition, France bought 377 tons of uranium hexafluorides
in 1995 and 115 tons up to june 1996, the minister added.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Parliament Passes Law on Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti parliament has
passed a law requiring those who win government contracts worth
100,000 Kuwait dinars (330,000 U.S. dollars) or over to declare if
they are paying a commission to relevant persons on the government
side.
</P>
<P>
The law which was passed in the first reading Tuesday was aimed
at curbing wide-scale kickbacks and corruption in government
contracts, especially defense deals, official sources quoted
members of parliament as saying.
</P>
<P>
The law will become effective after the parliament approves it
in the second reading and the government endorses it, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had awarded a deal recently to British companies to buy
the British made surface-to-surface missile while rejecting a
similar French offer of 5 million dinars (16.5 million dollars)
less and with better payment terms.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Defense Ministry said it chose the British missiles
because they were tried during the Gulf war while the French
missiles were not.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the bill also requires the deal winners
to declare the amount of commission they pay and the name of
the beneficiary and stipulates tough penalties and fines for
those who are cheating.
</P>
<P>
It is learned the the Kuwaiti government expressed reservations
over the law, saying there is a suspicion that it may include a
breach of the constitution.

<P>
Seven-year old Mahina usually eats several mutton kebabs at a
night market on her way home from her piano teacher's
house. Meanwhile, her mother buys goods from the Xingguang Night
Market, located on the Wuyi Road in Urumqi.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, about 200,000 people visit this
market every week. The figure is one-seventh of Urumqi's total
population.
</P>
<P>
It takes people 90 minutes to complete their tour down
Xingguang Road's one-kilometer long night market, which has become
a shopping center for local people and also a place where visitors
can have a real taste of Xinjiang's folk traditions.
</P>
<P>
Along both sides of the street stand cooking stoves, ovens,
garment shops, billiard tables, fruit carts and stores that sell
everyday goods. People walking through the market can find many
typical local dishes, and those from other places in the country.
</P>
<P>
Peddlers here represent many nationalities, including Uygur,
Kazak and Han.
</P>
<P>
Pascal, a man from Switzerland has, arrived in Urumqi after
travelling in five middle Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"Commodities in Xinjiang are richer than they are in the former
Soviet Union. People here seem to be more confident," he said.
</P>
<P>
His companion, Bocis, a photographer, said, "In the past, I
heard that there are clashes between the Han Nationality and other
ethnic groups. But now I found that they are living in great
harmony."
</P>
<P>
Adi Axing is a typical peddler on the night market. Every day,
he sells 300 kilograms of watermelons and makes a profit of 70 to
80 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shen Juying, who settled down in Xinjiang in the 1960s, said
she feels safe when walking through the night market. She comes
home at 01:00 every day, and never feels threatened.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30,000 people travel through the market every evening,
and there are only eight public security guards on duty.
</P>
<P>
The Xingguang Night Market is only open six months a year, but
produces 800,000 yuan in tax revenues.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Exports to Increase 14 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Barclays Bank of Zimbabwe has
predicted a 14 percent growth in exports for this year despite
trade related setbacks and the vagaries of weather affecting the
country, the Daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
In its latest monthly economic bulletin, Barclays said
tobacco, gold, ferro-chrome and tourism which constitute about 45
percent of total exports, will make a large net impact to the
projected growth.
</P>
<P>
The remainder will be accounted for by manufacturing exports,
other agricultural and mineral commodity exports. Purely
manufactured exports excluding cotton lint and ferro-chrome will
contribute 25 percent of Zimbabwe's exports.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated growth is, however, still below a 21 percent
increase in the volume of exported products achieved in 1994 and
another subsequent positive growth made last year.

<HEADLINE> China to Commemorate Former Cultural Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Ceremonies will be held next month
to mark the centennial of the birth of China's first cultural
minister Mao Dun, who also was a left-wing writer in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
The events will be an opportunity for China to again illustrate
the idea that art should serve the people and promote socialism,
said Ai Qingchun, vice-minister of culture.
</P>
<P>
Mao Dun is regarded as one of the most renowned literary giants
in China, because he helped create the country's modern literature
movement in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
The communist party member believed that literature was a means
to modernize China, and wrote many novels to criticize what he
believed was the country's dark society.
</P>
<P>
One of his representative works was "Midnight," a novel
demonstrating the fact that socialism and the Communist Party of
China are the correct choices for the people.
</P>
<P>
"We must inherit Mao's revolutionary legacy," said Ai.
</P>
<P>
He explained that only by doing this can people adhere to the
correct political line in literary creation.
</P>
<P>
The activities, mounted by the ministry of culture and other
government departments, include meetings, seminars, exhibitions,

<HEADLINE> Christopher Arrives in Cairo for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher arrived here this morning for talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Christopher came here after his one-day visit to Israel, where
he held a three-hour meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Tuesday to discuss the future of Arab-Israeli peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Christopher was expected to brief Mubarak on his talks in
Israel. Their meeting would also deal with the Arab summit, which
urged Israel in a final communique to continue the peace process
based on the principle of land for peace.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who just attended the Arab summit here on Saturday and
Sunday, would arrive here later today. He would also meet Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Arafat would discuss with Christopher Israel's withdrawal from
the West Bank town of Hebron and the resumption of the
Palestinian-Israeli talks for a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
Under the Palestinian-Israeli agreement on expanding
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank, Israel should have
redeployed its troops in Hebron in March. But Israel has delayed
the redeployment following a series of suicide bombings carried
out by Palestinian extremists in Israel in February and March.

<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he
has given instructions to establish channels of contacts with the
Palestinian Authority (PA), including PA President Yasser Arafat.
In an interview with the Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot published
today, Netanyahu said that the new government plans to have
channels of contacts of different levels with the PA.
</P>
<P>
He added that he has given clear instructions for cooperation
contacts with PA to continue, including joint patrols, meetings of
officers and joint committees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Tuesday's joint press conference held with
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Netanyahu
did not answer directly a question about his possible meeting
with Arafat, but hinted that he would consider it, "if it's
essential to the security of Israeli people".
</P>
<P>
In the past, Netanyahu repeatedly vowed that he would never
hold talk with Arafat, whom he charged with harboring terrorism.
</P>

WASHINGTON -- The death toll in the bomb attack on a U.S. air
base in Saudi Arabia has climbed to 23, Pentagon spokesman Sam
Grizzle said Tuesday. All 23 were Americans. More than 300
people were injured, 105 seriously.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said 19 were killed.
</P>
<P>
The bomb went off at about 10:30 p.m. local time (19:30 GMT) in
a suburb of Dhahran in eastern Saudi Arabia. The truck bomb
destroyed an eight-story building housing Americans and other
foreigners at King Abdul Aziz Air Base near Dhahran in eastern
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton condemned the attack as the work of
terrorists and vowed to bring those responsible to justice.
He said he was sending a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
team to help probe into the blast.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The Iranian government said Tuesday that the proposal
by U.S. President Bill Clinton for comprehensive talks with Tehran
is not honest.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Maleki, Deputy Foreign Minister for Education and
Research, said at a press conference that the proposal by the
U.S. president was "concurrent with the ratification of the bill
by both the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding the
intensification of the sanctions against Iran."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday voted 415-0 to
approve a measure that would sanction foreign oil firms investing
40 million U.S. dollars or more in Iran in a single year.
</P>
<P>
The statement by the deputy foreign minister serves as an
official response to what Clinton has said with London-based Arab
newspaper Sharq al-Owsat recently.
</P>
<P>
Clinton reiterated that his policy is not to confront Tehran
militarily, and specified that his intention is to somehow change
the behavior of the Iranian government and make it "more moderate."

<HEADLINE> Investment Growth Sped Up in China's Middle, West Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China recorded a faster investment
growth in its middle and western regions than in the eastern
region in the January-May period this year. It is the first time
since the 1980s that the inland areas have come out on top.
</P>
<P>
Investment in capital construction and technological
rennovation chalked up a 15.16 percent year-on-year increase in
the middle region, and a 13.41 percent increase in the western
region during the period, according to the State Planning
Commission and the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
In comparison, the eastern region witnessed an investment
growth of just 6.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Such a change represents an initial, but substantial progress
in China's efforts to contain the widening of the regional gap in
economic development, Li Xiaoxi, a leading economist with the
Research Office of the State Council, said.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a massive campaign since last year to
improve the imbalance in regional development, with a series of
policies worked out in favor of inland regions, where economic
growth has long lagged behind the east coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Investment growth in capital construction and technological
renovation began to speed up in the middle and western regions
late last year, and turned out to be remarkable this year, SSB
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A number of the state's key projects have been launched in the
regions this year, mainly in the industries of energy,
transportation, telecommunications and raw materials, while many
enterprises in the east region have also diverted part of their
technology and capital to the west and central areas.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the acceleration in investment growth, which is a
forerunner economic indicator, will promote rises in other
economic indicators, and help bring about a faster economic growth
in the middle and western regions.
</P>
<P>
An official of the State Planning Commission called for further
efforts to be made in maintaining the positive trend.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to work hard for a fairly long period before we
succeed in bridging the regional gap," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan Province
has vowed to ensure the quality of export commodities through its
customs offices.
</P>
<P>
Both local exports and export goods from other parts of China

<HEADLINE> People Get Better Off in Three Gorges Resettlement (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- With 10,400 new residents in the
county, Yichang takes the lead in resettlement due to the
construction of the massive Three Gorges Dam Project.
</P>
<P>
Of these people, 10,100 have built new houses, and 6,380 of
them have gained lifetime security by joining an old-age pension
system, getting a job or developing farmland.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the incomes of the majority of those resettled
people have risen, and the county's economy is developing at an
unprecedented speed. In 1995, agricultural and industrial total
output in the county soared 40.5 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
"The earlier people move away from their original dwelling
sites, the sooner they become better off," townspeople said.
</P>
<P>
The average salary of people in Zhujiawan, the first
resettlement village, has reached 4,898 yuan (about 590 US
dollars), compared to the 500 yuan (about 60 US dollars) they were
earning three years before they moved.
</P>
<P>
Zhujiawan has become the richest village in the
County. Officials said the resettlement has allowed their people
to get rich ten years ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
Tongshuwan Village, in Zigui County of Hubei Province, is the
first village that will be submerged once the reservoir is filled
with water. Here, 1098 of 1146 people will have to be resettled.
</P>
<P>
As an experimental base for resettlement, 904 people in the
village have moved into new dwellings, and those resettled have
planted 60 hectares of citrus orchards.
</P>
<P>
To the villagers' surprise, their living conditions have
improved: their average income was 5.35 times that of 1990's
figure.
</P>
<P>
Villagers told Xinhua the reason for their improved living
conditions can be attributed to China's subsidies and a series of
preferential policies.

<HEADLINE> San Miguel to Strengthen Cooperation with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The San Miguel Corporation, the
largest food, beverage and packaging company in the Philippines,
will strengthen its co-operation with China, aiming to occupy 12
to 15 percent of China's beer market by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Alberto O. Villa-Abrille, Jr., executive vice president of
China operations for San Miguel, revealed the company's investment
plans in China at a news conference on San Miguel's sponsorship of
Chinese Olympic Committee held here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
San Miguel has invested more than 260 million US dollars to set
up four brewing and two packaging joint ventures in China. San
Miguel's annual beer output in China surpasses 500,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to catch up with the United States early in
the next century to lead the world in beer consumption. This has
encouraged San Miguel to pour larger investment into the country,
Villa-Abrille said.
</P>
<P>
San Miguel has shared 20 percent of the beer market in south
China's Guangdong Province, where San Miguel has two brewing joint
ventures in Guangzhou and Shunde.
</P>
<P>
Two other brewing joint ventures are located in Baoding in
north China's Hebei Province, which are expected to expand San
Miguel's business in north China, and especially to meet the
increasing beer demand in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
San Miguel also has two packaging joint ventures in Zhaoqing
and Shunde, both in Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
China has now attracted more than 30 overseas companies to
invest in the country's brewing industry, using more than 500
million US dollars in overseas investment.

<HEADLINE> Game Warden Wang Becomes the Animal's Friend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- "When I patrol in the forest,
antelopes and their like often run boldly alongside me," said game
reserve warden Wang Huizhong.
</P>
<P>
The animal kingdom in the Helan Mountain Nature Reserve have
adopted Wang as their trusted friend during his 26 years as a
warden.
</P>
<P>
Such close contact with his animal friends was rare in the
past, Wang recalls.
</P>
<P>
Herds of antelope, red deer and hartebeests can be seen roaming
in the forest at the Helan Mountain Nature Reserve in northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Helan Mountain, which means 'horse' in Mongolian, is a
concentrated area of animals and plants in Mongolia, north China
and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It was designated a state-level
nature reserve by the State Council in 1988.
</P>
<P>
In recent years the nature reserve authorities and local
government have introduced a series of laws and regulations to
prevent forest fires and protect the wildlife resources.
</P>
<P>
At present, the afforestation rate in the reserve has reached
over 45 percent, and the water and soil conservation ability in
the nature reserve has markedly improved.
</P>
<P>
The nature reserve has been free from forest fires for 45
years, according to reserve official Li Yongfang.
</P>
<P>
The number of wildlife species has increased to more than 170,
many of which are under state protection, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, criminal activities such as poaching has basically
disappeared in the nature reserve because of the government's
efforts.

SICHUAN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The cuddly dozen - that's the 12
artificially bred giant panda cubs - giving hope to the endangered
black and white bears.
</P>
<P>
They have all arrived at the China Research Institute for Panda
Protection, based in southwest China's Sichuan Province, since
1991.
</P>
<P>
An official at the center said that scientists breed pandas by
artificial insemination because of the difficulty for giant pandas
in captivity to mate on their own.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Wolong Nature Reserve, the home of giant pandas,
the center was set up jointly by the Chinese government and the
World Wildlife Fund in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas, one of the most endangered animal species in the
world, live in mountainous areas in Sichuan, Gansu and Shaanxi
provinces. China now has some 1,000 pandas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, a 13-member special task for breeding
pandas in captivity has been conducting artificial insemination
experiments with four pandas rescued from sickness or starvation,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The center has six offices and two field observatory stations.

<HEADLINE> Rebel Leader Accepts Talks With Ugandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Kony, leader of the
Ugandan rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), has written to the
Ugandan government, calling for the resumption of peace
talks stalled years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Monitor" of Uganda today quoted Rwot Justine Acana,
leader of Acholi clan in northern Uganda, as saying, "as far as I
am concerned, Kony himself is ready to talk peace with us."
</P>
<P>
He said the letter was known to the office of the Minister for
Pacification of North, Resident in Gulu, over 300 km north of
the capital city Kampala.
</P>
<P>
The letter addressed to both elders and the government in an
appeal for the resumption of peace talk.
</P>
<P>
He said that Acholi elders were going ahead with preparations
for the meeting with the LRA rebels, despite the recent killings
by suspected rebels of two Acholi elders on a peace mission.
</P>
<P>
The elders recently met in Gulu town to seek ways of reviving
the stalled peace talks, according to the Acholi clan leader.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in his last month's
successful campaign for presidency refused the peace talks with
Kony.
</P>
<P>
Kony was a criminal killing ordinary civilians, Museveni said,
but adding he would allow tribal leaders to seek ways of peace
talks with Kony.
</P>
<P>
The LRA was founded in April 1987 by Kony, a 32-year-old
former catechist in a catholic parish.
</P>
<P>
Most of LRA rebels fled into Sudan from Uganda in October 1994,
when the Uganda government troops intensified attackes on
them.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of Kony rebels have since February this year
returned to Uganda to engage in their anti-government operations
in northern Uganda.

JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians are looking for
high-level talks between Israel and the Palestinians, and that
means talks between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat, said Arafat's
aide Nabil Abu Rudeineh.
</P>
<P>
Disappointed by Tuesday's meeting between Netanyahu and
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Palestinian
officials believed that a meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu was
essential before any serious talks can begin on the future of the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
When it happens, "I am sure the first meeting between Arafat
and Netanyahu will be difficult, but I am sure it will be less
difficult than the first meeting between Arafat and Yitzhak
Rabin," the assassinated Israeli Premier, said Ahmed Tibi, a close
adviser to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources also expected that such a meeting
will be necessary before any Israeli redeployment in the disputed
West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat is traveling to Egypt today to meet with
Christopher in Cairo, Egyptian capital, before offering his own
assessment on Israel's attitude toward the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The PA president and the U.S. secretary of state will likely to
be joined in their meeting by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China has banned the purchase and
transfer of small chemical paper pulp machines, and limited the
purchase of medium-sized chemical paper pulp machines.
</P>
<P>
In a recent emergency circular to local governments, the State
Bureau of Environmental Protection called on local authorities to
adopt measures to ban the purchase or transfer of facilities with
a capacity of producing 10,000 paper pulp annually by chemical
means.
</P>
<P>
Such facilities cause serious water pollution problems,
according to the circular.
</P>
<P>
Purchase and transfer of similar facilities with bigger
production capacity must be strictly controlled, and must be
approved by provincial environmental protection bureaus, the
circular said.
</P>
<P>
It said plants which purchase the facilities must equip
themselves with pollution-control equipment that meets the
requirements of the State environmental protection laws and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
Wastewater discharged by those plants also must meet State
environmental protection requirements.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises which violate the regulation will be punished
according to State environmental laws and regulations.
</P>
<P>
The circular was issued when it was discovered small chemical
paper pulp facilities have been transferring from the Huaihe River
Valley, including the provinces of Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and
Shandong.
</P>
<P>
The four provinces have been ordered to close hundreds of small
chemical paper pulp plants as part of central government's efforts
to clean the Huaihe River by 2000.

SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the suburban areas of
China's financial and trade center now are richer than their
colleagues, owing to the steady growth in their annual income
which stood at 4,200 yuan (506 US dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
The farmers also saw a higher urbanization rate of their
townships.
</P>
<P>
All of the villages have been connected with highways, and a
farmer's lifespan now is expected to reach 70 years, due to the
formation of a complete social welfare system.

Economists said that the suburban rural economy has entered
into a quick-growth period, and township enterprises have become
the main driving force in the local rural economy.
</P>
<P>
Local township enterprises' industrial output value reach 157.9
billion yuan last year, accounting for 82.3 percent of the total
from the suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
There are also 132 villages that each have seen an annual
output value of more than 100 million yuan, and another 807 with
one million yuan in annual profit.

<HEADLINE> IMF Director Hails Existing Currency Exchange Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rates between major
currencies are now the most justified in decades, the
International Monetary Fund's top official said today before going
to the southern city of Lyon to attend Thursday's G-7 summit.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said that based on
economic fundamentals, parity between the major currencies "has
never been more justified in 30 years."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar surged to 1.5303 German marks today from 1.5301
marks in late European transactions on Monday. It has risen over
6 percent against the mark since the last Group of Seven (G-7)
meeting in October, helping to re-balance the world economy by
making European exports cheaper on world markets.
</P>
<P>
And this year's G-7 summit is widely expected to applaud the
dollar's rally over the past nine months, as the major economies
are comfortable with the current exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus noted that the stronger dollar was due to the will of
the seven most industrialized nations to operate in an orderly
reversal of currencies following the dollar's plunge against the
Japanese yen and European currencies at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the dollar was triggered by a U.S. decision to
increase interest rates for six months to curb the feared
inflation rise in the country.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus added that the G-7's finance leaders "should also
recognize that it is necessary to resume (intervention) if it is
justified, and as far as possible not to wait until the situation
becomes extreme." But he did not specify when it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
Economic policy-makers from the G-7 of most industrialized
nations -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Canada and Japan -- meet each year since 1975 to coordinate
financial policies and revive economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Opposition Challenge Netanyahu's Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Labor Party, now
in opposition, Tuesday night stressed that Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government will have to meet Palestinian Authority
(PA) President Yasser Arafat and carry out the redeployment in
Hebron if it is serious about continuing the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Labor leaders made the comments after visiting U.S. Secretary
of State Warren Christopher called on former Prime Minister
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Member of Knesset (MK) Ehud Barak described Netanyahu's desire
as "an illusion," adding that "the Madrid conference is no longer
relevant."
</P>
<P>
Barak dismissed Netanyahu's assertion concerning advancing
negotiations with no pre-conditions, noting that such a stand
might be plausible before negotiations, "but today Netanyahu
should remember we are in the midst of negotiations, and there is
no place for such utterances."
</P>
<P>
Barak said the Hebron issue is complicated, and when Netanyahu
studies all the material involved, "he will carry out everything
we planned to. In a week, we shall see him changing his militant
tone and saying very different things. Otherwise, the peace
negotiations will be quagmired."
</P>
<P>
MK Haim Ramon said a meeting between Netanyahu and Arafat is
inevitable, and the sooner it takes place the better. "The Israeli
government must honor International agreements, as the prime
minister has stated. This obliges him to talk to the head of the
PA, whether he likes him or not," Ramon said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Netanyahu's promise, at the end of the news
conference with Christopher, to install air-conditioning in the
Prime Minister's Office by Christopher's next visit, Ramon said,
"Is that the great government reform Netanyahu had promised?"
</P>
<P>
In his reaction Tuesday night, Meretz leader Yossi Sarid said,
"It seems to me that Netanyahu is still in his election
campaign. I hear words, words, words, but they're meaningless and
it's impossible to understand anything from them about his
intentions. What we saw today was evasions, not answers."
</P>
<P>
Scoffing at the idea of reviving the Madrid conference, Sarid
said that "Netanyahu cannot take us back to the Madrid period,"
adding that "I don't know a single Arab leader who would join
him. So what does it matter what he thinks about it?"

<HEADLINE> "We Won't Be on SADC Agenda," Says Zambian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will not
allow the Southern African Development Community (SADC) security
summit scheduled for Friday in Botswana to specifically discuss
rising political tension in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Foreign Minister Christon Tembo told the Zimbabwe
National News Agency in Harare on Tuesday that Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba would not attend the summit called by SADC
Chairman, Botswana President Sir Ketumile Masire.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit was arranged after a series of bomb blasts
blamed on supporters of former Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda
in the Zambian capital Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda and his supporters are protesting new constitutional
amendments effectively barring the former president from
contesting in presidential eledctions scheduled for October this
year.
</P>
<P>
"You don't put other countries on the agenda," Tembo said when
responding to questions after delivering a letter from Zambian
President Chiluba and discussing with Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe for over an hour.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a SADC meeting but not specifically on Zambia," he
declared.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member SADC recommended in January the setting up of a body
to monitor the security situation in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Tembo also ruled out the possibility of the on-coming summit of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) in Cameroon discussing the
political problems in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Government Faces Criticism in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali parliament is to
begin its 10th regular session here today while the main
opposition party prepares to raise criticism against the
nine-month-old coalition government led by Prime Minister Sher
Bahadur Deuba.
</P>
<P>
The session, a budget session, is scheduled to discuss the
government's policy program and budget report for the coming
fiscal year starting from July 16.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 30 bills including those on women's
property rights, land reform and terrorism control would be
introduced in the parliament during the session.
</P>
<P>
Another major issue on the session's agenda is to ratify a
treaty with India on the development of a border river signed
earlier this year during Prime Minister Deuba's visit to India.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary party meeting of Deuba's main ruling Nepali
Congress (NC) party Tuesday decided to put forward the Mahakali
Treaty to the lower house for ratification during the parliament
session.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by Deuba and the then Indian prime minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao in February, was hailed by the two governments
as a watershed of Nepal-India cooperation on water resources
development.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also agreed that the government's policy and budget
for the 1996-97 fiscal year would continue in line with that in
the previous year while including some new programs in accordance
with the country's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a similar meeting of the main opposition the
Communist Party of Nepal (UML), the largest party in the
parliament, Tuesday decide to ask its central committee to
finalize the party 's position on some important parliamentary
issues like the Mahakali Treaty and women's property rights.
</P>
<P>
The UML's support to the Mahakali Treaty would be conclusive to
its ratification as it needs a two-thirds majority in the 205-seat
lower house. The UML holds 88 seats in the house.
</P>
<P>
The UML party meeting also decided to raise in the parliament
session 17 different issues including price hikes, corruption,
privatization program, economic deterioration, reduction of
development budget and a big-sized cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems unlikely that the main opposition could launch
a fatal challenge against the three-party coalition government as
it had threatened two months ago.
</P>
<P>
The UML earlier had vowed to overthrow the Deuba government
during this parliament session, but its efforts to break up the
ruling coalition failed when Deuba expanded his cabinet for the
third time last month to recruit more MPs from the National
Democratic Party (RPP), whose 19 seats in the house are crucial
for the government.
</P>
<P>
Deuba is leading a 48 member-strong cabinet, or council of
ministers, the biggest ever in Nepal's history.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Instructs to Contact with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu said today he has given instructions to establish
channels of contacts with the Palestinian Authority (PA),
including PA President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot published
this morning, Netanyahu said that the new government plans to have
channels of contacts of different levels with the PA.
</P>
<P>
He added that he has given clear instructions for cooperation
contacts with PA to continue, including joint patrols, meetings
of officers and joint committees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at Tuesday's joint press conference held with
visiting U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Netanyahu
did not answer directly a question about his possible meeting
with Arafat, but hinted that he would consider it, "if it's
essential to the security of Israeli people".
</P>
<P>
In the past, Netanyahu repeatedly vowed that he would never
hold talk with Arafat, whom he charged with harboring terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He has strongly demanded that the Palestinian side prove its
capability to halt the terrorism, and conditioned the progress of
peace talks on PA's fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that, while he will resume peace talks with
the Palestinians, he has no interests in returning what he called
"the old pattern of terrorist attacks, a brief closure on the
territories followed by renewed negotiations".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Faisal Husseini, senior Palestinian representative
in Jerusalem, said Tuesday that an Arafat-Netanyahu meeting would
be likely "within a month."
</P>
<P>
"We must start a direct dialogue again. I don't know if
Mr. Arafat likes Mr. Netanyahu, or whether Mr. Netanyahu likes
Mr. Arafat. But this is not important. We are talking about
politics, you can't decide for the other side about his own
leadership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Husseini believed the two leaders would meet "in a matter of
weeks," hinting the possibility of meeting abroad.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, speaking to reporters
after meeting with Christopher Tuesday night, also indicated that
he would meet face-to-face with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Talks will be held with the Palestinian Authority, but there
is no authority without a head," Levy said.
</P>
<P>
However, Levy instructed Tuesday Ilan Baruch, director of the
ministry's Autonomy Division, to immediately sever all contacts
with PA representatives, and sought clarification of Baruch's
efforts to arrange a meeting between him and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Baruch reportedly held several meetings with
PA security heads Mohammed Dahlan and Jibril Rajoub, during which
he explored the possibility of a Levy-Arafat meeting. Dahlan and
Rajoub were reported to be interested in arranging such a
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Official Says Myanmar Firm in Anti-Drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will continue to go all out
in its anti-drug efforts with or without outside help, Minister
for Home Affairs Lieut. Gen. Mya Thin said at a ceremony here
today marking the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit
Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Mya Thin, also chairman of the Central Committee for Drug Abuse
Control, hinted that the United States refused to support
Myanmar's efforts for control and eradication of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
"An official of a big nation has openly declared to the
international community that they do not recognize and would not
aid the efforts being made by this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Myanmar government has made it a national
duty to eradicate and prevent drug abuse and is working to
eliminate poppy cultivation by improving people's life.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has made a significant step in its
anti-drug combat in taking over the areas ruled by former drug
warlord Khun Sa, who earlier surrendered to the armed forces along
with his Mong Tai Army.
</P>
<P>
Between 1989 and May this year, the Myanmar government spent
more than 3,895 million kyats (some 649.16 million US dollars) on
helping people find alternatives to poppy plantation as a means of
living, Mya Thin said in another speech today.
</P>
<P>
He noted with concern that a majority of the drug addicts
registered for treatment in Myanmar were young people while those
arrested for illicit drug trafficking were mostly middle-aged.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, between 1988 and
June 15 this year, the Myanmar authorities seized 14,204.86
kilograms of opium, 1,895.98 kilograms of heroin, 3,788.51
kilograms of marijuana, and 30,793.87 liters of phensedyl.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Leaders Urge Bosnian Serbs to Respect Dayton Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia today urged the Bosnian Serb leaders to fully
implement the Dayton peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting between officials of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia comprising Serbia and Montenegro and Bosnian Serbs, the
leaders criticized some Bosnian Serb leaders for refusing to carry
out the Bosnian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were Federal President Zoran Lilic,
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, Montenegrin President Momir
Bulatovic and Vice-Presidents Biljana Plavsic and Nikola Kolijevic
of the Bosnian Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
The leaders discussed some major problems in implementing the
Dayton agreement, said a statement issued by the federal
presidential office after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that some Bosnian Serb leaders first
accepted the agreement but later refused to carry it out and these
acts have drawn negative reaction from the whole world.
</P>
<P>
They did not attend the Brussels conference on the Bosnian
peace process and illegally fired Rajko Kasagic, the former prime
minister of the Bosnian Serb Republic, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The participants demanded that the Bosnian Serb Parliament
immediately make a decision to honor their obligations as
stipulated in the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
They also asked the Bosnian Serb Parliament to appoint an
acting president of the Bosnian Serb Republic with full powers to
prevent its citizens' interests from being further jeopardized in
the implementation of the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that if the Bosnian Serb Parliament does
not accept the demand, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia may take
any actions against those organizations and persons who jeopardize
the interests of the Bosnian Serbs and the people of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia by blocking the implementation of the
Dayton agreement.

<HEADLINE> Germany Pledges To Help Romania Get Closer to EU, NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 25 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman Herzog today
pledged continued help for Romania to secure a closer relationship
with the European Union (EU) and the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
He made the pledge during talks with visiting Romanian
President Ion Iliescu, who is visiting Germany for the first time
since taking power in June 1990.
</P>
<P>
Romania sees closer links with the two blocs as a "major
diplomatic objective," Iliescu said.
</P>
<P>
Herzog also thanked Iliescu for supporting the 85,000-strong
German community in Romania, saying it helped give Romania a
positive image in the hearts of Germans and was an important link
in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Iliescu, who hailed Germany as Europe's largest economic power
and Romania's most important trading partner, briefed Herzog on
Romania's current economic situation.
</P>
<P>
He said the economy was showing an encouraging
improvement. Gross domestic product, a measure of economic growth,
grew by an estimated 6.9 percent last year, far exceeding the two
to three percent forecast by international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
German exports to Romania jumped 28 percent to 2.6 billion
German marks (1.7 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995, while imports
from Romania rose 18 percent to 2.1 billion marks (1.36 billion
dollars), figures from the German Economics Ministry show.
</P>
<P>
As of July 1995, German direct investment in Romania was valued
at 125 million marks (92 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
During Iliescu's visit, the two countries signed a reciprocal
investment protection and promotion agreement.

WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Freak weather brought snow to
Nevada and thunderstorms to Dakota and Texas on Tuesday in the
wake of a tornado in the Washington D.C. area on Monday that
toppled trees, tore off roofs and knocked out power to thousands
of homes.
</P>
<P>
Thunderstorms lashed the northern state of Dakota and Texas on
Tuesday, while light rain and snow over the eastern state of
Nevada boosted hopes of putting out a wildfire near Lake Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
In central North Dakota, thunderstorms poured four inches of
rain onto Garrison and several areas of the state were hit by
large hailstorms and damaging gusts of wind.
</P>
<P>
Strong thunderstorms moved across southeastern Texas and over
the central and southern High Plains, bringing welcome water to
the drought-stricken state.
</P>
<P>
As much as three inches of rain fell on Houston and Corpus
Christi before the storms moved off north east into Louisiana and
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, low pressure just off the California coast, caused
cool and showery weather from central California to Montana.
</P>
<P>
The inch of snow that fell overnight around Lake Tahoe
helped firefighters gain the edge on a 4,000 acre wildfire.
</P>
<P>
Cool air also brought severe thunderstorms to the Ohio Valley area
with large hail and torrential rain and causing flash floods.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, a tornado in a violent thunderstorm ripped
across the Washington area, destroying dozens of houses, toppling
trees and knocking out power to more than 220,000 people.

<HEADLINE> India to Attract More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is likely
to increase the existing ceiling of the foreign institutional
investors (FIIs) investments in listed companies in a bid to
attract more portfolio investment, it is learnt here today.
</P>
<P>
The existing limit is likely to be increased to 40 percent from
24 percent, as the existing ceiling has by now become inadequate
to attract large foreign investment, FIIs sources said.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of stock market in September 1992, the FIIs
have invested in nearly 600 listed companies in the country. Out
of this, the FIIs have already reached the 24 percent limit in
over 52 companies and in over 200 companies, their investment is
in the range of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
"As in the current financial year, the foreign portfolio
investment is expected to increase substantially, the government
is all set to make it more attractive as well as earlier for the
foreign fund managers," said a senior official in the Finance
Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Karadzic "Ready to Step Down", Says Top Serb Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 26 (Xinhua) -- A top Bosnian Serb official
strongly hinted Tuesday that Serb President Radovan Karadzic will
step down to avoid a reintroduction of international sanctions on
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Momcilo Krajisnik, President of the Assembly of the Serbian
Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina, told reporters after a meeting in
Pale with international envoy Carl Bildt.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was held to discuss the mounting international
pressure on the Serbs concerning Karadzic's running for the
September 14 elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said that although the Serbs hope the Dayton peace
agreement will be implemented, they will react strongly if
Karadzic, their most popular choice, is not allowed to run.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that he has brought Karadzic's oral promise
that the president "would certainly be ready to sacrifice his
office and above all his power if that was in the interest of the
(Serb) people."
</P>
<P>
Carl Bildt reiterated the request of the international
community that the Dayton accord must be implemented fully and
completely, and that whoever violates the agreement he will have
to pay for that.
</P>
<P>
As to the fate of Karadizc, the envoy said the Dayton agreement
has said clearly that he can not hold any public office.
</P>
<P>
If the Serbs refuse to abide by the accord, a second
international sanction might be imposed on them, the envoy said.
</P>
<P>
The Moslem-Croat Federation will also be sanctioned if they
don't release the prisoners of war as specified in agreement, the
envoy added.
</P>
<P>
In another development today, the Lawyers Association of the
Bosnia Serbs has filed a lawsuit against Bosnian Moslem leader
Alija Izetbegovic and Vice-President of the Moslem-Croat
Federation, Ejup Ganic, for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The indictment has been presented to the Sarajevo office of the
International Court of Justice, the association said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> India Projects 46 Percent Rise in Oil Import Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- India's oil import bill in
1996-97 is estimated to increase 46 percent over 1995-96, the Oil
Coordination Committee (OCC) sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The bill for the 1996-97 fiscal year (starting April 1) is
expected to touch a level of 9.5 billion US dollars compared with
around 6.5 billion dollars for 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The 46 percent increase in the oil import bill in 1996-97 has
been projected by the OCC in a note sent to the Finance Ministry
which is conducting its budget exercises.
</P>
<P>
The calculations were based on the assumption of a 7-8 percent
increase in consumption of petroleum products, a further marginal
depreciation in the value of the rupee against the US dollar and
stabilization of world oil prices at the prevailing level, the OCC
sources said.

<P>
BRUSSELS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
planned to roll out by year 2010 the so-called "clean" cars that
consume less energy and therefore emit less pollutants.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the European Commission said early today that
environment ministers from EU member nations set the target date
during arduous discussions in Luxembourg on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the Commission, the executive arm of the EU, is to
cut emissions of carbon dioxide gas by private cars to 120 grams
per kilometer by 2005 at the earliest and by 2010 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The reduction can be obtained by slashing average fuel
consumption to five litres per 100 kilometers for gasoline-powered
cars and 4.5 litres per 100 kilometers for diesel-powered cars.
</P>
<P>
Among the EU's 15 members, France, Germany, Britain, Italy and
Spain are car producing countries.

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> France Outlines G-7 Summit Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming Group of Seven (G-7)
summit will focus on the globalization of the world economy,
international situation and aid, said presidential spokeswoman
Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
She said the agenda of the three-day summit in Lyons, France,
beginning on Thursday will be divided into two clear-cut
parts: economic and political.
</P>
<P>
The economic part is expected to center on the globalization of
the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The summit of the seven most industrialized nations is going to
debate over the advantages and drawbacks of economic globalization
before an economic communique is issued.
</P>
<P>
France believes that the globalization of the world economy, on
one hand, helped boost economic liberalization and economic growth
and, on the other, poses a threat to those economies that lag
behind the globalization tempo and are unable to face the
increasingly fierce international economic competition, said
Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The summit will discuss ways of effectively curbing the
repercussions of the globalization on employment, financial
stability, international trade and aid, the spokeswoman added.
</P>
<P>
Russia will join in the political discussions, which will
include peace in Bosnia and the Middle East and the situation in
Russia, where President Boris Yeltsin faces a strong challenge of
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov in the runoff of the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Other topics cover the civilian use of nuclear power,
environmental protection, the fight against drugs and organized
crimes, Colonna said.
</P>
<P>
The summit will adopt a "political declaration" and put forward
more than 40 recommendations on how to fight organized crimes, she
said.
</P>
<P>
Colonna stressed the importance of Russia's participation in
these talks, saying that without Russia, talks on nuclear safety,
fight against organized crimes and environment would become
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin will arrive in Lyons at the interval of the two rounds
of presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac, who is going to chair a G-7
summit for the first time, also invited U.N. Secretary-General
Boutrous Boutrous-Ghali, World Bank President James Wolfensohn,
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Michel Camdessus and
World Trade Organization Director-General Renato Ruggiero to
discuss debt relief, aid and trade.

</P>
<P>
These three countries have been commended for taking action
through new laws enacted to punish those guilty of child abuse.
</P>
<P>
They said that some trials have received full publicity which
should act as a deterrent to those foreigners who have been
abusing children.
</P>
<P>
The ECPAT has also launched a program to work closely with the
Interpol and national police forces to prosecute child abusers,

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Blow up Colombian Oil Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- An oil pipeline in
northern Colombia was blown up by guerrillas today, spilling about
8,000 barrels of crude that threaten to pollute one of the
country's most important rivers, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
The attack damaged the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline which
carries 220,000 barrels of oil per day from the Cano Limon fields
to the Caribbean port of Covenas.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline has been attacked at least 17 times this year by
National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas in Norte de Santander
province.
</P>
<P>
Television reports said that it was one of the worst attacks so
far because the spilled oil threatens to leak from tributaries
into the Rio Magdalena, a major river system and important source
of food throughout northern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, founded by radical Roman Catholic priests in 1966, is
Colombia's second largest guerrilla group.

<HEADLINE> Closer Asian-European Cooperation Conducive: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here today that more exchanges and closer cooperation
between Asia and Europe will be conducive to the establishment of
a new international political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet hosted in his honor by Spanish Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar this evening, Jiang said the Chinese
government and people value and treasure the existing good
relations between China and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who arrived here Tuesday on a four-day state visit, said
that China is willing to work together with Spain for a long-term
stable relationship of bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the banquet, Jiang briefed the hosts on China's reform and
open policies, economic achievements and the outlines of its 9th
five-year plan and long-term development targets.
</P>
<P>
With reform, development and stability, Jiang said, China will
be able to increase exchanges with the rest of the world and
provide ample opportunities for foreign investors, especially
those from Asia and Europe, and to play a more active role in
maintaining world peace, stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Aznar said that developing relations with China is a priority
of the long-term strategy of both the European Union and Spain.
</P>
<P>
Since China and Spain established diplomatic ties in 1973,
bilateral cooperation in the economic, trade and cultural fields
has expanded rapidly, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that exchange of visits by high ranking
officials of the two countries have deepened friendship and
cooperation, and Jiang's visit will become a catalyst in boosting
bilateral relations in all fields.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Urges G7 to Give More Aid to Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called on western leaders attending Friday's G7 summit in
Lyons, France, to pledge more aid to the developing world.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told reporters that industrialized powers should realize
that it is their duty to channel more assistance to the developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to do his utmost to press his counterparts from the
Group of Seven (G-7) most industrialized nations -- the United
States, Japan, Germany, France, Canada and Britain, Italy -- into
digging deeper into their pockets.
</P>
<P>
Aid from Western nations has been on the decline for two years
running, a report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD) said in early June.
</P>
<P>
Last year, developed countries within the OECD provided 59
billion U.S. dollars in aid to the developing ones, 9.3 percent
less than in 1994, which was already 8 percent down on 1993.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette in a speech to the
National Assembly notably criticized the United States for its
continued slashing of its foreign aid program.
</P>
<P>
The United States, offering only 7.3 billion dollars of aid
last year, made the deepest cut in its foreign aid program.
</P>
<P>
France was the second largest aid donor among all Western
nations with a 8.4 billion dollar program in 1995, following Japan
which provided 14.5 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Allows Temporary Stay of Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government Tuesday
officially agreed to allow the temporary stay of some 700,000
illegal immigrant workers in 39 provinces to help ease the severe
labor shortage in the country, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under a cabinet decision, the immigrants will be allowed to
work for up to two years while waiting for deportation.
</P>
<P>
The Labor and Social Welfare Ministry will soon begin to
register foreign laborers, which will continue until June 1997.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers today quoted Thai labor officials as saying
that a law would be enacted soon to provide employment protection
and equal benefits for registered immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Thai Employer Association, the
country is currently short of about 1.36 million workers, mainly
in the sectors of farming, fishing, construction, mining,
transportation, and industry.
</P>
<P>
Admitting that the legal recognition of immigrant workers would
have an impact on local workers, Thai labor officials said the new
measure is the only way to effectively monitor and control illegal
immigrant workers.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Thai Labor and Social Welfare Minister Prasong
Boonpong has said that all illegal immigrants will be deported
when their two-year employment term ends.

<HEADLINE> IPR Graduates from Beijing University Badly Demanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China's first school dedicated to
the instruction of intellectual property rights (IPR) couldn't
meet the demands of employers this year, as its first group of
graduates had already been employed.
</P>
<P>
"Various employers kept coming up for more students," said Zhu
Qichao, vice-president of the IPR College of Beijing University
(Beida), one of China's most prestigious universities.
</P>
<P>
Some employers will wait till next year, when the second group
of students graduates from the school, he added.
</P>
<P>
Four of its 40 graduates who received double majors or master's
degrees already had signed work contracts with employers from
Shenzhen, the China's first special economic zone in southern
Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
The rest will work in Beijing for ministries or departments
such as the State Science and Technology Commission, the State
Trademark Bureau, the Bureau of Legislative Affairs of the State
Council, and the China Council for the Promotion of International
Trade.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1993, Beida IPR College was the first of its
kind among China's 1,057 colleges and universities. The school
trains professionals who specialize in IPR theory, science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years, the IPR College has hosted academic
seminars on the relationship between commercialized inventions
and industries in Asia, and also workshops on academic exchanges
regarding IPR protection across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that students who graduate from his school are
prepared to work for legislative, judicial, and law-enforcement
departments, or other enterprises that need their expertise.
</P>
<P>
He believed China's IPR professionals' inability to meet the
demand of employers was a sign that the sense of IPR protection
has been improved in Chinese society, and that the government has
made great achievements in its IPR protection system.

residents' real wages.
</P>

He promised that pension payments will be indexed with price
hikes and support will be given to poor regions.
</P>
<P>
Horn's promise came amid increasing public discontent with the
performance of his government.

<P>
Many economists noted that Hungarians will not fare better
unless the national income, which now inches up by only 1-2
percent a year, grows by 5-6 percent annually.

SHANTOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Shantou Port recently accommodated
a 20,000-dwt ship, an achievement that highlights the improvements
made to this major port in south China.
</P>
<P>
Though well-placed in the Shantou Special Economic Zone,
Shantou Port previously could only handle smaller ships less than
10,000 tons, due to the accumulation of silt. A few years ago,
port authorities dredged the main channels in a drive to deepen
the port.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project has been completed, and includes
a coal terminal capable of containing 35,000-dwt ships, a
multi-function berth for 20,000-dwt ships, and a berth for
15,000-dwt sundry goods carriers.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000-dwt ship -- the Red Flag 124 -- arrived from
Qinhuangdao Port in north China. It was loaded with coal.
</P>
<P>
The Shantou Port has established business ties with 210 ports
in 47 countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> 200 Million Child Workers Worldwide, ICFTU Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Up to 200 million children are
illegally employed worldwide, concentrated in unskilled jobs and
heavily exploited, a world trade union group reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a report entitled "No Time To Play," the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) listed examples of
child labor in 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
The incidents included 7-year-olds working in glass furnaces in
India, 8-year-old boys cutting sugar cane in the Dominican
Republic, and youngsters kidnapped into slavery by camel drivers
in Mauritania.
</P>
<P>
Although most of the cases emerged from the less developed
Third World, the report stressed that the problem was also growing
in North America and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 minors were forced to work in the United States,
ICFTU quoted the 1990 figures from the U.S. Department of Labor as
saying. In Britain, an estimated 5,000 children and adolescents
are working in prostitution.
</P>
<P>
Children sewing shoes illegally in Portugal were reportedly
getting 50 cents for a pair that sells for 70 U.S. dollars in

<HEADLINE> New Deal Sets Latin American Trade Bloc on Expansion Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, June 25 (Xinhua) -- South America's biggest trade
bloc Mercosur has signed a free-trade pact with Chile and a
similar deal with Bolivia is expected in the next 90 days.
</P>
<P>
Although neither country will become a full member of the bloc,
which has a market of more than 200 million consumers, the move is
seen as part of a drive toward Latin American integration and
could pave the way for other countries to join the union,
currently made up of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
"This is a signal that in this corner of Latin America we are
creating an emerging market of world-class importance," Chilean
President Eduardo Frei said during the signing ceremony attended
by the presidents of the six countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the deal would create hundreds of thousands of new
jobs and bring major long-term trade benefits to the country.
</P>
<P>
Chile will reduce tariffs on its bilateral trade with Mercosur
by 40 percent from October, and will eliminate them completely
within eight years, although tariffs on more sensitive goods will
fall more gradually over 10 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, hammered out after two years of negotiations,
will come into effect on October 1, 1996, provided it is ratified
by the Chilean Congress.
</P>
<P>
Chile's incorporation has been long sought by Argentina in
particular, which is keen to use its neighbor as a bridge for
Mercosur exports to Asia via the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Bolivia, which will reduce tariffs on 80 percent
of its bilateral trade, pledged to finalize the terms of its entry
within 90 days. Its formal association will begin on January 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Bolivian President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada welcomed his
country's link up with Mercosur, saying it would help the
land-locked country boost its exports.
</P>
<P>
"Bolivia used to function at a disadvantage because it had no
exit to the sea, but now we have access to both the Atlantic and
the Pacific," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, which stands for the South American Common Market,
is the world's fourth largest trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
It is a customs union with a common external tariff for
imports from countries outside the block and aims to enlist all
South American countries before linking up with the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which incorporates the U.S., Canada
and Mexico, by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
At the summit, the presidents also signed a clause which
requires all member nations to be democratically governed. Under
the agreement, Mercosur would impose sanctions on any country or
associate where the democratic process was interrupted.
</P>
<P>
The clause was promptedy by Paraguay's crisis in April when a
rebellious army general brought the country to the brink of a
military coup.

<P>
YICHANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China is conducting an experiment
on the Qingjiang River basin in central China's Hubei Province,
aimed at reshaping the country's administrative system of
investment in hydro-electric power development.
</P>
<P>
The Qingjiang is the Yangtze River's nearest branch to the
Three Gorges in Hubei Province, and is 423 kilometres long. There
are many good sites along the Qingjiang Basin for dams for
hydro-electric power plants.
</P>
<P>
There are two big power stations to be started soon in the
river basin, involving in a total investment of 13.7 billion
yuan. Construction of the two will provide opportunities for
overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
China's State Council has decided that a company with limited
responsibilities will be set up for the development of power
plants on the river.
</P>
<P>
Investment will mainly come from profits of the Geheyan
Hydro-Power Station, which is operating with a generating capacity
of 1.21 million kw, according the Wang Dingguo, manager of the
Qingjiang Hydro-Power Development Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The company will also try to attract two billion yuan in
overseas investment for development of power plants in the basin.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Urged to Probe Into Black Church Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (xinhua) -- Bishops of the largest black
denomination in the United States said Tuesday they want to meet
with President Bill Clinton and federal officials to discuss the
fires that have destroyed a string of black churches in the south.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see the full measure of government behind getting
to the bottom of this," Ecumenical Bishop H. Hartford Brookins of
Los Angeles was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
While praising the government's recent attention to the fires
that have burned more than 40 churches, since January 1995,
Brookins said, "It seems rather improper that it can be explained
away by saying that there is not some sinister conspiracy,"
Brookins said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met last week with Southern governors to look for ways
to stop the fires, and a joint federal-state task force has been
urged to spare no expense probing their causes.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, there is no evidence of conspiracy, but there
is clear evidence of racism," Attorney General Janet Reno said
Monday in Detroit. "And I think it is so important for us all, no
matter where we are in this country, to speak out and to join
forces against it."

<HEADLINE> "Mad Cow" Crisis to Cost Britain 3.8 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain will have to pay 2.5
billion pounds (about 3.85 billion U.S. dollars) over the next
three years for compensation schemes for the "mad cow" crisis, a
government official said today.
</P>
<P>
"We have looked at the consequences of all the schemes and I
can inform the House that the cost over three years will in fact
be 2.5 billion," junior agriculture minister Angela Browning told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Britain is under a ban imposed in March by the European Union
(EU) on British beef exports amid fears that the "mad cow" disease
could be transferred to humans.
</P>
<P>
Since then, many British farmers have been facing financial
difficulties and the nation's beef export industry has collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit in Florence last week promised to ease the ban
step by step although no specified date was given. Prime Minister
John Major said he expected some movement by November.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, Britain agreed to meet EU conditions to prove that
its beef is safe to eat.

<HEADLINE> People in Guizhou's Barren Areas Escape Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Bijie Prefecture in southwest
China's Guizhou Province has become the epitome of a program that
helps destitute people in barren areas escape poverty by improving
the local environment.
</P>
<P>
Located at the juncture of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou
provinces, Bijie has the typical karst formations of the upper
reaches of the Yangtze River, and more than 93 percent of its land
is on a plateau or is mountainous.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, the area suffers from natural disasters,
such as flooding, drought, and hailstorms.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the central government designated Bijie as one of the
pilot areas in its drive to get rid of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Seven years of work has given Bijie a new look. More than 3,500
square kilometers of water and soil erosion have been curbed,
about 70,000 ha of mountainous slopes have been terraced, nearly
30,000 ha of low-yield farmland have been improved, and more than
6,700 ha of irrigated paddy fields have been added.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate of agricultural output and total grain
output in the prefecture has maintained nine percent and five
percent respectively, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
More than two-third of the destitute people in Bijie, or more
than two million, have got rid of poverty and have adequate food
and clothing.

<HEADLINE> Site of Ancient Battlefield Becomes International Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 technicians and
management personnel from 49 countries and regions have come to
Mengjin, site of a battle 3,000 years ago, to attend the
inauguration ceremony of the construction of the Xiaolangdi water
control project.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the project, designed for the control of
flooding in the Yellow River, is backed by a one-billion-US-dollar
loan from the World Bank and has called for international bidding.
</P>
<P>
As many as 34 contractors from four continents took part in the
bidding in August of 1993, and 14 of them won the bidding by July
1994. They formed three joint corporations and came to the
Xiaolangdi construction site in Mengjin in central China's Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
The once bleak and desolate mountain valley has become a
cosmopolitan gathering place with the arrival of foreign
technicians and their dependents.
</P>
<P>
Coming into the village, one can see rows of white single-story
houses along the mountain slopes with green grass in front of
them, and flowers growing in the yards. Cobblestone roads zigzag
around the houses, and road signs in different languages direct
people to such-and-such a swimming pool, hospital, laundry,
football field, hotel, bar, and golf course.
</P>
<P>
"We have built more than 40 residences and 48 dormitories at
our campsite," said Danile Michele, general service manager of
Italy's Impiegilo Corporation.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this campsite has people from 28 countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
All facilities at the campsite were built in accordance with
urban planning and a school has been built for the children.
</P>
<P>
The school gets its teachers from Italy while the foreigners
have shown great interest in traditional Chinese culture. They
have invited a Chinese instructor to teach the traditional Chinese
shadow boxing to more than 20 foreign students.
</P>
<P>
The campsite has hired more than 100 local laborers who
co-operate and communicate frequently with the foreign
friends. "We co-operate with each other delightfully just like a
big family," Michele explained.
</P>
<P>
Mr Massimo Malvagna, project manager for Italy's corporation,
said delightedly, "I have come to love the Yellow River and
Xiaolangdi since I came here in March 1994. I became familiar with
the working staff of the project, co-operating successfully with
them."

<P>
The winning time was 0.05 seconds faster than the 9.92 of
Trinidad's Ato Boldon and American Dennis Mitchell set earlier
this month and, until Tuesday, the season's best legal marks.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Zoo Has Two New Cubs of David's Deer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Two David's deer living in the
Beijing Zoo recently became mothers to two fawns, one male and one
female, the first successful breeding reported by the zoo in the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
The rare species is found only in China. David's deer used to
live in the mid and lower reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) raised a group of David's deer in
southern part of Beijing during the 18th century, but the animals
were destroyed by floods and the invasion of imperialist troops
early in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
"The four David's deer first raised by the Beijing Zoo were
sent to Britain from Beijing during that period. They were sent
back to China by a British Zoo in the mid 1980s," said Feng
Youqian, head of the Beijing Zoo.
</P>
<P>
"This legendary experience has made them even more famous than
the Giant Pandas and Golden Monkeys, and the country has placed
them under the first-category protection," he added.
</P>
<P>
The fawns each weighing about ten kg. They are orange with
white spots.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Federation Rejects Coach's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Croatia's soccer federation
rejected coach Miroslav Blazevic's resignation Tuesday in Zagreb,
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The coach decided to resign after the team's exit at the
European Soccer Championships, but the federation said that he
must honour a legal contract.
</P>
<P>
"Blazevic has signed a contract with the Croatian football
federation. That contract is a law that must be respected,"
federation deputy director Vlatko Markovic said.
</P>
<P>
Blazevic said announced his withdrawl before leaving
London. Croatia was edged by Germany 1-2 in a quarter-final match
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers quoted Blazevic as saying he had been forced
to quit by hostile fans and media. "Now you'll have a new coach to
blame." the furious coach said.
</P>
<P>
After taking over as Croatia coach in March 1994, Blazevic
scored an impressive record of 16 wins against just three defeats.
</P>
<P>
Blazevic's decision to rest several key players for the group
match against Portugal drew widespread criticism in Croatia. The
3-0 defeat meant a quarter-final clash with the favourites
Germany.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Crashes out of Wimbledon Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, June 25 (Xinhua/OANA) -- The fifth seeded
Russian tennis super star Yevgeny Kafelikov crashed out of the
first round clashes of the on-going 1996 Wimbledon Tennis
Championships here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, who just grabbed the French Tennis Open singles
title earlier this month, was beaten by the 21-year-old British
player Tim Henman 7-6, 6-3, 6-7, 4-6, 7-5 at the Center Court,
becomning the fourth major seed out of the Championships.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, top American big names Andre Agassi,
Michael Chang and Jim Courier were also defeated at the first
hurdles of the Wimbledon Championships, becoming a majer upset in
the Wimbledon history.
</P>
<P>
The young British top player, which was in superb form today,
launched fierce and effective attacks upon Kafelnikov, who was
obviously caught off-guard and made some stupid errors.
</P>
<P>
Under deafening cheers from thousands British tennis fans at
the Center Court, Henman quickly took the first two sets by 7-6,
6-3 and was seen only step to upsetting the super Russian star in
the 3rd set.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial moment, the French Open Champions plugged up
his spirits and stormed back with hard volleys and won back two
sets by 7-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
At the fifth set, the inspring British player saved two match
points and it was the Russian who faltered at the last minute,
allowing Henman to wrap up a magnificent 7-5 win.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the game, Kafelikov said, "I think I didn't
respond well on those two match points. I didn't concentrate and
that was a mistake."
</P>
<P>
"I feel a little bit frustrated but I have to take it. I am
going to try and forget about this tragic day," he said, adding
that he was to concentrate on the doubles.
</P>
<P>
In comparison with the tragic situation of the top men's
tennis stars, the women's top seeds continued to enjoyed a
comfortable sailing into the next round.
</P>
<P>
The world number one and defending Champion Steffi Graf made a
successful start in fighting for a seventh Wimbledon singles title
by defeating her Czech opponent Ludmila Richterova 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
However, the top seed seemed not in her prime form in today's
clashes and she later told reporter, "I am lacking match play,
this is why it took me a little bit to get into the match."
</P>
<P>
Also in today's women's singles matches, fourth seeded Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario of Spain and fifth seeded German Anke Huber
trounced their opponets in straight sets.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen B-share Market Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors opened more
than 8,000 accounts to trade in the B-share market in Shenzhen
over the first five months this year, and from June 10 to 14, the
B-share sub-index surged by nearly 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that investors' enthusiasm over the market has
been re-ignited, a local analyst pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Since last year the special economic zone in south China's
Guangdong Province has unveiled a series of measures to
re-invigorate the local securities market.
</P>
<P>
It has required enterprises to issue no less than 50 million
B-shares each, made plans to select large, high-quality firms from
a wider range as listing candidates, set up a central clearance
system and reduced trading expenses.
</P>
<P>
A special group has also been set up to breathe new life into
the local B-share, strictly for overseas investors, market.
</P>
<P>
"We will give full play to the advantages of Shenzhen as a
neighbor of Hong Kong, an international financial center, and
grasp opportunities resulting from the return of Hong Kong in
1997, " said Liu Xinhua, head of the group.
</P>
<P>
"And we will seriously analyse problems emerging on the market,
further upgrade trading, clearance and information disclosure
systems, improve trading services, and encourage companies to
operate following suit of those listed on the Hong Kong securities
market," he added.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Shenzhen B-share market is playing host to 15
foreign securities firms and over 80 foreign brokerages,
accounting firms, law firms and other intermediary institutions,
of which 85 percent are based in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"The B-share market will further strengthen relations between
the securities markets in Hong Kong and Shenzhen," an analyst said.
</P>
<P>
In April, legislature in Shenzhen proposed to actively promote
linkage between the two stock markets, list B-share firms on the
Shenzhen bourse on the Hong Kong stock exchange, and list some
China-related shares in Hong Kong on the Shenzhen exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The dual listing of B-share companies will surely spur trading
in their shares and more widely expose the Shenzhen securities
market to the world," said the analyst.
</P>
<P>
It's estimated, due to the close economic relations between
Hong Kong and Shenzhen, more than ten billion Hong Kong dollars
are circulating in south China.
</P>
<P>
"The large sum of money will produce unestimable impact on the
Shenzhen B-share market, which is denominated in Hong Kong
dollars," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Technological Push for Brand-name Garments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- China's largest metropolis, is
increasing the use of technology to increase the amount of
brand-name garments to 50 percent of output from the present 30
percent, in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The city also intends to raise the proportion of ready-made
clothes to 80 percent from the present 40 percent, a municipal
official in charge of the industry said.
</P>
<P>
"When the goal is met, Shanghai, which is a leading garment
producer, will be able to turn out more beautiful clothes for
people all over the country, and export more," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The recently-restructured Shanghai Textiles Holdings Group,
which is a leading power in the garment industry, has announced
that it will take a "three brand-name" strategy (brand-name
products, persons, and factories) in its new round of market
expansion.
</P>
<P>
The industry's success also comes from learning from foreign
counterparts and buying more advanced equipment and technology
abroad, the official said.

<HEADLINE> 800-Year-Old Copper Coins Unearthed in Jiangxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 kilograms of copper
coins that date back 800 years have been unearthed in Huilong
Village, Chenggang Township, Xingguo County, in east China's
Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The coins were discovered on June 17 when 100 villagers were
digging holes for fruit trees on a hillside. They had been buried
in a cellar that was 80 centimeters by two meters deep.
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists, the earliest coins were issued
from 713 to 714, the first year of the Xuanzong emperor of the
Tang Dynasty (618-907) and the latest ones, during the reign of
the Gaozong emperor (1131-1162) of the Southern Song Dynasty
(1127-1279).
</P>
<P>
The find consists of 40 types of coins issued over 400
years. The archaeologists expressed the belief that the coins will
help in the study of economic growth, changes in coins, and
calligraphy 800 years ago.

NEW YORK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks recovered mostly
from early losses of the day, with the Dow Jones industrial average
edging 1.48 points higher to 5,719.27.

<P>
The tiny gain in the blue-chip measure was its fifth straight
advance, for a total of about 91 points.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares slid sharply again today on worries about
computer industry profits, but a late surge trimmed most losses in
other sectors.

Declining issues outnumbered advances by a 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 388.99 million
shares.

Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.37 to 668.48.

Technology shares dragged down the struggling Nasdaq and
American stock markets, amid growing worries about the prospects
for disappointing profits in the computer sector.

The Nasdaq composite index fell 10.32 to 1,172.58, and the

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outraged at Explosion in US Airbase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
outraged at the truck bombing in a U.S. airbase in Saudi Arabia,
which caused a great number of casualties, has vowed to punish
those who committed the murderous act.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement from the White House, Clinton said the
bombing in Saudi Arabia "appeared to be the work of terrorists."
</P>
<P>
"Our best information at this time is that there have been many
injuries and apparently some fatalities.... The cowards who
committed this murderous act must not go unpunished," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will pursue this," he said. "America takes care of her own.
This will not go unpunished."
</P>
<P>
The explosion was said to be caused by a truck bomb at the King
Abdul-Aziz airbase in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, at 10:30 local time,
where is deployed part of the 4,404th Wing of Southwest Asia who
participate in a coalition of forces monitoring U.N. resolutions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
French and British forces also reside on the facility which is
operated by the Saudis.
</P>
<P>
No accurate figures of casualties are available, but some U.S.
officials said the bombing had killed two to four people and
injured as many as 60.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. officials said two men, driving a fuel truck towards
the compound, were told by Saudi security guards to move their
truck as they tried to drive into the northern end of the
compound.
</P>
<P>
The two men then may have walked away from the truck, and got
into another vehicle as the truck exploded.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred less than a month after the Saudis
beheaded four militants convicted of setting off a car bomb last
Nov. 13 at a U.S.-run military training facility, killing five
Americans and two Indians.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's nine industrial zones,
set up on its outskirts in the 1990s, are playing a key role in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The zones have imported more than 1,500 projects, involving a
total investment of 30 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
At least 436 industrial enterprises have now gone into
production, generating an output value totalling eight billion
yuan and profits and taxes amounting to 650 million yuan last
year. The output value is expected to reach at least 12 billion
yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The industrial zones cover 150 square kilometers, 15 square
kilometers of which are provided with better infrastructural
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Featuring different industries including high-tech, automobile,
a combination of machinery and electric equipment, new building
materials and iron and steel, the industrial zones have become
favored places for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan about one third of industrial enterprises
in downtown Shanghai will move to the outskirts in the coming 15
years.

<HEADLINE> WTO Maritime Talks Most Likely to Be Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have generally agreed to suspend their current
negotiations on an international trade agreement to liberalize
shipping services which faces a self-imposed deadline of June 30.
</P>
<P>
However, officials emerging from a formal meeting the WTO
maritime negotiating group also told reporters today that they
were still divided on how long the talks should be suspended.
</P>
<P>
Hopes to reach a deal before the deadline were dashed earlier
this month when the United States walked away from the talks by
refusing to put forward a market-opening offer.
</P>
<P>
The WTO-sponsored talks, one of the unfinished work left over
from the 1986-1993 Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations,
were aimed to lower barriers and expand trade in ocean shipping,
port use and port services, a market worth more than 100 billion
U.S. dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
After months of haggling, the United States said on June 18
that Washington stood by its earlier decision not to submit an
offer in the talks because the market-opening offers on the table
from the 42 participating parties were not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Without U.S. participation, an agreement cannot be reached,
negotiators had said previously.
</P>
<P>
After separate informal consultations with the participating
parities since last Friday, Don Kenyon, the Australian WTO
ambassador who chaired the negotiating group, submitted today a
proposal suggesting that the negotiations be suspended on June 30
and be resumed at the earliest date as feasible and no later than
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials said Kenyon's proposal was generally supported
by Japan, which favored a prolongation of the present talks
earlier, as well as the European Union and the Southeast Asian
countries. Brazil favored a resumption in two years.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, said they were willing to consider
a suspension on condition that the negotiations are resumed no
earlier than the year 2000 when the next round of WTO-sponsored
multilateral trade talks kicks off.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, New Zealand and Canada said the realistic timing to
resume the talks would be the year 2000, according to trade
officials.
</P>
<P>
Kenyon today also proposed to consolidate the current offers on
the table, by which he meant that the offers should apply as firm
commitments which could be modified or withdrawn in the context of
the resumed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
This idea, however, found less support from the negotiating
parties with the EU saying that it would be impossible to make
commitment in the absence of a truly multilateral package.
</P>
<P>
A positive development today came from Cuba and Iceland which
tabled their own offers to the meeting, bringing the total offers
on the table to 24.
</P>
<P>
A final decision on the fate of the maritime talks is expected
to be made at the next formal negotiating group meeting scheduled
for Thursday or Friday.

<HEADLINE> China Attaches Importance to Economic Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here today that the Chinese government attaches great importance
to economic relations with Spain, which is the cornerstone in
building long-term, stable and cooperative ties between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar this
evening, Jiang said that although China and Spain differ in social
system, cultural tradition and economic development level, they
can push their relations forward steadily if the two sides abide
by the principles of seeking common ground while reserving
differences, strengthening cooperation, equality and mutual
benefit.
</P>
<P>
"We hold that China and Spain must handle their relations from
the high plane of strategy and have their eyes on the 21st
century. We are willing, together with Spain, to forge long-term,
stable and mutually beneficial cooperative relations between the
two countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president arrived here Monday for a four-day state
visit to Spain, the first leg of his current six European and
central Asian nation tour which will also take him to Norway,
Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhastan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said Spain has played a more and more important role in
the international arena these years and China and Spain have
shared identical or similar views on many major international
issues.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the Spanish government will make new efforts in
promoting friendly relations between the two countries in all
domains, thus raising bilateral cooperation to a new level both in
depth and width," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also noted the Chinese and Spanish economies are
complementary to each other with huge potential remaining to be
tapped. "We hope that both sides will make joint efforts to
explore and probe new domains and ways in cooperation to further
enhance economic and trade relations between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Spain, President Jiang has held talks with
Spanish parliament leaders and met with local business and
financial leaders.

<HEADLINE> Solana: New War Must Be Prevented in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General Javier
Solana today called on the international community to take
necessary actions to prevent the resumption of the Bosnia war.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a responsibility that war does not resume
again. I'm sure that the international community will...prevent
that from happening," Solana told a breakfast meeting with
reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that he did not believe war would recur in the
former Yugoslav republic when the NATO-led 60,000 peace
implementation forces pull out from the country at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
Solana also noted that if an international force were needed
after the planned withdrawal from the Balkan country at the end of
this year, it would be a separate operation from the current
mission.
</P>
<P>
The NATO leader made the remarks after meeting with
high-ranking U.S. officials including U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and Defense Secretary William Perry.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the need to "maintain a strong deterrent
capacity in Bosnia," Solana declined to cite how many NATO troops
might be involved in the fellow-up mission.
</P>
<P>
He said that serious consideration and decision-making would
take place only after Bosnian elections are held in mid-September.

WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- A truck bomb has exploded in a
housing area at the King Abdul-Aziz airbase in Saudi Arabia, where
125 U.S. Air Force personnel work, U.S. Air Force Secretary Sheila
Windnall told the House National Security Committee today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department said there were up to 60
casualties caused by the explosion but they could not immediately
confirm any fatalities.
</P>

U.S. officials said two men, driving a fuel truck towards the
compound, were told by Saudi security guards to move their truck
as they tried to drive into the northern end of the compound.
The two men then walked away from the truck and got into another

</P>
<P>
The bombing occurred at 9:55 p.m. local time today.
</P>
<P>
"Some buildings housing American service members have been
damaged and there are some U.S. casualties," the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency actions were under way to treat the injured and to
assess the extent of damage, and U.S. and Saudi Arabian officials
are making investigations into the bombing, said a statement
issued by the Central Command, which oversees U.S. forces in Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
said U.S. officials in Dhahran would help the Saudis track down
those who "committed this crime."

<HEADLINE> Shabby Schools Throughout US: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. General Accounting
Office (GAO) reported today that children across the country are
enduring inadequate public school buildings and there are shabby
schools in every state.
</P>
<P>
Such problems as faulty roofs, leaky plumbing and broken-down
heating systems are most widespread in big cities and the West,
said the report following a study conducted by GAO, an auditing
and investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, in secondary schools, buildings house
600 or more students and in schools serving poor and minority
students, the problems are worse.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, the GAO report said, 38 percent of schools
reported at least one inadequate building. The figure was 30
percent for rural areas and 29 percent for suburban areas.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 67 percent of inner-city schools, serving nearly
10 million students, reported the need to repair or replace
plumbing, heating or foundations.
</P>
<P>
Congress in 1994 approved 100 million dollars for building,
repairing and renovating schools, but it cut the money in 1995
to help balance the budget.
</P>
<P>
Even that 100 million dollars in federal money would not be
sufficient. In a similar report in February 1995, the GAO said it
would cost about 111 billion dollars to repair schools nationwide.
</P>

In many schools, buildings are as old as 75 years. In New York
City, for example, the average age of schools is 56. In the rest
of the state, school buildings were built an average of 38 years
ago. Most of the aged school buildings have the problems of leaky
roofs, rundown boilers and electrical wiring.
</P>
<P>
Urban school districts spend about 3.5 percent of their budgets
on maintenance, but 85 percent of that is spent on emergency
repairs.
</P>
<P>
"In one urban district, the small amount allocated was only
adequate to paint classrooms every 100 years and replace floor
coverings every 50 years," the latest GAO report said.
</P>
<P>
"America's schools are literally falling down," New York
Democratic Representative Nita M. Lowey said. "We simply cannot
prepare America's children for the 21st century in 19th century
schools."

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Illicit Drugs Eradication </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Wang
Xuexian today called for strengthened international cooperation to
eradicate the "social evil" of drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the high-level segment of the substantive session of
the Economic and Social Council, Wang said that the international
community is still confronted with a grim situation of rampant
spread of drugs.
</P>
<P>
"Drug crimes have extended from such traditional activities as
illicit cultivation, production, sale, traffic and distribution of
drugs to smuggling of chemical precursors, money-laundering and
corruption. Drug-related violence and other criminal activities
and the number of patients infected by taking drugs have been
increasing steadily," he said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the United Nations estimated that 122 billion
dollars were accumulated annually from cocaine, heroin and
cannabis during the late 1980s while some 150 million people
worldwide had incurred significant health risks as a result of
using psychoactive substances.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador put forward the following measures for
international drug control cooperation:
</P>
<P>
-- combating drugs is the common responsibility of drug
producing, consuming and transit countries, which calls for joint
efforts at national, regional and international levels with
national efforts as the basis;
</P>
<P>
-- the developing countries which face more and greater
difficulties in their struggle against drugs should receive more
financial and technical assistance from the international
cooperation; and
</P>
<P>
-- the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each and every
country should be strictly respected. No one should interfere in
the internal affairs of other countries under the pretext of
anti-drug cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government attaches great importance
to drug control and adheres to an anti-drug policy of placing
equal emphasis on the prohibition of sale, cultivation and
consumption of drugs, eliminating the sources of drugs and
enforcing the law strictly so as to bring the drug problem under
permanent control.

<HEADLINE> Spanish PM Stresses Importance of Keeping Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria
Aznar said today that it is of vital importance for Spain and
China to keep friendly cooperative ties and the momentum of
high-level mutual visits.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Aznar
said the Spanish government "has been pursuing a friendly and
constructive policy toward China and hopes to keep and further
develop such cooperative relations" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Aznar, who was sworn in as the new prime minister last month,
also said the active development of Spanish-Chinese relations "is
the consensus of all political parties" in his country and the new
government will continue its efforts to "raise the bilateral
relations to a new level."
</P>
<P>
President Jiang arrived here Monday for a four-day official
visit to Spain, the first leg of his current six European and
central Asian nation tour.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish prime minister said economic and trade relations
between Spain and China have developed rapidly over the past few
years and Spanish enterprises have done business successfully in
some joint ventures in China.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish business circles also hope to further increase
their investment in China, particularly in central and western
regions, which gains full support and encouragement from the
Spanish government, including financial help, Aznar said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the two governments will keep frequent contacts and
probe new ways in economic cooperation," he added.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Spain, President Jiang has held talks with
Spanish parliament leaders and met with local business and
financial leaders.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Confidence Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Consumer Confidence, an index
measuring the market mood and produced by a private research group
here, slid to 97.6 this month, representing a loss of almost six
points from May.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board reported today that most of the drop in
confidence can be attributed to the decline in the "Present
Situation" component. The monthly consumer confidence survey is
based on a representative sample of 5,000 U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
"The decline in confidence is not alarming," said Edgar
Fielder, vice president of the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the confidence index continues to suggest economic
growth for the months ahead, though not robust growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Looking six months ahead, consumers are somewhat more
pessimistic. A larger proportion than in May anticipate business
conditions will worsen. Regarding the employment outlook, however,
only slightly more consumers feel fewer jobs will become available
over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
As for expectations regarding their families' incomes,
consumers are less positive than in May. A somewhat greater
proportion expect a decrease, according to the research company.

<HEADLINE> UN Recommends Strengthened Police Presence in Croatia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali has recommended that the professional police
presence be strengthened in the former Serb-controlled areas in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali said that
measures taken thus far by the Croatian government to provide
security to Serb residents in Krajina and other former
Serb-controlled areas have been insufficient.
</P>
<P>
"The prevailing lawlessness, particularly in the area around
Knin, clearly demands that additional steps be taken and
especially that the professional police presence be strengthened,"
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the government's failure thus far to
provide reasonable security in these areas has not created
conditions likely to encourage the return of Croatian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
While 7,000 Serb refugees are reported to have received
approval to return, this total is slight when compared with
200,000 persons who fled in the summer of 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. report was made under the request of Council
Resolution 1009 and 1019. The two resolutions were adopted
following Croatia's military operations of May and August 1995, by
which the government regained control of formerly Serb-controlled
areas of territory, located in Western Slavonia and Krajina
region, that have been designated U.N. Protected Areas.
</P>
<P>
In the resolutions, the council demanded, inter alia, that
the government of Croatia respect fully the rights of the local
Serb population in the areas, including their right to remain,
leave or return in safety, take urgent measures to put an end to
all violations of international humanitarian law and human
rights in the areas and investigate all reports of such
violations so that those responsible for such acts could be
judged and punished.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR, Malaysia Close Camp for Vietnamese Boat-People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 25 (Xinhua) -- The office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and Malaysian authorities today
closed Malaysia's last camp for Vietnamese boat-people, ending 21
years of cooperation in which more than a quarter-million people
transited the country, the UNHCR announced.
</P>
<P>
A UNHCR spokesman told a press conference here that Tuesday's
closure of Sungei Besi camp, near Kuala Lumpur, occurred just five
days before the end of the Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA), a
multinational effort established in 1989 to stem the flow of
asylum-seekers from Vietnam and Laos.
</P>
<P>
The CPA established an alternative, legal migration route out
of Vietnam, permitting over half a million people to depart by
air. The ground-breaking agreement also established screening
procedures under which the countries of asylum in Southeast Asia
individually examined asylum-seekers' claims to the refugee
status.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR said virtually all the refugees, who had passed the
screening procedures, were given resettlement places in Western
countries. The screened-out, who could safely return to Vietnam,
were expected to do so before the formal closure of the CPA on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
However, it is estimated that some 24,800 people will still be
in camps after that date, including 3,500 in Indonesia, 2,300 in
the Philippines, 4,000 in Thailand, and 15,000 in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
As of June 30, the UNHCR will phase down its care and
maintenance activities in Southeast Asian camps except those in
Hong Kong where the bulk of remaining boat-people live. The UNHCR
will continue to assist and monitor the situation of people who
return to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In all, nearly 255,000 Vietnamese boat-people were given
temporary asylum in Malaysia, where they were cared for by the
UNHCR, the Malaysian authorities and local Red Crescent Society. A
total of 248,410 were resettled in Western countries, some of them
children born in the camps, and over 9,000 returned to Vietnam.
