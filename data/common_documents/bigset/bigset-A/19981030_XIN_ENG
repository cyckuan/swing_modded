<HEADLINE> About Two-Thirds of Americans Say Scandal not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Almost two-thirds of
Americans say President Bill Clinton's legal troubles will not be
a factor in their vote on November 3 in congressional elections, a
poll suggests.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are pouring 10 million dollars into advertising
linked to the controversy.
</P>
<P>
The likely voters in an Associated Press poll say they are
interested in issues like education, health care and the economy.
But while voters say the Clinton scandal won't influence their
vote, they do say moral values are a top concern.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 1,010 adults was taken October 21-25 by
ICR of Media, Pennsylvania. It had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3 percentage points. Among likely voters, the error margin
was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Democrats say their priorities of education, health care and
Social Security are in line with voters' chief concerns as
reflected in the polls.
</P>
<P>
Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said in an interview Wednesday that Republicans have a
huge advantage financially, "We will overcome that with quality
candidates and quality of issues."
</P>
<P>
Republicans maintain their new ad campaign is issue-oriented,
despite a focus on the investigation of Clinton's relationship
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The AP poll indicated the race for Congress has grown very
competitive, making large gains more difficult for either party
next week.
</P>
<P>
But almost two-thirds of likely voters, 64 percent, say they
disapprove of the way Congress has handled the Clinton-Lewinsky
matter, according to the latest poll.
</P>
<P>
A similar number, 63 percent, said the Clinton matter will not
be a factor in their vote. The remainder was split between voting
to reflect their support or opposition to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Democrats say the Republican Party is shifting focus because
the Democrats have the upper hand on the issues. Representative
John Linder, chairman of the National republican congressional
Committee, said top Republican issues are taxes, crime and welfare
while Romer cited education, health care and Social Security as
top Democratic issues.
</P>
<P>
Education was the top issue of concern to the likely voters, 28
percent, followed by moral values at 22 percent, health care at 17
percent and the economy at 14 percent. Nine percent of the likely
voters said taxes were the top issue and a similar number chose
crime.
</P>
<P>
About a third of Republicans, 32 percent, considered moral
values to be the top issue, followed by education at 26 percent.
Nine percent of Democrats in the poll said moral values was the
top issue.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Wins Support to its Route for Caspian Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and four Caspian
countries signed here a declaration on piping Caspian and Central
Asian petroleum to markets in the West through the Eastern-Western
corridor.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara Declaration was inked by Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, Azeri President Geidar
Aliyev, Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, Kazakh President
Nursultan Nazarbayev and Uzbek President Islam Karimov.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which favored the Turkish route to other
options, sent its Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to signed on
the document as an observer.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said at the signing ceremony that the document is a
symbol of the determination of concerned countries to materialize
the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline as a main pipeline for crude
shipment.
</P>
<P>
Demirel called the declaration a triumph for Turkey, which
rallied all the countries involved in the issue except Russia to
declare their support for piping oil to Turkey's Mediterranean
port of Ceyhan.
</P>
<P>
This was hardly good news for Russia, which has been vying for
pipelines to traverse its territory as well. Turkey's main
argument against the Russian route is the heavy oil tanker traffic
through the Bosporus strait, which has led to hundreds of
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Although the options of piping are largely economic and
technical, their selection is bound to be highly political. The
host country of the pipeline from Central Asia is able to bob its
clout there.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said the declaration "forms
the political framework of the economic development which closely
interests our country for the future."
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that the declaration clarifies these countries'
resolution and will to transport energy resources to world markets
through more than one pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The energy resources were very important for strengthening the
independence and economic development of the countries in the
Caspian Basin and for increasing the welfare level of their
people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Cem said the concerned countries made a moral commitment and
who fails to make good on it will be under a serious
responsibility.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Truth Body Unveils Final Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Thursday handed its final report
to President Nelson Mandela, which implicated many politicians in
human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
The 3,500-page report held the former apartheid government and
its allies responsible for the major part of the gross human
rights violations committed against the South African people.
</P>
<P>
But it also held all political groupings accountable for the
decades of conflict in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said, from the late 1970s to the early 1990s, the
apartheid state planned and undertook political assassinations
against political opponents.
</P>
<P>
Former president P. W. Botha, by virtue of his position as
chairman of the now-defunct State Security Council (SSC),
contributed to and facilitated a climate in which the gross
violations occurred and for which he must be held accountable,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report described the SSC as an institution in which abuses
including political assassinations were planned and carried out.
</P>
<P>
The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) was accused along with other
political groups of colluding with the state in pursuing its
illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
The TRC also held IFP leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi politically
responsible as former KwaZulu minister of police and IFP
president for the systematic pattern of abuse that occurred in
KwaZulu-Natal, in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The report accused the African National Congress (ANC) of
gross human right violations both in exile and during the course
of its armed struggle within the country. It also held the ANC
accountable for deaths that occurred in the country after its
unbanning in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The TRC found that the ANC was responsible for killings and
assaults on political opponents and contributing to the spiral of
violence through the creation of self-defense units.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Front, through its leaders General Constand
Viljoen and Pieter Groenewald, and leader of Afrikaner rightist
group Weerstandsbeweging, Eugene Terreblanche, were held
accountable for gross human rights violations resulting from
inflammatory speeches, arming of supporters, and random attacks.
</P>
<P>
No major role-player of the time escaped unscathed as the
report blamed a wide range of political parties for their roles
in the conflict of the time.
</P>
<P>
The report singled out Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie
Madikizela-Mandela for harsh criticism for her role in the
formation of the Mandela Football Club. The TRC found that she
failed to account to her community and to political structures,
and was politically and morally accountable for the violations
committed by club members.
</P>
<P>
The TRC went as far as to say Madikizela-Mandela herself had
been responsible for committing such gross violations.
</P>
<P>
The report was finally released Thursday as scheduled after
the Cape Town High Court dismissed an application by the ANC to
block the release of the report.
</P>
<P>
The TRC was established in 1995 after the first democratic
general elections to heal the wounds of the apartheid era.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deputy Secretary Meets Head of UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State for African Affairs Susan Rice said here Thursday during
a meeting with the head of UNITA Renovative Committee Jorge
Valentim that the U.S. was "very interested" in the progress it
has made.
</P>
<P>
She admitted to the press after the meeting that the U.S.
government has contacted several times with the Committee which
has split from Jonas Savimbi's National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) and that she was satisfied with
this meeting.
</P>
<P>
On the Angolan peace process, Rice said as one of the three
observer countries, the Unites States wishes to see a stable and
democratic Angola and is ready to do its best to achieve this
goal.
</P>
<P>
Valentim referred to the meeting as "fruitful", for he has
obtained much "encouraging information" from Rice.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is of great significance from the perspective of
international law. Meanwhile, it is also a milestone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Renovative Committee was established in early September.
It calls on patriotic UNITA members to stick to peace, to dismiss
Savimbi from his post and turn UNITA into a humane and democratic
political party.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has announced to suspend all contacts
with Savimbi and treat the Committee as the only legitimate
dialogist on the peace process. It also appeals to the
international community to recognize the splinter group, although
currently some of the world's major countries including the
United States have not given the nod.
</P>
<P>
Rice arrived here Wednesday from South Africa. She was
accompanied by President Bill Clinton's special assistant on
African affairs Gayle Smith, and U.S. special envoy to the Great
Lakes region Howard Wolpe.
</P>
<P>
Her current African tour which focuses on the situation in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), will also include the DRC,
Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Accepts Truth Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said Thursday he accepted the final report of the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) despite its
imperfections.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore take this opportunity to say that I accept the
report as it is, with all its imperfections, as an aid that the
TRC has given to us to help reconcile and build our nation,"
Mandela said in a speech at a handover ceremony in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
He said the TRC itself could not be expected to meet the
target of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"Its success in any case depended on how far all of us
cooperated with it."
</P>
<P>
According to Mandela, reconciliation required that South
Africans should work together to defend democracy and the
humanity proclaimed by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
"It demands that we join hands... to eradicate the poverty
spawned by a system that thrived on the deprivation of the
majority."
</P>
<P>
Reconciliation required that South Africans should end
malnutrition, homelessness and ignorance, and that they put
shoulder to the wheel to end crime and corruption.
</P>
<P>
"More particularly, we will start consultations with all
sectors of society on how to contribute to the variety of
programs required to restore the dignity of those who suffered
and to give due recognition to those who paid the supreme
sacrifice so that our nation could be free," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela warned that the TRC report contained material that
could sustain endless finger pointing and gloating at the
discomfort of opponents whom the TRC pronounced responsible for
gross human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
"But we should constantly keep our minds on the broad picture
that has emerged," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dynamite Fishing Poses Threats in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Sixty percent of the
coastal line in east Tanzania's Tanga Region is threatened by
destructive means of fishing.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen from Dar es Salaam have used explosives in fishing
along the southern section of the regional coastal line, the
Tanga Coastal Zone Conservation and Development Program (TCZCDP)
has said.
</P>
<P>
Such incidents have also been heard in the northern part of
the coast, the TCZCDP coordinator, Solomon Makoloweka, was quoted
by a report from the Tanzania News Agency (Shihata) Thursday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the culprits are few in number, they have seriously
affected the majority of fishermen in the region, Makoloweka
said, adding only 40 percent of the 150 kilometers of the Tanga
coastal line is free from destructive fishing.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, the TCZCDP is carrying out a program
to increase people's awareness of reducing the hazards of
dynamite fishing.
</P>
<P>
Issues being addressed in the program include overfishing,
destructive means of fishing, coastal erosion, destruction of
mangrove trees and poor agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The TCZCDP has won financial assistance from Irish people and
the World Conservation Union for the implementation of an
integrated coastal zone management strategy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The program has completed its first phase of training and has
started the second phase. Training programs have been piloted in
coastal villages of Kipumbwi, Kigombe and Mwambani.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the coordinator said patrols by village-trained
militia with the help of the navy have curbed illegal fishing to
some extent.
</P>
<P>
Although dynamite fishing is prohibited in the Indian Ocean
and all lakes in Tanzania, criminal cases related to the problem
have frequently been reported.
</P>
<P>
During a crackdown on dynamite fishing between July and
November in 1997, th police and Tanzania's People's Defense
Forces arrested 10 suspects and impounded seven tons of fish in
Dar es Salaam, Coast and Tanga regions.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism has
complained that the government is short of boats and modern
facilities in attacking illegal fishermen.

<HEADLINE> 25 Million Nigerian Children to Be Immunized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, Nigeria, October 29 (Xinhua) -- About 25 million
Nigerian children under the age of five will be immunized against
polio during this year's National Immunization Days, the National
Program on Immunization Agency has said.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the agency made available to Xinhua Thursday
said the move is in pursuance of Nigeria's commitment to the
global eradication of polio by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The first round of the immunization will be carried out on
November 4-5 and the second round on December 9-10.
</P>
<P>
The program, conducted by the Ministry of Health, will get
help from the World Health Organization, the United Nations
Children's Fund and other international agencies, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It urged parents to bring their children for the exercise,
which will be free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Polio is a disease that often results in paralysis of limbs,
particularly among children under five.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Workers Income Goes Up 3.7 Pct over Past Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. workers income
which includes Wages, salaries and benefits rose by 3.7 percent
over the past year ended in September, the biggest increase in
more than six years, the Labor Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The rise for the year shows workers still are benefiting from
two years of strong economic growth, as unemployment sank to a
28-year low of 4.3 percent in April in May, forcing employers to
increase compensation faster than inflation in order to attract
and retain qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the
number of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment
benefits fell last week for the first time in four weeks. Claims
dropped by 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 301,000.
</P>
<P>
However, a four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes
fluctuations in the volatile data series, rose to a 12-week high
of 309,250, up from 306,500 for the period ending one week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment, though higher than the Spring, remains low. It
was 4.6 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Wages and salaries have been increasing faster than benefits,
gaining 4 percent during the year ended in September, the most in
seven years. Benefits increased 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
For the third quarter alone, wages and salaries rose 1.2
percent. That's the most since an identical increase in 1990. They
haven't increased more than that since 1984. Benefits increased
0.8 percent in the third quarter.

<HEADLINE> UK, Germany Pledge to Maintain Russia's Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Germany agreed
Thursday that the top priority of the European Union's (EU)
foreign policy must be to maintain Russia's stability.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Minister Robin Cook and his German counterpart
Joschka Fischer told reporters after their talks that maintaining
the stability of Russia was vital for the EU's 15 member states
and it was "an urgent priority" to reach a common position on what
to do.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they noted that the Kosovo dispute should be the
other priority for the EU's common foreign and security policy and
Cook said they agreed they had to turn the recent Kosovo agreement
into a reality on the ground.
</P>
<P>
Fischer and Cook agreed they would hold formal meetings at
least twice a year and their junior ministers would meet at least
four times a year in a fresh effort to step up cooperation between
Germany and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Cook said his government would give strong backing to Germany's
EU presidency in the first half of next year and its goal of
completing the EU's Agenda 2000 reform package by mid-1999.

<HEADLINE> 1998 World Wheat Production To Be Second To Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- World wheat production is
forecast 7 m. lower at 586 m. tons, but it would still be second
to the record 610 m. of 1997, the International Grains Council
(IGC) announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The revision results from decreased output estimates mainly for
Argentina, Australia, India, Kazakhstan, Russia and South Africa,
it explained.
</P>
<P>
World wheat trade is forecast 1 m. higher, matching last year's
total of 95 m. tons. The increase stems from a higher figure for
Russia, the IGC said.
</P>
<P>
Export forecasts for both Argentina and Australia have been
lowered, but those for the EC and the United States have each been
raised by 0.5 m. tons.
</P>
<P>
Mainly due to the lower figure for global production, the
forecast for world wheat consumption has been reduced by 11 m. to
591 m. tons, according to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The estimate for world wheat stocks is up 5 m. at 128 m. which
includes 55 m. tons for the five major exporters, it added.

ATHENS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Thursday met with his visiting Slovenian counterpart Janez
Drnovsek to discuss Slovenia's efforts to join the European Union
(EU), NATO and the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Simitis said that Greece's
policy was in favor of the EU's enlargement to the whole of Europe
in order to ensure stability and friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Drnovsek, who arrived here Thursday for a
first-ever visit by a Slovenian premier to Greece, thanked Athens'
support in Slovenia's bid for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
He said that responsibility for the final outcome lay not only
with the 15 member-states of the community but also with the
candidate countries which must make appropriate preparations.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek, who also met Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos
and Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis, invited Simitis to
visit Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that Drnovsek's visit to Greece was part of
Slovenia's efforts to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
Greece is currently one of the countries that has not yet
ratified the EU agreement with Slovenia but is expected to place
the issue on Parliament's agenda soon.

<HEADLINE> Botha Keeps Silent at TRC's Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
state president P. W. Botha kept silent Thursday as the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) released its finding which
branded Botha one of the country's worst human rights violators.
</P>
<P>
An aide at Botha's home in the Western Cape Province said
Thursday it was unlikely that Botha would comment on the report,
which was handed to President Nelson Mandela by TRC Chairman
Desmond Tutu Thursday, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Botha's lawyer, Ernst Penzhorn, said he thought Botha would
not have anything to say until they had studied the report.
</P>
<P>
The 3,500-page report, which was the result of 30 months of
work by the truth body, said that Botha, who ruled South Africa
from 1978 to 1989, was accountable for a litany of human rights
violations.
</P>
<P>
As chairman of the former State Security Council (SSC), Botha
had contributed to a climate in which gross human rights
violations had occurred, the truth body said.
</P>
<P>
The report described the SSC as an institution which planned
and carried out abuses, including assassinations.
</P>
<P>
It found that Botha had personally ordered former Law and
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok and former police commissioner Johan
van der Merwe to bomb the headquarters of the South African
Council of Churches in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
No one was killed in the bombing, but the building was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The TRC said Botha's action greatly enhanced the prevailing
culture of impunity and facilitated gross violations of human
rights by senior security force members.
</P>
<P>
Botha was also held accountable for the 1982 bombing of the
African National Congress (ANC)'s London headquarters, and a 1981
attempt to overthrow the government of Seychelles, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The five-volume report also contains numerous other
incriminating references to abuses perpetrated by Botha's
government.
</P>
<P>
Botha, 82, has steadfastly maintained that he has nothing to
apologize for and has described the TRC as a "circus".
</P>
<P>
He ignored three subpoenas by the TRC to testify in person for
his role in the SSC, and was prosecuted earlier this year for his
repeated defiance.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted in August and sentenced to a 10,000-Rand
(about 1,600 U.S.Dollars) fine or a 12-month jail term, but has
appealed to the Cape High Court.
</P>
<P>
The ailing ex-president also received a further 12-month jail
sentence suspended for five years on condition that he did not
disobey further TRC subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
Botha might yet be subpoenaed to appear before the
commission's amnesty committee, which will continue hearings for
another four months.

HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's civic organizations

commitment of Zimbabwean troops to greater military involvement
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).

In a joint statement, the five organizations, namely Zimbabwe
Rights, Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, Legal

claimed that Mugabe made the commitment without any consultation
with parliament or cabinet, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Without a mandate from parliament, Zimbabwean troops are now
being deployed in the eastern portion of the DRC which could
result in a greater number of casualties and enormous financial
cost," said the statement.
</P>

"We are concerned about the lack of transparency in disclosing
the exact number of Zimbabwean casualties," it added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israeli, Palestinian Leaders Condemn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- While condemning a suicide
bombing attack in Gaza Thursday morning, Israel said the peace
process would continue and the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) vowed to live up its commitments on fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder and spiritual leader of the
Islamic militant group Hamas, was put under house arrest by the
PNA in the wake of the car bombing attack in which one Israeli
soldier was killed and five people injured.
</P>
<P>
The attack came at about 7:45 a.m. (0545 GMT) in an
intersection of the major Jewish settlement bloc of Gush Katif in
Gaza when a car loaded with dozens of kilograms of explosives
rammed into an Israeli military jeep and blew up. The car driver
was killed instantly.
</P>
<P>
Witness said the car was apparently trying to run into a school
bus carrying about 40 children of the settlers before the military
jeeps escorting the bus moved in to intercept it. The suicide
driver in the car managed to detonate the explosives.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the incident
"serious" because the Palestinian attacker came from the
PNA-controlled areas of Gaza, which has been under Palestinian
autonomy for five years.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Netanyahu showed restraint in his reaction. He
expressed his concern in a telephone conversation with PNA
Chairman Yasser Arafat and demanded that the PNA fight terrorism
as stipulated in the newly-reached interim agreement.
</P>
<P>
Touring the scene in Gaza after the attack, Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said the peace process has to be
continued.
</P>
<P>
Arafat convened an emergency meeting of top Palestinian
intelligence and security officials soon after the attack, and
issued a statement condemning the terrorist act.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the PNA will "do all in its power" to track down
those behind it and bring them to justice.
</P>
<P>
Despite Hamas' denial of involvement in the attack, Palestinian
intelligence and security forces have arrested several Hamas
activists in Gaza, including a Hamas spokesman. Israeli military
officials praised the Palestinian police for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Under the land-for-peace deal signed by Netanyahu and Arafat
at the White House last Friday, Israel will hand over another 13
percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians in exchange for
tougher Palestinian crackdown on Islamic extremists.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials have reiterated that they will carry out
their obligations called for in the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Russian Minister Denies Threat of Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Food and Agriculture
Minister Viktor Semyonov said Thursday that Russia faces no threat
of famine despite a grain output that was about half of a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
"We see no reason for food shortages," Semyonov told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports, Russia produced 47.3 million
tons of grain this year compared to 88.5 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Semyonov described media reports on food issues as an attempt
to create some advantages for imported foods in Russia, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Russia had stocked enough potatoes, sugar,
vegetable oil and vegetables and there were enough grain to meet
its basic needs, but it should create a reserve fund.
</P>
<P>
While acknowledging that 22 of Russia's 89 regions are
suffering from grain shortage, the minister said some 100 million
Russians are growing their own potatoes and vegetables, about 50
million Russians raise their own cattle, which represent a hedge
against food shortages.
</P>
<P>
The private sector in agriculture accounts for up to 90 percent
of the total output of potatoes, 76 percent of vegetables, 55
percent of meat and 47 percent of milk, Semyonov said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a serious stabilizing factor," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Russia as a whole has a sufficient amount of grain, but
reserves should be formed to rapidly stop local food shortages,"
Semyonov said. "We cannot afford to have such low harvests for two
years in succession."
</P>
<P>
On foreign food aid, the minister said, such assistance,
actively discussed by some international humanitarian
organizations, must not damage Russian food manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the current problem with food in Russia "is
not so much the shortage of supplies, but the fact that many
valuable foodstuffs, primarily meat and milk, have become less
affordable to many people because of the financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
In this sense humanitarian aid could be quite useful in some
areas for individual population groups and it is senseless
rejecting it, Semyonov said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said his ministry "is categorically opposed to
commodity interventions at dumping prices under the guise of
humanitarian aid," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry "will closely monitor the process to prevent
damage to local producers," Semyonov said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Turkish Airspace Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has lodged a strong
protest to the United Nations over new violations of its airspace
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan by Cyprus permanent representative to the U.N., Sotos
Zackheos, the Cyprus News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zackheos said in his letter that on October 23, 24, 25 and 26,
Turkish military aircraft entered the Nicosia Flight Information
Region (FIR), violating international air traffic regulations, and
also violated the national airspace of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the government of the Republic of Cyprus, I wish
to strongly protest these new provocative acts by Turkey against
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of" Cyprus, Zackheos
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He described the violations as "a further reminder of Turkey's
offensive disregard of international law, the Charter of the
U.N. and all the relevant decisions of the organization on the
question of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the fact that continuing overflights by the
Turkish Air Force, as well as the presence of the Turkish military
occupation forces on the island, constitute the underlying causes
of tension in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since maintained 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus,
allegedly to protect the Turkish Cypriots, who declared
unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Worry Over Pupils Engaging in Sex </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Education, Sports
and Culture Minister Gabriel Machinga said Thursday it is
disturbing that the country's youths continue to engage in sexual
relationships as early as at primary school level without any
protection.
</P>
<P>
Machinga said at the end of a two-day workshop on family
planning in Harare that his ministry was liaising with parents
and other organizations to strengthen the campaign against early
and unprotected sexual activities in schools.
</P>
<P>
It was time HIV/AIDS tests were made a pre-condition for
marriage to reduce the spreading of the AIDS pandemic, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Other countries have done it, we can also do it too," said
Machinga, adding "We respect and value those of our youth who
complete their education and marry according to our norms and
values."
</P>
<P>
The ministry, concerned by the increasing cases of sexual
activities by the youths, is currently implementing family life
education to children attending primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the youth, he said, started sexual activity in
their teens and there was need to enhance later sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is considered to be among countries with the highest
HIV/AIDS figures in the region with an estimated 700 people dying
weekly from diseases related to the pandemic.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Truth Body Proposes Wealth Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Thursday proposed a wealth tax
and a once-off levy to raise money to compensate victims of the
apartheid past.
</P>
<P>
In a preliminary report released Thursday, the TRC special
court recommended that apart from a wealth tax and a once-off
levy on corporate and private income, companies listed on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange should make a one percent donation of
their market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
Other suggestions were a retrospective surcharge on corporate
profits extending back to a specific date, a surcharge on
retirement pension given to senior public servants since 1990.
</P>
<P>
One of the tasks of the TRC, founded in 1995, was to prepare
for the appropriate and affordable reparations to the victims of
gross human rights violations during the apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
The report, which summarized the TRC's 30-month work, also
called for suspension of tax on all land occupied by previously
disadvantaged communities.
</P>
<P>
The commission said South Africa should reconsider the
repayment of its massive foreign debt, which was a crippling
burden on the national fisc, as the debt was the responsibility

<HEADLINE> Britain, Argentina to Enhance Defense Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- British and Argentine defense
chiefs Thursday reached a defense agreement in a bid to step up
bilateral military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Secretary George Robertson and his Argentine
counterpart Jorge Dominguez signed a memorandum of understanding
covering existing joint defense activities and setting out areas
where the two sides could do more together.
</P>
<P>
"Our forces already work together for the United Nations in
Cyprus, in Bosnia and in Kuwait, and both have contributed to
other coalitions in the Gulf," Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
However, Robertson refused to make further comments on
Britain's possible lifting of arms sanctions against Argentina by
saying: "I'm not making any prediction at the moment. It's a
matter we keep under consideration.".
</P>
<P>
Dominguez, whose government complains the arms embargo is
ridiculous given the close cooperation between the two nations'
armed forces, said that he was confident the matter would be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel the embargo is a practical problem for Argentina
but it is one of the last problems we have to solve. In the future
the problem of the embargo will be over," he added.

<HEADLINE> The Richest Countries Giving Less To The Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29, (Xinhua) -- Aid flowing from the richest
countries in the world to the poorest has slumped to its lowest
ever level, a report released Thursday shows.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the 21 richest nations gave 47.5 billion U.S.
dollars compared with 55.4 billion the previous year, a drop of
7.1 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
As a percentage of rich countries' output, aid has fallen to
0.25 percent, the lowest proportion on record, according to the
charity Action Aid.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the fifth largest donor in money terms, giving out
5.4 billion U.S. dollars last year, up by 275 million U.S. dollars
in cash terms but in real terms a decline of 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a proportion of national income, Britain gives just 0.26
percent to the developing world. Under the Tory government, aid
flows declined from 0.51 percent to last year's all time low.
</P>
<P>
The present Labor government committed when it came to power to
raising this level to 0.27 percent by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes Turkish Reaction to Memorandum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday criticized
Turkey for its reaction to a memorandum submitted by Athens to the
European Union (EU) Council of Ministers concerning relations
between the community and Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas described the Turkish reaction to the memorandum
as "hypocritical and misleading."
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, which was submitted Wednesday by Greek Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos to the EU council of ministers in
Luxembourg, was regarded as an indirect response to efforts by the
European Commission to change the legal basis for releasing EU
funds to Turkey which has for years been blocked by Greece.
</P>
<P>
Turkey reacted angrily, saying that the submission of the
memorandum by Athens was "an immoral act."
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that Turkey's such stance would harm Turkey itself.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was not willing to bring itself in line with the
European community because it did not want to recognize the
jurisdiction of the International Court at the Hague, he said.
</P>
<P>
Greek-Turkish relations have been strained for decades over
their disputes in the territorial waters, air space limits and the
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea as well as
the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Greece has insisted that the EU should not release its funds as
economic aid for Turkey unless Turkey improves its human rights
record and its relations with Greece.

LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and visiting Argentine President Carlos Menem Thursday held
"very positive" talks and signed agreements on promoting bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Menem, the first Argentine president to visit Britain since the
1982 Falklands (Malvinas) War, signed a four-page "partnership
action agenda" with Blair as well as a memorandum of understanding
on increasing trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The action agenda said each country "expressly reaffirms its
known position with regard to the sovereignty over the Falkland
(Malvinas) Islands.
</P>
<P>
"Both governments are determined to continue working together
in a spirit of cooperation on all issues of mutual interest,
particularly in the South Atlantic context," the document added.
</P>
<P>
Under the action agenda, Britain and Argentina would work to
enhance cooperation in the United Nations Security Council and in
peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
They also vowed to work more closely to fight against drug
trafficking and international crime and to continue cooperating
over the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
"Both governments welcome the growing interest of their
business communities in their respective markets and hope it will
lead to the further strengthening of trade and investment in both
directions," the action agenda said.

<P>
BEIRUT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon on Thursday accused
Israel of stealing its soil in the Israeli-occupied south Lebanon
and called on the international community to help curb the
practice, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proven that Israel is systematically stealing
hundreds of tonnes of soil in south Lebanon and transporting them to
the Israeli northern Galiee area for the benefit of its farmers,"
said Lebanese parliament speaker Nabih Berri in a letter.
</P>
<P>
The letter will be addressed to parliament leaders of the five
permanent member states of the United Nations Security Council,
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Commander of the U.N. Interim
Forces in Lebanon General Jioki Konrote and other international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Berri said that Israel started the operation two weeks ago and
has stolen hundreds of tonnes of the richest soil in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to help stop Israel's
practice which has violated international laws.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
against Israeli occupation.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Test Results on VX Prove its Credibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said test results have
proved beyond disputes that there were no substances related to VX
agent in the remnants of Iraq's destroyed warheads, the Iraqi News
Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to president of the United Nations Security
Council, Iraqi envoy to the U.N. Nizar Hamdoun said analytical
results of 122 samples taken in July from Iraq at French, Swiss
and the United States laboratories did not show any chemical
warfare-related chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoun said that 40 samples analyzed by Swiss laboratory, 43
by U.S. lab and 39 by French lab, did not show any traces of
VX-related materials; only one sample analyzed by French lab
showed a chemical which could be related to chemical warfare.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming
Iraq of choosing to seize on one sample against all other results.
</P>
<P>
"This is an obvious attempt to deflect attention from the
overwhelming evidence in support of Iraq's declaration that no VX
was stabilized and weaponized," said Hamdoun.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM submitted a report to the U.N. Security Council on
Monday, saying that the French test found a degradation product of
nerve agent, which could be VX, Sarin or Soman.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that Iraq probably had hidden information
on its ability to put VX into warheads.
</P>
<P>
Iraq admitted in the past that it had experimented with VX
agent, but said it never succeeded in weaponizing it.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoun insisted that all the information related to VX
research, development and production attempts by Iraq have been
presented to UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
A U.S army lab said in June that it found traces of VX on
samples of Iraqi warhead fragments. Iraq accused the U.S. of
faking the results and insisted that French and Swiss laboratory
test them.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused UNSCOM of serving the U.S. interests and
of attempting to prolong the U.N. economic sanctions imposed on
the country following its invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The crippling U.N. sanctions on Iraq cannot be lifted unless
UNSCOM verifies that Iraq is free of nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Turkish Airspace Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has lodged a strong
protest to the United Nations over new violations of its airspace
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan by Cyprus permanent representative to the U.N., Sotos
Zackheos, the Cyprus News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zackheos said in his letter that on October 23, 24, 25 and 26,
Turkish military aircraft entered the Nicosia Flight Information
Region (FIR), violating international air traffic regulations, and
also violated the national airspace of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"On behalf of the government of the Republic of Cyprus, I wish
to strongly protest these new provocative acts by Turkey against
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of" Cyprus, Zackheos
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He described the violations as "a further reminder of Turkey's
offensive disregard of international law, the Charter of the
U.N. and all the relevant decisions of the organization on the
question of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the fact that continuing overflights by the
Turkish Air Force, as well as the presence of the Turkish military
occupation forces on the island, constitute the underlying causes
of tension in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has since maintained 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus,
allegedly to protect the Turkish Cypriots, who declared
unilaterally in 1983 a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Leading Gas Firm in Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The TOL Ltd, a leading
manufacturer and distributor of industrial and medical gases in
Tanzania, may register losses amounting to about 600 million
Shillings (896,000 U.S. Dollars) during the full financial year.
</P>
<P>
Board Chairman of the company Felix Mrema said Thursday that
the losses can be attributed to certain decisions made by the
company's management for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
Mrema told reporters at the company's headquarters in the city
that the board held a meeting Thursday to consider the company's
third quarter cumulative accounts.
</P>
<P>
The accounts reflected an operating profit for the third
quarter of 15,787,000 Shillings but a cumulative operating loss
for the period ending September 30, of 209,775,000 Shillings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that prior period adjustments, interests on loans and
other write-downs resulted in a cumulative adjusted loss for the
period ending September 30, of 492,400,409 Shillings or 0.74 U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The board will investigate the company's mismanagement, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the board decided to recruit a product development
manager to work side by side with the current marketing manager
in an effort to create increased demand for the company's
products, he added.
</P>
<P>
The board decided to invite a strategic partner to take part
in the management and operations of the company, he said, adding
that the board is holding discussions with potential strategic
partners.
</P>
<P>
TOL Ltd is one of the two listed company in Tanzania. During
late 1997 and last March, 7.5 million shares floated by the
company worth 37.5 billion Shillings (56 million Dollars) were
bought by 10,000 share-holders.
</P>
<P>
"The board wishes to reassure share-holders and all interested
parties that the company has a sound and secure future and the
appropriate measures to safeguard the interests of share-holders
are being taken," the board chairman said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Earnings Drop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Tobacco earnings in Zimbabwe
have dropped by 37 percent over the past three selling seasons.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner.
Tobacco earnings in Zimbabwe amounted to 593 million U.S. Dollars
from a crop size of 201 million kg in 1996 before dropping in
1997 to 437 million Dollars from a crop size of 187 million kg.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, earnings further fell to 378 million Dollars from a
crop size of 215.9 million kg, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Tobacco Association (ZTA) has already advised
tobacco farmers to reduce their plantings by 10 to 15 percent for
the 1998/99 season to avoid unnecessary expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board Chairman Njodzi Machirori
predicted that total flue-cured tobacco to be sold next year is
likely to drop from 215.9 million kg this year to 200 million kg
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
This dramatic drop in performance by the tobacco sector,
largely blamed on the depressed world market prices, has impacted
negatively on financial institutions and downstream industries as
farmers suffer serious financial loses or diminished returns.
</P>
<P>
The crop was sold at an average price of 1.72 Dollars per
kilogram this year compared with 2.33 Dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the depressing effects of the Asian financial
crisis were being felt in lower export flows of cigarettes and
delayed or canceled leaf orders as currency values dropped
sharply.

</P>
<P>
The duty of the national bank will then focus on implementing

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
give Tanzania some 9.2 million U.S. Dollars for its sufferings
during the August 7 U.S. embassy bombing attack.
</P>
<P>
This aid package was included in a budget bill passed last
week by the U.S. Congress, said a news release issued Thursday by
the U.S. Information Service in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
According to the bill, the U.S. will provide 50 million
Dollars in economic support funds to assist persons and
rehabilitate infrastructure damaged in the August 7 embassy
bombings in Dar es Salaam and in Nairobi, capital of neighboring
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania is expected to receive approximately 9.2 million
Dollars, of which one million will be disaster assistance for
infrastructure, 2.8 million for immediate reconstruction of
private property, and 5.4 million for hospitals and health
institutions to improve their disaster preparedness.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Embassy is working out the mechanisms by which these
funds will be disbursed," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Congress has directed that 2.5 million of this bill
will be allocated to the U.S. Agency for International

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expects End of Violence in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of
Information Nasir Judeh said here Thursday that Jordan condemns
the bomb attack that happened earlier Thursday in Gaza and expects
an end of such violence in that area.
</P>
<P>
What happened in Gaza on Thursday seems to be a continuation of
the series of violence and counter-violence that the region has
been suffering from since a long time ago due to the stalled
Middle East peace process, Judeh told Jordan Television.
</P>
<P>
Judeh said that such violence, which claims lives from both
Palestinian and Israeli sides, can be stopped only through the
full implementation of all the agreements that have been reached
by both parties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Judeh denied that Thursday`s bomb attack was related to the
Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement signed last Friday in
Washington and called on all parties concerned to fully implement
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, signed between Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel will return 13 percent land of the West Bank to the
Palestinians in exchange for the Palestinian promise to crack down
on anti-Israeli terrorist violence.

such implementation measures in light of the their specific
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Libyan Compliance With  Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday called upon the Libyan authorities to comply with
resolution 1192, saying that "sanctions would be suspended as soon
as the Secretary-General reports that the terms of" the resolution
"have been met."
</P>
<P>
The appeal came as the president of the 15-member Security
Council, Jeremy Greenstock of the United Kingdom, issued a
statement to the press at the end of the council's closed-door
consultations.
</P>
<P>
"Member reiterated their call to Libya to comply with
resolution 1192 and recalled that sanctions would be suspended" as
soon as the U.N. Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, presented a
positive report on the compliances, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Council members welcomed the fact that clarifications
concerning the procedures for the trial in the Netherlands under
Scottish law and with Scottish judges were being provided to the
Libyan authorities through the Secretary-General'f office," it
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council members "were encouraged by the relatively
positive trend of those developments," it said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press
conference that the Security Council reviewed sanctions against
Libya for the 20th time since they were first adopted in 1192
under a Security Council resolution,.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions review takes place every 120 days and the last
one was on July 2 this year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed sanctions against Libya in 1992
after two Libyan intelligence officials were accused of their role
of the blast of a U.S. passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland in
December 1988.
</P>
<P>
"Council members noted that the 10th anniversary of the
Lockerbie tragedy falls on December 21 of this year and they
agreed that this underlined the need to resolve this issue in line
with resolution 1192 as soon as possible," the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Libya has accepted the US-UK offer to try the two accused
Libyans in the Netherlands under the Scottish law. However, the
procedure made little progress after Libya declined to hand over
the accused and relevant witnesses, as was required by the
resolution and such Western countries as the United States and the
United Kingdom.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Meets Congolese Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Thursday met with a rebel delegation from the
war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to seek a
cease-fire, South African television reported.
</P>
<P>
SABC said Mandela held a meeting with the rebel delegation led
by Ernest Wamba dia Wamba. But no details of the meeting were
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's talks formed part of Mandela's renewed diplomatic
efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Congolese war.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, he traveled to Windhoek to hold talks with
Namibian President Sam Nujoma. The two leaders agreed that a
cease-fire should be signed and peace be restored as soon as
possible. But Mandela failed to convince Nujoma to withdraw his
troops from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said Namibian troops would withdraw only after the
government of Congolese President Laurent Kabila is secure.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Mandela held talks with Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame on the same
issue.
</P>
<P>
While Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad sent troops to help
Kabila quell the rebellion in eastern Congo (K), Uganda and
Rwanda have been accused of siding with the Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
Defense and foreign ministers from 19 African countries met
Tuesday and Wednesday in Lusaka, Zambia to try to secure a
cease-fire in Congo. But the talks failed as Kabila refused to
meet Wamba's rebels face to face.
</P>
<P>
The Congolese civil war erupted on August 2 when Tutsi or
Banyamulenge soldiers, who helped Kabila oust late Zairean
president Mobutu Sese Seko, turned against Kabila.

NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The second in a series of
regional seminars on the World Trade Organization (WTO) Uruguay
round of talks opened in Ghana's second largest city of Kumasi
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The program is aimed at informing institutions and
entrepreneurs about trading opportunities as a result of the
talks, Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the two-day
seminar will also enable the participants to keep abreast with
the challenges and rules of the multilateral trading system, said
the GNA, in a special story to Xinhua based in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Institutions represented include Customs, Excise and
Preventive Service (CEPS), National Board for Small-Scale
Industries (NBSSI), Chamber of Commerce, and Small-Scale
Importers.
</P>
<P>
In an address read for him, Daniel Agyekum, Ashanti Regional
Minister, said the outcome of the talks is only an instrument to
promote economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
"The Uruguay round of talks presents a window of both
opportunities and challenges and it is only when we are able to
take advantage of these market openings to increase our share of
trade that we shall be seen to be exploiting to the maximum the
immense benefits inherent in it," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Agyekum called on the participants to ensure that the country
makes a mark in international trade and attains the middle income
status envisaged in the Vision 2020 document.

<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Guinea Bissau President Joao
Benardo Vieira and rebel leader General Ansoumane Mane started
face-to-face peace talks late Thursday in the Gambian capital of
Banjul, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Mane arrived in Banjul at about 16.30 gmt on board a Nigerian
aircraft while Vieira arrived minutes later in a French military
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that they are likely to discuss the reopening of
Bissau airport by the rebels, an extension of the recently
expired cease-fire and the establishment of a government of
national unity.
</P>
<P>
The key mediators in the conflict between the Guinea Bissau
government and rebels are the Gambian and Cape Verdian foreign
ministers, and the ambassadors of France and Portugal in Bissau.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are reportedly aimed at finding a formula to
end the conflict which erupted after Vieira fired Mane, accusing
him of involvement in a case of arms trafficking in favor of
rebels in Senegal's Casamance region.
</P>
<P>
After further advances in fighting last week, the rebels are
reported to control more than 80 percent of the national
territory although the Vieira government is supported by
Senegalese and Guinean troops.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire agreement brokered by the Community of
Portuguese-Speaking Countries and the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) was broken 10 days ago.

"This acquisition is an important development in our strategy
of investment in sectors which meet the needs of corporate

</P>
<P>
Africa Online Holdings Limited was formed by The African Lakes

UNITED NATIONS, October 29 (xinhua) -- The reporting mechanism
of some human rights instruments had played an important and
positive role in monotoring the implementation of conventions by
state parties, but there had been problems in recent years, China
stressed here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly,

included too frequent reporting by the state parties, duplication
of report content, heavy workload and serious delay in report
consideration by treaty bodies.
</P>
<P>
Reform was essential, Xie Bohua said, adding that treaty bodies
should work within their mandate and increase their efficiency,
and efforts should be made to better coordinate work among several
treaty bodies to avoid duplication and thus reduce the burden of
state parties.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said that with regard to the implementation of
certain provisions that also appeared in other treaties, one way
of solving the problem was for state parties to present a
comprehensive report in a core document.

<HEADLINE> 300 Feared Dead in Bandit Raids in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Up to 300 people were feared
dead Thursday after bandits swept across the frontier from
Ethiopia into northeastern Kenya this week, said a media report
reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament from the area claimed Thursday night
that the incursions taking place five days ago were turning into
genocide.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two villagers -- mostly teenage girls - were kidnapped
and an estimated 17,500 head of cattle stolen and driven back
toward the border, the report quoted local authorities as
claiming. Hundreds of people were still missing, they said.
</P>
<P>
The official death toll for the raids has already been put at
139, with witnesses believing it could be at least twice as high,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Targets of the raids were mainly people from the Degodias
tribe, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Borans assisted by Oromos were rounding up Degodia men, women
and children at watering points, ordering them to surrender
before gunning them down and taking away their livestock.
</P>
<P>
The Oromos were from the Oromo Liberation Front which is
fighting the Ethiopian government from the Kenyan border, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
The 500 raiders -- described variously as "Oromo bandits" and
"Ethiopian militiamen" -- struck along the remote Wajir-Marsabit
border Sunday. The frontier district was said to be in a state of
panic since then.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan army has been sent to strengthen security in the
area and to prevent further incursions by the bandits.
</P>
<P>
Security minister Marsden Madoka said Thursday that the death
toll from the Sunday killing was disputed.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government would do everything possible to
establish the correct figure - and to recover the hostages and
stolen cattle.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tax Collectors Urged to Increase Revenue (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China's tax bureaus and finance
departments need to take immediate action to increase taxes and
cut expenditures to balance the budget, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said today.
</P>
<P>
This requires an increase of 100 billion yuan (about 12 billion
U.S. dollars) in tax revenues over last year, Li told a State
Council phone conference on tax revenues and expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Tax and financial departments should stick to the principle of
"strengthening administration, closing loopholes, punishing
corruption, and paying off outstanding taxes" that is an important
yardstick for measuring the performance of them, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He asked tax bureaus to give priority to administration and to
put most of their staff members on the front lines. There are
still a large number of legal loopholes in the country's tax
system, and an effort needs to be made to close these loopholes.
</P>
<P>
Outstanding taxes, which have long been a headache for tax
departments, must be cleared, he said, adding that even though the
general quality of tax work is good, corruption and embezzlement
still exist to a degree.
</P>
<P>
Improving tax work should be put high on the agenda of tax
departments and steps should be taken to deal with major
corruption cases, he said.

Li said that the government should place greater importance on
taxation and provide solid support for tax departments.
</P>
<P>
Some local leaders encourage enterprises to avoid paying state
taxes to keep tax money from leaving the area, he said, and warned
that this practice must be dealt with severely, no matter which
level of leaders it involves.
</P>
<P>
Li asked organizations to cooperate with tax departments and
institutions to see to it that their enterprises pay their taxes,
and said that custom offices should increase the campaign against
smuggling, and public security departments need to strike hard
against tax evasion and tax related criminal activities.
</P>
<P>
Big tax evasion cases need to be exposed by the media and more
publicity and media exposure given to taxation, he said.
</P>
<P>
China will stick to its financial policy and expenditures
should be managed with efficiency, he said, adding that finance
department should stick to the principle of "saving ordinary
expenditures for key projects, and improving administration".
</P>
<P>
He said that the key finance areas are the grain risk fund,
basic living expenses and employment of laid-off workers, and
agriculture, science, technology, and educational development.
</P>
<P>
Cadres should take the lead in saving finances, he said, and
more scientific, standardized management systems should be
established to increase efficiency in the use of funds.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
announced on Friday a humanitarian program worth 10 million ECUs
(9.52 million U.S. dollars) to help Sahrawi refugees in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
The aid, granted through the European Commission's Humanitarian
Office (ECHO), will help, over a six-month period,
non-governmental organizations in aiding the 150,000 people living
in refugee camps in the Tindouf region of Algeria, said the
European Commission, the European Union's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The program includes a food-aid component of 9.35 million ECUs
(8.9 million dollars) for the purchase, transport and distribution
of 9,350 tons of grains or other food. It also involves a
non-food component of 650,000 ECUs (620,000 dollars) to cover
expenses like medicine, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The new program has brought the amount of humanitarian aid
allocated to Sahrawi refugees this year to 17.2 million ECUs (16.4
million dollars), the EU said.
</P>
<P>
ECHO, set up in 1992, is responsible for managing humanitarian
aid to all non-EU countries.
</P>
<P>
EU statistics show ECHO is the biggest aid donor in the world.
In 1997, it made available aid packages worth 442 million ECUs (420
million dollars) in 66 countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Sports leaders of the
Special Administrative Region (SAR) said they would not put undue
pressure on the athletes though Hong Kong's Olympic Committee has
decided to send a largest ever Asian Games delegation to the 13th
Games in Bangkok this December.
</P>
<P>
"We will not speculate on the number of medals our athletes
might receive," said Timothy Fok, president of the Amateur Sports
Federation and Olympic Committee (ASF&AMP;OC) of Hong Kong, China.
But the athletes had undergone rigorous training, he said at a
press conference Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The 300-strong delegation announced by the ASF&AMP;OC, which will
compete for the first time in the Asian Games as "Hong Kong,
China", comprises of 215 athletes, 50 of them female, 72
officials and three delegates for the Olympic Council of Asia
meeting scheduled during the Games.
</P>
<P>
At the 1994 Games in the Japanese city of Hiroshima, Hong Kong
was represented by about 40 athletes and officials.
</P>
<P>
The SAR athletes will compete in 32 sports at Bangkok, which
was also a Games record for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Fok, however, picked up athletes in table tennis, Wushu,
windsurfing and snooker for praise due to their impressive
performance in recent international events.
</P>
<P>
Pang Chung, chief-de-mission, said that the ASF&AMP;OC had
proposed to the SAR government as well as to the various sports
associations to take necessary measures against any unexpected
happenings including traffic jam, sickness and failure in doping
tests.
</P>
<P>
All the elite athletes of the SAR had been tested as
drug-free, according to Vivien Fung, an administration member of
the delegation.

<HEADLINE> At Least 60 Killed in Disco Fire in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 60 people were
killed and 190 injured when a fire broke out in a disco in the
western Swedish city of Gothenburg Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The blaze started about midnight when about 400 young people,
aged from 13 to 20, gathered for a Halloween party on the second
floor of the local Macedonian Association building. Most of those
present were immigrants from Macedonia or Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still unknown, but the police have not
ruled out arson.
</P>
<P>
"I have received information that it could be arson. We can't
rule it out since the fire went so fast," Lennart Olin, who led
the rescue operation, told Swedish radio.
</P>
<P>
A 15-year-old witness told the Swedish news agency TT that he
was out on the dance floor when the blaze started.
</P>
<P>
"It looked like it started in the ceiling, and lamps and
loudspeakers fell to the floor... It was chaos. Everybody was
trying to get out and people trampled on each other on the way to
the exit."
</P>
<P>
The 300-square meter venue, on the second-floor of the
brick-built building, had only two emergency exits and was
licensed to hold only 300 people, said TT.
</P>
<P>
The fire spread rapidly and many of the youths panicked,
breaking windows and jumping from the second floor when they could
not escape from the disco's only open exit. The other exit was
blocked.
</P>
<P>
By Friday morning, the official death toll was 60 but it could
rise as some of the injuries were serious.
</P>
<P>
"We never thought something like this could happen in Sweden.
This is probably the largest fire catastrophe we have ever had in
Sweden," Olin said.
</P>
<P>
Helicopters were called in from Sweden's navy and air force to
help take the injured to hospital.
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson and Defense Minister Bjorn
von Sydow arrived in Gothenburg immediately after the fire.
Persson said his first reaction was one of sorrow and shock. He
said there would not be a shortage of money for experts to help
victims.
</P>
<P>
"Our thoughts are with those parents whose children never came
home," Persson said.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the city administration said the fire is
a catastrophe for not only Gothenburg but the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Gothenburg is Sweden's second largest city, on the country's
west coast about 500 kilometers southwest of Stockholm.

afternoon that the European Union (EU) hopes to strengthen its
partnership with China.

political, trade and human rights topics, and during the EU-China
summit in London in April, both parties decided to hold the summit
annually.
</P>
<P>
It is important that the EU maintains closer relations with
China in a multipolar world, and there are plenty of chances and
possibilities to improve those relations, said Santer, the first
EC president to visit China in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Santer expressed his appreciation for China's continued reforms
and its not depreciating the currency, saying that the EU has
pledged of supporting China's entry into the World Trade
Organization.

<P>
LUANDA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States has provided
Angola 400 million U.S. Dollars in aid since the Lusaka Peace
Protocol was signed in 1994, said visiting U.S. Deputy Secretary
of State for African Affairs Susan Rice.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar here Thursday, Susan Rice said Angola
has been Africa's biggest beneficiary from the U.S. finnacical
aid.
</P>
<P>
Angola is also the third biggest trade partner of the U.S. in
sub-Saharan Africa, she added.
</P>
<P>
At present, seven percent of the U.S. petroleum imports come
from Angola. Rice predicted that U.S. oil imports from Angola
will go up to 10 percent in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investors are interested in not only Angola's petroleum
industry, but also in such sectors as sugar, flour, fishery and
services, she said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the U.S. exports to Africa stood at six billion
U.S. Dollars while that of the imports from Africa at 1.6 billion
Dollars, according to Rice.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official has arrived in Angola for talks with Angolan

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Nigerians Become Blind Yearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 200,000 Nigerians become
blind every year due to lack of awareness and inadequate number
of eye-care personnel and facilities in the country, a health
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Adenike Abioge, Vice Chairman of the National
Program for Prevention of Blindness, said Thursday in Kaduna,
central Nigeria, that about one million Nigerians are blind while
more than three million are visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
She noted that two-thirds of these blind Nigerians are
needlessly blind as their cause of blindness may have been
prevented in the first place, The Guardian newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
She argued that half of all those blind could have cataract
surgery to restore their eyesight, an operation which is safe and
lasts for only half an hour.
</P>
<P>
However, the health official said, at present only thousands
of such cataract operations are performed annually in the country
due mainly to lack of awareness and inadequate number of eye-care
personnel and facilities.
</P>
<P>
Abioge was speaking in Kaduna at the launch of cataract
surgery at the community levels in the west African country in a
bid to curb the increasing cases of blindness among Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government launched the National Program for
Prevention of Blindness in 1990 aimed at fostering necessary
political and resource support from various levels of government
departments.
</P>
<P>
The program has supported eye health education through
production of relevant audio visual aids to all states in the
country and development of specific disease control efforts to
tackle some of the main causes of blindness.

<HEADLINE> Clan Fighting Kills 40 in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 40 people died and
nearly 60 others were wounded during the fighting Thursday
afternoon at the former United Nations Operation for Somalia
(UNOSOM) headquarters of Huddor town in Bakol region.
</P>
<P>
The armed confrontations were between the militiamen of
Hussein Mohamed Aidid and those of the Rahanwein Resistance Army
(RRA) in northern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to confirmed reports from confidential sources
Friday, the town has fallen and Hussein Aidid's men have escaped
with several of their battle wagons in the direction of Bay
region where forces loyal to Hussein Aidid maintain its control.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed All Aden Qalinle, spokesman for the RRA here in
Mogadishu, said Friday his forces launched the attack against the
militia positions of Hussein Aidid's men in Huddor town at 16:00
hours local time Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the town of Huddor has fallen for his forces Thursday
night after bloody battle between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that they are continuing their offensive
against Hussein Aidid's men as long as they occupy parts of their
land in Bay and Bakol regions.
</P>
<P>
Qalinle said his forces have killed 20 of Hussein Aidid's men
during the fighting and captured two big lorries mounted with
anti-aircraft heavy machine guns.
</P>
<P>
The RRA admitted it has lost one man during the fighting while
six others sustained gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the casualty figures on the RRA is believed to
be much higher and according to the VHF radio reports from the
region there has been quite a number of civilians killed or
wounded in this unexpected insurgence by the RRA.
</P>
<P>
There has been no official word from Hussein Aidid's side over
the fighting. However, militia commanders loyal to Hussein Aidid
admitted that the town has fallen with some casualties on their
side.
</P>
<P>
According to the militia officials, the fighting began during
a withdrawal process by their forces from the town in accordance
with an earlier agreement between the two sides. They noted that
the whole issue has been misinterpreted by their political
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
VHF radio reports from Bakol said there are still five more
battle wagons and dozens of militiamen loyal to Hussein Aidid
missing in the jungle after fleeing the sudden attack by the RRA.
The militia commanders here in Mogadishu have expressed concern
over the fate of those men since many of the roads between Huddor
and Baidoa have been mined by the RRA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the southern port town of Kismaio said
all international staff members of the UN agencies as well as
those of the international NGOs have been evacuated temporarily
from the town following the escalating armed clashes between the
Marehan and Majerten clans outside the town.
</P>
<P>
"The international expatriates are now said to be monitoring
the situation from Nairobi, while their offices are being run by
the local staff. The Marehans are said to be making further
advances toward the town in their attempt to regain at least
their former militia bases in and outside Kismaio.
</P>
<P>
The emergency relocation of the international staff from
Kismaio is a serious setback on the humanitarian operations by
those agencies in the town, since the remaining local staff in
the town are not authorized to promote their business in dealing
with the current humanitarian crises.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga made a strong appeal Friday for collective efforts to
save the South Asian Environment.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating The three-day 4th meeting of the Environment
Ministers of South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), the president said much need to be done to stop the
degradation of natural resources in the South Asian Countries.
</P>
<P>
She admitted that national efforts were decisive in addressing
most issues. However, she said, in the case of the environment a
regional approach is necessary because even local environmental
problems have implications for the entire region.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that a great deal of environment
degradation was a result of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, she said, poverty alleviation is not only a moral
imperative but also a prerequisite for environmental
sustainability.
</P>
<P>
She also noted the apparently conflicting objectives of
development and environmental conservation.
</P>
<P>
The environment ministers and representatives of the seven
SARRC member countries, namely Bangladesh, Bhutan, India,
Pakistan, Nepal, the Maldives and Sri Lanka, attended the opening
ceremony of the meeting, which is one of the most important
components of SAARC which was formed in 1985.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and foreign
intellectual property rights experts today called for a strong
worldwide IPR system to help boost global economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The world economy is almost completely integrated and goods and
services, especially those involving advanced technology, must be
global for the developer to recoup the investment required to
create them, said Michael Kirk, executive director of the American
Intellectual Property Law Association.
</P>
<P>
Kirk and other IPR specialists spoke about a uniform system for
IPR protection at an international symposium in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
One of them, Warren Bovee, of the IP department of the U.S.
3M, said that the importance of intellectual property rights is
being recognized as an important element of international trade
more and more, and IP has also been recognized as significant in
the development and maintenance of international business.
</P>
<P>
It is in the economic interest of all countries to have an
effective, efficient patent system, and making the patent system
uniform on a global basis will achieve that goal, he said.

<P>
The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPs), which took effect on January 1, 1995, is the most
comprehensive multilateral agreement on intellectual property
rights ever. It sets seven categories of intellectual property
rights standards and rules on enforcement.
</P>
<P>
It also provides for application to the WTO to resolve disputes
between member states and covers copyrights, trademarks,
industrial designs, patents, integrated circuit designs, and trade
secrets.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Dexi, director general of the International Cooperation
Department of China's State Intellectual Property Office (SIPO),
said that although unifying IPR is a liberalization and
integration of the world economy, different conditions in
different countries have a counter effect on internationalization
and harmonization.
</P>
<P>
Wen Xikai, another SIPO official, said that China has revised
its patent law twice and the country has come up to international
patent standards.
</P>
<P>
The internationalization of IPR protection is part of China's
effort to join the World Trade Organization, according to Zheng
Songyu, managing director of the China Patent Agent in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Security Forces Raid Yassin's House: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian security forces
raided the house of spiritual leader of the Islamic militant group
Hamas Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in Gaza Thursday night searching for a
Palestinian fugitive, Israel Radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The telephone line in Yassin's house was also cut off, the
radio said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was not allowed out for prayer Friday since he was under
a house arrest placed by Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
Thursday, according to local radio and TV reports.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials said Yassin was confined to house arrest
"because his recent statements were against the Palestinian
national interests."
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move, the first the PNA has taken against
the Hamas leader since he returned to Gaza in October 1997, was
seen as part of PNA's efforts to round up Hamas activists in the
wake of a suicide bombing Thursday in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli soldier was killed when a Palestinian car loaded
with explosives rammed into an Israeli military jeep escorting a
bus carrying about 40 children of settlers and blew up outside
the major Jewish settlement of Gush Katif.
</P>
<P>
The suicide bomber was also killed and five people were injured
in the terror attack. Israel Radio said Hamas has claimed
responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
Arafat quickly condemned the terror act and vowed to take
every measure possible to bring to justice those behind it.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security sources said that more than 100 Hamas
activists, including several senior members, have been arrested
in Gaza since the attack.
</P>
<P>
Yassin denounced the PNA decision to place him under house
arrest as "incorrect and unsound."
</P>
<P>
Under a newly-signed Israeli-Palestinian interim agreement, the
PNA will take tougher measures to fight terrorism while Israel
will hand over 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security officials have stressed that they will
live up to the commitments made in the agreement, including those
concerning security issues.

<HEADLINE> EU Allocates More Aid for Flood Victims in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
announced on Friday the additional allocation of humanitarian aid
worth 1.05 million ECUs (one million U.S. dollars) to the victims
of the flood disasters this year in China.
</P>
<P>
The funding will be used mainly in crisis relief, particularly
food aid and water purification, the executive body of the
European Union (EU) said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the emergency aid will be managed by the
European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) and will be
delivered via the International Federation of the Red Cross and
the Red Crescent.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, the EU has allocated a total of 2.73 million
ECUs (2.6 million US dollars) in humanitarian assistance to the
victims of the natural disasters in China.
</P>
<P>
ECHO, which was set up in 1992, is a service of the European
Commission which is responsible for managing humanitarian aid to
non-European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
As one of the world's biggest aid donors, ECHO has made
available over three billion ECUs (2.86 billion US dollars) for
projects in 100 countries.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, the office had managed aid worth 442 million
ECUs (420 million US dollars) in 66 countries, EU statistics

<HEADLINE> China Plans Internet Home Page on IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China plans to set up a web
site on the Internet for its intellectual property rights
protection to provide information on various court decisions,
according to Jiang Zhipei, the deputy chief judge of the IP
Tribunal of the Supreme People's Court judge.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he believes that this will benefit IP rights
holders, society and foreign investors, adding that China will
make a legislative, judicial, administrative and social effort to
protection intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the nation's courts have handled 22,860 IPR
disputes, with a decision reached on 21,830, in the past six years.
</P>
<P>
Chinese law, in agreement with international conventions,
protects patent, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual
property rights, and Chinese courts have increased the judicial
protection of intellectual property rights against plagiarizism,
illegally copying, and contract breaches, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The revised Criminal Law took effect in October 1997 and allows
for a three to seven year prison sentence for offenders.
</P>
<P>
The High People's Court in Beijing also trains scholars from
law schools, institutes or government offices in trying major
difficult IPR cases, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
A sound system for adjudicating intellectual property rights
disputes is an important prerequisite of IPR protection, said Lu
Guoqiang, chief judge of the IP Tribunal of the High People's
Court of Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Christie's HK Autumn Sale to Be Held on November 2-4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Christie's Hong Kong autumn
sale series will be held between November 2 and 4 at the JW
Marriott Hotel, Anthony Lin, deputy chairman of Christie's Asia
said here Friday at a press preview.
</P>
<P>
This year's autumn sale series includes the Contemporary Chinese
 Oil Paintings, Fine Modern and Contemporary Chinese Paintings,
Fine Chinese Paintings from the Tsi Ku Chai Collection,
Exceptional Chinese Ceramics and Buddhist Treasures as well as
Magnificent Jewelry, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
"Shrubalthea," an important oil painting by renowned
contemporary artist Wu Guanzhong, will be offered along with 40
other works at the sale of Contemporary Chinese Oil Paintings
during the auction series.
</P>
<P>
Expected to realize between 1.5 million HK dollars (192,307
U.S. dollars) and 2 million HK dollars (256,410 U.S. dollars),
"Shrubalthea" is a charming depiction of the artist's garden in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The painting is highly unusual due both to the large size of
the canvas and the fact that this particular painting has never
appeared before at auction.
</P>
<P>
Lin Fengmian is represented by a pair of oil paintings entitled
"Opera Figures," which is estimated at 300,000 HK dollars (38,462
U.S. dollars) to 350,000 HK dollars (44,872 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Characters from Chinese operas are Lin's favorite theme
allowing him to depict not only action and images but the
confrontation of good and evil as well.
</P>
<P>
Paintings by Wang Yidong expressing the strong rustic
sentiments of the North include "Bride in Waiting," which is
estimated at 450,000 HK dollars (57,692 U.S. dollars). It is
widely regarded as the most accomplished work from Wang's Bride
Series, which has been widely exhibited and published.
</P>
<P>
The magnificent "Sunshine after the Rain" by Zhang Daqian from
the private collection of Heidi Wang from California, a friend of
the artist's, is estimated to fetch between 1.8 million HK dollars
 (230,769 U.S. dollars) and 2 million HK dollars (256,410
U.S. dollars) at the sale of Fine Modern and Contemporary Chinese
Paintings, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The other important private collection comprises a total of 20
works of art by great masters such as Xu Beihong, Zhao Shao'ang
and Qi Baishi.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90 fine Chinese paintings from the renowned Tsi Ku
Chai gallery which celebrates its 40th anniversary this year will
also be offered as part of Christie's autumn auction series.
</P>
<P>
Tsi Ku Chai was established in 1958 with the mission to promote
Chinese paintings which capture the Zeigeist of the modern
age. It quickly became a well respected art gallery among
collectors of Chinese art.
</P>
<P>
The Fine Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art including
exceptional Buddhist images will be an important part of
Christie's Hong Kong autumn sale series, said Lin.
</P>
<P>
Following the success of Christie's Hong Kong inaugural sale of
Buddhist sculptures last spring, Christie's will continue this
popular theme with inclusions of some 40 pieces in a category
entitled "Gods of the Buddhist Pantheon," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
A number of the important images are from private collections
never before seen at auction. The dating of these Chinese Buddhist
deities ranges from the 5th century to the 18th century.
</P>
<P>
Their styles and iconography are reflective of the varied
influences throughout Chinese history providing a comprehensive
picture of the changing fortunes of Buddhist art and faith in
China.
</P>
<P>
The sale of Fine Chinese Ceramics includes an extremely rare
imperial famille rose yellow-ground wine cup from the Kangxi
period (1662-1722) which is expected to generate considerable
interest during the sale.
</P>
<P>
Other ceramics include those in Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and
Song dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
Lin said that the most important private collection of jewelry
ever offered in Asia will go under the hammer on November 2 as
part of Christie's Hong Kong autumn sale series.
</P>
<P>
Theresa Po Lau, a leading business figure in the Far East and
co-founder of Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd., one of Hong Kong's
foremost real estate and corporate investment companies, will be
selling part of her personal jewelry collection at the JW Marriott
Hotel, Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The collection, comprising 60 lots, is estimated at over 55
million HK dollars (7 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Programme For Poor Produces No Desired Results: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Indian President Kocheril
Raman Narayanan admitted here Friday that government programmes
for poor and women initiated 50 years ago had not produced desired
results.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inauguration of the Women's World Banking Global
Meet which began here today, Narayanan said "these massive
programmes have not produced desired results primarily due to
bureaucratic hurdles or their non-implementation."
</P>
<P>
Since India's independence from British rule in 1947, several
programmes like Integrated Rural Development Programme and
Development of Women and Children in Rural Area were launched by
the Indian governments to improve the social and economic
conditions of the deprived classes.
</P>
<P>
Though they were aimed at employment generation, creation of
productive assets, upgradation of technical and entrepreneurial
skills and raising the income level of the poor, these programmes
failed to produce the desired effect, Narayanan said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the failure of government agencies in implementing
the programmes, the president said, non-governmental institutions
were now being involved in the execution of the schemes.
</P>
<P>
He said that constitutional status and power conferred upon
local self-government institutions had given a new impetus to the
people's participation in development programmes at the grassroots
level.
</P>
<P>
Narayanan said "there is a growing realization that despite
vast expansion of formal banking sector and the existence of many
specialized institutions (in India), there is a large section of
population, specially poor women, who remain unreached and
undeserved by banks."
</P>
<P>
With about 60 million poor households in the country, he said,
the empowerment of women of these households has special meaning
for the Indian government.

<HEADLINE> EU, China Cooperate on Stabilizing Global Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A member of the European
Commission today called for a closer partnership between the EC
and China to help stabilize the international finances.
</P>
<P>
World economic growth in the next two years will mainly depend
on the EC and China, said Yges-Thibault de Silguy, the EC official
in charge of trade and financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Euro will help the EC gain lost ground in the global
financial and currency system, while China needs to participate in
reforming the old currency system, he added.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for introducing the Euro next January 1 are done
and the market has reacted favorably to it, as is indicated in
rising official reserves and stability of currencies of the 11
European members.
</P>
<P>
This will bring opportunities for China, because Chinese firms
will be able to trade with the 11 European countries in a single
currency, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the EU will never adopt trade protectionism
after the Euro is launched and will remain one of the most open
markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
The economy behind the Euro is comparable to that of the United
States, and the Euro is expected to become a major stabilizer in
the global currency system, according to Zhu Min, economic adviser
to the president of the Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
However, Holger Schmieding, a vice-president at Merrill Lynch
Limited predicts that Euro will fail with the failure in Europe's
reform of its labor market and welfare system, and may be blamed
for the increase in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The EU and the Euro may, wrongly, be blamed if that happens,
but this is just a residual risk and the European economy will
more likely get better and more flexible so as to support the Euro
to become a genuine rival to the US dollar, Schmieding said.

<HEADLINE> China's Contract Law Should Cover More, Legislators Say (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers have called
that that a draft of the Contract Law should be expanded to
include other forms of contracts to coincide with economic life.
</P>
<P>
Qin Henggao, member of the Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress, said today that the current draft only
deals with contracts between equal economic entities, and if there
is to be a unified contract law, land contracts and grain
procurement deals between farmers and the state need to be
included.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiangyuan, Li Yining and other lawmakers said that the
Chinese Communist Party has announced that the land contract
system between farmers and the state will last for another 30
years, so the number of land contracts that the law involves will
be enormous and they are the most fundamental forms of contract in
China.
</P>
<P>
So, the land contracts should get included in the law, or a
separate law needs to be made, Li Yining said.

Song Qingwei, vice-chairman of the NPC Foreign Affairs
Committee, said that various new businesses appearing in China are
resulting in a growing number of new forms of contracts and the
existing law is behind the times.
</P>
<P>
Postal and communications disputes are on the increase, for
example, but with no appropriate law, he added.
</P>
<P>
The existing draft says that those who cannot fulfill a
contract due to "policy alterations" or "extraordinary forces
beyond their prediction and control" are not responsible for
breaking the contract.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Wu Shuqing said that this should be canceled because
it will affect the credit of Chinese firms in foreign trade.
Another lawmaker, Chen Mingshu, said that "extraordinary forces"
are hard to define and will possibly result in unfairness in the
implementation of the law.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jialu, a vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said
that legal consequences for breaking contracts should be further
detailed and criminal penalties included, because without criminal
punishment, the growing number of violations of contracts in China
will not be easily solved.

<P>
CAIRO -- Germany will offer Egypt 26 million German marks (15

</P>
<P>
Director of Egypt's Agricultural Research Center Saad Nassar

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Admit Secret Contacts with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Afghan Taliban has admitted secret contacts between Iran and the
militia, and disclosed that some top Taliban officials had paid
secret visits to Iran in the past.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Hakim Muneeb disclosed that the Taliban had in the past
sent a high-ranking delegation to Iran. However, talks with Iran
could not yield any results, according to a report Friday by the
News Network International (NNI).
</P>
<P>
NNI quoted Muneeb as saying in an interview that as a result of
secret contacts with the Iranian officials, the delegation was
sent to Tehran to persuade the Iranians to end interference in
Afghanistan's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban official regretted the Taliban failure to convince
the Iranian authorities to bring a shift in their policy. The
current tension between Iran and Afghanistan is not the result of
the killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan, rather, the
failed policy of the Iranian officials is its basic cause, Muneeb
said.
</P>
<P>
The recent Iranian military exercise at the Afghan border, he
said, has further boosted the morale of the Taliban who are well
prepared to defend their borders.
</P>
<P>
He said if the Iranians want to impose a war on the Afghans,
the Taliban militia is ready to meet any eventuality.
</P>
<P>
Muneeb said that the Taliban want to establish good and
friendly relations with all countries, particularly the
neighboring countries.

<P>
DHAKA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan will provide Bangladesh
with about 8.3 million U.S. dollars in grant to procure rice under
an agreement signed in Rome Friday, the official BSS news agency
reported, quoting a press release of the Japanese Embassy in
Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government and the Rome-based World Food Program
(WFP) signed a relative accord under which Japan will provide the
money through the WFP to Bangladesh to finance its purchase of
rice, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's decision to extend the grant was made
upon a request from the Bangladeshi government in view of the
recent devastating floods, it stated.
</P>
<P>
The grant is one of the biggest contribution ever made by Japan
to Bangladesh for the procurement of foodgrains, it added.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Reserve Bank Says Economy Still in Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Fiji's economy still remains
in recession with output expected to contract by between 3 and 4
percent this year, the Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The recession was attributed to an eight-month drought this
year which caused sugar production to fall by about 50 percent to
its lowest level in 30 years, and affected the other sectors of
the economy, the Australian Associated Press quoted a RBF's
statement from Suva as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fiji earns close to 300 million Fijian dollars (about 150
million U.S. dollars) from sugar, the backbone of its economy, but
industry sources say this income will be halved this year because
the prolonged drought has destroyed thousands of hectares of sugar
cane.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said, despite this, foreign exchange
reserves remained strong.
</P>
<P>
Other key features of the economy in the past six months were:
the exchange rate remained competitive; consumption was weak and
fell; wage increases were moderate; and the agricultural sector
was weak but the tourism and garment industries performed well.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, low levels of investment in recent
years had accentuated Fiji's exposure to negative developments.
</P>
<P>
"While some sectors of the economy have weakened sharply over
the past six months, others have performed well in this difficult
environment," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Not surprisingly, the drought and deteriorating global
conditions have seen production in the agricultural sector and
mining sector drop and this has carried over to some parts of the
manufacturing sector and the retail sector has also slowed," the
RBF said.
</P>
<P>
"However, there have been continued strong performances in the
garments and tourism industries.
</P>
<P>
"Garment manufacturers expect to improve again in their export
performance. Tourism has rebounded from the setback at the start
of the year and visitor arrivals are currently at record highs."
</P>
<P>
The RBF said these sectors were providing a strong income boost
for the economy at a "very crucial time".
</P>
<P>
It said the outlook for overall production next year was a
little better although a lot depend on how quickly the weather
conditions return to normal and on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"At this stage it is expected that the economy will grow by
around two to three percent in 1999," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
While inflation has picked up sharply since the beginning of
the year the rate of price increases has moderated significantly
over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
"In this period prices increased by 1.8 percent," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
It said the external sector of the economy has held up well
largely because of a 20 percent devaluation in February.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, "substantially stronger export receipts and
weaker import payments have boosted foreign exchange reserves."
</P>
<P>
"The foreign reserves are currently more than 710 million
Fijian dollars (353 million U.S. dollars), and additional
increases are likely over the next few months."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the projected high level of reserves should
cushion the country from any further deterioration in the global
economy.

<HEADLINE> Trade Volume at Guangzhou Fair Equals Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite the impact of the
Asian financial crisis, the total export volume at the
just-concluded 84th Guangzhou Commodity Fair in this capital of
south China's Guangdong Province equaled the all-time record.
</P>
<P>
With transactions of 11 billion U.S. dollars, this fair, which
closed today, was as successful as the 78th fair in the autumn of
1994 which achieved the same export volume. But the number of
overseas participants at the latest fair hit a record high of
70,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Commodity Fair, the largest of its kind in China
for the past forty-two years, is regarded as the barometer of
China's foreign trade, and its trade volume constitutes 25 percent
of the country's total annual export volume.
</P>
<P>
The fair witnessed rising transactions with business people
from the EU, the United States and the Middle East, whose numbers
accounted for 20.41 percent of all participants, and whose trade
volume made up 57.2 percent of the total, indicating that China's
effort to diversify its market is paying off.
</P>
<P>
It is worth noting that trade volume with Japan, Korea and
Southeast Asian nations rebounded considerably, up 2.1, 15.9 and
30.5 percent, respectively, over the last fair.
</P>
<P>
China's manufacturerers including the Haier, Chunlan and Greece
groups as well as foreign-funded enterprises in China enjoyed
brisk export transactions, with volume of over 500 million
U.S. dollars, 4.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The fair also saw a rise in transactions in products of the
electro-mechanical, textile and garment, and light industries,
whose export volume made up 25.8, 19 and 37.4 percent of the
total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The export of foodstuffs, native products and livestock
reversed their downward trends at the fair, while exports of
metals, minerals, chemical products and medicine and health
products fell to some extent.
</P>
<P>
High-tech exports accounted for nine percent of the total
export volume at more than one billion U.S. dollars. But insiders
say that it will still take time before such products are exported
in large quantities.

great significant for Sino-EU ties.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that both the EU and China should shoulder
important responsibility in the world.
</P>
<P>

maintaining stable economic development, China has contributed to
the stability of the the world's economy and finance, as did the
EU by introducing the euro, the new European integrated currency,
and other measures, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators on Securities Act (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The drafting of a securities
act should focus on regulating the activities of the securities
market, preventing market risks, and protecting the interests of
investors.
</P>
<P>
This view was shared by legislators attending the ongoing fifth
meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
NPC Standing Committee members Wang Mingshi, Zhang Xiao, and
Wang Yuefeng stressed that the law must make it clear that banks
are not allowed to circulate funds for securities
companies. Strict regulations on how listed companies use
circulated funds should be stipulated in the draft.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuan, chairman of the board of directors of Beijing
University's Founder Group Corp, a listed corporation in Hong
Kong, urged strict market supervision.
</P>
<P>
"Strict supervision over listed companies is a must for
protecting investors and safeguarding market order," he said,
adding, insiders should be prevented by law from divulging
commercial secrets, and this should include insiders' family
members, relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
The legislators also discussed the supervision of government
securities supervisory body. They believe that supervising the
activities of the supervisory body should be done within a legal
and normal orbit. The draft should map out specific stipulations
on a working process for the supervisory body.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some other legislators did not think conditions for a
securities act were ripe because China's securities market is
still in the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
Some who have worked with securities for years said the early
enactment of a securities act is urgently needed for regulating
the market.
</P>
<P>
China now has 820 companies listed on security exchanges at
home and 43 listed overseas which have raised 320 billion yuan of
domestic funds and 14 billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds. The
number of securities investors has increased to 38 million.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Daojiong, the first chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission under the State Council, outlined some major
problems today.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there are no laws regulating the market;
supervision is weak; the securities market, controlled sometimes
by several big investors, is too opportunistic; some intermediate
service organizations are not self-disciplined; some listed
companies pay more attention to raising funds than to system
reform and became investors with raised funds.
</P>
<P>
A perfect securities act would make a great contribution to the
healthy growth of the socialist market economy, otherwise it will
be another unstable factor in economic and social development,
Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
The nine-day meeting of the NPC Standing Committee is scheduled
to conclude next Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Adopts Action Plan on Social Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 30 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN senior officials at
their second meeting on rural development and poverty eradication
Friday adopted an action plan on social safety nets with the aim
of assessing and monitoring the social impact of the regional
financial and economic crisis on the rural and poverty sectors.
</P>
<P>
The action plan would involve managing and implementing safety
nets programs for the disadvantaged and vulnerable, improving the
effectiveness of economic and social services delivery and
promoting public awareness of the impact of the crisis on poverty,
Secretary General of the Ministry of Rural Development Abdul Aziz
Muhamad told a press conference after the meeting which ended
Friday.
</P>
<P>
To implement the action plan, the officials agreed to establish
an ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Task Force on
Social Safety Nets, Abdul Aziz, who is chairman of the meeting,
said, adding that the task force is aimed at promoting regional
cooperation in response to the immediate social impacts of the
crisis, with particular focus on poverty issues and the
development of the rural populace.
</P>
<P>
He said the task force, which will meet regularly to review the
progress of the implementation of the action plan, would strive to
develop a comprehensive regional work plan focusing on the
development of social safety nets and other forms of social
protection to cushion the impact of the crisis on the target
group.
</P>
<P>
It would also serve as a forum for mobilizing resources and
technical assistance from international aid agencies, ASEAN's
Dialogue Partners, ASEAN Foundation and the private sector, to
implement the task force's programs and activities, he added.
</P>
<P>
The task force will have its next meeting on December 4 and 5
in Indonesia prior to the forthcoming Informal Meeting of ASEAN
Ministers on Rural Development and Poverty Eradication in early
December, he said.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials at the meeting also agreed to come up with
a standard measurement of poverty where the member countries would
propose a clear-cut definition of poverty in their respective
countries.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed ASEAN's unity where the member countries are
able to come together to address the regional problem as one.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials meeting was attended by delegates from the
ASEAN Secretariat and the nine ASEAN members -- Brunei, Indonesia,
Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
Vietnam. Observers from Cambodia also attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> UK Lags Behind Competitors in Productivity: Consultancy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The productivity of management
and workers in Britain lags significantly behind that of their
competitors, according to one of the world's foremost management
consultancies.
</P>
<P>
The McKinsey Global Institute examined six sectors of the
economy -- car production, telecoms, food processing, retailing,
software and hotels -- and found that in most of them productivity
was low.
</P>
<P>
Bill Lewis, the director of McKinsey's Global Institute, said
the UK was vastly underperforming its true potential.
</P>
<P>
He said better productivity would trigger much higher incomes
and lower prices and "would enable Britain to catch up with
countries such as Germany and the United States."
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the UK's gross domestic product per
head is 20 percent lower than Germany's and a staggering 40
percent less than that of the United States.
</P>
<P>
McKinsey blames regulatory constraints, low investment and a
lack of skills for the UK's poor track record.
</P>
<P>
The survey says British companies have failed to adopt best
global practices. Car prices, for example, could fall by 10
percent if UK manufacturers were more productive, it argues.
</P>
<P>
However, Lewis pointed out that even though UK productivity
lagged behind that of Germany and France, it was way ahead in
terms of structural changes of its labor and capital markets.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Customs Offices Increasing IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A division chief of China's
General Administration of Customs (GAC), Li Qunying, told an
international symposium on intellectual property rights today that
China had seized a total of more than 1,900 shipments of goods
that violated intellectual property rights laws by the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
China has made laws or regulations to stop these kinds of goods
and given customs the power to take action to prevent imports or
exports, Li said, and the Regulation on Customs Protection of
Intellectual Property Rights in 1995 shows China's determination.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fundamental principle of IPR protection of
China's Customs is to make an effort to protect intellectual
property without making it difficult for legitimate trade.
</P>
<P>
China's customs offices destroyed 1.8 million pirated disks in
Guangzhou in June in the largest crackdown on illegal
publications. Law enforcement officers also closed 64 underground
production lines.
</P>
<P>
In most cases, Customs officers protect overseas businesses'
rights regardless of whether they make a formal request or not,
says Li Junhuan, another GAC official.

MOSCOW, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin

prescribed by his doctors to recuperate from "serious fatigue."

The 67-year-old president was scheduled to go to Vienna Tuesday
to attend the Russia-EU summit, but the trip was cancelled at the
last minute when his doctors advised him to stay put and take a
vacation.

Yeltsin expressed interest in the discussion of the government
documents aiming to stabilize the economic situation in Russia,
the Itar-Tass new agency quoted presidential spokesman Dmitry
Yakushkin as saying.
</P>

rising inflation and further drop in production.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin suffered two heart attacks in 1996 following the June
16 presidential elections and had quintuple heart bypass surgery
in November that year.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves 3-Year Adjustment Program for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) has approved a three-year enhanced structural
adjustment facility program for Ethiopia for 1998-2001.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Herald Friday quoted Finance Minister Sufian
Ahmed as saying that the IMF also approved the second annual
loan, an equivalent of 42 million U.S. Dollars, for Ethiopia
under the program for 1998/99 (July 1998-July 1999) in support of
the country's structural adjustment, economic and monetary
programs.
</P>
<P>
Sufian Ahmed said that the loan will be disbursed in two equal
semi-annual installments, the first of which will be available
immediately.
</P>
<P>
In approving the loan, the IMF proceeded from the fact that
Ethiopia has taken significant strides in deepening economic
reforms, said the Ethiopian minister.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also agreed with the idea that private sector
investment is likely to increase in the future as a result of a
better regulatory environment and improved infrastructure, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the agreement between Ethiopia and the IMF will
greatly assist in a speedy economic growth for Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The program will help Ethiopia's economy grow by seven
percent or more in the next three years, to contain inflation
below four percent and to keep the exchange rate from going above
seven Birr to one U.S. Dollar, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to the Addis Tribune, a private weekly
newspaper, published Friday, the IMF approved a three-year
enhanced structural adjustment facility arrangement for Ethiopia
on October 11, 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the mid-term review under that arrangement could not
be completed, and the first annual arrangement of the program was
allowed to expire on October 10, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Law on Administrative Appeal Wins Lawmakers' Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Participants at the Fifth
Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC) today gave full support to a bill on administrative
appeal after a full day of debate.
</P>
<P>
"It is of great significance to enact a law on administrative
appeal to assure that administrative organs act according to law
and protect the rights and interests of residents, corporations
and other organizations," said Huang Yuzhang, member of the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the participants were in favor of passing the
law to make government actions and administration more
standardized, scientific and democratic. This will help form a
closer relationship between the government and the people, they
affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Some of the participants said that administrators often make
mistakes but are unwilling to correct them. This causes many
complaints from the masses of the people, they said.
</P>
<P>
Concrete requirements should be given to improve the qualities
of government officials, they said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being legal, timely, open and convenient, the
procedures for administrative appeals should be just, they
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Such a law can help perfect the supervisory system of
self-correction within governmental administrations, the
participants believe.
</P>
<P>
However, they said that it needs more revisions to some
articles concerning the scope, limits and legal responsibilities
of administrative appeals before it goes into force. They expect
that the law will be adopted in the near future.
</P>
<P>
China enacted regulations governing administrative appeals by
the State Council in 1991. By the end of 1997, 220,000 cases had
been reported, about 30,000 cases a year.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Population Services
International (PSI) plans to launch 40,000 female condoms in the
market of Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam in November, PSI
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The female condoms are aimed at reducing risks of AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as well as family
planning, Alex Ngaiza, a STD co-ordinator with PSI, told Xinhua
by telephone.
</P>
<P>
Ngaiza said that female condoms will also be distributed to
other cities like Arusha, Mwanza and Mbeya in six months.
</P>
<P>
A pack of female condoms containing two pieces is priced at
300 Shillings (about 45 U.S. Cents), he said.
</P>
<P>
Ngaiza said PSI has already distributed such gadgets in other
African countries such as Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa and
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Studies done on nearly 2,000 women in nine countries found
that most of them accept the usage of female condoms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has a population of 31 million, 1.4 million of which
are estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS. Among these, 680,000
are women between ages of 15 and 49 years, statistics indicated.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chen Fengji, an expert with the
People's Bank of China, the central bank, today outlined the
blueprint for the country's future nationwide banking information
system.

<P>
He said the computer network will be based on networks
currently being operated by Chinese banks and their data banks.

The central bank, policy banks, regional banks, shareholding
banks and overseas banks in China all will have to integrate their
computer networks that are now running separately, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The framework of the network will include a banking payment
processing system, a management and information system, a
banking information consulting system, a foreign exchange and
international business system, and an office automation system.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU Will Add No New Requests on China's WTO Bid, Brittan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of the European
Commission Sir Leon Brittan said here today that the European
Union (EU) is "committing ourselves not to add any new requests
until the end of the next year, when new multi-lateral talks begin
in the WTO," at which time China's entry into the World Trade
Organization (WTO) will be on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Brittan made the remark at a symposium held here on business
relations between China and the EU.
</P>
<P>
"I am heartened by the continuing commitment of Chinese
political leaders to seek partnership with the WTO next year," he
said.
 "We in Europe want China to play its rightful part in the WTO as
it evolves," he said.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that China's reform now faces serious test and
this makes it all the more important for China to stay the course
of reform without slowing the pace, he said.
</P>
<P>
On financial reform, he suggested that China "should not open
its capital account before the right regulations are put in place
to ensure sound prudential standards in the country's financial
system."
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, vice chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, also spoke to
the symposium.
</P>
<P>
"The emergence of a single European economic and monetary union
will have a big influence on the world's political and economic
structure," he said, adding that such an entity will play an
important role in world's trade, investment and financial arenas.
</P>
<P>
He said that a recent EU report underlined the importance of
cooperation between Chinese and EU enterprises, creating a
favorable environment for boosting cooperation and exchanges in
the regard.
</P>
<P>
According to Jing, Chinese enterprises are concerned with
changes after the new Euro currency, the single European currency,
is used as an accounting unit in international trade in the eleven
European countries.
</P>
<P>
The EU now has become one of China's most important trading
partners with a total trade volume of 43.9 billion U.S. dollars
last year, up 8.3 percent over 1996, and approaching the volume
between China and the United States for the period.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Fair Illustrates Bright Export Prospect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- With a record participation
of 70,000 international buyers and record transactions of 11
billion U.S. dollars, the 84th China Export Commodity Fair, which
closed here today, illustrates bright export prospects for China,
according to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
The biannual event has long been considered a barometer of
China's foreign trade, and this autumn's fair especially was a
gauge for the development of trade next year.
</P>
<P>
Trade officials attending the fair pointed out that the
encouraging results not only illustrate the hope for a gradual
reversal of the downturn in China's export growth in the first
half this year, but also points to hopes for a better 1999.
</P>
<P>
As transactions with Asian countries such as the Republic of
Korea and Japan, which dropped in the spring event, resurged,
analysts are convinced once again that the impact of the Asian
financial crisis is diminishing.
</P>
<P>
During the current fair, transactions with southeast Asia rose
by over 120 million U.S. dollars, while participation soared by 40
to 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The fair also showed the continued high demand of markets in
Europe and North America, as transaction with the two largest
buyers -- the European Union and the United States -- jumped by
11.2 percent and 14.1 percent. Orders from Hong Kong and Macao,
which are collectively the third largest buyer, also grew, by a
smaller margin.
</P>
<P>
Most of the new clients at the fair were from Europe, North
America, the Middle East and Africa, indicating high potential in
these regions.
</P>
<P>
High-tech exports made up nine percent of the total, another
encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
Despite all the success, the negative effects of the Asian
financial crisis are also obvious, as transactions in and the
prices of raw and semi-finished materials dropped during the fair,
analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As the world economy is expected to slow down, and the impact
of the Asian financial crisis will continue, China's foreign trade
next year will still face arduous tasks, they added.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Stronger Despite Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
the week stronger despite worse-than-expected trade figures
released here Friday by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended local trade for the week at 62.54 U.S.
cents from Thursday night's close of 61.83 U.S. cents, trading
between 62.25 U.S. cents and 62.65 U.S. cents on the day.
</P>
<P>
According to Nick Volanakis, treasury manager at Colonial State
Bank, strong United States interest helped sustain the local
currency following its dip to 62.25 U.S. cents when the balance of
goods and services figures, showing a deficit of 634.15 million
U.S. dollars for September, were released.
</P>
<P>
A weaker U.S. dollar and stronger Japanese yen also helped the
local unit.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said the Australian dollar would move nervously into
next week, the prospect of an easing in monetary policy looming at
the Reserve Bank Australia's meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people are tipping it (a rate cut) will happen after
the meeting, sometime later in the week," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished at 72.38 Japanese yen from 72.20
yen and 1.0333 German marks from 1.0226 marks.

</P>
<P>
Speaking to INA after the meeting, Shariatmadar said that his

two neighbors.
</P>

signed an agreement on trade cooperation between the two former
foes who fought an eight-year bitter war from 1980-88 due to
border disputes.
</P>
<P>
Early last month, Saleh visited Iran to attend the 24th Tehran
International Fair, during which he discussed with Iranian
officials means of developing bilateral economic and trade
relations and widening their future prospect.

ULAN BATOR, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia has targeted a
3.5-percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 1999, the
Mongolian newspaper Government News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Acting Finance Minister Bat-Erdene Batbayar on Thursday briefed
the Great Hural (parliament) on the caretaker government's
policies on the country's economic and social development next
year, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Batbayar said efforts would be made to overcome the negative
effects of the Asian economic crisis on the Mongolian economy and
to maintain macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
The government would seek to keep inflation rate below 15
percent and foreign exchange reserves above 90 million
U.S. dollars in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mongolia's GDP growth, registered at 3.3 percent last year, was
targeted at 4.5 percent this year. But analysts said the figure
was difficult to achieve due to the impact of the Asian economic
crisis and the domestic political turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Pandas Find Home Near Mountain Villages (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang is not alone in the 40-household Banqiao, where villagers
often encounter pandas in fields and around the village, and some
of them resued pandas' life.
</P>
<P>
Dongdong, a three-year-old panda, was found with one front leg
broken on a winter day by farmer Liu Guozhen. Villagers brought
Dongdong back to the village on a quilt-covered stretcher.
</P>
<P>
During the next eight weeks, more than 100 villagers took turns
nursing Dongdong, feeding him sweet porridge, potatos, Chinese
cabbage, sugarcane and apples. Children climbed the mountains to
pick up fresh bamboo leaves and dig tender bamboo shoots for him.
</P>
<P>
Longlong is another ailing panda rescued by villagers in
Banqiao Village. Breathing with difficultly, Longlong met Liao
Changfa and his son when they were grazing cattle on a fall day
and the father and son carried her back in a handcart.
</P>
<P>
Longlong soon recovered from dysentery after she was given
injections and medicine and then stayed with the Liaos for the
ensuing six weeks. Liao and several villagers cleaned out a room
for her and brought her fresh bamboo leaves. Villagers also
donated money to help the poor Liao family buy milk powder for
Longlong.
</P>
<P>
When time came to return to the wild, Longlong, reluctant to
leave the villagers, looked back time and again. Later she
sneaked back to the village several times.
</P>
<P>
"Locals often cite giant panda as a mascot," said Village head
Zhang Zeguo, "my fellow villagers learned from their ancestors
that hunters never lift a hand against a panda, or 'lovely child'
as they often refer to it."
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Chinese government made Banqiao and its
surrounding mountain forests part of the Changqing National
Nature Reserve three years ago, and took away guns from hunters.
</P>
<P>
Today, boars and pheasants today often plague this part of the
nature reserve and leave the farmers' fields in a terrible
state.
</P>
<P>
"To protect pandas, we've banned the placing of lassos, but the
boars take advantage of this," said one villager.

BANQIAO VILLAGE, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Jiaojiao has given
birth to another baby panda so farmer Wang Wenshu shuttles daily
between the cave where she lives and his own house, bringing her
food and candies.
</P>
<P>
"He has not been bustling in and out like this even when I had
a baby," said Wang's wife, jealously.
</P>
<P>
Meek and naive, Jiaojiao is a 15-year-old giant panda living in
a cave a 40-minute walk from Banqiao Village where Wang lives. She
has had three sons and one daughter in several caves near Banqiao
over the past years. The caves are covered in dense bamboo forests
on the southern slope of the Qinling Range about 500 km from
northwest China's ancient city of Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
One thousand and four meters above sea level, the southern
slope of the Qinling Range is home to 250 of the 1,000 giant
pandas in the world.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenshu, once a part-time guide for an expedition team from
Beijing University looking for giant pandas, became friends with
Panda Jiaojiao when she had her first baby.
</P>
<P>
Everyday, Wang trekked five km along mountainous paths to visit
Jiaojiao and her little cubs, bringing fresh and tender bamboo
shoots, steamed corn bread and candies.
</P>
<P>
"The little downy panda is really cute. She looks happy,
contented and very lovely in my arms," Wang said as he told how
it felt to hold a baby panda in his arms.
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Wang nicknamed his second son "panda" too.

<HEADLINE> Pandas Find Home Near Mountain Villages (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No pandas here have got injured or died of cold or hunger over
the past two decades, an official of the nature reserve said.
</P>
<P>
"Pandas are smart," he said, "when they go hungry or are ill,
they will lay on road or by riverside so that passers-by will
easily spot them. Sometimes they just show up at the doors of
some villagers."
</P>
<P>
One day recently a panda named Maomao pushed open the door of
the house of Gu Yingming, head of the village, and dropped in.
</P>
<P>
Gu's mother brought some sliced bacon for this "honorable"
guest. Maomao then sniffed a jar of honey in the corner of the
house. After eating a rich dinner, Maomao fell asleep in Gu's
cattle pen for the night.
</P>
<P>
The next day Maomao was given another feast at Wang Degang's
home. After he ate and drank his fill, Maomao, swaying his head,
sat on his bottom beside the heated brick bed to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
All the family members sat around Maomao and tried to amuse
him. Maomao was happy to bowwow and baa baa from time to time.
</P>
<P>
Panda stories from Banqiao reassure Professor Pan Wenshi, the
country's leading giant-panda specialist, that human beings and
giant pandas can live together in harmony.
</P>
<P>
"Giant pandas here (the Qinling Range) are the wild species
that Chinese scientists will most likely be able to successfully
rescue," said Prof. Pan.
</P>
<P>
As this fall becomes colder, Wang Wenshu and his fellow
villagers often see young pandas playing with their mothers in the
wild. Wang even saw Jiaojiao's daughter, who he had once held in
his arms, walking in the forest with her own baby.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy that Jiaojiao is blessed with many children now,"
Wang said.

<HEADLINE> Sino-European Seminar Highlights Women's Human Rights (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China and Europe share the
common aspiration to protect and promote women's rights, a senior
official with the All-China Women's Federation (ACWF) said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Sino-European Seminar on Women's Issues, which
closed in Beijing today, Feng Cui, member of the secretariat of
the ACWF, said that helping women in poverty and women's political
participation and education are all issues related to the
protection and promotion of women's rights.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to the individual countries to decide how to realize
women's human rights, taking into account their own national and
social developments," Feng said. "The most important task for
Chinese women now is to achieve the right to subsistence and
development."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has drafted the Program for the
Development of Chinese Women (1995-2000), which set out the main
goals and specific tasks for the development of Chinese women, she
said.
</P>
<P>
A legal system has been basically formed for the protection of
women and for cracking down on the abductions, kidnapping, abuse
and ill-treatment of women and children, and all other criminal
acts, with the Constitution as its basis and the Law of Protection
of Women's Rights and Interests as the main component, she said.

South Africa, Desmond Tutu, Thursday presented a five-volume,
3,500-page report on the tragic chronicles of the Apartheid years
(1960-1993) to President Nelson Mandela, in which both the Apartheid

They said domestic violence should not be regarded as a private
affair, and women, especially handicapped, aged and migrant women,
must be guaranteed legal protection.
</P>
<P>
They noted that the abduction and kidnapping of women has
become an "international trade" like drug trafficking, and all
countries should adopt laws to crack down on such abuses.
</P>
<P>
Feng Cui said that Chinese and European women also agreed
during the five-day seminar that "poverty is the most serious
problem affecting women's status," "women's participation in
politics and management of social affairs should be improved" and
"education is important for the realization of gender equality."
</P>
<P>
Improving people's awareness of protecting women's rights
requires the united efforts of women from all countries, said
Daniela Napoli, head of the Human Rights and Democratization Unit
of the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
She said the seminar was a first step made by European and
Chinese women to expand their exchanges and cooperation, and from

multilateral cooperion on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Phone Companies Compete for China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The world's three major
satellite telephone companies are engaged in a final dash to enter
the Chinese market before commencing full-scale global operations
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
ICO Global Communications and Globalstar opened representative
offices in Beijing earlier this week. Globalstar and Iridium have
already obtained preliminary operating licenses from the Ministry
of Information Industry (MII).
</P>
<P>
Globalstar has completed the construction of a gateway station
in Beijing, and plans to open two additional stations in other
areas of the country prior to the third quarter next year. The
company attracted a 37.5 million US dollar investment from China
Telecom (Hong Kong) in April, thus establishing a close
partnership with the nation's largest telecommunications service
provider.
</P>
<P>
ICO is one step behind its rivals in obtaining initial access
to China market, but has nonetheless established long-term
relationship with the Chinese government. The Ministry of
Communications is the company's major shareholder.
</P>
<P>
Ji Pengyuan, vice-president of ICO Global Communications China,
said the company's telephone system uses far fewer satellites than
the other two companies. He also noted that its satellite are
designed with a much longer operational life. ICO's launch,
operations and maintenance costs will be much lower than those
for Iridium and Globalstar systems.
</P>
<P>
ICO satellite telephone calls here will cost one US dollar per
minute, compared to the current price of three dollars per minute
for calls in nearby areas.
</P>
<P>
Globalstar Public Relations Manager John Cunningham said the
company will have highly competitive prices in the Chinese
market. He estimated that the company will charge lower than other
companies.
</P>
<P>
MII has authorized the China Broadcasting Satellite Company to
deal with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Ministry sources said that China will follow the principle of
safeguarding national sovereignty and security, and will continue
to seek foreign cooperation to expand satellite telephone
services. MII is currently considering a plan to let China Telecom
administer land-based operations for the satellite telephone
network. The ministry's science and technology, planning,
policy and regulatory departments are working on relevant legal
and regulatory issues.
</P>
<P>
Consulations with the three companies continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China has granted approval for
70 key enterprise groups to set up financial subsidiaries over the
past 10 years, with related ventures controlling also a quarter of
total state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries, the internal financial arms of various key
enterprises, are designed to coordinate the state strategy of
building large companies and enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries have operated under the guidance of the
People's Bank of China and have played a significant role in using
internal settlement systems to rationally manage the capital of
their respective parent companies.
</P>
<P>
Some 60-odd financial subsidiaries have established internal
settlement departments which handle daily settlements of over 5.45
billion yuan. The subsidiaries have leveraged their fund-raising
functions and have provided positive support for product
management and capital operations.
</P>
<P>
The subsidiaries have not only engaged in traditional business
activities, but have also extended to develop new financial
services to meet the needs of enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 44 of China's 120 pilot reform
enterprises, or 37 percent of the total, have established
financial subsidiaries which are not only playing an increasingly
important role for enterprise groups, but also the nation's
financial system as a whole.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Meets EC President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress (NPC),
met here this morning with visiting European Commission (EC)
President Jacques Santer.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to the guest, Li said that China's
relationship with Europe has progressed steadily over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
China supports the global multi-polarization process and hopes
that Europe plays a more important role in international politics
and economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his last meeting with Li two years ago during the
Asia-Europe conference in Bangkok, Santer said that bilateral
relations between Europe and China have since witnessed major
development. The EU has adjusted its policy toward China and is
now devoting itself to the establishment of a comprehensive
cooperative partnership with China, he added.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the visitor on the function of both the People's
Congress system and the NPC, as well as the country's democratic
and legal construction efforts, Li said that it is China's basic
policy to administer the country according to law, and that the
NPC will contribute to accelerating the construction of democracy
and the legal system.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to relations with the European
Union, Li said, adding that the NPC hopes to increase ties and
mutual understanding with the parliaments of EU members and the
European Parliament. China also hopes that more parliamentarians
from the European Parliament and EU member states will visit China
to promote the overall development of Sino-EU relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on the launching of Euro and
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Santer expressed his appreciation to China for its responsible
actions in the face of the financial crisis, adding that the EU
will adopt a more positive and open attitude to increased imports
from China.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Non-native Residents (1) </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- "Beijing really offers many
opportunities for people to make a better living," said a
businessman from north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
who runs an audio-visual products store in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Though small in size, his shop has proved to be profitable
since it opened two years ago. He now plans to open more stores in
the next several years.
</P>
<P>
Like this businessman, many people from other provinces come to
Beijing seeking a better living, since they believe that Beijing
is a city full of opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Many of these non-Beijing natives are busy on construction
sites and at outdoor markets, in the hairdresser's, tailor shops
and small restaurants around town.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show there are now more than 1.8 million non-Beijing
natives working and living in Beijing, over 90 percent of whom are
workers serving in the service sector or business people.
</P>
<P>
"Don't look down upon non-Beijing natives," said a local taxi
driver. "It is people of great ability who dare to leave home and
make a better living in other places."
</P>
<P>
Local government sources also praised non-Beijing natives for
their contributions to Beijing's construction and economic
development, especially in the building and textile industries,
sanitation, retail sales and household services.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 7,000 farm workers now working in
Beijing's textile sector which has laid off over 15,000 people.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Municipal Labor Bureau, the city had
60,500 registered laid-off workers by the end of September. Local
labor departments say they can arrange jobs for laid-off workers
within 48 hours if they are not too picky.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Announces New Land Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 30 (Xinhua) --The Zimbabwean government
has decided to speed up the resettlement program by settling
people on identified land first and paying compensation to
the farm owners later, said President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the families resettled in Makoni
District of central Zimbabwe Thursday, President Mugabe said the
the way to let people settled after the farms value has been
ascertained and the farm owners paid has stalled the country's
resettlement program, hence the government has decided to adopt
the new policy of settling people first and paying later.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government has announced that in the country's
resettlement program which has been carrying out in the past two
years, the government would not pay compensation to the farm
owners, the Daily Herald Friday reported.
</P>
<P>
"Resettlement should not be delayed by evaluations. We
evaluate the land and let the government take it immediately. We
should no longer hesitate. We must proceed with speed," Mugabe
said while urging land acquisition committees to act fast in
resettling people.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have decided that the process of negotiating
prices can take place after people have been resettled."
</P>
<P>
The president also urged the resettled families to conserve
the land and natural resources such as trees to avoid making a
mockery of the whole resettlement program.

Actually, many local laid-off workers are reluctant to serve as
sanitary workers, builders, babysitters, or to repair shoes and
sell vegetables at the local markets, regarding these jobs as
disgraceful.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's leading group for reemployment recently urged local
governmental organs and enterprises to dismiss non-Beijing natives
in order to offer their jobs to local laid-offs. Some enterprises
said that this is difficult, since some of the jobs done by
non-Beijing natives are still not acceptable to local workers.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's population consists of several segments including old
Beijingers who have lived here for at least three generations,
university graduates and ex-servicemen assigned to work in the
city, and people transfered from other places.
</P>
<P>
Generally, non-Beijing natives include people without
a permanent Beijing residence and people who have immigrated to
the city.
</P>
<P>
One former laborer, in Beijing now for a dozen years, runs a
company in the city. His daughter was born and is growing up in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said, "My daughter will attend college entrance examinations
next year, but she has to take the exam in my hometown."
</P>
<P>
He also said that he particularly is worried about his identity
card, "If I lose it, it will be very hard to get a new one."
</P>
<P>
To make things easy for non-Beijing natives, Beijing has
adopted measures to perfect management, education, services and
protection for these people so that they can better serve the
local reform and opening up drive and economic construction.

<P>
NANJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
plans to cut the number of rural officials in order to enhance
efficiency and reduce burdens on farmers.
</P>
<P>
New guidelines for simplifying village administration will
limit the number of officials to a maximum of fiver in villages
with populations of less than 1,000 people. One official can be
added for each additional 500 people.
</P>
<P>
The fact that villages quite often have as many as a dozen
officials, and in some cases as many as 20-30 people handling
village affairs, has created a heavy financial burden to farmers.
</P>
<P>
The streamlining program will be carried out in an open and
fair manner in line with relevant legal procedures. The number of
official posts will be publicized and incumbent village leaders
can run for reelection. Winners must win the majority approval of
villagers.
</P>
<P>
Plans calling for completing the streamlining effort in June
next year, the sources added.

</P>
<P>

profession, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, these "superintendents of the
Supreme Court," with authorization from the Supreme Court, will be
held responsible for supervising and offering guidance in major

dissent.
</P>
<P>
They will also be empowered to investigate major issues
concerning judicial corruption and cases involving parties

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Announces New Land Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 30 (Xinhua) --The Zimbabwean government
has decided to speed up the resettlement program by settling
people on identified land first and paying compensation to
the farm owners later, said President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the families resettled in Makoni
District of central Zimbabwe Thursday, President Mugabe said the
the way to let people settled after the farms value has been
ascertained and the farm owners paid has stalled the country's
resettlement program, hence the government has decided to adopt
the new policy of settling people first and paying later.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said the government has announced that in the country's
resettlement program which has been carrying out in the past two
years, the government would not pay compensation to the farm
owners, the Daily Herald Friday reported.
</P>
<P>
"Resettlement should not be delayed by evaluations. We
evaluate the land and let the government take it immediately. We
should no longer hesitate. We must proceed with speed," Mugabe
said while urging land acquisition committees to act fast in
resettling people.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have decided that the process of negotiating
prices can take place after people have been resettled."
</P>
<P>
The president also urged the resettled families to conserve
the land and natural resources such as trees to avoid making a
mockery of the whole resettlement program.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Brunei has decided to
focus more on ASEAN countries and has already embarked on a study
in search of new investments in Malaysia, Brunei Minister of
Industry and Primary Resources Abdul Rahman Mohamed Taib said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia is a country which definitely attracts our interest,"
he told Malaysian journalists in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei's

</P>
<P>
The minister said the relevant authorities in Brunei, including
the Brunei Investment Agency were keenly looking into possible

He said the private sector would be encouraged to seek
investment opportunities in Malaysia and other ASEAN countries.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Chinese Market Still Remains Attractive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Business people from overseas
still flowed in to attend the 84th Guangzhou Commodity Fair in the
capital of south China's Guangdong Province in the past two days
before it closed here today.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday, the fair had drawn nearly 67,700 business people
from around the world, exceeding the total number at last year's
fair, and trade volume had reached 10.16 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the fair said that there was another peak of
contract signing today, adding that the total trade volume may
even break the record of 11 billion U.S. dollars set at the 76th
fair in the autumn of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have commented that all indications are that
China still remains one of the most attractive markets in the
world, despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Commodity Fair is regarded as the window
and barometer of China's foreign trade. Since the 80th fair,
the number of participants from overseas has risen constantly, and
trade volume has remained at around 10 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Many insiders, who had predicted a sharp decrease in the number
of foreign participants at this fair, were surprised to see
instead a dramatic increase.
</P>
<P>
The number of business people from such countries as Japan,
Korea, Thailand and Indonesia have grown by a range of 10 to 70
percent over the last fair. Though many may have come just to look
around,"We will not miss any business opportunities," said one
Thailand businessman.
</P>
<P>
Business people from 163 countries and regions have attended
the fair, which has witnessed a marked decrease in people from
Latin America and Russia, but a significant increase in those from
Africa and the Middle East, while those from the United States and
Europe continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian businessman noted that good credit and quality
products with competitive prices bring him here every time.
</P>
<P>
One U.S. businessman has closed a deal with the Haier Group, a
leading Chinese manufacturer of home electrical appliances, worth
30 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He attributed his transfer of orders from Southeast Asia to
China to the latter's stable political and economic environment
and the improved product quality.
</P>
<P>
Participants from many domestic enterprises said that with the
increased number of new clients, there is also a increase in
smaller orders.
</P>
<P>
But they believe that once they know each other better, they may
continue to sign contracts even after the fair ends.

<HEADLINE> Recession Hits Auto Industry In India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Major car companies including
General Motors (GM), Daewoo Motors and Mahindra Ford suffered a
negative three percent growth in India in the first half of the
current fiscal year (April to September).
</P>
<P>
According to the latest figures released by the Association of
Indian Automobile Manufacturers (AIAM) on Thursday, only Maruti
Udyog, India's largest car maker, managed to obtain a mere two
percent growth during the period.
</P>
<P>
While heavy commercial vehicles segment posted a negative
growth of over 34 percent, sales of light commercial vehicles
dropped by over 20 percent, AIAM figures showed.
</P>
<P>
Severely hit by the economic slowdown was GM, maker of Opel
Astra, as the company's sales fell to 1,966 cars from April to
September as against 5,469 in the same period last year, or a fall
of 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Things were no better for Mahindra Ford as this joint venture
had only sold 1,977 cars compared to 4,331 sold in the same period
last year, a fall of 54.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo of the South Korea too had a tough drive with its sales
of Cielo going down by 24.6 percent at 4,114 units compared to
5,511 units last year.
</P>
<P>
Other passenger car makers, PAL-Peugeot, Mercedes Benz and
Premier Auto Mobiles, also suffered a major drop in their sales
during the period, according to AIAM.
</P>
<P>
However, the new entrant Honda Siel Cars LTD sold 5,090 City
model in the first half and captured over 20 percent in the luxury
car segment in the country.
</P>
<P>
Thanks mainly to the performance of two-wheel motorcycles, the
sale of which jumped over 24 percent, the automobile industry
recorded a growth of over seven percent in the first six months of
the fiscal year 1998-99.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Penalized For Body-search </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A female university student in
Shanghai, China's largest commercial city, is expected to get
250,000 yuan in compensation for the humiliation she suffered at a
local supermarket.
</P>
<P>
The People's Court in the Hongkou District ruled on Wednesday
after the first instance that the supermarket, a subsidiary of
Watson's Co. Ltd., must grant the 19-year-old university student,
identified only as Qiang, the sum of money as compensation for
searching her body when they suspected her of shoplifting, and
offer her a public apology in local newspapers within 10 days.
</P>
<P>
On July 7, Qian left the supermarket on Sichuan Beilu when the
alarm at the exit went off. Despite her protest, the security
guards took Qian into an office and forced her to take off her
pants to search her.
</P>
<P>
When nothing was found on her, Qiang asked the supermarket
to apologize and make reparations. But the supermarket rejected
her demand.
</P>
<P>
Body-searching often occurs, but few of those searched have
ever brought the case to court, said Qian, who said she hopes her
case will enhance people's awareness of their right to protect
themselves through legal channels.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese law, the defendant can appeal in 15 days
after the ruling. But so far the Watson's has remained
silent.

<HEADLINE> Index of China's Real Estate Climate Down Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The January-September Index
showing the overall climate for China's real estate market dropped
by 0.49 points compared with the January-August period, the State
Statistics Bureau and China Business Climate Monitoring Center
said today.
</P>
<P>
This index figure, which evaluates the industry's prosperity
level, reached 103.45 points in the first three quarters of this
year, down 0.49 points from the January-August period, but up 4.11
points over the same period last year, maintaining a boom climate
since the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The slight drop was attributed to the slow growth of land
development and housing sales.
</P>
<P>
Though this may be the case, the bureau predicted that the
index will maintain its current level if there is good fixed
assets investment and overall economic environment in the fourth
quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the real estate industry completed
investment of 187.2 billion yuan, up 18.9 percent on an annual
basis. The bureau also predicted that total investment for the
whole year will be 370 billion yuan, up 18 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of newly started projects rose by a big
margin, indicating a future boom for the industry, the bureau
said.

GUANGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish-based H&AMP;M
Department Store Co. has established business ties with over 100
Chinese enterprises during the ongoing 84th China Export Commodity
Fair.
</P>
<P>
H&AMP;M, the third largest listed company of Sweden, will purchase
40 percent of its total Asian products in China during 1998,
according company representative Jacka Chan.
</P>
<P>
"We've ordered both clothing and daily-use products during this
year's fair," according to chan.
</P>
<P>
The company operates over 500 chain stores in 12 European
countries.
</P>
<P>
The biannual export fair opened on October 15 and has attracted
a large number of international buyers in spite of the financial
crisis sweeping Asia. Over 40 chain store groups, including
US-based Walmart and Kmart, are participating in the fair.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said the increasing presence of chain store
purchasing agents has greatly benefited the fair which
formerly attracted mainly middlemen such as traders and agents.
</P>
<P>
"Selling directly to international chain store groups increases
exports and improves economic efficiency," according to a Tianjin
sales representative, adding that "related sales not only reduce
costs, but also greatly increase our export earnings."
</P>
<P>
Five Tianjin companies and six chain store purchasing agents
have inked sales contracts valued at 25 million US dollars.

Pol Gen Pornsak Durongkavibul, deputy police
commissioner-general, was quoted Friday by the Bangkok Post as
saying that the police would patrol all stadiums designated for
competition and practice, entertainment places, shopping centers,
and tourist attractions in Greater Bangkok.

According to the officer, Bangkok is expected to welcome 8,860
athletes, 2,726 staff, and 7,000 reporters during the Games. VIP

others in nearby provinces.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-three stadiums have been designated for competition and
97 others for practice. Police will guard every stadium.

Pol Lt-Gen Somchai Vanichseni, assistant police
commissioner-general, said that he had told all police stations
in the city to inspect streets in their areas to clear
unnecessary road blockages.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Plans to Set Up Housing Mortgage Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
planned to set up a housing mortgage bank for homeless and other
poor people in the rural and urban areas to improve their living
conditions.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken by the government in view of the
increasing number of homeless people and urbanization at an
alarming proportion in the country, The Bangladesh Observer
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed housing mortgage bank will finance the low and
middle class people in setting up houses under the government's
project known as "two million housing program in Bangladesh by
2005", the paper quoted a competent source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The program will cost over 55.2 billion taka (1.14 billion U.S.
dollars), and it has been included in the current fifth five-year
plan (1998-2002).
</P>
<P>
The government is actively considering to provide loans from
the proposed housing mortgage bank at a minimum rate of interest,
he said, adding the interest rate will be five to seven percent
with a 15-year recovery period, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Groups of people who can get loans from the proposed bank have
been fixed as follows: low income group whose income ranges
between 50 taka (1.03 dollars) and 100 taka (2.06 dollars) per day
while that of the middle income group is 150 taka (3.1 dollars)
per day and not below 100 taka (2.06 dollars).
</P>
<P>
These families must be able to repay the monthly installment
according to the prices of the house and plot with five to seven
percent interest rate for a period of 15 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
A housing census survey will be made with the help of
non-government organizations. Besides, the beneficiaries of the
target group will be given house building credit, and this will
generate self-help in house building activities, he added.

Fiat dropped 4.6 percent to 19.4 trillion lire (11.8 billion

2.37 trillion lire (1.44 billion dollars) from 3.17 trillion lire

</P>
<P>
One factor for the fall was the end of the Italian government's
incentives for the demolition of old cars, the company's analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The other factors are a 26-percent fall of demand in Brazil and
aggressive pricing policies implemented by Asian manufacturers in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
But Fiat confirmed its plan to invest 20 trillion lire (12.2
million dollars) between 1998 and 2002 for the launching of 19 new
models and expansion in the emerging markets in Argentina, Brazil
and other countries.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker Killed in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish special team succeeded
in ending an operation against a hijacker early Friday morning in
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Transport Minister Arif Ahmet Denizolgun said that the
Turkish special team succeeded in launching the operation against
the hijacker "without any accident" and rescued all the passengers
and crew on the hijacked plane.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, with a pistol and a bomb, hijacked the Boeing 737
passenger plane of the Turkish Airlines on the Adana-Ankara flight
soon after the plane took off from the Adana Airport, southern
Turkey, Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
There were 34 passengers, most of them doctors, and six crew
members on board.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker first ordered the pilot of the plane to fly to
Lausanne, Switzerland, and later ordered the plane be diverted to
Bulgarian capital of Sofia, but the pilot fooled the hijacker into
believing that the plane was landing at Sofia. However, the plane
actually landed at Ankara Esenboga Airport.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking occurred as people were celebrating the 75th
anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth hijacking this year. On September 14, a
gunman abducted an Airbus A-310 passenger plane on a
Ankara-Istanbul flight, and surrendered after the plane touched
down at Trabzon Airport near the Black Sea of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On February 24, a man hijacked a RJ-100 type passenger plane in
Adana, southern Turkey, and later landed it at Diyarbakir Airport
in southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Zone Set up to Draw Returning Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, the capital of
Guangdong Province is trying to attract and draw back Chinese
students who have studied abroad and are armed with scientific
expertise and technological knowledge, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
"Guangzhou will be the ideal place to put their talents to the
best use," declared Mayor Lin Shusen yesterday as he announced the

Students.
</P>
<P>
"Besides the abundant human resource they represent, these
students could play a significant role in upgrading the city's
industrial structure," he said.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Guangzhou Economic Development Zone, the
pioneering zone will attempt to provide an encouraging environment
for the well-educated returnees to conduct scientific research,
project development and investment.
</P>
<P>
"A series of favorable policies will be hammered out next week
to facilitate the students' move back and initiate a new phase
for Guangzhou," Lin said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the favorable policies will include reduces
taxes, lower charges for purchasing residential houses,
convenience in getting start-up capital and other governmental
support.
</P>
<P>
In a move to show respect for intellectual property rights, the
city will even let the center take up more than a 35 percent share
in a project, the top percentage for a co-operative project.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, we're trying our best to encourage the students to
come back and help develop the city's high-tech industry," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The returning wave of Chinese students studying abroad started
in the early 1990's in Guangzhou, when the city's booming economy
realized the importance of having scientific and technological
knowledge applied in its development.

<P>
COLOMBO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka plans to develop its
railway network under a series of massive development projects
estimated to cost about 1.2 million U.S. dollars, according to
Transport Ministry sources Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the projects include the double tracking of
all railway lines, rehabilitation of bridges, improvement of the
signal system and electrification of railways.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that Sri Lanka's railway transport is
undeveloped. The transfer capacity of the railway lines is very
low.
</P>
<P>
These improvements will undoubtedly increase the line capacity
and reduce delays and waiting time, said the sources, adding that
the possible transfer of commuters from road transport to rail, a
marked deduction in the consumption of fuel and enhanced
reliability are among the other benefits.

<HEADLINE> A Bank Robbery Trial Catches Chinese Legal Experts' Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A simple case of bank robbery
caught the attention of some 350 Chinese legal experts this week
as it was tried in the Beijing Higher People's Court, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Not only was the case tried twice, but it was tried by a German
panel and under the system used in the United States, which made
court rules as different as black from white, the paper explains.
</P>
<P>
Together with another three-day trial and discussion on a civil
case over a contract dispute, the trial was part of a week-long
demonstration of trial procedures under the continental law
system and the Anglo-Saxon law system for Chinese legal experts.
</P>
<P>
The activity, sponsored by the Ford Foundation and organized by
the State Judges College in Beijing, the American Bar Association
and the Berlin Judges Association, is part of a comparative
research on trial procedures geared towards China's ongoing reform
in the field.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to give Chinese judges, lawyers, procurators and
educators an opportunity to see how it (this case) is tried (in
the West) so that they can observe the two systems," said Wendy
Locks, co-ordinator of the activity.
</P>
<P>
However, China's legal system, when it was formed, was very
much influenced by that of the then-Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
After the new Criminal Procedure Law took effect, it veered
more towards the Anglo-Saxon legal system, according to the
paper.

<P>
Meanwhile, India has agreed with Myanmar in principle to open
two more border trade points, while undertaking to upgrade the
infrastructure facilities of Tamu-Kalemyo highway.

SHANGHAI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China's international tourism
industry anticipates only a slight rise this year due to the
impact of the Asian financial crisis and the lingering effects of
heavy summer flooding.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Wendong, deputy director of the National Tourism
Administration, said the economic slowdown in Asia has led to a 20
percent drop in tourists from many Asian nations, while arrivals

Some 41.33 million tourists from other countries and regions
visited China between January and August, a year-on-year rise of
12.22 percent. Tourism earning for the period grew by 5.55 percent
to 8.198 billion US dollars. "This year's growth was substantially
lower than in 1997," according to Chen, who is in Shanghai to
attend the 98 China International Travel Mart which opened on

<HEADLINE> Efforts Urged to Increase Chinese Farmers' Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agronomists and
agricultural officials attending a recent symposium held in
Beijing called for efforts to add to the coffers of farmers in the
country.
</P>
<P>
There are seemingly "surplus" production of some durable goods,
but these goods have not yet found their foothold in the vast
rural market, today's "China Daily" quoted Wan Baorui,
vice-minister of agriculture as saying.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' income did not rise much and consequently, they have a
modest purchasing power. According to the deputy minister, Chinese
farmers' consumption level and purchasing power is 10 to 15 years
behind that of the urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
In the past nine months, the per-capita income of farmers
increased by only one percent over the same period last year.
Between 1992 and 1997, sources attendintg the symposium said.
</P>
<P>
Average annual urban income was 2.7 times that of farmers,
according to the ministry statistics.
</P>
<P>
To narrow the income gap, China has a pressing need to achieve
a "harmonious development" in urban and township regions, said the
vice-minister.
</P>
<P>
Duan Yingbi, deputy director of the Financial and Economic
Leading Group Office of the Chinese Communist Party Central
Committee, said the country should develop high-yield and efficient
agriculture, increase investment for agriculture, and accelerate
the development of township enterprises and the transfer of farm
workers to other industries.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 officials and rural development experts and
professors specialized in agriculture attended the symposium to
mark the 20th anniversary of China's rural reform.

<HEADLINE> Estonia Optimistic About EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Estonian Foreign Minister Raul
Myalk said here Thursday that Estonia will start negotiations with
the European Union (EU) on its EU membership next month and he is
optimistic about an early result.
</P>
<P>
Myalk, who arrived here Wednesday morning for a brief visit,
told a press conference that Estonia is to begin negotiations on
November 10 and will try its best on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The most important factor affecting the Estonian-EU
negotiations is whether there is a strong political will among the
EU countries to facilitate Estonia's membership in line with the
scheduled timetable, he said.
</P>
<P>
The political and economic crisis in Russia has a certain
impact on the economy of Estonia, Myalk said, adding that Estonian
enterprises will have to seek markets outside Russia.
</P>
<P>
The coming Estonian general elections scheduled for next March
is expected to affect the government's work and the country's
preparations for joining the EU, he said.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Wednesday for the first trip abroad since he
took office two weeks ago, Myalk told reporters that Estonia will
complete its preparations for the EU membership between 2002 and
2003.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Myalk, Finnish Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen said Finland will assist Estonia and other European
countries in joining the EU when Finland takes over from Austria
the EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Besides the membership issue, the leaders also discussed
bilateral relations, the European integration and the
strengthening of cooperation among the Baltic countries.

"He is going to fight in January," Shelly Finkel said
Thursday. "We're looking at Las Vegas."
</P>
<P>
It was at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that Tyson bit Evander
Holyfield's ears last June, 1997. Now, the former heavyweight
champion is likely to fight his next boxer at the same place
where he lost his license and 3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tyson still faces a December 1 trial on misdemeanor assault
charges stemming from a traffic accident on August 31.
</P>
<P>
The date and a specific site is not settled. As for an
opponent, Finkel said: "We're looking at the Axel Schulzes, the
Francois Bothas, the Vaughn Beans, somebody like that."
</P>
<P>
Schulz, Botha and Bean are strong fighters, but are not
knockout punchers. They have good record and have title-fight
experience. Tyson beat McNeeley in 89 seconds during his comeback
fight in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Bitha of South Africa was stopped in the 12th round by Moorer
in an IBF title fight in 1996, and Bean lost a tough fight

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Meet 35 Percent of EU Membership Requirements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria will meet 35 percent of
EU membership requirements by the end of 1998, Bulgarian
parliamentary Foreign and Integration Policy Committee Chairman
Assen Agov said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In order to become a member of the European Union (EU),
Bulgaria must pass a total of more than 2,100 acts, of which 889
refer to the single market, while 1,214 refer to other legislative
spheres, Agov said.
</P>
<P>
So far Bulgaria has fulfilled 20 percent of the requirements
for coordinating its legislation with EU laws, according to Agov.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, he said, they are expected to reach 35
percent, which will demonstrate considerable progress for Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Agov said the government's report on the six-month
implementation of the measures for Bulgaria's accession to the EU
will be discussed in all parliamentary committees.
</P>
<P>
The final debate will be in the Foreign and Integration Policy
Committee, he said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament is expected to adopt a document on the
government report before the EU summit in Vienna on December
12-13. By then the parliament will also adopt positions on two
more documents: the European Commission's report on Bulgaria,
which is expected to be published next week, and the resolution of
the European Parliament on Bulgaria's application for EU
membership.

<P>
QINGDAO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The total import-export volume
for Qingdao, a major port city in east China's Shandong Province,
surged 11.5 percent to 4.23 billion US dollars in the first three
quarters of the year in spite of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The city's export volume stood at 2.85 billion US dollars, up
12.7 percent on the 1997 period.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao has suffered a heavy blow from the financial crisis in
Asia, a region which previously accounted for 60 percent of its
total export volume.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao has attempted to offset declining imports from
Southeast Asia by readjusting its product mix and raising the rate
for manufactured products. Of the export volume for industrial
products, machinery and electronic products accounted for 40
percent, with the level for primary products 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The city has also dispatched delegations to explore new markets
in Europe, Africa, the United States and South America.
</P>
<P>
As a result, exports to Europe and the United States jumped 40
percent, with the volume destined for Africa growing by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Qingdao approved 426 foreign-funded projects during the period,
up 1.2. percent, and total contracted foreign investments grew by
45.9 percent to 740 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Hanoi Int'l Meeting on 20/20 Initiative Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Hanoi International Meeting
on the 20/20 Initiative closed Thursday, calling for donor
countries and multilateral organizations to spend at least 20
percent of their Official Development Assistance (ODA) on basic
social services and to improve their quality.
</P>
<P>
A media release issued after the meeting said that participants
in the meeting agreed that the current economic and financial
crises make the 20/20 initiative even more relevant in order to
protect the access to basic social services of the most vulnerable
people.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which opened here Tuesday, reaffirmed a mutual
commitment by developing countries and their development partners
to give higher priority to basic social services. Governments must
not only devote financial resources, but must also demonstrate a
strong political commitment to ensuring the quality, equity and
efficiency with which services are provided.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the progress made since the Oslo meeting in 1996,
the Hanoi meeting recognized that the 20/20 initiative has
encouraged donor and developing countries to focus more on basic
social services. However, the media release said, it is clear that
many countries are unlikely to reach the agreed goals for social
development by the end of the first decade of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The meeting emphasized that developing countries were also
urged to continue their efforts to monitor and analyze the level,
equity, effectiveness and efficiency of budgetary spending on
basic social services and ensure that budget allocations are
translated into actual expenditures.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is a follow-up to the first conference held
on the 20/20 initiative in Oslo, was hosted by the Vietnamese
government and sponsored by the governments of the Netherlands and
Norway with the support of UNICEF (United Nations Children's
Fund), UNDP (United Nations Development Program), UNFPA (United
Nations Population Fund) and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
More than 170 representatives from 72 countries and
international organizations took part in the meeting.

SANTIAGO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investment in
Chile between January and September of this year amounted to 4.56

1997.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released Thursday by the Chilean Minister of
Economy Jorge Leiva.
</P>
<P>
He said the increase shows that "foreign investors who are not
affected by short term international turbulence maintain their
interest in doing business for the medium and long term."
</P>
<P>
Leiva said that most of the capital comes from Canada (28.3
percent), the United States (19.8 percent), Spain (13.3 percent),

On Wednesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso announced a
package of spending cuts and higher taxes, aiming to heal the
economy.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement, President Cardoso's economic team
went to the congress to try to win support for the plan, which
would save nearly 24 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 and slash the
huge budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
But resistance to the measures was widely expected.
</P>
<P>
The austerity plan was aimed to help Brazil win a 30 billion
dollar rescue package from the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
The president also must win support from states' governors who
have big influence over their lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Some governors are reportedly unhappy with the budget
adjustment plan which calls for sharp cutbacks in the amount of
federal money given to the states.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to auction off some 600 million pesos (15 million U.S.
dollars) worth of jewelry previously owned by former first lady
Imelda Marcos.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Friday that the jewelry,
which consists mostly of rubies and diamonds, has been kept in the
vaults of the Central Bank of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper Friday, Finance Under-secretary
Joel Banares said that the jewelry was part of some 1.4 billion
pesos (35 million dollars) worth of sequestered assets approved
for disposition by the Committee on Privatization during its
latest meeting.
</P>
<P>
Banares said the Marcoses left the jewelry in the presidential
palace when they fled to Hawaii, the United States, in 1986 at the

<HEADLINE> Homesick Laudrup to Leave Chelsea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 29-year-old said Thursday that he is homesick after
playing abroad for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
But he dismissed reports that he wanted to leave because he
objected to manager Gianluca Vialli's policy of rotating his
squad.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea called a news conference on Thursday to discuss
Laudrup's future, following widespread speculation he was on his
way to FC Copenhagen.
</P>
<P>
But while the west London club insisted they had turned down
an offer from Copenhagen to take Laudrup on loan until the end of
the season, they did admit that it was only a matter of time
before he left.
</P>
<P>
Laudrup revealed he was so keen to return to Denmark that he
would accept a significant pay cut to do so.
</P>
<P>
"What use is money if you are not happy as a private person?"
he said. "Every time I have been home, I have wanted to stay a
little longer.
</P>
<P>
"That is where my friends and family are. My wife is 500%
behind me. Some fans will be disappointed, but the most
disappointed person is myself."
</P>
<P>
And he added: "It is nothing to do with the rotational system
at Chelsea."
</P>
<P>
Chelsea managing director Colin Hutchinson insisted the club
were keen to hang onto their highly-rated attacking midfielder
and had rebuffed Copenhagen's approach.
</P>
<P>
He said: "No deal whatsoever has been done between Chelsea and
Copenhagen for Brian Laudrup.
</P>
<P>
"We turned down an approach from Copenhagen to take him on loa
n a couple of weeks ago but that is not to say that something of
that nature may not happen in the future."
</P>
<P>
Hutchinson said he had been involved in negotiations with
Laudrup for the past seven weeks, even offering the player the
chance to train for part of the week in Denmark in a bid to keep
him.
</P>
<P>
He said no deal would be completed until after Chelsea's
return European Cup Winners' Cup second round fixture against
Copenhagen next Thursday, but after that it would just seem to be
a matter of time before Laudrup leaves.
</P>
<P>
"We have done everything we can to keep him, we have worked
non-stop to make Brian and his family as happy as possible in
London but he is a very strong-minded guy and wants to return to
Denmark," said Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
Laudrup, who quit international football after the World Cup,
joined Chelsea from Rangers in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Fiji PM Visits New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Fiji Prime Minister Sitiveni
 Rabuka concluded his 4-day official visit to New Zealand and left
 Auckland for home Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was his first official visit to the country in five years.
</P>
<P>
Major General Rabuka, whose country will go to general
elections in April next year for the first time under a new
constitution, came to seek political support and more preferential
access to New Zealand for Fiji's  clothing exports.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's objectives for the visit included: enabling Prime
 Minister Jenny Shipley to meet with her Fijian counterpart for
the first time, reaffirming NZ's relationship with Fiji as an
important partner in South Pacific, and gaining an insight into
current developments in Fiji in the run-up to the general
elections.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's relationship with Fiji with a population of more
than 772,000 is among the most important in South Pacific. This is
a result of historical links, significant trade interests and
Fiji's strategic position in the region. Links exist with Fiji at
many levels through family, business, tourism, sports and defense
contacts.
</P>
<P>
Difficulties associated with the events surrounding a 1987
coup have largely been resolved with Fiji's adoption of the new
Constitution in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the year to June 1998, New
Zealand exported 190 million NZ dollar (100 million U.S. dollar)
worth of goods to Fiji, mainly sheep meat, petroleum products,
iron and steel and dairy products. Meanwhile imports from Fiji,
mainly apparel and footwear, stood at 53.5 million NZ dollars (27
million U.S. dollars). The large gap in the balance of trade
between the two countries has been of concern to Fiji.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the country, Rabuka, who staged the
successful coup in Fiji in 1987, did a lot of explanatory work for
the coup, which was condemned by the then New Zealand government.
He got pledged support from his New Zealand counterpart.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Shipley met with him, saying that she will be
"watching with keen interest to see how you get on" in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
"We also congratulate you as the Fiji Islands embark on a new
era with a new constitution and a new name for your country and
its people," she said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand prime minister stressed that the relationship
with Fiji is one her country "values highly" and Rabuka's visit
"will deepen further the friendship" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Rabuka raised Fiji's desire to improve the access of its
exports to New Zealand. Shipley replied that her country "might
consider further measures for promoting open and free trade"
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Fiji prime minister also called on New Zealand
Governor-General Sir Michael Hardie Boys.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in New Zealand, Rabuka paid a visit to Linton
army camp near Palmerston North, talking with members of the Fiji
army personnel studying at the School of Military Engineering. The
New Zealand Army, and in particular Linton camp, has for many
years had a role in training Fiji's troops.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Rabuka also met with the Fijian community in
Wellington and addressed New Zealand-Fiji Business Council in
Auckland before leaving for home.

<P>
ANKARA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish Airlines plane
hijacked with 39 people on board landed safely at Ankara airport,
its scheduled destination, on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
But the 33 passengers and six crew members were not immediately
released.
</P>
<P>
The plane landed around 10 p.m. (2000 GMT), two hours after
taking off from the southern city of Adana on a domestic run to
the capital. The hijacking took place at 7:53 p.m. (1753 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The hijacker, with a hand grenade in his hand, first demanded
the plane be diverted to Lausanne, Switzerland, but then changed
his mind and ordered the plane to fly to Bulgarian capital of
Sofia.
</P>
<P>
The motive of the hijacking is not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737 circled over Ankara for a while before landing,
as the pilot tried to convince the hijacker that the plane had
arrived in Sofia.
</P>
<P>
Authorities at Ankara's Esenboga airport switched off the
lights on the airfield and prepared for a possible emergency.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said the authorities had promised
to let the plane refuel and take off again if women and children
aboard could go free.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking occurred as people were celebrating the 75th
anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey.

<HEADLINE> "Mitch" Becomes Tropical Storm, Disaster Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, Oct 29 (Xinhua) -- Hurricane "Mitch," which has
been slashing at Honduras for the fourth consecutive day, became a
tropical storm Thursday, a Contingencies Permanent Commission
(COPECO) source said.
</P>
<P>
Col. Anahel Perez told the press that hurricane "Mitch," which
remained off the Honduran coast at mid-day of Thursday, "has
ceased to be a hurricane and now is a tropical storm," with the
same force it had when it began across the Colombian coast last
week.
</P>
<P>
However, rain continues in the north and Caribbean regions of
Honduras, so its influence will continue.
</P>
<P>
The storm could recover its strength and continue in the next
hours toward the west, so its presence is still a threat for
Central America, said a source of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a yacht with 31 people aboard was missing Thursday
in the storm-roiled Caribbean, where Hurricane Mitch killed 32
people before being downgraded to a tropical storm.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Coast Guard airplane was searching for the boat, while
storm-driven floodwaters continued to rise on shore, cutting some
Central American communities off from food, water and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Incessant rain along the coast has flooded at least 50 rivers
in Honduras, knocking out bridges and highways and putting many
towns under water. More than 150,000 people were forced to seek
higher ground in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize
and Mexico.

NEW YORK, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. stocks closed broadly
higher Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average up 123.06
to 8,495.03.
</P>
<P>
The advance, following a small gain of 5.93 points Wednesday
and a three session losing streak since last week, was attributed
in part to buying by fund managers before the close of the fiscal
year due Friday.
</P>
<P>
The mid-month announcement by the Federal Reserve of cutting
lending rates boosted the market with the Dow up nearly 600 points
in a seven session winning streak before turning lower amid
profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
But analysts doubt the possibility of another round of interest
cut in the Fed's next meeting next month as the government
reported Thursday that employment costs, the inflation-causing
factor, rose more than expected in the third quarter.

In other trading, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 21.66 to

U.N. Secretary-General's decision to set minimum age requirement
for U. N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
"This is a major breakthrough for children's rights," said
UNICEF Executive Director, Carol Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is a boost for international efforts to adopt an
optional protocol which raises to 18 the minimum age for
children's recruitment in armed forces and participation in
hostilities," she said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy believed that this new standard should be complemented
by specialized training on child rights of personnel involved in
peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace building, as recently called
for the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
According to latest U.N. sources, today, an estimated 300,000
child soldiers participate in armed conflicts around the world.
UNICEF has urged that governments and all armed groups immediately
demobilize these children.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for peacekeeping, Bernard Miyet,
announced this morning that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had
decided to set minimum age requirements for United Nations
peacekeepers who are made available to the Organization by Member
States.
</P>
<P>
According to Annan's decision, member states are asked not to
send civilian police and military observers younger than 25 years
to serve in peacekeeping operations.

<HEADLINE> Greek PM Reshuffles Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis Thursday night reshuffled his cabinet by placing new heads
in three ministries and setting up a new ministry.
</P>
<P>
The most notable change is of George Romeos in the Ministry of
Public Order, who is replaced by hitherto Macedonia-Thrace
Minister Philippos Petsalnikos. George Anomeritis and Yiannis
Magriotis are taking over the Agriculture and Macedonia-Thrace
Ministries respectively, while outgoing Health Minister Costas
Geitonas is assuming the new ministry to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Also outgoing are five deputy ministers, including two in the
Agriculture ministry, and one each in Labor and Social security,
Transport, and Health and Welfare.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers and deputy ministers will be sworn in
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Greek Parliament President Apostolos Kaklamanis,
Simitis has asked for a convening of the plenum for a debate and
the provision of a confidence vote to the new government.
</P>
<P>
The debate will start on Sunday and is expected to end with the
confidence vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the second cabinet reshuffle since Simitis came to
power in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the reshuffle was the inevitable
outcome of the recent local government elections during which the
ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) lost a large number
of municipal and prefectural seats to the main opposition New
Democracy party (ND).

<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Light gains on Wall Street
offered some solace to nervous European investors still agitated
by concerns about Brazil and Russia and the U.S. dollar's weakness
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In London, hopes for lower interest rates on both sides of the
Atlantic kept shares on the right track. The FTSE 100 index closed
64 points higher at 5,358, just shy of its lunch-time high.
</P>
<P>
Solid hopes for a U.K. rate cut next week and the prospect of a
firmer Wall Street opening were considered to have helped the FTSE
100 climb.
</P>
<P>
However, strategists noted the lack of volume, which
exaggerated share price movements. Provisional market volume was
674 million shares traded.
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be just sitting here. People don't know which way
the market is going to jump so they are doing nothing," commented
one domestic trader.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street was a positive influence on the Footsie. After an
uncertain start in New York, sentiment remained intact despite
stronger-than-expected wage inflation data for the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Economists said current jitters about deflationary pressures
mean the Fed is unlikely to be swayed from their rate cutting
program.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares enjoyed a late flourish to climb
out of the red, having been hampered by a weaker dollar and
concerns about third quarter corporate results for much of the
session.
</P>
<P>
The later trading electronic Xetra Dax index closed down 6
points at 4,570.
</P>
<P>
"There's no real negative news out there," said Udo Becker, an
institutional dealer at Merck, Finck &AMP; Co. in Munich. "But there
certainly is a sense of foreboding," he added.
</P>
<P>
Traders said trading volume was thin, reflecting wariness on
the part of investors.
</P>
<P>
The dollar's fall against the Dmark offered the likeliest
explanation for the market's earlier retreat, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares finished slightly weaker, upset by the
soft dollar and profit-taking in the banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The leading Cac 40 index had come back from a low to close down
10 points at 3,483.

<HEADLINE> Hijacked Plane Lands at Ankara Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Ankara Esenboga Airport was
closed after a hijacked Boeing 737 type passenger plane landed at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
Ankara Airport officials said that all the passenger planes are
banned to take off from the airport after the hijacked Boeing 737,
with 33 passengers and six crew on board, landed at the airport.
</P>
<P>
They said that all the passenger planes from outside are
ordered to fly to other airports, mostly to the Istanbul Ataturk
Airport, about 420 kilometers west of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Many passengers stuck at Ankara airport because of the
hijacking and many had to get off from passenger planes ready for
taking off, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the hijacker is holding negotiations with the
Turkish officials and a Turkish special police team is ready for
rescuing the 33 passengers and six crew members on board.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737 was on a flight from the southern city of Adana
to Ankara. The hijacking took place at 7:53 p.m. (1753 GMT) soon
after taking off from Adana.
</P>
<P>
The hijacker ordered the plane be diverted to Lausanne,
Switzerland, but the pilot fooled him into believing that the
plane was landing at Bulgarian capital of Sofia. However the plane
actually landed at Ankara's airport.
</P>
<P>
The motive of the hijacking is not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The hijacking occurred as people were celebrating the 75th
anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey.
</P>
<P>
This was the fourth skyjacking last year. On September 14, a
gunman abducted an Airbus A-310 passenger plane on a
Ankara-Istanbul flight, and surrendered after the plane touched
down at Trabzon Airport near Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
On February 24, a man kidnaped a RJ-100 type passenger plane
in Adana and later landed it at Diyarbakir Airport in southeastern
Turkey.

BONN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The German government Thursday
offered the deployment of German military surveillance drones to
help monitor Yugoslavia's troop withdrawal from its troubled
southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
About 350 German soldiers were likely to be sent to Macedonia
to operate the surveillance flights of the unmanned small planes
over Kosovo, said German Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping.
</P>
<P>
The German cabinet would make a formal decision on the
deployment on November 4. An parliament approval was also needed
for such an operation, Scharping added.
</P>
<P>
The German surveillance drones, which fly at an altitude of
between 200 to 1,200 meters, would be a supplement to the
high-altitude U.S. U-2 spy planes under cloudy conditions, experts
said.

according to Serb-run Kosovo Media Center report.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 16 Lebanese Sentenced for Spying for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen Lebanese were sentenced
on Thursday by a Lebanese military court to prison terms up to 15
years for visiting Israel or providing information to Israeli
forces, the official National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court convicted them of contacting with Israel and its
proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA), providing information about
activities of Lebanese army and Syrian army in Lebanon to the
Jewish state, or entering Israel without the government's permit.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, which was open to reporters, some defendants
present in the courtroom denied having any contacting with
Israel. They said they had been tricked into going to the Jewish
state by an SLA officer.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 16 convicted, another 58 Lebanese still on the run
were also sentenced in absentia to jail terms ranging from 10 to
15 years with similar charges.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese law forbids citizens from dealing with Israel, which
occupies parts of south Lebanon as a self-styled security zone to
protect its north.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's resistance, spearheaded by the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is fighting to oust Israeli forces and
their allied SLA militia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Confident in Palestinians on Fighting Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
expressed confidence Thursday that the Palestinian Authority was
actively investigating a suicide bombing attempt against Israelis
in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
"We understand that security officials of both parties --
Israel and the Palestinian Authority -- are working closely
together on the ground in response to this attack. And we welcome
that," State Department spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Foley told a regular news briefing: "We are well aware that
extremists will seek to destroy the hope for peace and security."
</P>
<P>
He added that the bombing was an act of terrorism that the
United States strongly condemned.
</P>
<P>
The bomber drove an explosives-packed car into an Israeli army
jeep that was escorting a school bus. He and an Israeli soldier
were killed.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing, the Palestinian Authority placed under
house arrest Sheik Ahmed Yassin, leader of the Islamic militant
group Hamas, which has sent suicide bombers against Israeli
targets.
</P>
<P>
Palestine and Israel signed a peace agreement last week, under
which Israel will cede another 13 percent of the West Bank to the
Palestinian Authority in exchange for increased counter-terrorism
action by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Despite the bombing, Foley said that he believes Palestinians
will provide an action plan on security on Friday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"My understanding is that we are expecting that the necessary
work will be done tomorrow, Friday, in that regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Resolving the crisis of confidence between Israelis and
Palestinians requires each side to fulfill a set of
responsibilities based on the concept of reciprocity," said Foley.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged Israel to keep its commitment pledged in
the land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians despite the attack.
</P>
<P>
Foley also said he was unable to confirm reports of the sheik's
house arrest. If true, he said, "that would illustrate the
seriousness with which they are dealing with this matter."
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is in the Palestinians' interest to maintain
security in the areas they control, and it's their decision how
best to do so," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
"The key is a terrorist act has occurred," he said. "The
Palestinians have committed at Wye, as well as previously, to root
out those responsible for such terrorist acts, and we would
welcome this move, if that's a step in that direction."
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross, who helped set up the Wye
summit, will return to the region Monday, said Foley.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Emergency Assistance for Dominican Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Thursday approved the Dominican Republic's request for
financial assistance equivalent to some 56 million U.S. dollars in
a bid to support the government's economic adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
The assistance is provided to help the associated relief and
rehabilitation efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Georges
recently, which was estimated to cost economic damage totaling 1.3
billion dollars or 8 percent of GDP for the country.
</P>
<P>
The government's adjustment policies are based on a deepening
of structural reforms and a continuation of prudent macroeconomic
policies over the medium term, while allowing for accommodation of
financial policies in the short term because of the damages
sustained from the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
The adverse impact of the hurricane on GDP growth and inflation
is expected to be short lived and limited. The 1998 growth rate of
output is likely to be about 0.5 percentage point less than the
originally forecast rate of 7.5 percent. The inflation rate is
expected to be about 6 percent in 1998 and 4.5 percent next year,
as against 8.4 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Dominican Republic joined the IMF in December 1945. Its
quota is some 224 million dollars and its outstanding use of IMF
financing currently totals about 2 million dollars.
