<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises Despite Trade Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies  
Tuesday even as the United States hit a record trade deficit in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0624, down  
from $1.0638 late Monday. The dollar was worth 118.78 Japanese yen, 
up from 117.58 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders bought dollars even though the government reported that  
the U.S. trade deficit soared to another record, widening to $19.4 
billion in February, a 15.6 percent increase over January's record 
imbalance of $16.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Normally that kind of news would be negative for the dollar  
because other countries would have a perceived economic advantage 
over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But Allison Montgomery, a currency analyst at IDEA Inc., said  
the widening deficit ``doesn't become an issue while foreigners are 
willing to finance it'' by investing in U.S. securities like 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the European Central Bank's president, Wim Duisenberg,  
said Monday the bank wasn't prepared to intervene in currency 
markets to protect the falling euro, which has slid since its 
launch in January. The euro fell to its lowest level yet against 
the dollar on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yen lost strength even as top Japanese officials, including  
the finance minister and the ministry's international bureau chief, 
expressed continued dismay at a strong yen. A top Ministry of 
Finance official, Eisuke Sakakibara, reiterated his position from 
Monday that Japan would move quickly to kill what he termed 
premature strengthening of the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.5063 Swiss francs, up from 1.5035,  
and 1.4906 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4855. The British pound was 
quoted at $1.6098, down from $1.6116. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Tuesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8409 
German marks, up from 1.8386; 6.1728 French francs, up from 6.1652; 
and 1,821.49 Italian lire, up from 1,818.18.

<HEADLINE> DiCaprio Safe After Boat Capsizes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The hero of ``Titanic'' survived a  
real-life boat sinking in Thailand -- but despite some local media 
reports, his producer insisted today there were no sharks in sight. 
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio and co-star Tilda Swinton were riding in a long tail  
boat -- a traditional fishing canoe with an outboard motor -- when it 
went down Friday in heavy seas during a sudden storm. The two were 
filming ``The Beach'' off Phi Phi Island in the Andaman Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	But contrary to front page reports in some Thai newspapers, no  
sharks were seen near the boat, said Santa Pestanij, the Thai 
coordinator for the 20th Century Fox film who was present when the 
boat capsized. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not underestimate the sea. There were at least four  
security boats present and prepared for the unpredictable,'' Santa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dive operators contacted by The Associated Press said some small  
sand sharks might swim near the islands, but they had never heard 
of a shark attack in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa said Dicaprio remained calm for the five to ten minutes he  
was in the water and helped soothe crew members who feared 
drowning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a real gentleman. A hero,'' Santa said.  
</P>
<P>
	DiCaprio is anything but a hero, however, to local environmental  
activists who are suing him and the film company in a Thai court 
for allegedly damaging the ecosystem of Maya Beach on the island. 
</P>
<P>
	The activists have staged several protests against DiCaprio,  
wearing masks made from a photo of his face with the addition of 
vampire fangs. Security has been extremely tight on the set to keep 
the protesters away. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa said the boat accident cost tens of thousands in damage to  
camera equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	The film is scheduled to finish shooting on Saturday, but Santa  
said DiCaprio wants to spend a few more days in Thailand and make a 
trip to Bangkok.

<HEADLINE> Chronology of Colo. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A reconstruction of Tuesday's school shooting in Littleton,  
Colo. All times MDT: 
</P>
<P>
	11 a.m. -- About 900 Columbine High School students head into the  
cafeteria for lunch, hit the books in the library or in classrooms. 

</P>
<P>
	11:30 a.m. -- Two young men wearing long black trench coats  
approach the school. They pull out weapons and open fire in the 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	They proceed inside, to the school cafeteria, shooting as they  
walk, then upstairs to the library, still shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	As bullets ricochet throughout the building, scores of students  
hide in closets, bathrooms, under tables and chairs. Some students, 
barricaded behind a heavy door, whisper on their terror over 
cell-phone calls to relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens more flee the building, hiding in bushes or sprinting to  
a nearby park. 

</P>
<P>
	Noon -- Police SWAT teams find several explosive devices around  
the school. Ambulances take first wounded students to area 
hospitals, all of whom managed to run outside. 
</P>
<P>
	Anguished parents, awaiting word on their children, gather at  
nearby Leawood elementary school. 

</P>
<P>
	12:30 p.m. -- SWAT teams begin room-by-room sweep of the high  
school, checking every knapsack and desk. 

</P>
<P>
	2:30 p.m. -- SWAT teams begin freeing students in hiding. In  
small groups, the students and teachers run from the building to a 
holding area, where they are frisked, questioned, offered medical 
care and then bused to Leawood elementary to be reunited with 
parents. 

</P>
<P>
	4 p.m. -- Sheriff's spokesman confirms as many as 25 people are  
dead, a combination of students and teachers. Officers searching 
the library find the bodies of both suspects, who apparently died 
of self-inflicted gunshot wounds. 

</P>
<P>
	4:30 p.m. -- SWAT teams declare school safe.  

</P>
<P>
	6:15 p.m. -- Authorities find an explosive device in a car in the

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With 10 Church Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 36-year-old Indiana man with an interest in  
satanism was indicted Tuesday on charges of burning 10 churches in 
Indiana and Georgia, including one in which a volunteer firefighter 
died, the National Church Arson Task Force announced. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest number of fires charged to one individual  
during the task force's nearly 3-year-old investigation, said 
Treasury Undersecretary James Johnson, the task force co-chairman. 
The task force has opened investigations of 752 church fires, 
bombings or attempted bombings and has charged 331 individuals in 
249 of those attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant, Jay Scott Ballinger, who was arrested last  
February on a federal complaint charging him with seven southern 
Indiana church fires, ``is a white man charged with setting fire to 
predominantly white churches,'' Acting Assistant Attorney General 
Bill Lann Lee, task force co-chairman, said at a news conference at 
the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger has admitted to federal agents that he burned 30 to 50  
churches in 11 states between 1994 and 1998, according to an 
affidavit by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent Scott D. 
McCart. In that February document, McCart said satanic materials 
were found in Ballinger's Yorktown, Ind., home. Ballinger traveled 
with his girlfriend, Angela Wood, 24, of Atlanta, as she worked as 
a stripper in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood and another man, Donald A. Puckett, 37, of Lebanon, Ind.,  
have told federal agents they took part with Ballinger in burning 
an Indiana church where they painted an upside-down cross on the 
steps as part of a satanic ritual, McCart's affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Indianapolis returned 12 counts charging  
Ballinger with the seven Indiana fires. A separate federal grand 
jury in Atlanta returned six counts charging him with three 1998 
fires in northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of those, at New Salem United Methodist Church in  
Commerce, Ga., volunteer firefighter Loy Williams, 27, died, and 
three firefighters were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that death, Ballinger could face the death penalty if  
he is convicted and Attorney General Janet Reno authorizes seeking 
that penalty. Otherwise, the Georgia fires carry a minimum penalty 
of 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana fires carry a total minimum penalty of 90 years in  
prison and a maximum of 210 years. Ballinger also faces a top fine 
of $3,000,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in custody at a federal medical facility in Minnesota, Lee  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood and Puckett were not indicted Tuesday, Lee said. They were  
charged in the same criminal complaint brought in February against 
Ballinger with assisting him in the 1994 arson of the Concord 
Church of Christ in Boone County, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Puckett filed a petition to enter a plea of guilty to  
that charge. Lee said Puckett and Wood ``have not been cleared'' 
and the investigation of fires set by Ballinger continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone who sets fire to a house of worship is not just  
attacking a building, they are attacking a community,'' Lee said, 
adding that the task force would continue operations ``as long as 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The task force has maintained a 34 percent arrest rate in the  
fires it has investigated, which Johnson said is ``more than double 
the nationwide arson arrest rate of 16 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger has been in federal custody since his arrest after  
suffering burns from a church fire he allegedly set in Ohio. 
Off-duty Ball State, Ind., Police Sgt. Steve Hiatt said he 
overheard paramedics describing Ballinger's suspicious burns and 
remembered Ballinger's name from a 1997 church fire investigation. 
He stopped by the hospital and questioned Ballinger, who was 
bandaged with severe burns to his face, chest, legs and hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger has been mostly unemployed since he settled back into  
his parents' rural home in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, parents complained he was recruiting teen-agers into a  
cult. At Ballinger's home, Daleville Police Sgt. Mark Brewer 
confiscated about 50 contracts signed in blood by teen-agers who 
agreed to give their souls to the devil and do ``all types of 
evil'' in exchange for wealth, power and sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger was not charged and successfully sued to get the  
contracts back, Brewer said.

<HEADLINE> Yanks' Strawberry Awaits Findings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There were no announcements from the  
commissioner's office Tuesday on Darryl Strawberry's recent drug 
tests, which several baseball officials said was an indication the 
results did not indicate cocaine use. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from the commissioner's office and the players'  
association conferred several times during the day. However, there 
were no signs there were problems with Strawberry's recent tests. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said the team had  
not heard any updates. The commissioner's office informs teams of 
positive test results but not of negative tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing new to report,'' Cashman said before Tuesday  
night's game against Texas. ``They won't tell unless we need to 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Record of Hackensack, N.J., reported Tuesday that results  
were negative from a test last Tuesday, 24 hours before Strawberry 
was arrested in Tampa, Fla., for cocaine possession and 
solicitation. The newspaper quoted sources said to be familiar with 
Strawberry's legal predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, was at the Yankees' training camp as part of an  
extended spring training program. The outfielder was still 
rehabilitating from colon cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's lawyer, Joseph Ficarrota, declined comment, a  
secretary at his office said.

<HEADLINE> Barbour Lobbies for Medicare Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Republicans wanted to squeeze savings out  
of Medicare in 1995, party chairman Haley Barbour was a leading 
planner and pitchman. Now a lobbyist for the nursing home industry, 
Barbour wants to boost Medicare spending, saying it is perilously 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour says he still thinks the $200 billion-a-year health-care  
program for the elderly and disabled must be buttressed for the 
retirement of baby boomers. He says he is merely helping companies 
hurt by lower Medicare reimbursements than envisioned in the 1997 
balanced-budget deal between President Clinton and Congress, which 
sought five-year Medicare savings of $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't find anything inconsistent with that,'' he said in an  
interview recently. Had the budget deal proposed the savings that 
have materialized, ``It would never have passed Congress,'' he 
said. ``Nobody would have voted for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some, however, contrast Barbour's insistence that nursing homes  
are getting $1.5 billion a year less than expected with his earlier 
claims that Medicare spending must be reined to keep it afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour was a vocal defender of the original GOP plan that  
Congress approved in 1995 and Clinton vetoed, which exceeded the 
budget deal's savings. It would have extracted $270 billion in 
savings from Medicare over seven years to help finance tax cuts and 
balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to say it's relatively common where you find people  
in public life reverse a position. Coin is king,'' said Bill Hogan, 
director of investigative projects for the Center for Public 
Integrity, a private group often critical of lobbying practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing undisputed figures that Medicare spending has temporarily  
slowed, Barbour and executives of the skilled nursing facility 
companies he represents say patient care is threatened. The 
industry, which cares for 1.5 million of the sickest nursing home 
residents, recently has endured layoffs, operating losses and 
plummeting stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survival of our business is at stake,'' said Kirill  
Goncharenko, spokesman for Mariner Post-Acute Network, one of the 
biggest nursing home companies. He says Barbour ``knows how to 
handle difficult and complex issues in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour says the culprit is federal Health Care Financing  
Administration rules that have squeezed more savings from the 
system than lawmakers intended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're underspending what the balanced-budget agreement called  
for by big dollars, and that is more than the system can stand,'' 
Barbour says. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the problem is less dire and has other causes, too.  
These include reduced medical inflation, a natural slowdown after 
unusually fast nursing home growth and a federal crackdown on 
Medicare fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully premature to say a giveback is necessary,'' said  
Marilyn Moon, an analyst for the liberal-leaning Urban Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hash, deputy HCFA director, said the agency will  
``continue to monitor'' its regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour's effort seems like a long-shot. With lawmakers eager to  
cut taxes or increase domestic spending, GOP aides say there 
probably won't be anything for nursing-home operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership has shown no interest in reopening the balanced  
budget agreement of 1997,'' said John Czwartacki, spokesman for 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour is trying anyway, using contacts from his four years as  
Republican National Committee chief and before that as political 
adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., also now a lobbyist, is working  
the Democrats. Fazio, who was one of the House Democrats' leaders, 
voted for the 1997 budget deal but says things have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare needs to be reformed but adequately funded, and I  
find that totally consistent with what I'm doing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As party chairman, Barbour was a fixture at Republican strategy  
sessions as the plan moved through Congress and a frequent guest on 
television shows. Republicans say he helped devise their strategy 
of describing their goal as saving Medicare from insolvency, then 
projected for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after leaving the RNC, the 51-year-old Mississippian  
is a partner in Barbour, Griffith and Rogers, one of the capital's 
top lobbying shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm reported earning $7.3 million last year, according to  
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks 
political spending. Its list of 35 clients from 1998 includes 
BellSouth Corp., Philip Morris and the Swiss government.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Warned on Y2K Exclusions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. airlines are being warned against seeking  
exclusions that would prevent their insurance policies from 
covering claims passengers may file due to problems stemming from 
the Year 2000 computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Transportation Department, in a statement issued Tuesday,  
also urged airlines to ensure that their computers and planes will 
not be affected by Y2K problems on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said it had warned airlines that ``some aviation  
insurers wish to write into insurance policies a clause that would 
exclude liability for all damages related to Y2K problems, and that 
some carriers already may have had similar exclusions written into 
their policies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It added: ``The department has not approved any Y2K insurance  
exclusion.'' It said it approves exclusions only in rare cases, 
such as for war risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problems stems from a common programming practice  
in which computer software recognizes dates in a two-digit format, 
such as ``99'' for the year 1999. There is widespread concern that 
unless computers are repaired, some will malfunction at the end of 
this year when the century changes, since they may interpret the 
new year as 1900 instead of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Aviation administration recently tested its  
computers and radar systems to ensure that they will not 
malfunction. The Boeing Co. also issued a statement recently 
repeating that its planes will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. airlines have given reassurances that passenger flights  
will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, all U.S. and foreign air carriers -- including  
commuter airlines and air taxis -- are required to carry minimum 
aircraft accident liability insurance coverage for bodily injury to 
or death of aircraft passengers or other people and for property 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Minimum coverage amounts depend on the class of the carrier and  
the size of its aircraft.

<HEADLINE> Delicate Diplomacy at NATO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Details, details: For the State Department's  
office of protocol, taking proper care of the leaders of 42 foreign 
countries at this week's NATO summit is a logistical nightmare of 
motorcades, seating assignments, flags and music. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest headaches: Who should sit next to President Clinton  
at dinner? (Still unclear). And how to hang the flags? 
(Alphabetically.) 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to try to stay calm. It works better that way,''  
said Chief of Protocol Mary Mel French, her laugh masking the hours 
of frenzied planning her office is doing for Washington's 
largest-ever gathering of heads of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. French's staff must make sure that the limousines run on  
time, that guests are property attired, that cultural barriers are 
bridged and visitors not offended. 
</P>
<P>
	They know, for instance, that the flags of the 19 NATO countries  
are displayed alphabetically -- according to the English language -- 
with NATO's in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
	They know that NATO newcomer Vaclav Havel, president of the  
Czech Republic since 1989, ranks No. 1 on the seating hierarchy for 
one dinner the White House is holding for members of the alliance. 
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, his country's leader for just 
six months, ranks last. 
</P>
<P>
	But even that doesn't clear up who will sit next to Clinton: It  
also depends on how the tables are arranged, whether there will be 
other special guests and if seating is arranged male/female. 
</P>
<P>
	And the ranking will be different at a second White House  
dinner, for both NATO members and the 25 eastern and central 
European countries that are NATO partners. 
</P>
<P>
	``That changes the protocol order,'' Ms. French said.  
</P>
<P>
	It sounds complicated, yet protocol makes seating at official  
dinners manageable, says Selwa ``Lucky'' Roosevelt, chief of 
protocol from 1982 to 1989, under President Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody says `Why does the person from that unimportant  
little country of Lower Slobovia get to sit next to the president, 
and my country doesn't?' You can say `We just followed protocol,''' 
Mrs. Roosevelt said. ``That gives you an out. Everybody observes 
the same protocol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Does anybody really fuss over seating?  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, my dear, do they!'' Mrs. Roosevelt said. An Italian  
foreign minister once threatened to leave the White House unless 
seating assignments were changed. ``They take it not only as a 
personal affront, but as an affront to their country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign leaders are regulars at official events so their  
``antennae wiggle'' if seats are not properly assigned, said John 
Gifford Weinmann, a chief of protocol under President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinmann says there are two rules governing protocol: Common  
sense and good manners. If someone breaks with protocol, it's best 
to overlook the gaffe, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're really fouling things up, you play it by ear and  
try not to throw a hissy fit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To avoid glitches, protocol employees will handhold members of  
each foreign delegation from the time they're greeted at airports 
until they leave American soil. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everyone doesn't get where they have to be, then it's a  
problem,'' said Ms. French, who calls arrivals, departures and 
motorcades one of the most complex arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
	She's been working 17-hour days the past three weeks to help  
finalize details -- down to what music to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The tunes played at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in  
1949 seem a bit carefree for an event that, in hindsight, marked 
the beginning of a weighty alliance that has stood firm for 50 
years.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Bonds Out At Least 10 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds is out for at least 2 1/2 months  
after surgery on his throwing arm Tuesday -- the first significant 
injury to an All-Star player who rarely missed a game during his 
12-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Giants left fielder had surgery at Recovery  
Inn in Menlo Park to repair a triceps tendon and a bone spur in his 
left elbow. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list for only the 
second time. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation was performed by San Jose Sharks team physician  
Dr. Arthur Ting. Giants physician Dr. Bill Montgomery, who observed 
the procedure, said Bonds was placed in an elbow splint and will be 
fitted with a brace this week. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Giants, one of the National League's best hitting  
teams, will now be without their best hitter for a minimum of 10 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, an eight-time All-Star and seven-time Gold Glove winner,  
was batting .366 with 12 RBIs and four home runs. He had a 
league-leading .805 slugging percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably one of the largest challenges I've faced since  
I've been manager here,'' manager Dusty Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants trainer Mark Letendre said the expected recovery period  
was based on several factors, including Bonds' past ability to heal 
quickly from injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hopeful it will be on the shorter end of 10 weeks rather  
than the longer end,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Conte, the Giants' assistant athletic trainer who also  
observed the surgery, said the bone spur and damaged tendon tissue 
were right on top of each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tissue looked better than we feared, but not as good as we  
hoped,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first inkling of a problem came Friday during batting  
practice in Phoenix. Bonds told Baker his left elbow was bothering 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker dismissed speculation that the injury occurred during or  
just after a bench-clearing brawl Friday night against the Arizona 
Diamondbacks. ``That's crazy,'' Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
	Letendre the injury was from ``chronic overuse.''  
</P>
<P>
	``In this case, the injury just happened to catch up with  
Barry,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds' only other stint on the disabled list came with  
Pittsburgh in 1992 because of a strained right side. He has missed 
just 22 games since coming to the Giants before the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds sat out Sunday's game against the Diamondbacks, then was  
out of the lineup again for Monday night' game against the Florida 
Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, he underwent an MRI that revealed the problems, but  
decided to seek a second opinion from Ting, who confirmed the 
diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker called it a ``devastating blow.''  
</P>
<P>
	``At the same time, we have to do what we have to do. We have to  
carry on -- and I don't think Barry would want it any other way,'' 
Baker said. ``It still hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Javier took Bonds' place in left field, while Ellis Burks  
took the No. 3 spot in the batting order Monday night. Baker said 
that a variety of factors would determine the lineup on a 
game-by-game basis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry Bonds is Barry Bonds,'' Javier said. ``I can't play his  
game, I'm just going to play Stan Javier's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To replace Bonds, the Giants activated rookie pitcher Joe  
Nathan, scheduled to make his major league debut on Wednesday with 
a start against Dennis Springer of the Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	Giants general manager Brian Sabean has no plans for quick  
trades to replace Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' Sabean said, then joked about what it would take to  
replace Bonds: ``Unless Willie Mays wants to get in shape.''

	NATO Hits Communications Sites  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO blasted communications sites  
and military garrisons today as U.S. helicopters and troops headed 
toward Albania to bolster the alliance's ability to destroy 
Yugoslav ground forces. NATO also sought a new promise of 
cooperation from Bulgaria, hoping to use its airspace in the 
campaign to force Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to sign a 
peace plan for Kosovo. The Bulgarian premier was traveling to NATO 
headquarters tomorrow to work out a deal. In Washington, Secretary 
of State Madeleine Albright moved to act against Yugoslav forces, 
trying to persuade her fellow foreign ministers to cut off 
shipments of refined oil to Yugoslavia.

	Ebb of Refugees Flow Mystifies  
</P>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Aid officials puzzled today over the  
sudden drying up of the stream of refugees out of Kosovo, uncertain 
whether border fighting had stopped the flow or Serbs had blocked 
it. Refugees reported thousands still on the move within Kosovo. 
But fewer than 150 made it across yesterday. After a weekend in 
which tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians poured out of the 
southern Serbian province, the only to cross into Albania yesterday 
were a few cars and trucks full of people and an old man on foot. 
In Macedonia, only 30 made it. The U.N. refugee agency spokesman in 
Kukes said it was unclear if the Serbs were preventing people from 
reaching the border.

	Security High for NATO's 50th  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The city is taking unprecedented steps to  
protect leaders of about 40 countries meeting for NATO's 50th 
anniversary. Bomb squads, SWAT teams and other federal and local 
police units and personnel are throwing a smothering security 
blanket over America's capital. The cloak of protection, 
intensified because of the NATO bombing campaign, includes the 
first-ever closing of several Smithsonian museums. Police are 
virtually shutting down more than two dozen blocks in the busy 
heart of the city. Yet organizers continue to scale back public 
aspects of the gathering, turning it solely toward serious business 
topped by talk on NATO's conflict with Yugoslavia.

	Fires May Burn 40,000 More Acres  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An erratic 130,000-acre wildfire that has roared  
through the Everglades could devour another 40,000 acres before it 
is contained, officials warned. Firefighters were monitoring the 
blaze early today while hoping that barriers created with 
controlled burns would stop its progress. Late yesterday, the 
flames reached the Miccosukee Indian Reservation, threatening 
several hunting camps and shacks, said John Fish of the state 
Division of Forestry. No injuries were reported. Just to the north, 
the blaze was about two miles east of the Big Cypress Seminole 
Indian Reservation.

narrow path through affluent subdivisions in Montgomery, Blue Ash

	Giants' Bonds To Have Surgery  
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds will undergo surgery today to  
repair a bone spur in his left elbow and a damaged triceps tendon, 
San Francisco Giants manager Dusty Baker said last night. The 
All-Star left fielder was placed on the 15-day disabled list. There 
was no indication of how long Bonds would be out of the lineup, and 
the length of his recovery would depend on what the surgeons found, 
general manager Brian Sabean said. Bonds, batting .366 with four 
home runs and 12 RBIs, had an MRI yesterday that revealed the bone 
spur.

<HEADLINE> Everglades Blaze Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES (AP) -- Curtains of brown and gray  
smoke rose from the burning Everglades today as fire officials said 
they were close to blocking the blaze that had charred more than 
130,000 acres of dry sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, the biggest one blackening pockets of the Florida  
landscape, was pushing toward the south and west and could cover an 
additional 40,000 acres before it is declared contained, possibly 
this afternoon, state forestry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a chance that improving visibility late today also  
could allow the state to reopen a 60-mile stretch of South 
Florida's main east-west highway, Interstate 75 or the Alligator 
Alley, which had been closed since the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the fire -- about 25 miles northwest of Miami -- was not  
threatening any homes and will help the Everglades ecosystem that 
is home to egrets, bass, alligators and other wildlife, said John 
Fish, a spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is actually like a rebirth process,'' Fish said today.  
``Three months from now you probably won't even be able to tell 
this burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the flames, new sawgrass will sprout quickly and  
wildlife, most of which will have survived the fire by fleeing or 
submerging in pockets of water, will flourish, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Everglades are the way they are because of the fires.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dry, windy weather was expected to continue for several coming  
days, making new fires quick to start and difficult to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire crews have used controlled burns in an effort to block the  
Everglades fire's progress. They had hoped the Miami Canal, which 
runs about 70 miles from Lake Okeechobee to Miami, would keep the 
fire from advancing farther west, but flames jumped that barrier 
Monday, said David Stull, an operations specialist with the 
Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the flames reached the edge of the mostly  
undeveloped Miccosukee Indian Reservation, located about 60 miles 
west of Fort Lauderdale. And just to the north of the Miccosukee, 
sawgrass was burning east of the Big Cypress Seminole Indian 
Reservation, which is mostly cypress trees and swampland, police 
chief Tom Hernan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In communities immediately east of the fire, people with asthma,  
bronchitis and emphysema were urged to stay indoors. During the 
weekend, motorists in Miami had to switch on their headlights 
during the daytime because of the dense smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week,  
possibly ignited by a vehicle's catalytic converter. Fanned by 
swirling wind, it quickly became the largest of at least 2,515 
fires that have burned in Florida this year.

<HEADLINE> Family of Killed Schoolgirl Settles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The parents of a girl killed when the  
drawstring of her jacket got caught on a school bus handrail said 
Tuesday they have settled their $30 million lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms were not disclosed but the parents' lawyer, Donald  
Silverman, said, ``It's an extraordinary amount for the wrongful 
death of a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came Monday, after a jury had been selected for  
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman said Michael and Sin-Chai Chen were recovering money  
from the bus company, Advance Transit Co., as well as from an 
insurer for the company and for driver Eugenio Cordero. Advance 
Transit did not return calls for comment. There was no telephone 
listing for Cordero. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Chen, 14, was getting off her school bus on Feb. 8, 1996,  
when one end of the drawstring around the bottom of her parka 
slipped between the handrail and the wall of the stairway leading 
down from the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Though regulations say a school bus cannot leave until departing  
children are 15 feet away, the bus drove off. The parka was still 
attached to the handrail and Andrea was dragged beneath the bus and 
crushed by its back wheels.

<HEADLINE> Roba Wins Third Straight in Boston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fatuma Roba was tiring as she headed up a hill  
toward the end of the Boston Marathon. Then some friends handed her 
a red, yellow and green sweatband -- the color of the Ethiopian 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flag they gave me in the hilly area gave me a boost, and I  
started running at a faster pace,'' said the 27-year-old Ethiopian, 
who won her third Boston Marathon on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	After running even with Catherine Ndereba for a good part of the  
race, Roba pulled ahead near the three-fourths mark. While becoming 
just the second woman to win the event three times in a row, she 
posted the fourth-best time in race history -- 2 hours, 23 minutes, 
25 seconds -- for her gender. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba, the 1996 Olympic marathon champion, now holds the third-  
and fourth-fastest times for the Boston Marathon. She is bested 
only by Joan Benoit Samuelson, who finished in 2:21:43 in 1983, and 
by Uta Pippig, who ran it in 2:21:45 in 1994. Pippig is the only 
other woman to win three times in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Jennings, the 38-year-old runner with 10 USA Outdoor  
Championships and an Olympic bronze medal under her belt, outpaced 
all of her American competitors, coming in 12th overall with a time 
of 2:38:37. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only her second marathon. In 1978, when she was just a  
high school senior at the Bromfield School in Harvard, Jennings 
came in third as an unofficial entrant. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Jennings beat the time of 2:47 she set 21 years ago,  
perhaps starting a new phase of her 23-year running career as a 
marathoner. 
</P>
<P>
	She said after the race that she was happy she qualified for the  
Olympic trials by coming in under 2:42. 
</P>
<P>
	Her coach, John Babington, said she ran too fast early on.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was suffering, but she didn't break down completely,''  
Babington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings said she didn't expect to tire quite so early. She ran  
even with the leaders for the first half of the 26.2-mile race and 
then faded over the next few miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The race was a blur, she said, except for the cheering of the  
fans who lined the entire route from Hopkinton to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was absolutely carried along by the fans,'' said the  
Newmarket, N.H., resident. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of the race, 20-year-old Sun Yingje of China  
ran well ahead of the pack at a very fast pace, nearly a minute 
ahead of her closest pursuer. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba and Ndereba, 20, of Kenya, ran behind Sun until they caught  
her at about 12 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba later said she didn't even notice Sun until the middle of  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	For the next four miles, the two African women were locked in a  
stride-for-stride battle until Roba began to open up against 
Ndereba. 
</P>
<P>
	Ndereba, making her marathon debut, fell behind 32-year-old  
Franziska Rochat-Moser at the three-quarter mark and finished 
sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Rochat-Moser also is a lawyer who owns a gourmet restaurant in  
her hometown of Crissier, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Yukio Arimori, 32, finished third. She is a heroine in her  
native Japan for her second-place finish in the 1992 Olympic 
marathon and third at the 1996 Atlanta Games.

<HEADLINE> Schreiber is a Hoffman Wannabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dustin Hoffman was behind the scenes in the  
recent movie ``A Walk on the Moon,'' but was actor Liev Schreiber 
doing a Hoffman impression on-screen? 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, you know, he told me that when I first met him,''  
Hoffman said Monday night on NPR's ``Fresh Air'' show. ``He says, 
`You know, I've been ripping you off since the beginning.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman is co-producer of the movie, which takes on life in a  
Jewish vacation spot in the Catskills in the summer of 1969 -- the 
year of Woodstock and the first walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Schreiber and Diane Lane play a working-class New York couple  
who get caught up in the times. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Goldwyn, the grandson of Samuel Goldwyn, was Hoffman's  
co-producer and directed the movie. He joked to ``Fresh Air'' host 
Terry Gross that he coached Schreiber to mimic Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
	```Liev, it's really good, but if you could, just on this take,  
a little bit more like Dustin that would be great. I think what 
Dustin would do at this moment is ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman: ``That's all you have to do, is tell an actor that. ...  
He's producing it, and we'll only let you play the part if you do 
him.''

<HEADLINE> NYC May Limit Skyscrapers' Height </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city that is home to some of the world's  
most famous skyscrapers is considering its first broad limits on 
the height of new buildings under a proposal announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to turn Manhattan into a little village,''  
said Joseph Rose, chairman of the City Planning Commission. 
``There's no reason we can't create a lot of new housing with 
acceptable heights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sky would still be the limit for towers in midtown Manhattan  
and the downtown financial district, Rose said. Elsewhere, maximum 
heights would vary from neighborhood to neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The current zoning rules, enacted in 1961, require developers to  
provide public space on the ground if they want to build high into 
the sky. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rose said that system had failed, creating useless concrete  
plazas around buildings that were often out-of-sync with their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	And the incredible complexity of the regulations often let  
builders with clever lawyers do whatever they wanted, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Manhattan's East Side were shocked to realize  
Donald Trump would be allowed to put up a 90-story tower -- now in 
the planning stages -- in their neighborhood of mostly much smaller 
buildings near the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Conn Nugent, executive director of the non-partisan  
good-government group Citzens Union, applauded a simplification of 
the zoning rules and said height restrictions could help make the 
city friendlier to residents and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani emphasized that the proposal would go  
through a lengthy process of public review before adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a proposal. It isn't necessarily going to happen that  
way,'' he told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Boxer Ayala Released From Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- ``The Little Bull'' is a distant memory,  
even for Tony Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
	He once seemed destined for superstardom, but his promising  
boxing career crashed in a night of madness. Images of his 
flamboyance and devastating speed stayed locked behind bars with 
him, along with thoughts of a terrible crime he can never forget. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala walked out of a New Jersey prison Tuesday after serving 16  
years for rape. As he ventured into daylight and freedom, Ayala was 
bombarded by thoughts of a comeback and overwhelmed by disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept expecting an officer to come to me and say they made a  
mistake,'' said Ayala, spending his first hours of freedom with his 
wife at the Pennsylvania home of his adviser, Brian Raditz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like a dream. I've said that to her a number of  
times: `We made it. We got through this.' It's like a long 
struggle, a struggle to keep going. Sometimes it seemed like the 
end would never come, and when it happens it's hard to believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala, now 36, hasn't fought since he was a 19-year-old junior  
middleweight with a 22-0 record with 19 knockouts. But his chance 
to be the Oscar De La Hoya of his day was ruined by drugs and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early morning hours of New Year's Day 1983, Ayala  
returned to his Paterson, N.J., home after a night out with his 
wife, Lisa Paez. She went to bed. He said he was going to watch 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, stoked by heroin and booze, he went to the home of a  
female neighbor and raped her. At the time, he was on probation for 
beating a woman in the restroom of a San Antonio drive-in theater 
in 1980, and for breaking into a San Antonio home in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole focus was finding out what it was that caused me to  
behave in the manner that I did and fix myself,'' said Ayala, who 
was released for good behavior less than half way through his 
35-year sentence. ``The fact that I committed this crime is 
something I will have to live with the rest of my life. It's not 
ever going to be forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala spent much of his sentence attacking the demons that  
nearly ruined his life and that of his victim, training his mind 
and soul with the intensity that once honed his body for the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	With the counseling and friendship of Raditz, Ayala finally was  
ready to begin training his body again. He says he weighs 175 
pounds -- 21 pounds over the junior middleweight limit -- and can do 
300 pullups, 300 pushups, 300 dips, 2,000 crunches and run eight 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, he looks phenomenal,'' Raditz said. ``He's  
probably in better shape now than he was when he was fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paez struggled with her husband's crime and absence, leaving him  
several years ago. But she was there to lead him out of Bayside 
State Prison in Leesburg, N.J. The couple are planning to remarry 
and perhaps have children. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a deep breath, let it out and said, `Let's go,''' Paez  
said. ``We walked through the doors hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new beginning. It was a very hard walk. But I've always  
been in love with Tony, and I was always trying to replace him with 
someone else. It just wasn't happening. I wasn't running from him, 
because I loved him. I was running from a situation that was just 
unbearable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's parents and two older brothers also were there to escort  
him out of prison. His father, also Tony, will train him again if 
he makes it back into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Financially, Ayala needs to work. As with many troubled  
fighters, boxing probably will give him a few easy pay days. If he 
is going to make it, Ayala will have to avoid the problems former 
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson has had since he got out of prison 
for rape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boxing is a way I could give to my family what I always wanted  
to give to them, but unfortunately was too stupid when I was young 
to give them,'' Ayala said. ``I want to finish some unfinished 
business with boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Ayala tended to the unfinished business of his life.  
Laughter, chatter and a dog's barking could be heard in the 
background as he talked on the phone at Raditz's home in the 
Philadelphia suburb of Huntingdon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The sounds of a speedbag could be next.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's already succeeded,'' Raditz said. ``He's dealt with his  
horrible, horrible conflicts. He's very remorseful about how he 
behaved. He is a winner already, whether he goes back to fighting 
or, honestly, whatever he sets his mind to.''

<HEADLINE> Otis Thorpe Grabs 10,000th Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Otis Thorpe grabbed his 10,000th rebound Tuesday  
night, becoming the 16th player in NBA history to score at least 
15,000 points and get 10,000 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Wizards forward entered the game against the  
Chicago Bulls needing two rebounds to reach 10,000. Thorpe, 36, got 
his first with 5:50 left in the first quarter, when he grabbed an 
offensive rebound and put it back for a basket. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10,000th came off the defensive board with 2:39 left in the  
first. The game wasn't stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe finished the game with nine rebounds and six points.  
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the things that happen when you hang around for  
awhile and work at your game and work hard,'' he said. ``Work 
within the system that you've been involved in, good things happen 
for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The others in the 15,000-10,000 club are: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,  
Wilt Chamberlain, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem 
Olajuwon, Robert Parish, Elgin Baylor, Charles Barkley, Walt 
Bellamy, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Jack Sikma, Buck Williams and 
Patrick Ewing. Of the 15, 12 are on the NBA's list of 50 greatest 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing got his 10,000th rebound earlier this season.  
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking about legendary players, guys who have gone out  
there and set the foundation. Just to be a part of that group is a 
great achievement,'' Thorpe said. ``It's nice to be a part of that 
club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe, in his 15th NBA season, entered the game with 17,042  
points. He was the 55th player to reach 17,000.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Accountability Bill Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government would be required to  
report each year on the costs its numerous regulations impose on 
businesses and government bodies under a bill approved Tuesday by a 
House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would increase the federal government's  
accountability and improve the quality of regulatory programs, said 
its sponsors, Reps. Tom Bliley, R-Va., and David McIntosh, R-Ind. 
The GOP has introduced several measures to curb the creation of new 
rules and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``As many Americans filed their federal income taxes last week,  
I'm sure many wondered where their hard-earned dollars were 
going,'' Bliley said. ``This bill will help answer that question by 
providing an annual accounting statement of regulations at all 
federal agencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee's panel on national  
economic growth, natural resources and regulators affairs approved 
the bill by voice vote over the objections of some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said the Clinton administration  
has joined labor, environmental, consumer protection and public 
health groups in opposing the bill because it could tie up already 
overburdened government agencies with work that may end up being of 
little value. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure may ``seriously hamper the work of federal  
government agencies which are mandated to protect the public from 
adverse consequences and certain business practices,'' threats to 
the environment and public health and unfair labor practices, 
Kucinich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, he said, the bill puts too much emphasis on the impact  
of regulations on businesses and other organizations and too little 
on how the regulations affect the people they are designed to 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to  
compile accounting statements on the costs of federal regulations. 
Accompanying reports would analyze the impact of regulations on the 
private sector, including small businesses, wages, consumer prices 
and economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the bill will not impose any undue burden on  
OMB since much of the needed information is already available,'' 
McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee approved a Kucinich amendment that would have  
OMB also look at impacts on public health, public safety, the 
environment, consumer protection, equal opportunity and other 
policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., has introduced similar legislation  
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1074.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Tens of thousands of students shut down  
Mexico's main university -- one of the largest in the world -- with 
an indefinite strike Tuesday to protest a tuition hike that has 
ended the state-run school's virtually free status. 
</P>
<P>
	The students walked out on most campuses of the National  
Autonomous University, effectively blocking classes and research 
activities. They vowed to strike until college officials revoke 
last month's hike, which raised annual fees from 2 cents to about 
$145. 
</P>
<P>
	University President Francisco Barnes de Castro said Monday that  
his administration would not back down over the hike, which 
officials say is necessary due to steadily decreasing government 
funding. He called for further negotiations with student leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The university, known as UNAM, has some 268,000 students at 42  
campuses throughout the Mexico City metropolitan area. Students 
have long fought against any increase in fees, which have been 
frozen since 1948 due to constitutional guarantees of free 
education in state-run schools. 
</P>
<P>
	UNAM officials have promised students whose families make less  
than four times the national minimum wage, about $3.50 a day, would 
be exempt.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Supporters of Gen. Augusto Pinochet  
launched a new campaign Tuesday to raise $2 million for his defense 
over the next two years, convinced the former dictator faces a long 
legal battle in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcing the campaign, retired Gen. Luis Cortez, director of  
the Pinochet Foundation, said Pinochet would never be ``left 
alone.'' Pinochet, under arrest in Britain since October, is 
battling extradition to Spain, where a judge wants to try him for 
human rights violations stemming from his 1973-90 rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The new fundraising includes the restoration of five hot lines  
where people can donate the equivalent to $5 to $30. Two bank 
accounts also are to receive donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cortez said the foundation, a private group of Pinochet  
supporters and former aides, has already paid $1.5 million for his 
legal defense. That money came from private donations.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Federal police seized 77 pounds of  
cocaine aboard a Brazilian Air Force cargo plane and are 
investigating possible links between military personnel and drug 
traffickers, the Air Force Ministry said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs were found Monday on a Hercules C-130 bound for Palma  
de Mallorca, Spain, where it was scheduled to pick up spare parts 
for Brazilian military aircraft, the ministry press office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane departed from the Rio de Janeiro air base Sunday and  
made a refueling stop in the northeastern city of Recife, where the 
drugs were detected by drug-sniffing dogs. The pilot and eight crew 
members were detained pending further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs were found in two suitcases, which the pilot told  
investigators he had received from a fellow officer based in 
Manaus, capital of the jungle state of Amazonas, according to an O 
Globo newspaper report. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilot was asked to deliver the suitcases to an unidentified  
individual in Spain, the newspaper said.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A majority of Mexicans approve of the way  
President Ernesto Zedillo is leading the government, according to 
an opinion poll made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by the University of Guadalajara's Center for Opinion  
Studies showed that 80.2 percent of 2,202 people polled nationwide 
March 25-27 approved of Zedillo's performance. Another 17.3 percent 
disapproved, and 2.5 percent refused to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	The polls had a margin of error of 4 percentage points.  
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo is now in his fifth year of a six-year term, with  
presidential elections scheduled for July 2000. Three major parties 
and two smaller ones are scheduled to choose their candidates to 
succeed him this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 42.4 percent said they would vote for the candidate of the  
Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party, in power since 1929, 
if elections were held today. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 25 percent said they would vote for the conservative  
National Action Party, and 19.6 percent for the leftist Democratic 
Revolution Party. The rest supported smaller parties or declined to 
respond.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Ky. FB Player Jailed for 10 Yrs. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOMERSET, Ky. (AP) -- Former Kentucky football player Jason Watts  
was sentenced Tuesday to the maximum 10 years in prison for an 
alcohol-related truck crash that killed a teammate and another 
young man. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts, who turned 22 Monday, has been in the Pulaski County  
Detention Center since March 31, when he pleaded guilty to reckless 
homicide and volunteered to start serving time immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts' shoulders slumped when the judge sentenced him, and given  
a chance to address the court, Watts choked back tears as he said, 
``I want to say I'm sorry to all the people I let down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Watts' lawyer, James Lowry, had argued that Watts'  
willingness to take responsibility for the deaths of his friends 
should merit a lighter sentence, if not probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonwealth's Attorney Eddy Montgomery said that while he  
appreciated Watts' willingness to take responsibility, ``as a 
prosecutor, I can't look past the fact that two people have died.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Watts was immediately returned to jail, and Lowry did not make  
himself available to comment. Watts' father, mother and sister -- 
who attended the sentencing with Watts' former teammate, Paul 
McGonagle -- were in tears after the sentencing and declined to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nov. 15 crash on U.S. 27 north of Somerset injured Watts and  
killed teammate Arthur Steinmetz and Eastern Kentucky student Scott 
Brock. 
</P>
<P>
	Watts was hospitalized for a week with an arm laceration,  
visible Tuesday when he was dressed in a blue jail jumpsuit. He was 
kicked off the football team and left school briefly before 
returning in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The crash darkened Kentucky's most successful football season in  
years, one that climaxed with an appearance in the Jan. 1 Outback 
Bowl. Watts, a senior from Oviedo, Fla., played a key role in the 
team's success, anchoring a line that protected star quarterback 
Tim Couch.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA MADRE, Calif. (AP) -- Trash talk hasn't been a waste of  
time for Kevin Inciyaki. At age 9, it's landed him notice and a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin likes garbage and garbage containers and garbage trucks  
and garbage books and garbage videos. Early photos of him in the 
family scrapbook show him inspecting trash cans at Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a photo collection of ``garbage trucks of the world''  
taken for him by family friends on trips abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been garbage since he was 2-years-old -- you have no idea  
what it's like having a child who has a passion for trash,'' said 
Kevin's mother, Marsha Inciyaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin doesn't know what got his interested in the dirty side of  
life. Classmates at Bethany Christian School ``think it's kinda 
weird,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii, his brother wanted to go snorkeling, and when we  
asked Kevin what he wanted to do, he said, 'Follow the garbage 
trucks,''' Mrs. Inciyaki said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Madre public works officials who knew how much Kevin  
likes trash recommended him for a job with the University of 
California, Los Angeles. Now he's running a worm farm and 
collecting worm information as part of a waste management survey in 
Sierra Madre and Monrovia.

<HEADLINE> Group: National Parks Are Decaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dirty air is choking the Great Smoky Mountains  
National Park. Deteriorating sewers are polluting the streams of 
Yellowstone. Historic ruins in the Chaco Culture National 
Historical Park in New Mexico are falling apart because of neglect 
and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	The examples were cited Tuesday by a private parks advocacy  
group as examples of a national park system that is in need of 
billions of dollars in repairs and protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our national parks are not being protected or respected,''  
said Thomas Kiernan, president of the National Parks and 
Conservation Association, as the group released a list of its 10 
``most endangered parks'' in the federal system of 378 parks, 
monuments and historical sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiernan said the 10 parks were examples of the problems facing  
the federal park system and that other parks may be just as 
endangered. These were selected because they were symbolic of the 
kinds of problems parks are facing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The list of 10 is an embarrassment. ... We can and must do a  
lot more,'' he said at a news conference. But Kiernan acknowledged 
that overcoming years of neglect and funding shortfalls will be 
expensive -- perhaps as much as $6 billion over many years. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is growing interest in Congress this year to spend  
more for conservation, including land purchases, there's no 
indication Congress is prepared to spend that kind of money on the 
federal park system. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sens. Harry Reid of Nevada and Bob Graham of Florida  
attended the news conference to promote legislation they have 
introduced that would provide $500 million a year for park 
improvements and address outside threats to federal parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid noted that 65 million people visit the 54 national parks  
and more than 100 million more visit the numerous monuments and 
historic areas annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the envy of the rest of the world with our national  
parks,'' said Reid, but ``our national parks are being overused, 
over-loved. They're being loved to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The park groups' 10 most endangered list cited an array of  
problems, including traffic congestion, air pollution, a push for 
wider used of motorized vehicles, poor maintenance and inadequate 
safeguards against vandalism and looting that have led to the 
destruction of historic sites. Historic artifacts often are being 
left to rot, rust or mildew. In some cases, the biodiversity of 
parks is being undermined by invading non-native species; and in 
many parks, no one knows what species actually are present, the 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group did not rank the 10 parks, but provided a list in  
alphabetical order:

<HEADLINE> Health Benefits of Vitamin C Touted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Government researchers say the recommended daily  
allowance for vitamin C should be doubled or tripled because of 
increasing evidence over the past two decades of its 
cancer-fighting ability. 
</P>
<P>
	The current recommended daily allowances were established by the  
National Academy of Sciences in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	In a paper in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical  
Association, researchers from the National Institutes of Health 
said the RDA for vitamin C should be raised from 60 milligrams to 
between 100 mg and 200 mg. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mark Levine, an NIH researcher, said the recommendation  
reflects a growing body of research showing that five servings of 
fruit and vegetables a day can help prevent cancer. By raising the 
recommended amount of vitamin C, people are encouraged to eat more 
fruits and vegetables, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hower, the NIH researchers cautioned that there's such a thing  
as too much vitamin C. They said 200 mg is the maximum the body can 
absorb before it starts expelling the vitamin. Larger amounts can 
inrease the risk of kidney stones, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine said the recommendations are based on an ``explosion'' of  
research conducted since 1980. Levine said the current 
recommendation is based on decades-old studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin C, which is not produced naturally in the body, is one  
of 13 vitamins and minerals people need to stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences' Food and Nutrition Board is  
reviewing the recommended dietary allowance of several vitamins, 
including vitamin C. The board is expected to release its findings 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The board will review the NIH paper and other research in making  
its decision, said board member Sandy Schlicker. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert on vitamin C and other antioxidants agreed it is time  
to raise the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old recommendation was based on very primitive data,''  
said Dr. Kenny Jialal of the University of Texas's Southwestern 
Medical Center, who did not participate in the study. ``The data we 
have today is more plausible and more biologically relevant.''

<HEADLINE> 20 Hurt in Colorado H.S. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men dressed in long, black  
trench coats opened fire in a suburban high school today, 
scattering students as gunshots ricocheted off lockers. At least 20 
people were wounded -- one girl shot nine times -- and other injured 
people were stranded for hours in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosions also were heard inside Columbine High School.  
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two hours after the 11:30 a.m. shooting, SWAT team  
members entered the building and 15 to 20 students fled. The 
frightened students ran out with their hands in the air and were 
later frisked by police. Several other groups of youths left the 
school an hour later after an armored car was brought to an 
entrance for cover. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no confirmation that the gunmen were still inside, but  
police said some students were hiding in the building. SWAT team 
members searching the building were able to see some wounded 
students but couldn't reach them because the area wasn't secure, 
said Steve Davis, spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there are a few more victims,'' Davis said. ``We're  
hearing from deputies who can see from their vantage points more 
victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said police were looking for two suspects, but ``where in the  
building is unknown.'' Davis said fire trucks and armored cars were 
being brought in to get to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	One student, Kami Vest, called her father as she hid in the  
school with 30 other students. ``They have been able to call out on 
a cell phone and tell us they are OK,'' Dale Vest said. He said she 
remained in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope the American people will be praying for the students,  
parents and teachers,'' President Clinton said this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Television images, broadcast nationwide, showed police cars and  
ambulances at a staging area near the school, and helmeted officers 
in camouflage gear. At midafternoon, a bloodied young man dangled 
from a second-floor window, his right arm limp, and was helped down 
by two SWAT team members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the school was stormed, three youths wearing black  
-- but not trench coats -- were stopped by police in a field near the 
school. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation told KUSA-TV the three 
were friends of the gunmen who were being taken in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses said there were two gunmen and the shootings took  
place around the school, including the cafeteria and library. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard the gunshots and we were running,'' said Kaley Boyle,  
a junior at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said a student who gave her name as Janine. ``We didn't 
think it was real and then we saw blood.'' Her voice broke with 
anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was two young men, wearing black trench coats.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff. ...  
Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We saw three 
people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Sapin, another student, also said the gunmen were all in  
black, in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hid behind the school in the bushes and I saw them. When  
they started walking down the hallway, I ran and I ran and I hid in 
the bushes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight to 10 students in the school wear black trench coats every  
day, students said. Josh Nielsen said they are known as the 
``Trench Coat Mafia.'' Said another classmate, Jason Greer, ``They 
are jerks. They are really strange, but I've never seen them do 
anything violent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the adjacent Clement Park, students were shaking and crying  
as parents wandered about, looking for their children. Police 
helicopters whirled overhead and hundreds of police officers 
patrolled in the area of the school and park. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 19 people were taken to hospitals, including a girl who  
suffered nine gunshot wounds to the chest. Kari Mackecher, 
spokesman for HealthOne, which runs Swedish, said four students 
were taken there, all in serious condition but conscious, and a 
fifth was en route. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the girl with nine gunshot wounds, a second girl  
had a wound to the chest, a boy had a wound in the back, and 
another youth had three gunshot wounds in the chest and arms. A 
fifth person was en route, but there was no information available. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other hospitals reported getting 14 people, at least one of  
them in critical condition. The 20th injured person was the young 
man taken out of the school at midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver and Littleton police, and Jefferson County and Arapahoe  
sheriff's deputies were helping on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. It opened in 1973 and has 
an enrollment of about 1,800. Nearby schools were put on a lockdown 
status, with students prohibited from entering or leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of school shootings since 1997 shocked the nation and  
led to calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of troubled 
students. Two were killed at a school in Pearl, Miss., three at 
West Paducah, Ky., five at Jonesboro, Ark., and two at a school in 
Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Bonds Has Arm Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds had surgery today on his  
throwing arm, but it was not immediately clear how long he will be 
sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Francisco Giants star underwent an operation to repair a  
triceps tendon in his left arm and a bone spur in his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said he was out of surgery but would not elaborate on  
his condition. 
</P>
<P>
	This is only the second time in his 12-year career the All-Star  
left outfielder has been put on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not certain how Bonds hurt his arm, but manager Dusty  
Baker suspects it's just wear and tear. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, an MRI revealed the problems. Bonds skipped Monday's  
game -- a 5-4 victory over the Florida Marlins -- and got a second 
opinion from San Jose Sharks team physician Art Ting, who confirmed 
the diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds spent his only stint on the disabled list in 1992 when he  
was with Pittsburgh. He had a strained right side then. 
</P>
<P>
	``Barry's not one to complain,'' Baker said. ``He knew something  
was wrong -- and something was wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team got the news late Monday night after beating the  
Marlins. Bonds was batting .366 with four home runs and 12 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't replace Barry Bonds,'' general manager Brian Sabean  
said. ``It will be a test of our character and the depth of our 
team. It's something we're going to have to deal with, and depend 
on Dusty's ability to mix and match.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Monday's game, the clubhouse stereo, which usually blares  
after home wins, was silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to miss him because he creates a lot of things for  
the team,'' said Stan Javier, who replaced Bonds in left field. 
``We have to make sure we're in good shape when he comes back. On 
the good side, it's happened early, so he can come back and help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shawn Estes, who started for the Giants and gave up four runs on  
six hits, said Bonds' absence will be a test for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're missing a big part of our offense. I know he doesn't  
want to be there and he'll be back as soon as he possibly can,'' he 
said. ``Now we have to go do what we can without him.''

<HEADLINE> FCC Gives Broadcasters Verbal Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- With increased competition from cable TV,  
satellite TV and the Internet, broadcasters should be given some 
leeway to own more TV and radio stations, the nation's top airwaves 
regulator said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that we can afford to keep broadcasters in the  
Dark Ages of black-and-white era rules because the world has 
changed,'' Bill Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission, told broadcasters at the industry's annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the changing realities of today's marketplace, you do  
need the flexibility to seize these opportunities so you can be a 
player in the information age,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters say they need regulatory relief to better compete  
against other cable TV, satellite TV, Internet and other media and 
entertainment providers, which aren't subject to the same ownership 
restrictions. Owning more local TV and radio stations in the same 
market would produce business efficiencies that would allow 
broadcasters to offer new programs and services, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
	Deregulation opponents say allowing companies to own more local  
stations would threaten editorial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard asked the industry to work with the FCC to come up with  
a plan to ease rules limiting the number of local TV and radio 
stations that a single company can control. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan, he said, must balance broadcasters' needs with the  
commission's desire to make sure listeners and viewers continue to 
have diverse sources of news and entertainment. The industry and 
the FCC have been at loggerheads on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``My challenge this year is for you to join with me in crafting  
common-sense ownership rule relief,'' Kennard said. ``First and 
foremost, we've got to get this behind us. We've got to bring these 
ownership rule proceedings to a close. They have been pending for 
far too long. There's too much uncertainty in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC wants to produce a final plan in a couple of months, an  
agency official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard didn't specify what such a plan would do or whether it  
would resemble a proposal offered by commission staff last year. 
</P>
<P>
	That proposal would have made it easier for some broadcasters to  
own more media properties but also would have required others to 
divest some stations. Many broadcasters and key Republican 
lawmakers in Congress opposed the plan, saying it doesn't give 
broadcasters enough regulatory relief. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 telecommunications law eased some restrictions but  
required the commission to consider changing, or even eliminating, 
other limits because of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rules prohibit a single company from owning more than one  
local TV station in a given market or from owning a TV station and 
a radio station in the same market unless the FCC grants a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The major broadcast networks, meanwhile, want the FCC to  
eliminate or loosen a rule limiting them from owning stations that 
reach more than 35 percent of all TV viewers -- something their 
affiliates oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some say we should just eliminate all of these rules, just  
sweep them away, get rid of everything,'' Kennard said. ``I don't 
think that's the right answer, frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another crucial matter for broadcasters is whether the FCC will  
continue to let companies enter into local marketing agreements, or 
LMAs. They allow one TV station to operate another TV station in 
the same market, but not own it.

<HEADLINE> IMF Hopeful About Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund reported today  
that ``significant positive developments'' in the world economy 
this year raise hopes that the worst may be over for a financial 
crisis that pushed one-third of the globe into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Issuing its latest ``World Economic Outlook,'' the IMF insisted  
there are still plenty of threats around. But for the first time 
since the crisis erupted, the 182-nation international lending 
organization was able to revise its previous growth forecast 
slightly upward instead of being forced to admit it had been overly 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF said it believes the global economy will expand by 2.3  
percent this year, just 0.1 percentage point higher than a forecast 
it made four months ago. That would still make this year the 
weakest since the last global recession in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	But looking further into the future, the agency saw a solid  
rebound in 2000 with the economy returning to growth of 3.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Global economic growth should pick up again in 2000 as  
adjustments in the emerging market economies run their course,'' 
the IMF economists wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But for that to occur, the IMF said, the world's largest  
economy, the United States, must achieve a ``soft landing'' with 
growth slowing to a more sustainable pace to keep inflation 
pressures at bay. Japan, the second-largest economy, will have to 
finally exhibit signs of emerging from its worst recession in a 
half-century, the IMF concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	If weaknesses in Japan are prolonged further, if recent weakness  
in continental Europe intensifies or if the United States suffers a 
sharper slowdown than expected, risks to the global economy will 
rise markedly, the IMF said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF forecasts also saw threats coming from the current NATO  
bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, warning of severe disruptions to 
neighboring countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	For the United States, the IMF predicted growth will slow from  
last year's sizzling 3.9 percent rate to 3.3 percent, with an even 
further slowdown to 2.2 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy was projected to shrink again this year, with  
output falling 1.4 percent -- double last year's plunge. However, 
the IMF said there are hopeful signs that Japan's economy finally 
may be emerging from its decade-long period of weakness. It 
predicted an end to the Japanese recession and slight growth of 0.3 
percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF was even more optimistic about other Asian countries,  
where plunging currencies and stock markets, triggered steep 
downturns, beginning first in Thailand in July 1997 and then 
spreading to other nations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Activity has recently turned around in Korea and seems to have  
bottomed out in Malaysia and Thailand,'' the IMF said. ``Investor 
sentiment toward many emerging market economies has rallied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This assessment echoed a forecast released Monday by the Asian  
Development Bank, which reported ``distinct signs that this sharp 
contraction may be bottoming out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This view is a far cry from concerns last fall after Russia  
defaulted on billions of dollars in debt, throwing stock markets 
from New York to Buenos Aires into a tailspin. The Federal Reserve 
responded with a series of U.S. interest rate cuts that restored 
confidence and helped cushion the shocks when Brazil was forced to 
devalue its own currency in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's new economic forecast was released in advance of the  
agency's annual spring meetings. Those sessions are expected to be 
devoted to discussions about what still must be done to overhaul 
the global financial architecture to prevent future Asian-style 
currency crises.

<HEADLINE> Atheist Doesn't Have To Go to AA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An appeals court said an atheist cannot be  
forced to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. But the court also 
noted that his $1 award for damages was ``just about right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling came Monday in the case of Robert Warner, who had  
argued that the Orange County Department of Probation ignored his 
constitutional rights when it required him to attend AA meetings as 
part of his probation following an impaired-driving conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner argued that the order meant he would be forced to  
participate in religious exercises in violation of his First 
Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, siding with a lower court  
judge, agreed in a split ruling. It also said U.S. District Court 
Judge Gerard Goettel was right to find no substantial damages and 
to award Warner only a nominal $1. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Richard Golden, representing Orange County, said he  
planned to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. He said any 
religious aspect to AA meetings did not rise to the level of an 
establishment of a religion.

<HEADLINE> Radcliffe College, Harvard To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- When Radcliffe College opened its doors  
to women in 1879, it did so out of necessity: nearby Harvard 
University was only for men. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until 1943 -- with Harvard's undergraduates off  
fighting in World War II -- that Radcliffe's women were first 
allowed to take classes at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four years later, Radcliffe ceased to be an independent  
undergraduate institution. Though it still admitted female 
students, they studied at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, its mission fulfilled, Radcliffe plans to close its doors  
forever -- fully merging with Harvard and ending its role as a 
separate college after 120 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The former women's college will become the Radcliffe Institute  
for Advanced Study, which will offer graduate students instruction 
on women, gender and society. 
</P>
<P>
	That puts Radcliffe in the same league as Harvard's business,  
law, divinity and education graduate schools, with one major 
exception: Radcliffe will not grant degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are creating something that will have extraordinary  
intellectual power and visibility,'' Harvard University President 
Neil L. Rudenstine said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's long-rumored announcement is as much an end of an era  
as a beginning of a new one, said Mary Maples Dunn, director of 
Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library. She will become the institute's 
interim leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Institute for Advanced Study is going to become probably  
the best such institute in the country and the only one with a 
strong emphasis on women,'' said Maples Dunn, former president of 
Smith College. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions between Radcliffe and Harvard had been mounting over  
concurrent fund-raising campaigns and disputes over Cambridge 
property that the one-time women's college occupies. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new merger, Radcliffe, as well as its prime Cambridge  
real estate, will be subsumed under Harvard's enormous umbrella. 
Beginning next year, women applicants will apply only to Harvard, 
just as men do. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger brought mixed reaction from undergraduates.  
</P>
<P>
	``I may have been educated academically at Harvard, but  
Radcliffe gave me so many things that Harvard couldn't,'' said a 
disappointed Mia Bagneris, a 21-year-old senior from New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think it's the way to go,'' said Miriam Pachacki of  
Mountain View, Calif., Radcliffe Class of 1938. ``I think it's 
going to be a good thing for the women of Harvard not to have this 
sketchiness between the two colleges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radcliffe College was established in 1879 under the name the  
``Harvard Annex'' as an alternative to women who were denied access 
to the all-male Harvard. Fifteen years later came the name honoring 
Ann Radcliffe, who established Harvard's first scholarship in 1643. 
</P>
<P>
	Radcliffe seniors began receiving Harvard diplomas signed by the  
presidents of both colleges in 1963. Twelve years later, a joint 
admissions office opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger -- which still needs final approval from  
Radcliffe's Board of Trustees and Harvard's equivalent oversight 
board -- Harvard will actually boost the Radcliffe endowment by 
about $150 million, bringing the total to $300 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Radcliffe becomes just the latest women's school to merge with  
its one-time brother institution. The partnership between New 
York's Columbia University and all-female Barnard College is one of 
the few that still exist.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reacts to School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A somber President Clinton, recalling his own  
travels to the suburban Denver community rocked by a shooting 
rampage through Columbine High, asked the nation to ``wake up'' to 
school violence today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said a team of grief counselors has been mobilized and  
will head to Littleton, Colo., where the death toll -- which police 
estimated at 25 -- was still being confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it can happen here, then surely people will recognize that  
they have to be alive to the possibility that it can occur in any 
community in America and maybe that will help us to keep it from 
happening again,'' Clinton said from the White House press briefing 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, his face red and eyes mostly downcast, addressed  
the nation after an afternoon of updates from his aides and phone 
calls to state and local officials on the scene in Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed by reporters to say what the government might do to stop  
such school violence, Clinton said he wanted to give the Colorado 
community -- ``an open wound'' -- time to grieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight, I think the American people ought to be thinking  
about those folks in Littleton,'' he said. ``Tomorrow and in the 
days ahead, we'll have a little more time to kind of gather 
ourselves and our determination and go back at this again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A somber President Clinton, recalling his own  
travels to the suburban Denver community rocked by a shooting 
rampage through Columbine High School, asked the nation Tuesday to 
``wake up'' to school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of respect for Colorado's grief, Clinton canceled a  
political trip Wednesday to Texas. He said a team of counselors has 
been mobilized and will head to Littleton, Colo., where the death 
toll -- which police estimated at 25 -- was still being confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it can happen here, then surely people will recognize that  
they have to be alive to the possibility that it can occur in any 
community in America, and maybe that will help us to keep it from 
happening again,'' Clinton said from the White House press briefing 
room. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, his face red and eyes mostly downcast, addressed  
the nation after an afternoon of updates from his aides, phone 
calls to state and local officials in Littleton, and what he said 
were constantly changing numbers of injuries and fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Quoting from a conversation he said he had with County  
Commission Chairwoman Patricia Holloway, Clinton said: ``Perhaps 
now America would wake up to the dimensions of this challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed by reporters to say what the government might do to stop  
such school violence, Clinton said he wanted to give the Colorado 
community -- ``an open wound'' -- time to grieve. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight, I think the American people ought to be thinking  
about those folks in Littleton,'' he said. ``Tomorrow and in the 
days ahead, we'll have a little more time to kind of gather 
ourselves and our determination and go back at this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton had been scheduled to celebrate Texas' new  
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on Wednesday and to star at 
political fund-raisers in Austin and Houston. The president ``felt 
it was best to remain here in Washington,'' press secretary Joe 
Lockhart said Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	It was six months ago that Clinton -- together with Vice  
President Al Gore, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and close to 
800 educators and law-enforcement officials -- held a splashy White 
House conference on school violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night, after hours of nonstop television coverage of the  
dramatic events in suburban Denver, Clinton acknowledged the nation 
has made little progress. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know there are a lot of kids out there who have access to  
weapons -- and apparently more than guns, here -- and who build up 
these grievances in their own mind and who are not being reached,'' 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And it's not just Littleton.''  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday at an economic announcement, Clinton offered  
prayers to the students, parents and faculty of Columbine High but 
said he would not comment extensively until after officials were 
certain they'd heard the last of the gunshots inside the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Police at the scene said two gunmen on a ``suicide mission''  
shot and killed as many as 25 people inside the school and then 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	The president called attention to a spate of school shootings a  
year ago when he traveled last summer to Springfield, Ore., and 
visited the Thurston High School cafeteria. There, police said, a 
15-year-old pupil opened fire, killing two classmates and wounding 
22 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton followed up that emotional visit with the White House  
conference in October. 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered Education Secretary Richard Riley and Attorney  
General Janet Reno then to work with school officials and law 
enforcement authorities on developing an ``early warning guide'' 
that might help prevent the kind of youth rage that erupted in 
deadly -- and high-profile -- school gunfire in Springfield, West 
Paducah, Ky.; Edinboro, Pa.; Jonesboro Ark.; and Pearl, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton recalled those tragedies as he tried to  
console Littleton. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rest of us have a responsibility to do everything we can  
to make sure this doesn't make 1999 a year like last year, that we 
don't have another rash of this, that we really can be more 
effective in preventing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was asked if he stood by his administration's contention  
last October that students are still safer sitting in a classroom 
than they are walking down the street. 
</P>
<P>
	``Statistically, for all the whole 53 million kids in our  
schools it's true,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	But at Columbine High, where the attackers were apparently armed  
with hand grenades, explosives, and high-powered weapons, ``it 
obviously wasn't true there. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was obviously the most dangerous place in Colorado  
today.''

<HEADLINE> Mystery Surrounds Ng's Nature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The same jurors who concluded that  
Charles Ng was a vicious serial killer are now being asked to view 
him as a gentle philosopher and caring friend who deserves to 
escape execution. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final days of the penalty phase, Ng's lawyers have  
presented a litany of testimonials to his good character from a 
parade of witnesses, some of whose roles have bordered on the 
downright bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no surprise that family members would talk of Ng's abused  
childhood in Hong Kong. But more than a dozen other witnesses 
called by Deputy Public Defender William Kelley threw yet another 
twist in a trial that has become one of California's longest and 
most expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Some were upstanding citizens: tough former Marines, brawny  
prison guards and a 66-year-old woman who was briefly Ng's lover. 
Together, they spoke of the 38-year-old defendant in almost 
reverential tones. 
</P>
<P>
	None seemed more a surprise than Betty Kirkendall, a  
well-dressed, well-spoken woman who traveled from Cleveland, Okla., 
with her daughter. She told of forming a friendship with Ng through 
her efforts at prison ministry in 1983, a year before the killings 
began. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kirkendall said her son was murdered, she was having  
marital problems, had been raped and had no one to communicate with 
when she began writing letters to Ng, who was imprisoned at 
Leavenworth, Kan., for weapons theft while serving in the Marine 
Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	To her surprise, she said, Ng wrote supportive letters and sent  
gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did he make you feel loved?'' asked defense attorney Lewis  
Clapp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes,'' she replied.  
</P>
<P>
	When Ng was released, they decided to meet, she recalled. He  
came to the home of a friend in Shawnee, Okla.; they met and the 
next day she picked him up in her car and drove to a motel. After 
they had sex, Mrs. Kirkendall said she never saw him again. 
</P>
<P>
	Another supporter who testified was Chuck Farnham of San Jose,  
Calif., who wrote to Ng a year ago about their common hobby of 
origami, the Japanese art of paper folding. He said they began 
talking by phone and Ng comforted him over the death of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the people I know I was surprised that with all his  
problems he had this genuine concern about what I was going 
through,'' Farnham said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which convicted him Feb. 24 of killing six men, three  
women and two baby boys, also has seen Ng's darker side. 
Prosecutors showed them videotapes of Ng and his co-conspirator, 
survivalist Leonard Lake, tormenting bound, terrified women who 
were later murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	They saw, as well, cartoons drawn by Ng in prison -- crude  
pictures of babies being smashed, drowned, fried in a wok or put in 
a microwave oven. 
</P>
<P>
	These were in contrast to sweet, carefully drawn greeting cards  
shown by his friends -- valentines and images of angels and animals. 
</P>
<P>
	No witness was more effusive in his praise of Ng than convicted  
rapist and murderer Lance Blanchard who said Ng's counseling in the 
philosophy of Taoism turned him away from violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not harm another human being,'' Blanchard said in  
videotaped testimony, telling how Ng guided him through the 
principles of Taoism in prison. ``I have learned to, no matter 
what, give respect to everybody.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Boxer Ayala Released From Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- ``The Little Bull'' is a distant memory,  
even for Tony Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
	He once seemed destined for superstardom, but his promising  
boxing career crashed in a night of madness. Images of his 
flamboyance and devastating speed stayed locked behind bars with 
him, along with thoughts of a terrible crime he can never forget. 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala walked out of a New Jersey prison Tuesday after serving 16  
years for rape. As he ventured into daylight and freedom, Ayala was 
bombarded by thoughts of a comeback and overwhelmed by disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kept expecting an officer to come to me and say they made a  
mistake,'' said Ayala, spending his first hours of freedom with his 
wife at the Pennsylvania home of his adviser, Brian Raditz. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's almost like a dream. I've said that to her a number of  
times: `We made it. We got through this.' It's like a long 
struggle, a struggle to keep going. Sometimes it seemed like the 
end would never come, and when it happens it's hard to believe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala, now 36, hasn't fought since he was a 19-year-old junior  
middleweight with a 22-0 record with 19 knockouts. But his chance 
to be the Oscar De La Hoya of his day was ruined by drugs and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early morning hours of New Year's Day 1983, Ayala  
returned to his Paterson, N.J., home after a night out with his 
wife, Lisa Paez. She went to bed. He said he was going to watch 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, stoked by heroin and booze, he went to the home of a  
female neighbor and raped her. At the time, he was on probation for 
beating a woman in the restroom of a San Antonio drive-in theater 
in 1980, and for breaking into a San Antonio home in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole focus was finding out what it was that caused me to  
behave in the manner that I did and fix myself,'' said Ayala, who 
was released for good behavior less than half way through his 
35-year sentence. ``The fact that I committed this crime is 
something I will have to live with the rest of my life. It's not 
ever going to be forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala spent much of his sentence attacking the demons that  
nearly ruined his life and that of his victim, training his mind 
and soul with the intensity that once honed his body for the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	With the counseling and friendship of Raditz, Ayala finally was  
ready to begin training his body again. He says he weighs 175 
pounds -- 21 pounds over the junior middleweight limit -- and can do 
300 pullups, 300 pushups, 300 dips, 2,000 crunches and run eight 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, he looks phenomenal,'' Raditz said. ``He's  
probably in better shape now than he was when he was fighting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paez struggled with her husband's crime and absence, leaving him  
several years ago. But she was there to lead him out of Bayside 
State Prison in Leesburg, N.J. The couple are planning to remarry 
and perhaps have children. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took a deep breath, let it out and said, `Let's go,''' Paez  
said. ``We walked through the doors hand-in-hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a new beginning. It was a very hard walk. But I've always  
been in love with Tony, and I was always trying to replace him with 
someone else. It just wasn't happening. I wasn't running from him, 
because I loved him. I was running from a situation that was just 
unbearable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayala's parents and two older brothers also were there to escort  
him out of prison. His father, also Tony, will train him again if 
he makes it back into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Financially, Ayala needs to work. As with many troubled  
fighters, boxing probably will give him a few easy pay days. If he 
is going to make it, Ayala will have to avoid the problems former 
heavyweight champion Mike Tyson has had since he got out of prison 
for rape. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boxing is a way I could give to my family what I always wanted  
to give to them, but unfortunately was too stupid when I was young 
to give them,'' Ayala said. ``I want to finish some unfinished 
business with boxing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Ayala tended to the unfinished business of his life.  
Laughter, chatter and a dog's barking could be heard in the 
background as he talked on the phone at Raditz's home in the 
Philadelphia suburb of Huntingdon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	The sounds of a speedbag could be next.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's already succeeded,'' Raditz said. ``He's dealt with his  
horrible, horrible conflicts. He's very remorseful about how he 
behaved. He is a winner already, whether he goes back to fighting 
or, honestly, whatever he sets his mind to.''

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin Loses $87M in 1Q </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BETHESDA, Md. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. lost $87 million or  
23 cents a share in the first quarter as a $355 million accounting 
charge dragged down earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the charge, which the company attributed to start-up  
costs for business activities, and a $74 million gain on the sale 
of stock, the company would have earned $194 million, or 51 cents 
per share, in line with Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, Lockheed earned $269 million, or  
71 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenues edged lower to $6.19 billion from $6.22  
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although this quarter's results were on plan, they were not as  
good as we'd like them to be, and we remain focused on the 
operational and performance issues that create uncertainty for our 
customers and shareholders,'' said Vance Coffman, chairman and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin is one of the nation's largest defense  
contractors. It is engaged in the research, design, development, 
manufacture and integration of advanced-technology systems, 
products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Lockheed Martin closed down 75 cents to $39 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Importer Goes Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Tamexco, an import-export company that was  
at the center of Vietnam's biggest corruption trial, has been 
declared bankrupt effective May 1, a court official said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's creditors have 30 days to appeal the decision,  
which was made on March 31, the official said. There was no 
explanation why announcement of the decision was delayed. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy is the latest chapter in a scandal in which 20  
people, including business executives, bankers and government 
officials, were charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Four were sentenced to death at a trial in January 1997, and  
three of them were executed by firing squad a year later. The 
fourth was pardoned for contributions his family has made to the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamexco, the commercial arm of the Communist Party of Tan Binh  
District in Ho Chi Minh City, initially filed for bankruptcy in 
March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy petition was approved because Tamexco suffered  
from ``serious losses'' and ``is unable to pay its debts,'' the 
court official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamexco's former director allegedly spent some $27 million on  
bribery, embezzlement and gambling, then covered the losses with 
loans from state-owned banks on overvalued collateral. He was 
brought to trial as part of a government crackdown on corruption.

<HEADLINE> Nine-Year-Old Loves Trash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA MADRE, Calif. (AP) -- Trash talk hasn't been a waste of  
time for Kevin Inciyaki. At age 9, it's landed him notice and a 
job. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin likes garbage and garbage containers and garbage trucks  
and garbage books and garbage videos. Early photos of him in the 
family scrapbook show him inspecting trash cans at Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a photo collection of ``garbage trucks of the world''  
taken for him by family friends on trips abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been garbage since he was 2-years-old -- you have no idea  
what it's like having a child who has a passion for trash,'' said 
Kevin's mother, Marsha Inciyaki. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin doesn't know what got his interested in the dirty side of  
life. Classmates at Bethany Christian School ``think it's kinda 
weird,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hawaii, his brother wanted to go snorkeling, and when we  
asked Kevin what he wanted to do, he said, 'Follow the garbage 
trucks,''' Mrs. Inciyaki said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sierra Madre public works officials who knew how much Kevin  
likes trash recommended him for a job with the University of 
California, Los Angeles. Now he's running a worm farm and 
collecting worm information as part of a waste management survey in 
Sierra Madre and Monrovia.

<HEADLINE> NFL Eyes Coliseum for LA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The NFL wants to put its 32nd franchise in  
the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	That does not guarantee, however, that pro football will return  
to Los Angeles. Still to be determined is an ownership group for 
the new team, which must satisfy other NFL owners with its stadium 
and financing plans. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced the league's  
intentions today at a news conference in front of the Coliseum. 
Eleven team owners, members of the league's expansion committee, 
were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has not had a pro football team since the  
Rams, who played at the Coliseum before moving to Anaheim, left for 
St. Louis and the Raiders returned to Oakland, both after the 1994 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some NFL owners who have opposed putting a team back in the Los  
Angeles Coliseum apparently have unpleasant memories of their teams 
playing the Raiders there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there were owners who had their teams play against the  
Raiders here a few years ago who felt that there was a safety 
issue, a rowdiness issue,'' Mayor Richard Riordan said after he and 
other civic and business leaders met Monday with the expansion 
committee. ``Those are the ones who have changed their minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Raiders played at the Coliseum before moving back to  
Oakland, their crowds tended to be rougher than those at most other 
NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners were very, very positive about Los Angeles,''  
Riordan said. ``A couple of them mentioned that they were negative 
until they visited our city recently. I feel very confident we'll 
get a team, and I feel very confident we'll get a team at the 
Coliseum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum, which would be gutted inside and rebuilt, became  
the only viable choice in Los Angeles after Michael Ovitz bowed out 
of the Carson proposal last week to endorse the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan said that, among other subjects discussed at Monday's  
meeting, were parking -- ``They require 20,000 parking spaces'' -- 
and TV blackouts -- ``It's very, very important to the league that 
there are no blackouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who will own the new team remains a large question.  
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, chairman of the  
expansion committee, spoke glowingly of Ovitz, although Richardson 
did not rule out Ed Roski, who headed the drive to get an NFL team 
for the Coliseum, and partner Eli Broad as team owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, a developer, holds exclusive rights to any NFL deal with  
the Coliseum, but said he won't stand in the way if the league 
wants to hold an auction for the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	His exclusive rights would be relinquished if he were reimbursed  
for his expenses -- capped at $5 million -- incurred while seeking 
the league's franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've told them (the NFL) all along that we're not going to  
stand in the way of football in LA,'' Roski said. ``We would 
suggest a couple of things, local ownership, and reimburse us. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose was to bring NFL football back to LA, and  
the Coliseum and we would like to be a bidder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roski spearheaded the building of the new Staples Center  
downtown, and also gave the New Coliseum proposal life. Broad, who 
could provide solid financial backing for an NFL team, joined the 
Coliseum efforts later. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners have seemed interested in having Ovitz involved in  
any deal with the Coliseum. Tagliabue called the Hollywood 
deal-maker a ``visionary,'' and implied the league could benefit 
from Ovitz's experience in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no guarantee that Los Angeles will even get a team. The  
owners, well aware that the area represents the nation's 
second-largest TV market, voted 29-2 last month to spurn Robert 
McNair's Houston bid and award the franchise to the Los Angeles 
area on a conditional basis. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, suburban Carson also was in the running.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL gave Los Angeles until Sept. 15 to put together an  
ownership and stadium package. If a deal can't be reached, the new 
team, which would begin play in 2002, probably will go to Houston.

<HEADLINE> Senators Must Solve the Hasek Puzzle / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- The Ottawa Senators reward for winning  
the Northeast Divison and the No. 2 seed in the Eastern Conference: 
A first-round matchup with all-world goalie Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Goals will be at a premium when Ottawa faces Hasek's Buffalo  
Sabres in Game 1 of their quarterfinal series Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Senators have the only goaltender with a better  
goals-against average than Hasek -- Ron Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played a lot against Dominik Hasek,'' said Senators  
winger Shawn McEachern. ``We aren't expecting any high-scoring 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All five games between the teams went into overtime this season,  
with the Senators winning 3-2 on Dec. 30 in Buffalo and the other 
four ending in ties. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3-2 win was also the only time one team managed to score  
three goals. Only 15 total goals were scored by both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a battle,'' said Senators defenseman Wade  
Redden. ``But that's the price we have to pay to advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two clubs are meeting in the playoffs for the second time in  
three years, with Buffalo eliminating Ottawa from its first-ever 
modern-day playoff appearance two seasons ago on Derek Plante's 
Game 7 overtime goal against Tugnutt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always been a great intensity against them,'' said  
Senators wing Daniel Alfredsson. ``We can't just focus on their 
goaltending. They have a good team in front of him as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfredsson says there is a way to beat the Dominator.  
</P>
<P>
	``You have to make it tough for him to see the puck,'' said  
Alfredsson. ``We know we have to shoot a lot and be there for the 
rebounds. The main thing is you can't think he'll be there to stop 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek played all five games against Ottawa during the regular  
season, surrendering eight goals and three in the final three 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's their best player,'' Alfredsson said. ``But he's not  
their only player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tugnutt, who had a GAA of 1.79 this season, doesn't think his  
club should be too focused on Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be concerned with the way, the style of hockey that  
they play,'' he said, adding that both teams play a tight, 
defensive style of hockey. ``It's not just Dominik Hasek we have to 
beat, although he is a major part of that team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the Senators were just 3-2-5 in their final 10  
regular season games, coach Jacques Martin isn't worried about his 
club's lack of intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're well prepared,'' Martin said. ``We're a team  
looking forward to starting the playoffs, we're anxious.''

<HEADLINE>  Chebet, Roba Win Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Joseph Chebet found the secret of going from  
perennial runnerup to champion: train harder. 
</P>
<P>
	It might take a lot more than that for someone other than a  
Kenyan to win the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet became the ninth straight runner from Kenya to win the  
race Monday, and three of his countrymen also finished in the top 
10. At one point, though, Ecuador's Silvio Guerra held a huge lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra said he wasn't intimidated by the threat that loomed  
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get used to being around just Kenyans,'' he said. ``I  
prepare to run with Kenyans and African guys because they're the 
best in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Chebet, who picked up the $80,000 first prize in the race's  
103rd running, may be the best of them all at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In his six career marathons, he won his first two and finished  
second in the next three -- two in New York City and one in Boston 
last year -- before beating Guerra by 27 seconds in a time of 2 
hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds. Two of his second-place finishes were 
by three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, it was my first time in Boston,'' Chebet said.  
``This year I tried to change my training from last year. I tried 
to train harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, he's not completely ready,'' said his coach, Dr.  
Gabriele Rosa. ``He decided to train longer now and he was more 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While five different Kenyans have won the last nine races,  
Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia has dominated the women's division by 
herself. On Monday, she became the second woman to win three 
straight Boston Marathons, matching the accomplishment of Uta 
Pippig of Germany from 1994 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And she did it easily, with a margin of 2 minutes, 26 seconds  
over Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland. The winning time was 
2:23:25. Last year's victory margin was 3:56. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only difference is last year I had a knee problem, but  
this year I was physically good,'' Roba said. ``I was expecting a 
better time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few runners could have run a much better time than Sun Yingjie  
of China did early in the women's race as she set a blistering 
pace. But she lost the lead just past the midpoint, leaving Roba 
and Catherine Ndereba of Kenya running together. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba began to pull away about 17 miles into the 26-mile,  
385-yard race. At one point, two spectators carrying green, yellow 
and red Ethiopian flags ran behind her. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave me a boost and I started running with a new pace,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spotlight in the women's race also fell on Lynn Jennings,  
the three-time world cross-country champion from Newmarket, N.H., 
who was making her official marathon debut at age 38. 
</P>
<P>
	She hoped to run faster than her 12th-place time of 2:38:37,  
``but I'm glad I qualified for the Olympic trials,'' Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did better than another outstanding runner from New England.  
Bill Rodgers, who has won the Boston and New York City marathons 
four times each, failed to finish in his first competitive marathon 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 51, he was hoping to break the American course record for a  
runner older than 50, 2:31:34, held by Norm Green. But he dropped 
out because of dehydration with about six miles to go on an 
unseasonably warm day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not absolutely on, the marathon will really get you,  
especially if you're pushing hard`'' said Rodgers, who felt tired 
during the week preceding the race. ``Next time I run Boston I 
think I'm going to be a back-of-the-pack runner. I'm going to have 
fun out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's field of 12,797 was the second largest ever in Boston,  
exceeded only by the 38,708 official entrants in the centennial 
race in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wheelchair competitions, it was more of the same as Franz  
Nietlispach of Switzerland, in a time of 1:21:36, and Louise 
Sauvage of Australia, in 1:42:23, each won for the third 
consecutive year. For the second straight year, the women's race 
was so close between Sauvage and seven-time champion Jean Driscoll 
of Champaign, Ill., that both had the same official time. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no such drama in the men's and women's divisions as  
neither winner was threatened over the last four miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba, the 1996 Olympic champion, was followed by 1997 New York  
City champion Rochat-Moser at 2:25:51, two-time Olympic medalist 
Yuko Arimori of Japan at 2:26:39 and South African Colleen de Reuck 
at 2:27:53. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra led by as much as a quarter-mile before Chebet took the  
lead with about four miles left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to push hard, but after 20 miles, I started to get  
blisters on my feet and slowed down,'' said Guerra, who was seeking 
to become the first South American winner since Colombia's Elviro 
Mejia in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	That just wasn't going to happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Not with Kenyans running, even though one of them, defending  
champion Moses Tanui, dropped out near the 23-mile mark, apparently 
with leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra finished second at 2:10:18 and was followed by two South  
Africans -- Frank Pooe at 2:11:37 and Abner Chipu at 2:12:45. 
Kenya's John Kagwe, who beat Chebet at New York in 1997 and 1998, 
wound up fifth for the second straight year at 2:13:57. The top 
American finisher, Joe LeMay of Danbury, Conn., was 13th in 
2:16:11. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other streak of nine winners from one country came when  
Americans won from 1916 through 1925 with few foreigners in the 
field. There was no individual competition in 1918, only a team 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Kenyans are dominant.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have the best professional distance runners in the  
world,'' Rodgers said before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet is one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the world is trying to catch the Kenyans,''  
Chebet said, ``but they can't.''

<HEADLINE> Three Sweepstakes Promoters Sued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Three sweepstakes promoters and two celebrities  
were accused Tuesday of deceptive marketing in what was described 
as the most comprehensive lawsuit in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The three cases were filed by Washington state Attorney General  
Christine Gregoire in King County Superior Court against Publishers 
Clearing House of Port Washington, N.Y., American Family 
Enterprises -- better known as American Family Publishers -- of 
Jersey City, N.J., and Time Inc. of New York, owner of Guaranteed 
and Bonded. 
</P>
<P>
	Company representatives said they had not seen the litigation  
but denied any illegality. 
</P>
<P>
	Each case seeks damages of $2,000 per violation, potentially  
millions of dollars, and restitution that could run to additional 
millions, Gregoire said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These companies have become masters at creating a web of  
deception,'' she said. ``The headlines, the words, everything about 
these mailers are calculated to get people to buy products they 
wouldn't otherwise buy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In one instance, Gregoire said, neither she nor her husband  
could readily determine that they were not guaranteed of winning 
$833,000. 
</P>
<P>
	She accused all three companies of falsely suggesting that  
purchases increase a consumer's chance of winning, concealing odds 
of 200 million to 1 against winning a big prize, conveying a false 
sense of urgency for responses and wrongfully indicating that the 
mailings have been endorsed or approved by state and federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also named as defendants in the case against American Family  
Publishers were television announcer Ed McMahon and Dick Clark, 
host of the TV show ``American Bandstand'' for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1998, American Family Publishers promised to stop using  
wording like ``You're our newest winner'' in promotions, to fully 
disclose contest terms and odds, and pay $50,000 each to 25 states, 
including Washington. The suit accuses the company of failing to 
meet those terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeanne Meyer, an American Family Publishers spokeswoman, said  
the company exceeded the terms of the agreement, meeting state 
concerns ``in an aggressive, responsible and forthright manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five states -- Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, West Virginia and  
South Carolina -- rejected the settlement and have suits pending. 
Another suit, stemming from a case filed in 1993, was filed 
recently in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin, Indiana and Connecticut also have cases pending  
against Publishers Clearing House. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Irving, director of consumer affairs at Publishers  
Clearing House, defended his company. ``We run a fair and honest 
sweepstakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant attorney general William Nicholson said he knew of no  
other suits pending against Guaranteed and Bonded. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney general task forces representing 43 states are  
negotiating with at least eight sweepstakes companies, including 
Publishers Clearing House and Time, assistant attorney general 
Regina Cullen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Time spokesman Peter Costiglio said they were ``surprised and  
disappointed'' by the suit since Washington state has been involved 
in those talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been cooperating with that inquiry for several  
months.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Supports Award for Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rosa Parks, who stoked the civil rights  
movement by refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus, would 
receive Congress' most prestigious civilian honor under legislation 
sent to the White House on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said he would sign it, calling the award ``a  
fitting honor for a true American hero, whose act of courage helped 
to change the lives of so many people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 424-1 to award the 86-year-old Alabama native  
the Congressional Gold Medal. The Senate passed the measure Monday 
on an 86-0 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats lauded Mrs. Parks, who was awarded the  
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996, as an American heroine. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is an ordinary citizen with extraordinary courage,'' Rep.  
Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., said. ``She had the fortitude to claim for 
herself the most ordinary, the most basic of civil rights -- to be 
treated fairly and equally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said that ``one, simple, defining act''  
by Parks began a nonviolent revolution in the South that led to the 
end of segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rosa Parks taught me and an entire generation the power that  
one individual can have in standing up for what is right and for 
what is just,'' added Lewis, a civil rights veteran who was beaten 
bloody during protest marches in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks watched the debate on television while traveling in  
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Parks is very excited to have this honor,'' said Anita  
Peek, executive director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute 
for Self-Development. Mrs. Parks co-founded the nonprofit in 1987 
in Detroit, where she now lives, to benefit young people. 
</P>
<P>
	A seamstress in Montgomery, Ala., Mrs. Parks was arrested in  
December 1955 for refusing to give her seat on a segregated city 
bus to a white man. The arrest led to a yearlong bus boycott by 
blacks that endured until the Supreme Court ruled the city's bus 
segregation law was unconstitutional, and it was changed. The Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr., then a local minister, led the boycott.

<HEADLINE>  Chebet, Roba Win Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Joseph Chebet found the secret of going from  
perennial runnerup to champion: train harder. 
</P>
<P>
	It might take a lot more than that for someone other than a  
Kenyan to win the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet became the ninth straight runner from Kenya to win the  
race Monday, and three of his countrymen also finished in the top 
10. At one point, though, Ecuador's Silvio Guerra held a huge lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra said he wasn't intimidated by the threat that loomed  
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get used to being around just Kenyans,'' he said. ``I  
prepare to run with Kenyans and African guys because they're the 
best in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Chebet, who picked up the $80,000 first prize in the race's  
103rd running, may be the best of them all at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In his six career marathons, he won his first two and finished  
second in the next three -- two in New York City and one in Boston 
last year -- before beating Guerra by 27 seconds in a time of 2 
hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds. Two of his second-place finishes were 
by three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, it was my first time in Boston,'' Chebet said.  
``This year I tried to change my training from last year. I tried 
to train harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, he's not completely ready,'' said his coach, Dr.  
Gabriele Rosa. ``He decided to train longer now and he was more 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While five different Kenyans have won the last nine races,  
Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia has dominated the women's division by 
herself. On Monday, she became the second woman to win three 
straight Boston Marathons, matching the accomplishment of Uta 
Pippig of Germany from 1994 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And she did it easily, with a margin of 2 minutes, 26 seconds  
over Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland. The winning time was 
2:23:25. Last year's victory margin was 3:56. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only difference is last year I had a knee problem, but  
this year I was physically good,'' Roba said. ``I was expecting a 
better time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few runners could have run a much better time than Sun Yingjie  
of China did early in the women's race as she set a blistering 
pace. But she lost the lead just past the midpoint, leaving Roba 
and Catherine Ndereba of Kenya running together. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba began to pull away about 17 miles into the 26-mile,  
385-yard race. At one point, two spectators carrying green, yellow 
and red Ethiopian flags ran behind her. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave me a boost and I started running with a new pace,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spotlight in the women's race also fell on Lynn Jennings,  
the three-time world cross-country champion from Newmarket, N.H., 
who was making her official marathon debut at age 38. 
</P>
<P>
	She hoped to run faster than her 12th-place time of 2:38:37,  
``but I'm glad I qualified for the Olympic trials,'' Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did better than another outstanding runner from New England.  
Bill Rodgers, who has won the Boston and New York City marathons 
four times each, failed to finish in his first competitive marathon 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 51, he was hoping to break the American course record for a  
runner older than 50, 2:31:34, held by Norm Green. But he dropped 
out because of dehydration with about six miles to go on an 
unseasonably warm day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not absolutely on, the marathon will really get you,  
especially if you're pushing hard`'' said Rodgers, who felt tired 
during the week preceding the race. ``Next time I run Boston I 
think I'm going to be a back-of-the-pack runner. I'm going to have 
fun out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's field of 12,797 was the second largest ever in Boston,  
exceeded only by the 38,708 official entrants in the centennial 
race in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wheelchair competitions, it was more of the same as Franz  
Nietlispach of Switzerland, in a time of 1:21:36, and Louise 
Sauvage of Australia, in 1:42:23, each won for the third 
consecutive year. For the second straight year, the women's race 
was so close between Sauvage and seven-time champion Jean Driscoll 
of Champaign, Ill., that both had the same official time. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no such drama in the men's and women's divisions as  
neither winner was threatened over the last four miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba, the 1996 Olympic champion, was followed by 1997 New York  
City champion Rochat-Moser at 2:25:51, two-time Olympic medalist 
Yuko Arimori of Japan at 2:26:39 and South African Colleen de Reuck 
at 2:27:53. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra led by as much as a quarter-mile before Chebet took the  
lead with about four miles left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to push hard, but after 20 miles, I started to get  
blisters on my feet and slowed down,'' said Guerra, who was seeking 
to become the first South American winner since Colombia's Elviro 
Mejia in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	That just wasn't going to happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Not with Kenyans running, even though one of them, defending  
champion Moses Tanui, dropped out near the 23-mile mark, apparently 
with leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra finished second at 2:10:18 and was followed by two South  
Africans -- Frank Pooe at 2:11:37 and Abner Chipu at 2:12:45. 
Kenya's John Kagwe, who beat Chebet at New York in 1997 and 1998, 
wound up fifth for the second straight year at 2:13:57. The top 
American finisher, Joe LeMay of Danbury, Conn., was 13th in 
2:16:11. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other streak of nine winners from one country came when  
Americans won from 1916 through 1925 with few foreigners in the 
field. There was no individual competition in 1918, only a team 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Kenyans are dominant.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have the best professional distance runners in the  
world,'' Rodgers said before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet is one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the world is trying to catch the Kenyans,''  
Chebet said, ``but they can't.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Rebounding From Poor Day / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology stocks  
showing signs of recovery from Monday's rout but blue chips losing 
more ground. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 34.93 at 10,405.60 after having fallen 53 points on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was up 32.02 at 2,377.63 after  
plunging 5.6 percent Monday amid a sharp selloff in 
Internet-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile technology stocks that took big hits Monday were  
mostly higher. Microsoft led the Nasdaq trading in volume and was 
up 1 33/64 at 82 33/64. Dell, Intel and Cisco were all higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares, which were pounded sharply lower on Monday,  
were recovering too, with Amazon.com up 9 1/16 at 168. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the tech group will stay down. This is just a  
normal pause to refresh,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market 
strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc., St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;  
Co., in Kansas City, Mo., said he was encouraged at signs of gentle 
recovery in tech stocks after Monday's debacle. Investors embarked 
on the day expecting a recovery in tech shares, so they placed some 
bets in that stock sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``When tech stocks cratered yesterday, investors in general had  
someplace else to go,'' Belski said. ``While the vim and vigor is 
not present on this upside bounce that was there in other 
recoveries in the tech sector, it's good that people have 
alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While technology stocks recovered, industrial shares, which have  
been popular purchases for more than a week, were lower today. One 
of the biggest decliners was United Technologies, which fell 4 1/4 to 
140 3/4 despite reporting better-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in  
Charlotte, N.C., said attributed some of the blue-chip decline to 
profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is also a little bit of apprehension out there,'' he  
said. ``The fall in technology stocks over the last few sessions 
has created caution elsewhere in the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a transition period and no one is sure what is  
coming next,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 477 million shares, 
down from 462 million shares on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.94 at 1,300.42, the  
NYSE composite index was up 3.55 at 619.43, and the Amex composite 
index was unchanged at 735.11.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys' Newton May Be Gone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Guard Nate Newton has beaten the odds for 13 years  
but recent developments at Valley Ranch suggest he has seen his 
last days with the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Newton has been plagued by injury the past several seasons, a  
reason why Dallas drafted two more offensive lineman and signed 
free agent center Mark Stepnoski recently. 
</P>
<P>
	This would leave only about $400,000 for Newton who made  
$700,000 last year. His agent, Jim Neader, has suggested Newton 
will shop his wares to other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not closing the door to his coming back,'' Neader said,  
``but he may be forced to go elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys won't say if big Nate is in their plans.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be making that announcement in a couple of weeks,''  
Dallas coach Chan Gailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest NFL draft, the Cowboys took tight end Mike Lucky  
of Arizona and offensive guard Kelvin Garmon of Baylor with their 
two seventh-round picks. The additional help for the offensive 
line, which was targeted with Saturday's second-round selection of 
West Virginia's Solomon Page, could have made Newton expendable. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said earlier this year he wasn't sure  
Newton can be a starter in his 13th season, even though the 
37-year-old offensive lineman was just voted to the Pro Bowl for 
the sixth time. 
</P>
<P>
	A fixture in the Cowboys' offensive line since 1986, Newton has  
spent the past 12 years as a starter after one year as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point we will sit down with Nate and talk,'' Jones  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas coaches have discussed putting Flozell Adams at left  
tackle and moving Larry Allen back to guard, where he would join 
Everett McIver.

<HEADLINE> Waitress Must Share $10M Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- A former waitress who won a $10 million  
jackpot with a lottery ticket left as a tip has been ordered to 
share the money with four co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Tuesday decided against Tonda Dickerson, 28, who  
denied that she had agreed to split any winnings with her Waffle 
House co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-workers had also received lottery tickets as tips and  
testified that they and Mrs. Dickerson had a share-the-wealth plan. 
A couple who regularly dine at the Waffle House in Grand Bay 
testified that Mrs. Dickerson told them of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson, who had turned down a settlement offer that  
would have given her $3 million of the Florida jackpot, left court 
without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Her former co-workers were jubilant.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a 5-year-old girl and she's going to get a new  
collection of toys,'' said Jackie Fairley, 21. ``I want a new 
wardrobe and a new car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A beaming Sandra Deno, 45, said: ``I might work two days a week.  
I don't really have any hard feelings toward Tonda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Kendall said he will decide how the money will be  
divided after consulting with attorneys and Florida lottery 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson's attorney, Dwight Reid, said he expects the five  
will share equally. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson was given the lottery ticket on March 7 by a  
breakfast regular at the Waffle House, Edward Seward Jr., who said 
he wanted only a new pickup truck if the ticket won.

<HEADLINE> FCC Wants Boost for Broadcasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- With increased competition from cable TV,  
satellite TV and the Internet, broadcasters should be given some 
leeway to own more TV and radio stations, the nation's top airwaves 
regulator said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that we can afford to keep broadcasters in the  
Dark Ages of black-and-white era rules because the world has 
changed,'' Bill Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission, told broadcasters at the industry's annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the changing realities of today's marketplace, you do  
need the flexibility to seize these opportunities so you can be a 
player in the information age,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters say they need regulatory relief to better compete  
against other cable TV, satellite TV, Internet and other media and 
entertainment providers, which aren't subject to the same ownership 
restrictions. Owning more local TV and radio stations in the same 
market would produce business efficiencies that would allow 
broadcasters to offer new programs and services, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
	Deregulation opponents say allowing companies to own more local  
stations would threaten editorial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Commerce  
Committee and GOP presidential contender, said he plans to hold 
hearings next month on broadcast ownership and on ways to increase 
minority ownership of the airwaves. McCain, who supports giving 
broadcasters freedom from ownership rules, made his remarks in a 
taped speech beamed into the convention by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard asked the industry to work with the FCC to come up with  
a plan to ease rules limiting the number of local TV and radio 
stations that a single company can control. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan, he said, must balance broadcasters' needs with the  
commission's desire to make sure listeners and viewers continue to 
have diverse sources of news and entertainment. The industry and 
the FCC have been at loggerheads on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``My challenge this year is for you to join with me in crafting  
common-sense ownership rule relief,'' Kennard said. ``First and 
foremost, we've got to get this behind us. We've got to bring these 
ownership rule proceedings to a close. They have been pending for 
far too long. There's too much uncertainty in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC wants to produce a final plan in a couple of months, an  
agency official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard didn't specify what such a plan would do or whether it  
would resemble a proposal offered by commission staff last year. 
</P>
<P>
	That proposal would have made it easier for some broadcasters to  
own more media properties but also would have required others to 
divest some stations. Many broadcasters and key Republican 
lawmakers in Congress opposed the plan, saying it doesn't give 
broadcasters enough regulatory relief. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also said he intends to offer legislation to bolster  
airwaves ownership by revising the now-defunct ``tax certificate,'' 
which gave a tax break to broadcasters who sold stations to 
minorities. Congress repealed that provision several years ago, 
citing abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 telecommunications law eased some restrictions but  
required the commission to consider changing, or even eliminating, 
other limits because of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rules prohibit a single company from owning more than one  
local TV station in a given market or from owning a TV station and 
a radio station in the same market unless the FCC grants a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The major broadcast networks, meanwhile, want the FCC to  
eliminate or loosen a rule limiting them from owning stations that 
reach more than 35 percent of all TV viewers -- something their 
affiliates oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some say we should just eliminate all of these rules, just  
sweep them away, get rid of everything,'' Kennard said. ``I don't 
think that's the right answer, frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another crucial matter for broadcasters is whether the FCC will  
continue to let companies enter into local marketing agreements, or 
LMAs. They allow one TV station to operate another TV station in 
the same market, but not own it.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Open Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures advanced early today on  
the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for rains that will delay 
spring plantings. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans found the most support on continuing rains in  
the Midwest, which have increasingly stalled fieldwork and could 
lead to smaller acreage planted. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also were supported by a lack of selling by farmers in  
Brazil and the United States, which boosted cash market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose after the U.S. Agriculture Department  
reported Monday that winter wheat crop conditions had declined, 
although most of the gains came largely on the strength of the corn 
and soybean markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 3 cents to $2.66 1/4 a bushel; May  
corn rose 2 1/2 cents to $2.23 a bushel; May oats rose 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.22 a bushel; May soybeans rose 3 1/2 cents to $4.91 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and lean hogs were mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange, while pork bellies retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .45 cent to 62.47 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose .37 cent to 71.67 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .30 cent to 55.52 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .75 
cent to 55.17 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> NFL Eyes Coliseum for LA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The NFL wants to put its 32nd franchise in  
the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	That does not guarantee, however, that pro football will return  
to Los Angeles. Still to be determined is an ownership group for 
the new team, which must satisfy other NFL owners with its stadium 
and financing plans. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced the league's  
intentions today at a news conference in front of the Coliseum. 
Eleven team owners, members of the league's expansion committee, 
were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has not had a pro football team since the  
Rams, who played at the Coliseum before moving to Anaheim, left for 
St. Louis and the Raiders returned to Oakland, both after the 1994 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some NFL owners who have opposed putting a team back in the Los  
Angeles Coliseum apparently have unpleasant memories of their teams 
playing the Raiders there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there were owners who had their teams play against the  
Raiders here a few years ago who felt that there was a safety 
issue, a rowdiness issue,'' Mayor Richard Riordan said after he and 
other civic and business leaders met Monday with the expansion 
committee. ``Those are the ones who have changed their minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Raiders played at the Coliseum before moving back to  
Oakland, their crowds tended to be rougher than those at most other 
NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners were very, very positive about Los Angeles,''  
Riordan said. ``A couple of them mentioned that they were negative 
until they visited our city recently. I feel very confident we'll 
get a team, and I feel very confident we'll get a team at the 
Coliseum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum, which would be gutted inside and rebuilt, became  
the only viable choice in Los Angeles after Michael Ovitz bowed out 
of the Carson proposal last week to endorse the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan said that, among other subjects discussed at Monday's  
meeting, were parking -- ``They require 20,000 parking spaces'' -- 
and TV blackouts -- ``It's very, very important to the league that 
there are no blackouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who will own the new team remains a large question.  
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, chairman of the  
expansion committee, spoke glowingly of Ovitz, although Richardson 
did not rule out Ed Roski, who headed the drive to get an NFL team 
for the Coliseum, and partner Eli Broad as team owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, a developer, holds exclusive rights to any NFL deal with  
the Coliseum, but said he won't stand in the way if the league 
wants to hold an auction for the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	His exclusive rights would be relinquished if he were reimbursed  
for his expenses -- capped at $5 million -- incurred while seeking 
the league's franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've told them (the NFL) all along that we're not going to  
stand in the way of football in LA,'' Roski said. ``We would 
suggest a couple of things, local ownership, and reimburse us. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose was to bring NFL football back to LA, and  
the Coliseum and we would like to be a bidder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roski spearheaded the building of the new Staples Center  
downtown, and also gave the New Coliseum proposal life. Broad, who 
could provide solid financial backing for an NFL team, joined the 
Coliseum efforts later. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners have seemed interested in having Ovitz involved in  
any deal with the Coliseum. Tagliabue called the Hollywood 
deal-maker a ``visionary,'' and implied the league could benefit 
from Ovitz's experience in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no guarantee that Los Angeles will even get a team. The  
owners, well aware that the area represents the nation's 
second-largest TV market, voted 29-2 last month to spurn Robert 
McNair's Houston bid and award the franchise to the Los Angeles 
area on a conditional basis. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, suburban Carson also was in the running.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL gave Los Angeles until Sept. 15 to put together an  
ownership and stadium package. If a deal can't be reached, the new 
team, which would begin play in 2002, probably will go to Houston.

<HEADLINE> Otis Thorpe Grabs 10,000th Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Otis Thorpe grabbed his 10,000th rebound Tuesday  
night, becoming the 16th player in NBA history to score at least 
15,000 points and get 10,000 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Wizards forward entered the game against the  
Chicago Bulls needing just two rebounds to reach 10,000. Thorpe, 
36, got his first with 5:50 left in the first quarter, when he 
grabbed an offensive rebound and put it back for a basket. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10,000th came on a defensive board with 2:39 left in the  
first. The game wasn't stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	The others in the 15,000-10,000 club are: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,  
Wilt Chamberlain, Karl Malone, Moses Malone, Elvin Hayes, Hakeem 
Olajuwon, Robert Parish, Elgin Baylor, Charles Barkley, Walt 
Bellamy, Bob Pettit, Dolph Schayes, Jack Sikma, Buck Williams and 
Patrick Ewing. Of the 15, 12 are on the NBA's list of 50 Greatest 
Players. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing got his 10,000th rebound earlier this season.  
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe, in his 15th NBA season, entered the game with 17,042  
points. He was the 55th player -- and 12th active player -- to break 
the 17,000 mark.

<HEADLINE> New Indoor Football League Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The Extreme Football League, scheduled  
to begin play in April 2000, Tuesday announced nine cities that 
will field teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Art Clarkson, acting commissioner of the newly formed Extreme  
Football League, said teams will play a 16-game schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams will have 22-man rosters, with eight players per team on  
the 50-yard field at one time. The rest of the rules are still 
being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarkson said the league will definitely have three teams in  
Florida; Tallahassee, Jacksonville and Pensacola. It also plans to 
have teams in Huntsville and Birmingham, Ala., Norfolk and 
Richmond, Va., and Greenville, S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said five other cities were in ``serious discussion'' to  
join the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``We aren't going to be like the Arena League, mainly because we  
won't use the nets that they do,'' Clarkson said. ``We're going to 
try to bring the outdoor game indoors, with a lot of offense and 
defense, but make it a little more extreme.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The nine current teams will be owned in whole or part by  
existing East Coast Hockey League owners. That would allow them to 
use the hockey teams' existing support staffs and arenas during 
hockey's offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarkson, who said he will own the Huntsville franchise once a  
permanent commissioner is named, said it will be some time before 
his league can compete with the Arena League. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Arena League has teams in Chicago and New York, tier one  
markets, so I don't see them as competition,'' Clarkson said. ``But 
I still think we are on the right track. We have laid the cement, 
it's not exactly solid, but it's becoming stronger every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Burge, part of the group that will own franchises in  
Birmingham, Jacksonville and Pensacola, said the teams will be 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a minor league,'' Burge said. ``We're not taking a  
back seat to the Arena League. We're going for the best available 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league plans to hold a territorial draft next February. Each  
team would have four area colleges assigned to its territory and a 
budget of at least $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting the players will be the easy part,'' Clarkson said.  
``There are players coming out of college every year, late 
developing players who were NFL cuts and players who want to play 
just for the love of the game.

<HEADLINE> Wider Use of Tobacco Money Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A growing number of local and national  
coalitions and the U.S. surgeon general are shouldering into the 
tobacco settlement debate, seeking more money from squabbling 
legislatures for antismoking and preventive health campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalitions are offering moral suasion as 46 state  
legislatures separately feud over how much to spend on roads, 
playgrounds or health with the $206 billion they won from the 
tobacco industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying that the meaning of the settlement should be  
health, not money,'' said Damon Thompson, a spokesman for the 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson and Surgeon General David Satcher spoke Tuesday at a  
U.N. conference on tobacco control and building coalitions 
nationally and globally that include minority communities. The 
forum included students, local and state officials, representatives 
of community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Canales of the East Harlem Council for Human Services had  
very specific ideas about how to use the settlement monies. New 
York state is due $25 billion from the settlement and Canales 
pointed out that those with HIV/AIDS or who are alcoholics or 
substance abusers also are addicted to cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should get a higher amount of the money'' because of the  
interconnected problems, Canales said. 
</P>
<P>
	A study last year by the surgeon general, who also serves as an  
HHS assistant secretary, showed rapid increases in smoking by 
minority teenagers. Cigarette smoking is a major cause of death and 
disease among blacks, Latinos, American Indian/Alaska Native and 
Asian American/Pacific Islanders. Black men have death rates from 
cancer 50 percent higher than white men. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher called the increases among minority teens ``the first  
steps of a potentially tragic reversal for the health of American 
minorities,'' in issuing the department's first-ever study of 
tobacco and health focusing on ethnic and minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher vowed then to fight. On Tuesday, Satcher was just as  
emphatic in denouncing tobacco advertising that targets minority 
groups and children in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm upset. I'm very upset by the marketing to children, all  
our children ... to addicting tobacco,'' Satcher said. Children 
using tobacco grow up to ``suffer unnecessary diseases, suffer 
unnecessary pain and death,'' Satcher said, adding that fighting 
tobacco is harder than fighting infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tobacco is a greater foe because infectious diseases don't  
have lobbying efforts, infectious diseases don't have marketing 
efforts. They don't spread their infections through vending 
machines,'' he said, adding that children and minorities are not 
the only targets of tobacco marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pattern is to prey upon the poor and undereducated,''  
Satcher said. ``That's the sad part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Williams, a tobacco industry spokesman, rejected Satcher's  
statements comparing the tobacco industry with infectious diseases 
as ``a bit silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very cynical view,'' Williams said. ``You continue to  
hear that firebrand kind of rhetoric'' but not what the industry is 
doing in 1999, including tearing down billboard advertising and 
allocating $1.4 billion over 10 years for antismoking education.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Release RB Charlie Garner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Running back Charlie Garner was released  
Tuesday after five seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles on the eve 
of their second mini-camp under coach Andy Reid. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner, a second-round draft choice in 1994, rushed for 2,261  
yards and 17 touchdowns in 495 carries. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Garner battled ankle and rib injuries to play in just  
10 games, rushing for 381 yards and four touchdowns on 96 carries 
while catching 19 passes for 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner had been expected to replace Ricky Watters as the Eagles'  
primary running back in 1998 after Watters signed with the Seattle 
Seahawks as a free agent. Garner, an unrestricted free agent 
himself, re-signed with the Eagles for a reported $6 million over 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Garner made an impressive entrance to the NFL. After missing the  
first three games of his rookie year with a rib injury, Garner 
blitzed San Francisco for 111 yards and two touchdowns on 16 
carries. He got 122 yards the next week against Washington, 
becoming only the seventh player in NFL history to run for 100 
yards his first two games.

<HEADLINE> Text of Clinton Remarks on Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of President Clinton's remarks Tuesday night about the  
school shootings in Littleton, Colo.: 
</P>
<P>
	I want to begin by saying that Hillary and I are profoundly  
shocked and saddened by the tragedy today in Littleton, where two 
students opened fire on their classmates before apparently turning 
their guns on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	I have spoken with Governor Bill Owens and County Commission  
Chair Patricia Holloway and expressed my profound concern for the 
people of Littleton. I have spoken to Deputy Attorney General Eric 
Holder, and who along with Attorney General Reno, is closely 
monitoring the situation. I've asked the attorney general and the 
secretary of education to stand ready to assist local law 
enforcement, the schools, the families, the entire community during 
this time of crisis and sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
	A crisis response team is ready now to travel to Colorado, and I  
strongly believe that we should do whatever we can to get enough 
counselors to the families and the children as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	I know the other communities that have been through this are  
also ready to do whatever they can to help. 
</P>
<P>
	I think that Patricia Holloway would not mind if I said that  
amidst all of the turmoil and grief that she and others are 
experiencing, she said to me just a moment ago that perhaps now 
America would wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it 
could happen in a place like Littleton, and we could prevent 
anything like this from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	We pray that she is right.  
</P>
<P>
	We don't know yet all the hows or whys of this tragedy. Perhaps  
we may never fully understand it. Saint Paul reminds us that we all 
see things in this life through a glass darkly, that we only partly 
understand what is happening. 
</P>
<P>
	We do know that we must do more to reach out to our children and  
teach them to express their anger and to resolve their conflicts 
with words, not weapons. And we do know we have to do more to 
recognize the early warning signs that are sent before children act 
violently. 
</P>
<P>
	To the families who have lost their loved ones, to the parents  
who have lost their beloved children, to the wounded children and 
their families, to the people of the community of Littleton, I can 
only say tonight that the prayers of the American people are with 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you very much.  
</P>
<P>
	QUESTION: Mr. President, ... that message out last fall. Is  
there anything additional that you can say about what the federal 
government can do to prevent things like this from happening? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I think on this case, it's very, very important  
that we have the facts insofar as we can find them out. You know we 
had the conference here. The attorney general and the secretary of 
education prepared the handbook for all the schools that we asked 
to be widely used. And we do have from bitter and sad experience a 
great cadre of very good effective grief counselors. My guess is 
that they will be needed in abundance there for the children. I 
think, after a little time has passed, we need to have a candid 
assessment about what more we can do to try to prevent these things 
from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, there seems to be an epidemic of these kinds  
of incidents now. There was Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; 
Springfield, Oregon, and several others. Would you characterize 
this as an epidemic, affecting the nation's school system? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: I wouldn't want to use that word. What I would like to  
know is whether we can learn enough from this, which in its 
dimensions apparently, is much greater than even the others were, 
and see what else we can do. 
</P>
<P>
	I had a very interesting conversation this afternoon with  
Congresswoman Carolyn McCarthy. And as all of you know, she lost 
her own husband, and her son sustained a wound, as a result of a 
shooting incident on a commuter train. And that's what we talked 
about. 
</P>
<P>
	I think tonight we owe it to the people of Littleton and to the  
families involved in this tragedy to let them go through the 
grieving and deal. And try to get the facts, and then the rest of 
us have a responsibility to do everything we can to make sure this 
doesn't make 1999 a year like last year, that we don't have another 
rash of this, that we really can be more effective in preventing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	And I wish I could say more tonight, but I don't think I can.  
</P>
<P>
	Q: Have you been told, sir, that the death toll is as high as  
the 25 figure that we've heard? And secondly, sir, every time one 
of these things happens, we go through this course of handwringing 
and saying, ``We've got to stop it from happening again.'' Is there 
anything specific and concrete that you'd like to see happen or 
hasn't happened yet? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I don't want to make a, there are, but what I  
would like to do is take a couple of days because we don't know 
what the facts are here. And keeping in mind, the community is an 
open wound right now. They have suffered as much as anyone can 
suffer. This is the largest group of fatalities, whatever the 
numbers are, and I've heard various numbers, even as much as five 
minutes ago right before I came out. 
</P>
<P>
	I'd like to answer that question, but I think anything I say  
tonight could only add to the pain of the people in Littleton, and 
not serve to solve the problem. So I will answer that question when 
I have more facts and after we let a little time pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Mr. President, you said you pray that people will wake up.  
Wake up to what, sir? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Well, I think you know that there are a lot of kids out  
there who have access to weapons, and apparently more than guns 
here. And who build up these grievances in their own mind, and who 
are not being reached. And it's not just Littleton. We know that 
now. We've had lots and lots and lots of places. 
</P>
<P>
	So, I don't know how many of you have been there, but I've  
actually been there. I know the community and it's a wonderful 
place. And I think, I can't do better than what Patricia Holloway 
said, the commission chair, you know if it can said, it can here, 
then surely people will recognize that they have to be aware for 
the possibility that it could occur in any community in America. 
And maybe that will help us to keep it from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the motto that we put out before, you know the efforts  
we've made and I just think that tonight we need to focus on the 
families that lost their kids, on the children that are wounded, on 
the grieving of the community. Give this thing a day or two for the 
facts to emerge, and then I'll, I'll try to have more to say to 
you. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: On just that point, Mr. President, the time you ... you had  
that conference last year, your administration said that students 
are still safer sitting in a classroom than they are walking down 
the street. Do you think Americans still think that's true? 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Statistically, for all the whole 53 million kids in our  
schools it's true. But, you know, from the facts we're hearing 
about what happened at this school, and the possibility that 
explosives were out there, that hand grenades were available, that 
other things were there, it obviously wasn't true there. That was 
obviously the most dangerous place in Colorado today. 
</P>
<P>
	So I don't want to, but that doesn't, that shouldn't make people  
believe that every school is in danger. What it should make every 
community do is to study this handbook we put out and see what 
lessons can be learned here. But again, you know, tonight I think 
the American people ought to be thinking about those folks in 
Littleton. Tomorrow and in the days ahead, we'll have a little more 
time to kind of gather ourselves and our determination and go back 
at this again. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally lower  
Tuesday on profit-taking, but the key index in Tokyo rebounded in a 
late rally triggered by foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 22.90  
points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 16,697.11. On Monday, the 
index lost 177.37 points, or 1.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices recouped early losses as foreign and individual investors  
stayed bullish on the Japanese market. A tumble in hi-tech issues, 
triggered by a sell-off of technology shares in New York, had kept 
Tokyo stocks lower for most of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index lost  
138.43 points Monday, falling to 2,345.61, for its second-steepest 
drop ever. The Dow Jones industrial average fell after five 
straight sessions of record highs, slipping 53.36 points, or 0.5 
percent, to 10,440.53.

</P>
<P>
	The profit-taking was expected after the index rose nearly 8  
percent over the past three sessions, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said investors largely discounted a government land auction  
on Tuesday, which fetched relatively good prices. The land auction 
was the first since the Hong Kong government froze land sales nine

<HEADLINE> Baby Bells, Sprint Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Currency problems spoiled an otherwise strong quarter for  
BellSouth, but profits grew better than 15 percent at other major 
telephone companies in the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritech led the profit gains with a nearly 20 percent  
improvement from year-ago levels, while its Baby Bell merger 
partner SBC Communications posted a 15 percent increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint, the No. 3 long-distance provider, reported a 16 percent  
profit gain, but its PCS Group wireless business suffered a 
wider-than-expected loss. 
</P>
<P>
	BellSouth's net profit fell 45 percent as the currency crisis in  
Brazil overshadowed a robust showing in digital and Internet 
services. 

</P>
<P>
                        *SBC Communications    	
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio-based provider of local calling service in the  
Western and Southwest earned slightly more than $1.1 billion, or 56 
cents per share, in the first quarter, boosted by growth in its 
core and wireless businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year, SBC earned $970 million, or 49  
cents per share, excluding a one-time gain from a change in 
accounting methods. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenues increased 6.7 percent to $7.3 billion  
compared with a year ago, fueled by the addition of nearly 300,000 
new wireless subscribers and strong demand for Internet access and 
premium phone services like Caller ID. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest results were right in line with the projections of  
most analysts surveyed by First Call. In Tuesday's trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange, SBC's shares rose $1.68 3/4 to $54.62 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC said it expects to complete its planned acquisition of  
Ameritech, still awaiting FCC approval nearly a year after the deal 
was announced, by the middle of 1999. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Ameritech    	
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based provider of local phone service in the Midwest  
earned $732 million, or 66 cents per share, in the first quarter 
amid strong contributions from online services and the company's 
European investments. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a one-time gain of $27 million from the adoption of  
new accounting standards, Ameritech earned $705 million, or 63 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	That was slightly better than most Wall Street forecasts and up  
19.5 percent from the $590 million, or 53 cents a share, in 
operating income Ameritech recorded in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 7.8 percent from year-ago levels to $4.46 billion,  
driven by a 40 percent jump in data services such as high-speed 
Internet connections. Revenues from premium telephone services rose 
17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Ameritech's  
shares rose $2.43 3/4 to $64.56 1/4. 

</P>
<P>
                            *BellSouth    	
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based provider of local phone service in the  
Southeast posted first-quarter income of $615 million, or 32 cents 
a share, including a charge of $280 million to reflect the plunging 
value of the Brazilian currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But excluding currency factors, the company enjoyed a strong  
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 10.1 percent to $6 billion, bolstered by a 30  
percent jump in digital and data services business. 
</P>
<P>
	And without the currency-related charge, BellSouth's per-share  
earnings of 46 cents were slightly better than Wall Street 
projections and year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter of 1998, BellSouth earned $892 million, or  
45 cents per share, including a one-time gain of $96 million from 
the sale of a business. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, BellSouth's  
shares fell 50 cents to $41.37 1/2. 

</P>
<P>
 *Sprint Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas City, Mo.-based long-distance company earned $406  
million, or 93 cents per share, in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had been expecting a per-share  
profit of 90 cents from Sprint, which in the same period last year 
earned $352 million or 80 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	First-quarter revenues rose 7 percent to $4.2 billion, led by a  
9 percent increase in long distance business 
</P>
<P>
	But the company's new wireless PCS Group, reflected by a  
separate tracking stock created last November, quadrupled its 
first-quarter loss to $625 million, or $1.46 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same period last year PCS lost $145 million, or 97 cents  
per share, in the first quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The wider-than-expected loss overshadowed a quarter of stellar  
growth for PCS. Revenues nearly tripled to $604.2 million as 
763,000 new customers signed on during the quarter, rising the PCS 
subscriber total to 3.35 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Sprint's  
shares rose $3.00 to $100.43 3/4, while PCS rose 62 1/2 cents to $47.62 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Shots Fired at Colorado High School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- At least one gunman opened fire in a  
suburban Denver high school today, scattering students as bullets 
ricocheted off lockers. Witnesses said at least three students were 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's  
Department, said ``we do have injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now all I've got is there have been several shots fired,  
some explosions heard and some fire in the school,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	One student, Jonathon Ladd, said he was leaving a technology  
laboratory when he saw students running amid the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses said there were two gunman.  
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said a student who gave her name as Janine. ``We didn't 
think it was real and then we saw blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was two young men, wearing black trench coats.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff. ...  
Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We saw three 
people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ambulances and police cars were arriving at the school around  
lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladd said he ran to a nearby park to escape the gunfire.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High School, opened in 1973, is southwest of Denver in  
the suburb of Littleton. It has an enrollment of about 1,800.

<HEADLINE> Met Dusts Off Greek Art for Gallery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Metropolitan Museum of Art reopened its main  
Greek art galleries Tuesday after three years and $75 million worth 
of renovations that transformed the dark and dusty rooms into a 
polished, sun-washed space. 
</P>
<P>
	The galleries, arranged around a wide, 58-foot-high limestone  
hallway with classical columns, were built between 1912 and 1917. 
For years, the vaulted ceiling and its skylights were covered over, 
and the rooms were little more than a dull passageway to the museum 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The rooms were closed for three years while workers cleaned and  
cleared the space, revealing the skylights. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're returning it to its original grandeur,'' said Carlos  
Picon, the Met's curator of Greek and Roman art. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, light streams down onto 1,900-year-old marble statues.  
Finely painted red-and-black terra cotta vases and carved reliefs 
that once marked Greek graves are also among the works on display. 
Many were restored after decades in the Met's attic. 
</P>
<P>
	In one larger-than-life piece, a wounded Amazon warrior stands  
with a hand atop her tilted head and a mournful look on her elegant 
face. Nearby are a slender male athlete and a woman draped in wraps 
so finely carved the stone falls like cloth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am overwhelmed,'' said Jeannette Dean, 81, one of the  
opening-day visitors. ``I'm at the point of tears. One visit is not 
enough. I'll have to come here many times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six smaller rooms flank the main gallery, and curators have  
filled them with restored works from the fourth, fifth and sixth 
centuries B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, pottery was grouped with pottery and sculpture with  
sculpture. Now works of many types are displayed together in 
chronological order, taking viewers from the early days of Greek 
democracy through Athens' flourishing as a political and cultural 
center to its loss of power around the time of Alexander the 
Great's death in 323 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``It places Greek art, the very birth of Western civilization at  
the very center of the Metropolitan,'' said Philippe de Montebello, 
the museum's director.

<HEADLINE> ETrade Earnings Exceed Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Outpacing the rapid growth of the online trading  
industry, ETrade Group topped forecasts Tuesday for the first three 
months of 1999, showing robust gains in revenues and new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a one-time gain of $20 million from an investment,  
ETrade lost $14.3 million, or 12 cents per share, in its second 
quarter ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	While the second-largest Internet broker earned $4.5 million, or  
5 cents per share in the same period last year, the loss was 
smaller than the roughly 17 cents per share that analysts surveyed 
by First Call expected the company to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's shares soared 21 percent after Tuesday morning's  
report, closing $16 higher at $89.81 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
The stock had plunged 50 percent over the past week amid a barrage 
of profit-taking among Web-broker shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported second-quarter revenues of $126.7 million,  
up 44 percent from the final three months of 1999 and more than 
double its revenue tally in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade said it added 233,000 new accounts during the latest  
quarter, an increase of 77 percent over the prior quarter's 
customer growth and more new accounts than the company added in all 
of 1998. As of March 31, the company had slightly more than 900,000 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade handled 4.3 million trades in the latest quarter, an  
increase of 55 percent from the final three months of 1999. By 
contrast, the overall industry's trading volume rose between 30 
percent and 35 percent during the first three months of 1999, 
according to a preliminary estimate by Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the accelerating growth came during a quarter that saw  
Web brokers suffer repeated slowdowns and outages as investors 
overwhelmed their online systems. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said it expects to continue  
to lose money in the near future due to aggressive spending on 
marketing, technology upgrades and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took strong positive action during the quarter to build our  
technology infrastructure and in our efforts to ensure that our 
customers have access to high-quality service and support,'' said 
Christos M. Cotsakos, chairman and chief executive of ETrade.

<HEADLINE> Foot Sculpture Rejected by City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A proposal to erect a sculpture of a giant  
foot along the city's waterfront has been given the boot. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-foot-tall stainless-steel foot had won the unanimous  
approval of the city's Art Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But since then, many San Franciscans have blasted the artwork as  
inappropriate and a waste of the $500,000 it would cost taxpayers. 
City supervisors rejected the project with a 6-4 vote on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sculptor Richard Knight named his artwork ``Embark,'' which  
would have featured a pulsing light coursing out at night over San 
Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says our journey did not end here,'' Knight said. ``At this  
point in the new millennium, the journey would continue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But many residents urged Knight and his artistic endeavor to  
take a hike. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an embarrassment, and unfortunately it will be a  
long-lasting embarrassment,'' art dealer Charles Campbell said 
before the vote.

<HEADLINE> Avs Won't Take Shark's Bait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Swimming in Shark-infested waters is dangerous  
enough. Taking the bait could be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	With memories of last year's ignominious first-round playoff  
exit still fresh in their minds, the Colorado Avalanche are 
refusing to be drawn into a war of words with this year's 
first-round opponent, the San Jose Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
	While preparing for Game 1 of the best-of-7 series Wednesday  
night, the Avalanche shrugged off inflammatory comments by San Jose 
captain Owen Nolan, who once played alongside many of the current 
Colorado players. 
</P>
<P>
	``We definitely have more character on this team,'' Nolan said.  
``They have two solid lines, maybe the top two lines in the league. 
After that, they don't have anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Nolan took a shot at Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy, saying,  
``He's either unbeatable or things just go flying by. He's never 
medium. He's either on top of his game or lets in the weakest 
goals. If you get him off his game, he lets in some weird goals. If 
you get him rattled early, he feels like he has to do more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It amounted to strong bulletin-board material for the Avalanche,  
but Colorado declined to reciprocate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be very clear for the playoffs,'' Colorado coach Bob  
Hartley said Tuesday. ``We want to focus on our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed about the Nolan comments, Hartley said, ``Please move  
on, ask another question. We're focusing on our team. We will not 
get involved in that stuff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Roy, who typically delights in exchanging barbs with the  
opposition, was tight-lipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to get involved in that,'' Roy said. ``What I  
want to do is focus on what I have to do and play as well as I can. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know if my focus and concentration level is good, I am going  
to have some success and I will have a better chance to do well. 
That's what I want to concentrate on and not worry about the 
outside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado wing Claude Lemieux, one of the NHL's most notorious  
agitators, also brushed off Nolan's words. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's playoff hockey,'' he said. ``A lot of things are said  
and talked about in the press. But as far as we're concerned, 
you've just got to play your game. Name-calling or whatever you 
want to call it -- we're not going to get involved in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharks coach Darryl Sutter doesn't fault one of his players for  
trying to inject some emotion into the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's good,'' he said. ``Who is clearly the best team? It's  
Colorado. Owen has played here and I'm sure he's excited. He will 
come out with that intensity. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going against a great team and we can't have any average  
performances. We're all going to have to play, as individuals and 
as a team, our best hockey of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado won the regular-season series 3-1, outscoring the  
Sharks 13-6. But as Sutter noted, ``All that stuff goes out the 
window now. We played well down the stretch, but I don't think that 
has a bearing on the playoffs either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche also finished strong, going 7-2-1 in the last 10  
games. Colorado clinched the Northwest Division title on March 28 
and wound up as the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference with a 
44-28-10 record. 
</P>
<P>
	Only nine players in the NHL had at least 90 points during the  
regular season and Colorado has three of them. Peter Forsberg was 
fourth in the league with 97 points (30 goals, 67 assists), and Joe 
Sakic was fifth with 96 (41, 55). The Avs added more firepower on 
Feb. 28 when they acquired Theo Fleury, who had 93 points (40, 53). 
</P>
<P>
	Being one of the favorites in the postseason doesn't ensure  
success, as the Avalanche found out last year in bowing to Edmonton 
in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we took Edmonton seriously,'' Roy said. ``There  
were other circumstances and one of them was playing in the 
Olympics. We don't have that excuse now. We have no reason not to 
be ready for this series. We learned that from last year, and we 
know that San Jose has a very good hockey team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose (31-33-18) clinched a playoff berth on April 6, the  
earliest ever in a full season. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran goalie Mike Vernon, who has two Stanley Cup rings, has  
been the Sharks' regular goalie, but Steve Shields played better 
late in the season. Sutter has been vague about who will start 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a real huge issue,'' Sutter said. ``I think it's a  
real good situation to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the second game on Thursday night here, Sutter might  
alternate goalies.

<HEADLINE> Baby Not Returned To HIV Mother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- A judge refused Tuesday to give up state  
control of a baby born to an HIV-infected mother who wants to 
breast feed, saying the risk of spreading the deadly virus left the 
state no choice but to step in. 
</P>
<P>
	``The parents may choose to run that risk with the child, but  
the court may second-guess that decision,'' Juvenile Court Judge 
Maurice Merten said after a three-day hearing on the custody of 
4-month-old Felix Tyson. So far, Felix has tested negative for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathleen Tyson and her husband, David, lost legal custody of  
their son when he was days old because of the decision to nurse. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the state has legal custody of Felix, he is allowed to  
live with his parents and his 10-year-old sister. About once a 
week, a caseworker from Oregon's Office for Services to Children 
and Families makes a visit to the Tyson home to ensure the state's 
will is being carried out and that the baby is being bottle fed. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of their case to win him back focused on their belief that  
HIV doesn't cause AIDS and that the deadly virus cannot be spread 
by breast milk. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of medical experts testified for the state, however,  
that milk from an HIV-infected mother carries the highest risk of 
transmitting the virus -- even more than sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	After the decision, the Tysons hustled quickly out of court  
without talking to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed,'' Hilary Billings, the attorney for Mrs.  
Tyson. ``I just don't think that the judge was willing to buck the 
tremendous tide of medical opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tyson, who was diagnosed with HIV during prenatal  
screening, began nursing Felix in the hospital and a doctor called 
in authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying as the final witness, Mrs. Tyson told the judge her  
decision to breast feed was ``all about what I want for my child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love my son more than anything in the world and that I want  
the best for him,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Ends Race Limits in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge declared an end to  
race-based enrollment in San Francisco public schools Tuesday, 
approving a settlement of a lawsuit by Chinese-Americans who were 
denied admission to preferred campuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite objections by black and Hispanic students and parents,  
U.S. District Judge William Orrick said he had little choice 
because the current plan, in place since 1983, is almost certainly 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	School officials, the NAACP and lawyers for Chinese-American  
students and parents agreed to the settlement in February on the 
opening day of trial of a lawsuit challenging the use of race in 
enrollments in the 62,000-student district. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement repeals a limit of 45 percent of any racial or  
ethnic group at a single school and 40 percent at desirable 
``magnet'' schools. The repeal takes effect this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The limits were part of a 1983 consent decree, approved by  
Orrick, that settled a discrimination lawsuit filed in 1978 by the 
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the consent decree took effect, Chinese-Americans have  
grown to become the largest ethnic group in the district, with 28 
percent of the enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement gives the district until October to prepare a new  
enrollment plan for the fall of 2000 to maintain diversity in 
schools without assigning any student primarily because of race. 
</P>
<P>
	The new system, ``we believe, will guarantee more diversity in  
San Francisco schools than we currently have,'' said Robin 
Johansen, lawyer for state school Superintendent Delaine Eastin. 
She said the computer-designed system would avoid segregation by 
redrawing boundaries and giving more weight to economic and 
geographic diversity in competitive schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``Resegregation is inevitable,'' said Robert Franklin, who said  
he lives in San Francisco so that his two children -- a 7-year-old 
black girl and a 2-year-old white boy -- could attend its schools. 
``I want to keep them in an integrated, racially diverse public 
school.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Declares No-Fly Zone Over D.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO is coming to Washington and bringing with  
it its own no-fly zone. 
</P>
<P>
	The military alliance will observe its 50th anniversary in  
Washington this weekend under cover of an expanded zone around the 
city and its monuments where flights are banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Aircraft already are forbidden in Prohibited Area 56, a swath  
that runs from the Capitol west over the Mall to the Lincoln 
Monument. The zone also extends over the White House and northwest 
to the vice president's residence at the U.S. Naval Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Friday, unless authorized by air traffic controllers,  
pilots will not be allowed to fly below 18,000 feet within a 
10-nautical-mile radius of Ronald Reagan Washington National 
Airport, on the edge of the Potomac River, and Andrews Air Force 
Base in suburban Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The effect will be a ban on low-level flights within a radius  
covering the Capital Beltway region and points to the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Sightseeing helicopters also will be banned within seven  
nautical miles of Reagan National. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the restrictions apply to commercial flights into Reagan  
National or diplomatic or military flights into Andrews, the home 
of Air Force One. Limitations remain in effect until Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend's celebration will bring together as many as 42  
heads of state. Security in Washington will be very tight, with 
streets closed and access to one section limited to those with 
Secret Service credentials.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Lower at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Stock prices retreated Wednesday morning in Tokyo  
following a gloomy assessment of the Japanese economy by the 
International Monetary Fund. The U.S. dollar was higher against the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average lost 100.26 points, or 0.60 percent, to  
close the morning session at 16,596.85. On Tuesday, the index 
gained 22.90 points, or 0.14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.68 yen, up 0.64 yen from late Tuesday in  
Tokyo but was slightly below its level of 118.78 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices fell after the International  
Monetary Fund cast doubt on a swift economic recovery in Japan in 
its World Economic Report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF revised downward its forecast for Japan's gross domestic  
product to minus 1.4 percent from a December prediction of a 0.5 
percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``It underlines the fact that things are not improving as much  
as people expected,'' said Robert Sasaki, head of the quantitative 
strategy group at Jardine Fleming Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 9.06 points, or 0.68 percent, to 
1,319.84. The TOPIX lost 3.79 points, or 0.28 percent, the previous 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average  
finished at 10,448.55 points, up 8.02. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar maintained its strength from New  
York as the IMF's report deflated confidence in the Japanese 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent warnings by Japanese finance officials against the yen's  
excessive strength also sparked speculation that the nation's 
central bank may intervene to curb the yen's increase, discouraging 
yen-buying, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currencies, the euro was traded at 126.14 yen, up  
from 125.57 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.480  
percent from Tuesday's close of 1.500 percent, driving its price up 
to 102.82 yen from 102.64 yen.

<HEADLINE> Direct Pay Plan Can Simplify Things </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: Just about every monthly bill that comes in the mail offers  
an option for direct payment. Is it risky to let my phone company 
or credit card issuer take money directly from my bank account? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Merchants that offer direct payment -- aka automatic bill  
payment, direct debit and autopayment -- don't actually have direct 
access to your account. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments are handled in the same way as direct deposit for  
paychecks and Social Security checks, using an electronic network 
operated by the Federal Reserve and three private payment 
processors, including Visa USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, which is called the Automated Clearing House,  
currently handles electronic transactions among 20,000 financial 
institutions and 500,000 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1998 Fed survey, 37 percent of American  
households use direct payment options for their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, there were 1.2 billion direct payment transactions  
worth $678 billion, an 18 percent increase from the previous year, 
according to the National Automated Clearing House Association, a 
not-for-profit industry group that sets rules for the ACH network. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong growth, less that 5 percent of all bills are  
paid through the network, says Louis Fuertes, a product manager for 
Chase Manhattan. He notes that 64 billion checks are written 
annually in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, (direct) payment is the norm,'' says Fuertes. ``The  
thought of writing a check in a number of European countries is 
seen as a quaint concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the process is called direct payment, that doesn't mean  
your cable television company or mortgage company has direct access 
to your account and your finances. For each transaction, the vendor 
sends billing information to its own bank, which sends it to your 
bank through the ACH network. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vendor has your authority to debit your account, but it's  
not like an electronic hand that goes into your account,'' says 
NACHA spokesman Michael Herd. ``We don't know of a single case of a 
direct payment or direct deposit being lost or stolen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed survey found that 87 percent of those using direct  
payment said they were extremely satisfied or very satisfied with 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct payment may not be the best choice for people who live on  
a very tight budget and don't keep a close eye on their account 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
	But direct payment plans can simplify life. There's no  
check-writing, no cost for stamps, no payments lost or delayed in 
the mail, no risk of forgery or theft, and no late-payment fees. 
</P>
<P>
	And for those worried about privacy, direct payment actually may  
be superior to checks, which according to Herd, pass through as 
many as 12 hands from the time they leave your home. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, if there is a discrepancy, direct payments leave a  
clear electronic trail that's easy to trace. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a dispute, consumers need not be left holding the  
bag while it's being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	When a complaint is registered within 60 days of the debit, Fed  
regulations require the consumer's money be returned while any 
investigation is conducted, says Mary O'Toole, a product manager 
for Chase.

<HEADLINE> Tech Stocks Recover; Dow Up 8.02 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices ended mostly higher on Tuesday as  
technology stocks recovered from Monday's rout but industrial 
companies, also changing course, fell amid profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 8.02 to 10,448.55 after  
fluctuating between positive and negative territory throughout the 
session. The Dow lost 53 points Monday, ending a five-day streak of 
new closing highs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 16.69 to 1,306.17. The Nasdaq  
composite index, which is heavily weighted with technology stocks, 
rose 64.03 to 2,409.64, regaining nearly half the 138 points, or 
5.6 percent, it lost on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many high-profile technology stocks that took big hits Monday  
recovered Tuesday. Internet shares were back in favor, including 
Amazon.com, up 13 1/16 to 172; and AOL, up 12 13/16 to 128 11/16. 
The shares of online traders rose sharply, with Schwab Corp. shares 
gaining 4 3/4 to 106 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Other computer-related stocks also advanced, including Dell, up  
2 3/4 at 38 3/16, Intel, up 1 1/16 at 56 9/16, and Cisco, up 1 9/16 at 
101 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	But shares of companies that are sensitive to changes in the  
economy, such as manufacturers, ran aground after moving sharply 
higher last week. One of the biggest decliners among the Dow stocks 
was Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, which fell 2 5/8 to 81 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug stocks that fell hard Monday rebounded on positive earnings  
reports. Merck, a Dow component, advanced 2 1/8 to 75 1/4. Retailers, 
which also had big losses Monday, were back in the plus column, 
with Wal-Mart, another Dow stock, up 2 7/8 to 47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're seeing today is a classic bounce after an  
absolutely horrendous day yesterday,'' said Charles Pradilla, chief 
investment strategist at SG Cowen Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference in this week's action, Pradilla said, has been  
its speed and ferocity. ``The incredible viciousness of this 
rotation is unlike any I've seen since I've been doing this, which 
is more than 30 years. It's like catching a moving bus -- in the 
teeth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the close of trading today, Microsoft reported  
first-quarter earnings of 38 cents a share, handily beating 
analysts' estimated 32 cents. Some analysts believed the report 
might keep the recovery in technology stocks going on Wednesday. 
Microsoft shares ended 2 1/8 higher at 83 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues had a small 6-to-5 lead on advancers on the New  
York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume was heavy at 1.12 billion 
shares but off slightly from Monday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 4.96 to 620.84, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.87 to 736.98. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.93 to 415.34. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.14 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	European markets were sharply lower. Germany's DAX index closed  
down 2.56 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 0.71 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 skidded down 2.88 percent.

<HEADLINE> No Y2K Bug for Co. With No Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSBURG, W.Va. (AP) -- The federal agency that regulates stock  
trading asked Ralph Hinzman how his mutual funds business planned 
to become Y2K compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinzman wasn't worried. He told the Securities and Exchange  
Commission his small operation didn't have a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinzman, 87, has been selling mutual funds since 1948, and has  
had his own company since 1965. He runs Allegheny Financial 
Programs with his daughter from his home and doesn't see the need 
for a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	``You make a check out to the fund, I put a stamp on it and send  
it in,'' Hinzman said. ``How complicated is that? Why do I need a 
computer?'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the SEC sent Hinzman a 17-page form to fill out, he wrote  
``not applicable, we don't have a computer'' on the form and sent 
it back. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC spokesman Tim Warner said Hinzmans response was ``not  
sufficient.'' An SEC rule requires all brokers to become Y2K 
compliant, he said. Hinzman was fined $5,000 for failing to 
adequately respond to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe I was a little nasty with the guy who imposed the  
fine,'' Hinzman said. ``I told him he was getting on my nerves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hinzman paid his fine and turned over a second Y2K form to his  
daughter to fill out this month.

<HEADLINE> MD-11 Wiring Inspections Ordered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- MD-11 aircraft must undergo emergency wiring  
inspections after airline mechanics found a loose wire, signs of 
electrical sparking and a burnt insulation blanket in the cargo 
hold of one airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	An emergency airworthiness directive, issued by the Federal  
Aviation Administration late Friday but made public Tuesday, is the 
latest in a series of inspections and emergency repairs ordered in 
the aftermath of last September's crash of Swissair Flight 111. 
</P>
<P>
	That investigation is focusing on wiring in the cockpit and  
entertainment systems of the Swissair plane, also a Boeing MD-11, 
and investigators do not believe the latest discovery explains that 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-to-Geneva flight plunged into the ocean off Nova  
Scotia, 16 minutes after the pilots reported smoke in the cockpit. 
All 229 aboard were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, mechanics have paid close attention to all wiring on  
the planes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the FAA said: ``While performing routine  
maintenance on an MD-11, mechanics found evidence of wire chafing 
in the cargo loader control unit and burnt insulation. They also 
discovered that a wiring harness support bracket and clamp that 
supports a wire bundle may not have been installed on the 
aircraft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Operators of the MD-11 were required to perform inspections,  
verify the installation of the bracket and clamp and repair any 
damaged wires within five days. Findings must be reported to the 
FAA within 10 days after completion of the inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	The airworthiness directive applies to MD-11s with a 72-inch  
cargo door. There are 45 such U.S.-registered airplanes and 89 
worldwide. Operators include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, 
World Airways, Federal Express Corporation, and The Boeing Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The estimated cost to inspect the U.S. fleet is $8,100, or $180  
per aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the FAA gave airlines two months to inspect MD-11s  
for wiring and insulation problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The order followed a letter from the National Transportation  
Safety Board, which also is investigating the Swissair crash, that 
noted signs of heat damage and electrical arcing found by Canadian 
investigators in an overhead cockpit panel and the avionics circuit 
bay of the crashed plane. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, the FAA ordered a one-time inspection of MD-11s to  
detect problems such as nicks, fraying or chafing above the left 
and right front passenger doors. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, the agency also ordered airlines to inspect  
lighting dimmer switches in the MD-11 cockpit. A month earlier, the 
FAA announced it had begun work on an order requiring the eventual 
replacement of insulation aboard the entire U.S. commercial 
aircraft fleet. Those recommendations are due shortly. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Swissair agreed in October to discontinue use of an  
advanced in-flight entertainment system on its MD-11s and some 
Boeing 747s as a safeguard against electrical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week a Korean Air MD-11 crashed shortly after takeoff from  
Shanghai, China. The cause remains under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Wider Use of Tobacco Money Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A growing number of local and national  
coalitions and the U.S. surgeon general are shouldering into the 
tobacco settlement debate, seeking more money from squabbling 
legislatures for antismoking and preventive health campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalitions are offering moral suasion as 46 state  
legislatures separately feud over how much to spend on roads, 
playgrounds or health with the $206 billion they won from the 
tobacco industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're saying that the meaning of the settlement should be  
health, not money,'' said Damon Thompson, a spokesman for the 
Department of Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson and Surgeon General David Satcher spoke Tuesday at a  
U.N. conference on tobacco control and building coalitions 
nationally and globally that include minority communities. The 
forum included students, local and state officials, representatives 
of community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Canales of the East Harlem Council for Human Services had  
very specific ideas about how to use the settlement monies. New 
York state is due $25 billion from the settlement and Canales 
pointed out that those with HIV/AIDS or who are alcoholics or 
substance abusers also are addicted to cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should get a higher amount of the money'' because of the  
interconnected problems, Canales said. 
</P>
<P>
	A study last year by the surgeon general, who also serves as an  
HHS assistant secretary, showed rapid increases in smoking by 
minority teenagers. Cigarette smoking is a major cause of death and 
disease among blacks, Latinos, American Indian/Alaska Native and 
Asian American/Pacific Islanders. Black men have death rates from 
cancer 50 percent higher than white men. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher called the increases among minority teens ``the first  
steps of a potentially tragic reversal for the health of American 
minorities,'' in issuing the department's first-ever study of 
tobacco and health focusing on ethnic and minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Satcher vowed then to fight. On Tuesday, Satcher was just as  
emphatic in denouncing tobacco advertising that targets minority 
groups and children in general. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm upset. I'm very upset by the marketing to children, all  
our children ... to addicting tobacco,'' Satcher said. Children 
using tobacco grow up to ``suffer unnecessary diseases, suffer 
unnecessary pain and death,'' Satcher said, adding that fighting 
tobacco is harder than fighting infectious diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tobacco is a greater foe because infectious diseases don't  
have lobbying efforts, infectious diseases don't have marketing 
efforts. They don't spread their infections through vending 
machines,'' he said, adding that children and minorities are not 
the only targets of tobacco marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pattern is to prey upon the poor and undereducated,''  
Satcher said. ``That's the sad part.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Williams, a tobacco industry spokesman, rejected Satcher's  
statements comparing the tobacco industry with infectious diseases 
as ``a bit silly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a very cynical view,'' Williams said. ``You continue to  
hear that firebrand kind of rhetoric'' but not what the industry is 
doing in 1999, including tearing down billboard advertising and 
allocating $1.4 billion over 10 years for antismoking education.

<HEADLINE> China Economic Growth Seen Slowing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Massive stimulus spending by the government  
helped China grow a robust 8.3 percent in the first three months of 
this year, but its economy won't be able to sustain that pace, a 
state economist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With Chinese consumers and private companies reluctant to spend,  
growth will probably slow down in the second half of 1999 as public 
funds dry up, said Zheng Xinli, an economist with the State 
Development Planning Commission, the agency that guides government 
spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
	China's gross domestic product -- the sum of all goods and  
services produced within its borders -- will probably grow at about 
7 percent for the entire year, below last year's rate of 7.8 
percent but in line with government targets, Zheng said. 
</P>
<P>
	China's GDP totaled $205 billion (1.7 trillion yuan) in the  
first three months, said the State Statistical Bureau, which 
released its own figures Tuesday that mirrored Zheng's. 
</P>
<P>
	Zheng said the economy won't be able to pick up steam again as  
long as companies hold back on purchases of new factories and 
equipment, Chinese consumers continue to tighten their purse 
strings and exports remain down. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the government was targeting some of its stimulus money  
at spurring consumption by expanding consumer credit and boosting 
the income of poorer groups like farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	China is in the midst of a three-year, $1.2 trillion spending  
program on public works and other fixed assets aimed at fending off 
the ill effects of the Asian financial crisis, reviving the economy 
and creating new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Zheng said the spending program was working. He pointed to a 30  
percent to 40 percent increase in new investments in key industries 
like telecommunications in the first three months of this year from 
the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The influx of public money has helped profits at manufacturing  
companies soar to six times their level in the same three months of 
last year and to the same levels as 1997, before Asia's economic 
crisis hit, Zheng said. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run enterprises also showed a turnaround, earning $115  
million in the first quarter compared with a loss of $664 million 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But state enterprises still suffer huge inefficiencies that must  
be corrected as China moves from a socialist economy to a 
market-oriented one, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This restructuring will probably further drag on growth as state  
enterprises keep cutting excess workers, adding to China's millions 
of unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is a drop in exports ever since the start of the  
Asian financial crisis, Zheng said. But signs that the crisis may 
finally be over would give a much needed boost to exports, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another glimmer of hope: Figures released Tuesday by the State  
Statistics Bureau showed a 7.4 percent rise in retail sales in the 
first quarter, a sign that consumers may be returning to stores.

<HEADLINE> Vikings' Thomas Faces Arraignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Minnesota Vikings safety Orlando Thomas  
is expected to be arraigned in June on a charge of domestic 
violence involving an assault his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 26, was arrested at 11:30 p.m. Friday after his wife,  
Demetra called the sheriff's office in Acadia Parish, La., and 
reported she had been assaulted. She was treated at a local 
hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The arraignment has been tentatively set for June 24 in the 15th  
Judicial District Court in Acadia Parish. If convicted, Thomas 
could face a $500 fine and/or a six-month jail term. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas was born in Crowley and owns a home in the town, which is  
140 miles west of New Orleans. He has been in trouble before in his 
hometown, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 29, 1997, he was arrested in Crowley and charged with  
inciting a riot and two counts of disturbing the peace. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges were reduced to one count of disturbing the peace,  
and Thomas entered a plea of no-contest. He was ordered to pay a 
$100 fine, court costs and do 50 hours of community service, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings re-signed Thomas, their starting free safety, to a  
four-year contract worth $11 million in February. The deal includes 
a $2.75 million signing bonus -- most of it deferred -- and incentive 
money aimed at improving Thomas' workout habits. 
</P>
<P>
	By being charged, Thomas must comply with the NFL's violent  
crime policy, which includes mandatory evaluation and counseling.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Takes Tour of New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton had a simple explanation  
for New Yorkers on why she's considering running for office in a 
state where she's never lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love New York to start with -- I always have,'' the first  
lady said Monday as she jam-packed eight events around Manhattan 
into a 14-hour tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very interested in a lot of the issues I think will  
continue to be important for New York and America into the next 
century. New York is truly a microcosm of America,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her potential candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated  
next year by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, she would say only, 
``I'm obviously still considering and exploring and am very 
interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton began the second day of her New York road trip  
today at the Village Elementary School in Syosset, examining 
African dwarf frogs and plant life with some third-graders. She 
also planned to give a speech on health care and attend a United 
Jewish Appeal fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
	She returns to Washington on Wednesday but comes back to New  
York on Thursday with Niagara Falls among her planned stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Her itinerary is considered part of her work as first lady and  
is being paid for by U.S. taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an exploratory trip,'' she said. ``This is a trip  
filled with events and occasions, some of which I agreed to do 
months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll out Monday from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion indicates that New Yorkers may be cooling to her. The 
telephone poll of 512 registered voters showed her and a likely 
Republican candidate, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in a 
dead heat. Half of those polled said Mrs. Clinton should not run. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll just two months ago, Mrs. Clinton led Giuliani, 49  
percent to 38 percent. Each poll had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 4.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said it was going to be a cakewalk,'' said Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., who attended an event with Mrs. Clinton in Central 
Park. ``This is going to be a tough, tough race, but I think as 
people get to know her, she'll do better and better.''

<HEADLINE> Stakes Behind the Census Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the political struggle over the 2000  
census, there is a collision just ahead -- the money for it runs out 
in less than two months, and congressional Republicans will use 
that leverage in their effort to block a planned double count. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration still plans a traditional head count, to be  
followed by a statistically adjusted census. 
</P>
<P>
	In this dispute, there's always another chapter --  
understandably, given the future congressional power and the 
billions of federal aid dollars involved in the decennial count of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a contentious issue since 1996, when the Clinton  
administration announced plans to use statistical sampling, a sort 
of polling technique, to measure the 10 percent of the population 
most difficult to count, and therefore most likely to be missed in 
a census conducted the traditional way. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be done the constitutional way, Republicans said, and  
began trying to bar sampling to adjust the 2000 figures. The 
Constitution requires an ``actual enumeration'' of the population 
every decade to apportion the 435 House seats among the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled on Jan. 25 that there must be a head  
count without sampling to reallocate seats in the House among the 
states after 2000. But it didn't preclude the use of 
sampling-adjusted census numbers when the states draw their 
congressional and legislative district lines. And that's the point 
of maximum political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	By Census Bureau estimate, 1.4 percent of the population went  
uncounted in the 1990 census, the first to be judged less accurate 
than the one before it. The Republican administration and the 
Democratic Congress then in power asked the National Academy of 
Sciences to consider ways to avoid a replay in 2000. That led to 
the sampling plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue isn't statistical, it is political, because most  
of the missing persons in the last census, and presumably the next 
one, are from lower-income and minority neighborhoods, precincts 
most likely to be Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampling to count them in would work to Republican disadvantage.  
The GOP contends that sampling would conjure up people who don't 
exist, risk rigging by the administration and, according to the 
party chairman, add nearly 4 1/2 million Democrats to the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson said that would put Republican control of the  
House and state legislatures at risk. An analysis conducted for the 
Republican National Committee two years ago said sampling could 
cost the GOP 24 House seats. The current House has only 11 more 
Republicans than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats cite those warnings now in saying that the Republicans  
made a partisan issue of the census. Republicans argue the 
opposite, and say their concerns are about an honest, 
constitutional count without the estimates and guesswork they say 
would go into sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest census debate, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode  
Island, chairman of the Democrats' House campaign committee, said 
it was curious to hear Republicans saying they didn't want politics 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello everybody,'' he said. ``This is the most political issue  
we will probably face in the next two years. ... This goes to who 
is going to control this House for the next 10 to 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also will determine the allocation of $182 billion a year in  
federal aid distributed on the basis of population. 
</P>
<P>
	Which would leave the political dispute. It was on display when  
the House passed a bill to require a nine-week window after the 
head count, during which local governments could review the numbers 
and seek adjustments. ``It invites 39,000 individual jurisdictions 
to tell us that they have more people than we found,'' said Rep. 
Dan Miller of Florida, the Republican point man on the census. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said it invites delay, costs money, and failed when it  
was tried in 1990. They said the Republicans are trying to put in 
wrinkles to strengthen their hand against sampling. The bill passed 
on party lines April 14 and was sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown issue is coming soon. The appropriation for the  
census, and for the entire Departments of Commerce, State and 
Justice, plus the federal courts, runs out on June 15. Congress set 
an early expiration date for the spending by those departments, to 
keep leverage on the census issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to prevent spending for sampling and a  
two-number census. Democrats say that an appropriations bill 
barring sampling would invite a veto.

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Support for Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Seeking a political solution to the Kosovo crisis,  
Russian diplomats conferred with representatives from Islamic 
nations and ex-Soviet states, but there were no signs of progress. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of the countries in Tuesday's talks did not necessarily  
share Russia's opposition to the NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special mediator in the Yugoslav  
crisis, planned to visit the former Soviet states of Georgia, 
Azerbaijan and Ukraine in a bid to build support. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal of my mission is to look for a peaceful settlement,  
to seek ways out of the Balkan crisis,'' Chernomyrdin said upon 
arrival in Georgia, his first stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Chernomyrdin said his views largely coincided with  
those of Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet 
foreign minister who had previously announced his own five-point 
plan for ending the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``Genuine and all-around settlement of the conflict in  
Yugoslavia cannot be achieved without Russia's active 
participation,'' Shevardnadze said, according to ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine are all members of NATO's  
Partnership for Peace program. While they have called for a 
peaceful settlement to the Kosovo crisis, they have not issued 
strong condemnations of the bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	All three countries have sought to develop strong ties with the  
West in the post-Soviet era. Their presidents are heading to 
Washington this week for NATO's 50th anniversary celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has invited Russia to send a delegation to the NATO summit,  
but Secretary of State Madeline Albright said in Washington that it 
was not clear if Russia would participate. Russia has suspended 
cooperation with NATO to protest the air assault on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov hosted a  
delegation from the Organization of the Islamic Conference, led by 
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi. 
</P>
<P>
	While Russia has sided with Yugoslavia, many Muslim nations feel  
more sympathetic toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, who are 
overwhelmingly Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iranian foreign minister praised Russia's efforts to find a  
peaceful settlement, but said the most important thing was to halt 
``all repressive action'' by the Yugoslav government against the 
Kosovo Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin last week tapped Chernomyrdin, a  
former prime minister, to serve as his mediator in the Yugoslav 
crisis. So far, Chernomyrdin has not offered any new peace 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin reiterated that Russia did not want the Kosovo crisis to  
undermine Russia's ties with Western countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot break off relations with leading world powers,''  
Yeltsin was quoted as saying by his spokesman, Dmitry Yakushkin. 
Yeltsin has ruled out Russian military intervention in the Yugoslav 
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Radcliffe College, Harvard To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Radcliffe College, which has clung to  
existence during more than a generation of change, announced 
Tuesday it will merge fully with Harvard University and cease to 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
	Radcliffe will no longer educate undergraduates. Instead, the  
120-year-old Seven Sister school will next year become the 
Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, for graduate education 
only. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of a college president, Radcliffe will now have a dean  
who will make decisions about the institute in consultation with 
Harvard's president. 
</P>
<P>
	That puts Radcliffe in the same league as Harvard's business,  
law, divinity and education graduate schools, with one major 
exception: Radcliffe will not grant degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's long-rumored announcement is as much an end of an era  
as a beginning of a new one, said Mary Maples Dunn, director of 
Radcliffe's Schlesinger Library. She will become the institute's 
interim leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Institute for Advanced Study is going to become probably  
the best such institute in the country and the only one with a 
strong emphasis on women,'' said Maples Dunn, former president of 
Smith College. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine said: ``We are creating  
something that will have extraordinary intellectual power and 
visibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Radcliffe was established in 1879 under the name the ``Harvard  
Annex'' as an alternative to women who were denied access to 
Harvard. Fifteen years later came the name honoring Ann Radcliffe, 
who established Harvard's first scholarship in 1643. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until 1943 -- with Harvard's men off fighting in World  
War II -- that Radcliffe women were allowed to take classes at 
Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	The diminution of the school began in 1963, when Radcliffe  
seniors received Harvard diplomas signed by the presidents of both 
colleges. In 1975, a joint admissions office opened. 
</P>
<P>
	The real turning point came in 1977, when Radcliffe ceased to be  
an independent undergraduate institution. Radcliffe still admitted 
female students, but they studied at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard women still receive diplomas with Radcliffe and Harvard  
seals, although the Class of 1999 will be one of the last, if not 
the last, to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Beginning next year, women applicants will apply only to  
Harvard, just as men do. 
</P>
<P>
	Radcliffe becomes just the latest women's school to merge with  
its one-time brother institution. New York's Columbia University 
and the all-female Barnard College is one of the few partnerships 
that still exists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Radcliffe Institute will specialize in gender issues and  
will be open to women and men. Radcliffe has been well known in 
recent years for its Bunting Institute for female scholars and its 
publishing course for aspiring editors. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger brought mixed reaction from undergraduates.  
</P>
<P>
	``I may have been educated academically at Harvard, but  
Radcliffe gave me so many things that Harvard couldn't,'' said a 
disappointed Mia Bagneris, a 21-year-old senior from New Orleans. 
``A whole group of us feel a connection to Radcliffe.''

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Billboards Are Coming Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- In the Marlboro Man's hometown and across  
the nation, cigarette billboards that were once a celebrated part 
of the American landscape are coming down this week as part of the 
national settlement with the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In many places, the rugged cowboy with the cigarette dangling  
from the corner of his mouth will yield to images of young children 
delivering anti-smoking messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the $206 billion agreement between the tobacco industry  
and 46 states to settle state claims for smoking-related health 
costs, all cigarette billboards must be removed by Friday. The 
agreement allows states to take over billboard leases that had been 
held by tobacco companies and put anti-smoking ads on them at the 
companies' expense until the leases expire. 
</P>
<P>
	In Richmond -- where Philip Morris makes Marlboros and other  
brands at the world's largest cigarette plant -- one new billboard 
shows a young girl and a younger boy and reads: ``My sister never 
told me not to smoke. She showed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billboards in other states feature children declaring, ``It's  
time we made smoking history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New signs in Washington state show a sinking Titanic with the  
slogan ``Tobacco Kills a Titanic Full of Washingtonians. Every 10 
Weeks.'' More than 1,500 people died when the Titanic sank in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the changes, tobacco images like the Marlboro Man and  
R.J. Reynolds' Joe Camel will remain ingrained in the public's 
consciousness, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who saw them as part of American visual folklore will  
continue to refer to them,'' said James Fraser, library director at 
Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, N.J., and author of 
``The American Billboard: 100 Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Hayes, spokeswoman for the Outdoor Advertising  
Association of America in Washington, D.C., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're definitely part of the American landscape,'' she said.  
``People will continue to have an appreciation for them as a part 
of Americana, a part of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the best-known signs: a Camel billboard that for 25 years  
blew smoke rings into New York's Times Square before a Winston 
billboard displaced it in 1966. In West Hollywood, Calif., a 
64-foot-tall Marlboro Man overlooked the Sunset Strip before he was 
recently retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Health activists welcome the removal of such attention-grabbing  
gimmicks, which they have long claimed were designed to appeal to 
children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they say more needs to be done.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get rid of this pervasive, highly visible form of  
tobacco advertising,'' said Eric Lindblom of the Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted that the settlement still allows ads no larger than  
14 square feet to be displayed at businesses that sell or 
manufacture tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rather large loophole,'' he said. ``That means they can  
put those signs anywhere that sells cigarettes even if it were 
right next to a school or playground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Banzhaf III, executive director of Action on Smoking and  
Health, a Washington-based anti-smoking group, said the demise of 
tobacco billboards is a mostly symbolic victory. Increasing 
cigarette taxes and imposing more restrictions on public smoking 
would have greater practical effect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this tricks people into thinking we're making real  
progress, it's more harmful than helpful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From a business standpoint, neither the tobacco companies nor  
the outdoor advertising industry see the loss of cigarette 
billboards a major blow. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry spends about $505 million a year on ads,  
about 30 percent of it on outdoor advertising, said the research 
firm Competitive Media Reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Crosslin, spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in  
Winston-Salem, N.C., said her company will rely more on ``print, 
direct-mail to age-verified smokers, and special events in 
age-restricted venues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry voluntarily gave up broadcast advertising  
in the early 1970s to avoid a government ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hayes estimated the tobacco industry accounted for about 9  
percent of the $2.3 billion spent on billboards in 1998, but the 
figure had been steadily dropping since the mid-1980s. She said she 
expects ads from luxury car makers and Internet providers to make 
up for the lost tobacco ads.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Headstart Chief Accused of Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The former director of a Headstart program has  
been charged with embezzling $250,000 intended to help poor 
families. 
</P>
<P>
	Beatrice Richardson, 49, surrendered to police Monday and  
appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis, who released 
her on $200,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors accused Ms. Richardson of diverting the money from  
the program to a clothing business, her sons' fledgling companies, 
her daughter's college tuition and an ex-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson allegedly had three seamstresses from her  
clothing company, B-Rich Clothing, working in a Headstart program 
room meant to be used as a children's classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the government's allegations are incorrect,'' said Ms.  
Richardson's lawyer, Richard Willstatter, who wouldn't comment 
further. Ms. Richardson refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson's children were not accused of wrongdoing. Among  
them is director Matty Rich, who was 19 when he released the 
critically acclaimed 1991 movie ``Straight Out of Brooklyn,'' about 
the downfall of a black working-class Brooklyn family. Prosecutors 
said a movie company co-owned by Rich and his mother, plus a music 
company owned by another son, received more than $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Richardson, who now lives in Clearwater, Fla., was charged  
with writing unauthorized checks to benefit herself and her family 
while she was program director of the Metro North Association's 
Headstart program between 1991-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Headstart programs are meant to benefit preschool children  
whose parents are on public assistance or whose income is below the 
poverty level. 
</P>
<P>
	The city initially investigated because its Administration for  
Children's Services, which administers the program on behalf of the 
federal government, reported questionable expenses in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted on embezzlement charges, Ms. Richardson could face  
a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Global Economy Will Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global economy, badly shaken by a  
20-month-old currency crisis that has pushed one-third of the world 
into recession, should stabilize this year and enjoy a solid 
rebound by 2000, the International Monetary Fund predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the financial crisis hit in July 1997,  
the IMF said it was able to revise its previous outlook upward a 
bit instead of being forced to admit it had been too optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the IMF's ``World Economic Outlook'' projected global  
growth of 2.3 percent. While that would be lower than last year's 
2.5 percent, it represented a slight 0.1 percent increase from the 
last IMF forecast issued in December. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2000, the IMF was even more optimistic, predicting a solid  
recovery, with world output increasing by 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's 1999 outlook was bolstered by a sizable upward  
revision in expectations for the United States. In December, the 
outlook predicted U.S. growth would slow to 1.8 percent. But it now 
believes the U.S. economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, slowing 
to 2.2 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That was offset somewhat by worse-than-expected performance in  
Japan and Latin America, which became the latest victim of the 
global currency crisis in January when Brazil was forced to devalue 
its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief economist, said the agency  
was fairly confident that the currency crisis was bottoming out and 
the foundation laid for a solid recovery next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For that recovery to be fully realized, the IMF said, the United  
States must achieve a ``soft landing'' with growth slowing to a 
more sustainable pace to keep inflation pressures at bay. Japan, 
the second-largest economy, will have to finally exhibit signs of 
emerging from its worst recession in a half-century, and Europe 
must find a way to bolster growth, which in recent months has been 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation IMF released its new assessment of the global  
economy in advance of the lending institution's spring meeting at 
which time finance ministers are expected to resume efforts to put 
in place a new global financial architecture to make the world less 
vulnerable to Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF forecasters saw little concern that the NATO bombing  
campaign in Yugoslavia will trigger serious economic turmoil beyond 
neighboring countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy was projected to shrink again this year, with  
output falling 1.4 percent -- double last year's plunge. The IMF 
said, however, there are hopeful signs Japan is finally emerging 
from its decade-long period of weakness. It predicted an end to the 
Japanese recession and slight growth of 0.3 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF was even more optimistic about other Asian countries,  
where plunging currencies and stock markets in 1997 marked the 
start of the financial turmoil that spread to Russia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Activity has recently turned around in Korea and seems to have  
bottomed out in Malaysia and Thailand,'' the IMF said. ``Investor 
sentiment toward many emerging market economies has rallied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This represented a much more positive view than just six months  
ago. After Russia defaulted on billions of dollars in debt, 
financial markets around the world were thrown into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve responded with a series of U.S. interest  
rate cuts that restored confidence and sent U.S. markets headed to 
new highs.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Won't Show Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thai banks' earnings for the first  
three months of the year are unlikely to reflect the severity of 
the damage they've suffered from problem loans, analysts said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the quarterly results due out Wednesday will probably  
indicate that few banks have begun earmarking sufficient cash 
reserves against losses from problem loans -- which account for 
almost half of total lending. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because most have not been pressured to boost reserves in  
the first quarter by the crisis hit Southeast Asian country's 
central bank, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority of Thai banks will take as little provisioning as  
they have to,'' Peter Redhead, head of research at ING Barings in 
Bangkok, told Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Bank of Thailand rules, commercial banks don't have to  
meet stricter loan-loss reserve requirements until the middle of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Bangkok Bank, the country's largest, and Thai Farmers Bank,  
which have both successfully raised shareholder equity in the 
January to March period, have the capital base to continue 
prudently setting aside cash reserves well above minimum 
requirements, industry watchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks are likely to post much greater losses than other  
banks as they dip into reserves for bad loan write-offs. But they 
already have met their mid-year funding requirements and continue 
to accumulate funds to shore up their capital bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Other banks might post results which look better than the  
previous quarter -- although still in the red -- due to low 
provisioning and improving operating results. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said a decline in fixed deposit rates late last year,  
which in effect brings down a bank's cost for funds, also will 
begin to show up in better operating results in the first quarter 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-month fixed rates have fallen to around 5 percent at most  
commercial banks, compared to 8 percent about six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks that might seem to do be doing better on the basis of  
Wednesday's results but will come under intense pressure to step up 
reserve funding in the second quarter include Thai Military Bank 
and Bank of Ayudhya, said Kavee Chukitkasem, banking analyst at 
Capital Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	With improved conditions for raising money through equity  
financing, analysts say banks should now provision above 
requirements to free up capital for new lending -- something seen as 
crucial for economic recovery in Thailand.

<HEADLINE>  25 May Be Dead in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two students in black trench coats swept  
through their suburban high school with guns and explosives in a 
horrifying suicide attack Tuesday that left as many as 25 people 
dead. Several students said the killers were gunning for minorities 
and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was by far the bloodiest in a string of school shootings that  
have rocked U.S. communities over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them opened his cape and had a shotgun. Finally I  
started figuring out these guys shot to kill, for no reason,'' said 
a student, Nick Foss. The gunman ``didn't say anything. When he 
looked at me, the guy's eyes were just dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen -- both juniors at Columbine High School in this  
Denver suburb -- were found dead in the school library with 
self-inflicted gunshot wounds and what appeared to be bombs around 
their bodies, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Sheriff John Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Students said the killers, whose names were not released,  
apparently belonged to a clique of outcasts called the ``Trench 
Coat Mafia'' who wore long black coats, boasted of owning guns and 
disliked blacks, Hispanics and football players. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said that the motive for the attack was unknown and that  
school officials had not heard reports of trouble from the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said 20 to 25 people were killed, students and teachers  
alike. But by late Tuesday, officers had yet to remove any bodies -- 
which were in rooms throughout the school -- because of the danger 
of explosives and the need to preserve evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents and police SWAT teams slowly made their way through  
the building. At least 12 bombs were found inside the school, some 
set up as booby traps, Stone said. ``It's like walking through a 
minefield,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives also were found in two cars in the school parking  
lot, with one bomb rigged to blow up a gas tank, Stone said. Also, 
the gunmen's homes were being searched, and a bomb was found in 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents had to wait anxiously for word about their children  
even 10 hours after the shootings. They gathered at a nearby 
elementary school and answered questions from investigators, who 
were trying to identify the victims based on what they were 
wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Although authorities told parents to go home and come back in  
the morning, some refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 23 people were hospitalized, most of them with gunshot  
wounds. One girl suffered nine shrapnel wounds. At least 10 victims 
were in critical or serious condition; one was in guarded 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack began at 11:30 a.m. The killers, wearing fatigues and  
trench coats, started firing in the parking lot and then entered 
the school. They shot as they walked into the cafeteria, then 
walked upstairs to the library and continued firing with what were 
thought to be semiautomatic weapons and a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullets ricocheted off lockers as students sprinted for the  
exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them  
shooting,'' said Jake Apoeaca, 16. ``He saw us and then he started 
shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt threw two hand 
grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we started 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Frank, an 18-year-old senior, said he saw one of the  
killers shoot someone point-blank in the back with a 2-foot gun, 
possibly a sawed-off shotgun. ``He was just casually walking,'' 
Frank said. ``He wasn't in any hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from a second-floor  
window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by two SWAT team 
members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, a series of school shootings around the country have  
led to demands for stricter laws, tighter security and closer 
monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed in an 
attack in Pearl, Miss., three in West Paducah, Ky., five in 
Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said: ``Perhaps now America  
will wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it could 
happen in a place like Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Lammers, 17, was among several Columbine High students who  
said the gunmen were targeting minorities and athletes at the 
1,800-student high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said the killers might have been part of a group of  
eight to 10 students known as the Trench Coat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, 16, said several members of the Trench Coat Mafia  
had a video production class and made a video about guns they had. 
He also said that several members recently bragged about getting 
new guns, and that he heard members making derogatory remarks about 
blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really dark people,'' Lammers said. ``There were a lot  
of jokes that one day they might snap or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hours after the attack, wounded victims lay inside the  
building and police were unable to get to them because they feared 
that the gunmen might still be alive and holding hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hundreds of officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers hugged parents and each other and wept and they  
recalled the shootings. Some students had called their parents on 
cellular phones from inside the building to whisper that they were 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
	As TV images of the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter  
ambulances used a sports field as a landing pad, and officers in 
helmets and camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. Students 
who fled the building wept and held their hands above their heads 
while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	Four youths were taken in for questioning after the attack. One  
was led away from the school in handcuffs and three were stopped in 
a field near the school. Authorities said the four were friends of 
the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Nielsen, a 17-year-old junior, said the attack reminded him  
of a violent scene in Keanu Reeves' latest movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the guys pulled open his trench coat and started  
shooting,'' he said. ``It was a scene right out of the movie 
`Matrix.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A girl who gave her name as Janine said two young men wearing  
black trench coats ``walked down the stairs and they started 
shooting people. We didn't think it was real and then we saw 
blood.'' Her voice broke with anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff,''  
she said. ``Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We 
saw three people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something 
blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. Nearby schools were locked 
down after the attack, with students prohibited from entering or 
leaving for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Colorado Rockies and basketball's Denver Nuggets  
postponed their Tuesday night games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Legislature has been debating a bill that would  
allow people to carry concealed weapons, and the shootings brought 
emotional reaction from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's supporters said a teacher or administrator with a  
concealed gun could have stopped the tragedy; its opponents said 
the rampage was evidence that society is already overrun with guns.

<HEADLINE> Ventriloquist Wences Dies at 103 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Senor Wences, the master ventriloquist who  
delighted ``Ed Sullivan Show'' audiences by bantering in a comic 
Spanish accent with his puppet-in-a-box Pedro (``S'OK?'' 
``S'awright!'') and his falsetto-voiced hand puppet Johnny, died 
Tuesday at 103. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish-born Wences, whose real name was Wenceslao Moreno,  
died at his home in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Golden Age of television in the 1950s and '60s,  
Wences bickered and bantered with his puppets while he drank, 
smoked and juggled. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his puppets was gravelly-voiced Pedro, who consisted only  
of a head in a box. Pedro was born out of necessity when Wences' 
ventriloquist's dummy was damaged and only the head was spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Another puppet was Johnny, whose comeback line was: ``Deefeecult  
for you, easy for me.'' Wences created Johnny by scrunching up his 
fist, drawing a mouth where thumb and index finger met, and draping 
a blond wig over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Wences would talk to his puppets with his face right in theirs,  
as if daring the audience to watch his lips, which, of course, 
never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro's voice would become clearer as the door to his box  
opened, and muffled as it closed. Audiences forgot the sound was 
really coming from outside the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Wences would stuff a hankie in Johnny's mouth and have the  
puppet speak with a muffled voice while he himself smoked a 
cigarette. Then he would give Johnny a drag, and the puppet -- that 
is, Wences' hand -- would somehow emit perfect smoke rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of us were in awe of Wences,'' ventriloquist Jimmy Nelson  
once said. ``He could get laughs just by saying, `S'awright!' And I 
still don't know how he got those smoke rings out of Johnny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no jokes, just what one writer has described as  
``bizarre, farcical, Spanish-accented patter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing he taught me was it's not about the joke,''  
said twentysomething ventriloquist Michele LaFong, who became 
friends with Wences and inherited his original Pedro and Johnny 
puppets. ``Even though you know what's coming, you laugh anyway. 
That's the difference between someone who relies on a punch line or 
someone who's just plain funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between his many Sullivan show appearances, he entertained  
four presidents, toured with Dean Martin &AMP; Jerry Lewis, did a 
Broadway show with Danny Kaye and played every casino in Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a precise, economical act: 19 minutes with a one-minute  
encore. He would ask the promoter for only a card table and a glass 
of water. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued touring into his early 90s.  
</P>
<P>
	Wences was born in Penarada, Spain, and discovered his gift for  
mimicry amusing his classmates in grade school. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1934, when he came to the United States, Wences was  
conventional -- ``another ventriloquist with a dummy,'' as he put 
it. But two years later, en route to Chicago, his act was 
transformed when his dummy, Pedro, was crushed in a baggage car 
accident. Wences bought a box, stuck the head inside, and -- on 
stage that day -- inquired if he was OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro replied: ``S'awright!''  
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service and burial will be held in Spain this  
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Say NATO Slows Down War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO's cumbersome procedures are sharply  
limiting Army Gen. Wesley Clark's military options in Yugoslavia, 
some lawmakers are suggesting. ``The NATO consulting process is 
slowing down the war,'' said Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``And if you win it -- what do you win? First prize is 50 years  
in Kosovo. I'm not sure that's a prize I want to win,'' Bennett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional frustration is increasing over NATO's caution and  
its constant need for a consensus -- amounting to what many suggest 
is a war by committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``But for NATO, we would not be in this fight, and because of  
NATO, we can't win this fight,'' Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., told 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright as she defended NATO's role 
on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	She strongly disagreed -- although conceded NATO's was a little  
rusty as a military machine. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is the right instrument, and while it has never fought a  
war, it is doing a pretty darn good job doing it,'' she said. ``We 
need to hone it, but we are on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But calls are increasing in the Republican-led Senate for more  
direct action to stop Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 
aggression against Kosovo's ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of seven senators led by 2000 GOP  
presidential hopeful John McCain of Arizona filed a resolution 
Tuesday that would authorize ground troops in Kosovo -- even though 
the administration has not requested them. 
</P>
<P>
	``When a president threatens a war he should plan for it,''  
McCain said late Tuesday in satellite remarks to the National 
Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas. ``President 
Clinton seems neither to have a plan A nor a plan B.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers have called for even more direct action to try  
to overthrow Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should put a Tomahawk missile through Milosevic's  
bedroom window,'' said Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted 
Stevens, R-Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	But removing Milosevic is not part of NATO's strategy.  
</P>
<P>
	Albright made that clear earlier Tuesday at a White House  
briefing when asked if she thought Milosevic should be removed -- 
and how that would be achieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is not ... our goal for this conflict,'' she responded.  
</P>
<P>
	That goal, ``as we have all said, is to try to get the Serb  
forces out of Kosovo, the refugees back into Kosovo and have the 
protection of an international security force,'' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	The bombing campaign is not a U.S.-only operation, but is  
subject to review by the other 18 NATO countries. And NATO may need 
Milosevic one day to enforce terms of a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States says its prefers to have a democratic  
government in place in Belgrade -- but is short on details on how 
that might be accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's cautious position toward Milosevic was underscored  
Tuesday when British Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested allies 
will ``carry on until he does step down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman, quickly clarified Blair's  
remarks by saying NATO policy was to get Milosevic to ``back down'' 
rather than ``step down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To be sure, the four-week-old air campaign against Yugoslavia is  
run by a four-star American Army general -- Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	But military planners from other NATO nations are closely  
watching over his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've been able to strengthen the consensus process in  
NATO,'' Clark recently told a group of U.S. reporters in his 
command post in Mons, Belgium, about 30 miles from NATO 
headquarters in Brussels. ``And I think that's very evident in the 
increasingly smooth flow of the air campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers who have been to Europe to meet with Clark tell a  
different story, suggesting he is being hamstrung. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Clark just does not have the options he needs,'' said  
Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Foreign Relations 
Committee. ``He needs a consensus finding for targets and for 
objectives. As a result, General Clark is bound by that 
consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bad omen for NATO on the eve of its 50th anniversary  
celebration? 
</P>
<P>
	Not really, said Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, senior Democrat on  
the Armed Services Committee, and a strong NATO booster. And he 
says he fully expects NATO to be around for its 100th birthday, as 
well, ``because it serves an ongoing useful function.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's extraordinary how NATO's new nations, like Hungary, are  
willing to take risks for a common cause here,'' Levin said. ``And 
the common cause this time is an important one. NATO will prove 
itself by succeeding in not allowing Milosevic to ethnically 
cleanse Kosovo.''

the building. At least 12 bombs were found inside the school, some 
set up as booby traps, Stone said. ``It's like walking through a 
minefield,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosives also were found in two cars in the school parking  
lot, with one bomb rigged to blow up a gas tank, Stone said. Also, 
the gunmen's homes were being searched, and a bomb was found in 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Many parents had to wait anxiously for word about their children  
even 10 hours after the shootings. They gathered at a nearby 
elementary school and answered questions from investigators, who 
were trying to identify the victims based on what they were 
wearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Although authorities told parents to go home and come back in  
the morning, some refused to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 23 people were hospitalized, most of them with gunshot  
wounds. One girl suffered nine shrapnel wounds. At least 10 victims 
were in critical or serious condition; one was in guarded 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack began at 11:30 a.m. The killers, wearing fatigues and  
trench coats, started firing in the parking lot and then entered 
the school. They shot as they walked into the cafeteria, then 
walked upstairs to the library and continued firing with what were 
thought to be semiautomatic weapons and a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullets ricocheted off lockers as students sprinted for the  
exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them  
shooting,'' said Jake Apoeaca, 16. ``He saw us and then he started 
shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt threw two hand 
grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we started 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Frank, an 18-year-old senior, said he saw one of the  
killers shoot someone point-blank in the back with a 2-foot gun, 
possibly a sawed-off shotgun. ``He was just casually walking,'' 
Frank said. ``He wasn't in any hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from a second-floor  
window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by two SWAT team 
members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, a series of school shootings around the country have  
led to demands for stricter laws, tighter security and closer 
monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed in an 
attack in Pearl, Miss., three in West Paducah, Ky., five in 
Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said: ``Perhaps now America  
will wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it could 
happen in a place like Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Lammers, 17, was among several Columbine High students who  
said the gunmen were targeting minorities and athletes at the 
1,800-student high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said the killers might have been part of a group of  
eight to 10 students known as the Trench Coat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, 16, said several members of the Trench Coat Mafia  
had a video production class and made a video about guns they had. 
He also said that several members recently bragged about getting 
new guns, and that he heard members making derogatory remarks about 
blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really dark people,'' Lammers said. ``There were a lot  
of jokes that one day they might snap or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hours after the attack, wounded victims lay inside the  
building and police were unable to get to them because they feared 
that the gunmen might still be alive and holding hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hundreds of officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers hugged parents and each other and wept and they  
recalled the shootings. Some students had called their parents on 
cellular phones from inside the building to whisper that they were 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
	As TV images of the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter  
ambulances used a sports field as a landing pad, and officers in 
helmets and camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. Students 
who fled the building wept and held their hands above their heads 
while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	Four youths were taken in for questioning after the attack. One  
was led away from the school in handcuffs and three were stopped in 
a field near the school. Authorities said the four were friends of 
the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Nielsen, a 17-year-old junior, said the attack reminded him  
of a violent scene in Keanu Reeves' latest movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the guys pulled open his trench coat and started  
shooting,'' he said. ``It was a scene right out of the movie 
`Matrix.''' 
</P>
<P>
	A girl who gave her name as Janine said two young men wearing  
black trench coats ``walked down the stairs and they started 
shooting people. We didn't think it was real and then we saw 
blood.'' Her voice broke with anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff,''  
she said. ``Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We 
saw three people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something 
blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. Nearby schools were locked 
down after the attack, with students prohibited from entering or 
leaving for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Colorado Rockies and basketball's Denver Nuggets  
postponed their Tuesday night games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Legislature has been debating a bill that would  
allow people to carry concealed weapons, and the shootings brought 
emotional reaction from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's supporters said a teacher or administrator with a  
concealed gun could have stopped the tragedy; its opponents said 
the rampage was evidence that society is already overrun with guns.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Addresses Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton made a new pitch  
for a variety of health care reforms today but acknowledged her 
failure in previous efforts to overhaul health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to her ambitious and ultimately unsuccessful attempt  
in 1994 to fundamentally change health care, Mrs. Clinton said that 
she now comes ``from the school of smaller steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spoke on day two of her road trip to New York,  
where she is considering running for the U.S. Senate in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech on health care reform at Hofstra University, the  
first lady expressed support for her husband's proposal to use part 
of the federal budget surplus to prop up Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she would support a patient's bill of rights so that  
people covered by HMOs can see specialists and get treatment as 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	She said measures also must be taken to provide health care  
insurance to people frequently not covered currently: millions of 
children, young people working in their first jobs and people who 
are not yet old enough for Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	She was honored at the university for her public service.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, she visited the Village Elementary School in  
Syosset, examining African dwarf frogs and plant life with some 
third-graders. 
</P>
<P>
	She returns to Washington on Wednesday but comes back to New  
York on Thursday with Niagara Falls among her planned stops. Her 
itinerary is considered part of her work as first lady and is being 
paid for by U.S. taxpayers. The school visit, for example, had as 
its theme the promotion of excellence in education. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an exploratory trip,'' she said. ``This is a trip  
filled with events and occasions, some of which I agreed to do 
months ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, when she crammed eight events around Manhattan into a  
14-hour tour, she had a simple explanation for New Yorkers on why 
she's considering running for office in a state where she's never 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love New York to start with -- I always have,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for her potential candidacy for the Senate seat being vacated  
next year by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, she would say only, 
``I'm obviously still considering and exploring and am very 
interested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll out Monday from Marist College's Institute for Public  
Opinion indicates that New Yorkers may be cooling to her. The 
telephone poll of 512 registered voters showed her and a likely 
Republican candidate, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, in a 
dead heat. Half of those polled said Mrs. Clinton should not run. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll just two months ago, Mrs. Clinton led Giuliani by 49  
percent to 38 percent. Each poll had a margin of error of plus or 
minus 4.5 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one said it was going to be a cakewalk,'' said Sen. Charles  
Schumer, D-N.Y., who attended an event with Mrs. Clinton on Monday 
in Central Park. ``This is going to be a tough, tough race, but I 
think as people get to know her, she'll do better and better.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Reports Atrocities by Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Taking advantage of clear weather,  
NATO blasted tanks, military barracks and communications sites 
today as U.S. helicopters and troops headed toward Albania to boost 
the alliance's ability to attack Yugoslav ground forces. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO reported a series of ``disturbing developments'' today in  
the fourth week of allied airstrikes -- reports ``too numerous'' to 
ignore -- of Serb soldiers raping ethnic Albanian women, using tear 
gas to move ethnic Albanians out of homes in Pristina and 
``mixing'' into civilian convoys. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Serb military and paramilitary  
forces were staging ``a kind of safari operation,'' shelling hills 
where ethnic Albanians fled to flush them out, marching the 
refugees on roads, putting them on trains to the border and then 
closing the border to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Shea said the alliance was investigating reports of ethnic  
Albanians -- hands tied behind their backs -- being used as ``human 
shields in front of tanks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting was also reported inside Kosovo between ethnic Albanian  
rebels and Serb forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said 15  
wounded Kosovo Liberation Army fighters were brought to a hospital 
today in the Albanian border town of Bajram Curri, along with the 
bodies of two rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO commanders spoke of new accounts of mass executions,  
including ethnic Albanians flushed from their homes by Serb forces 
firing tear gas, and of ethnic cleansing operations spreading from 
Kosovo into the border villages of Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller 
republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the grim reports, NATO and its 19 allies intend ``to see  
this through to the end, no matter how long it takes ... until 
President (Slobodan) Milosevic backs down,'' Shea said at the 
briefing in Brussels, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright wouldn't go so far as to  
call for Milosevic's removal but said the Yugoslav people would 
``be better served by a democratic government that represents their 
values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flood of refugees from Kosovo slowed today, raising fears  
that Yugoslav soldiers were turning away those trying to flee. 
Ninety percent of Kosovo's 2 million people are ethnic Albanian, 
and Yugoslav forces have expelled an estimated 640,000 of them from 
the province since last month. 
</P>
<P>
	British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the NATO airstrikes that  
began March 24 have destroyed 50 percent of Milosevic's best 
fighter planes, the MiG-29s, 25 percent of its MiG-21s and 30 
percent of its Super Galebs, which he said are used in attacks on 
civilians in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, who met with Blair in  
Brussels, stressed that ``as we destroy and damage Milosevic's 
extensive military machine, we are also taking care of Milosevic's 
victims'' -- the waves of ethnic Albanians he has driven from the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. refugee agency, meanwhile, declared its camps in  
Macedonia full beyond capacity today, leaving 2,000-3,000 new 
arrivals from Kosovo stuck in a border no man's land. Another 2,000 
to 3,000 Kosovo Albanians successfully made their way over the 
mountains elsewhere in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 350,000 refugees already have reached Albania, but  
only a few crossed the border today. It was unclear whether 
fighting halted the flow or Serbs blocked it. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia's camps hold 46,600 of the 127,200 Kosovo Albanian  
refugees now in the country. As a stopgap, the U.N. refugee agency 
plans to expand refugee airlifts across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO, Blair said, had minimum, simple demands to end the  
conflict: Milosevic's forces ``get out of Kosovo,'' an 
international military force goes in and people be allowed to 
return to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The allies remain united in the battle, Albright said, promising  
to end Milosevic's and his military, paramilitary and police 
forces' ability to ``wage war on its own people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is trying to persuade her fellow foreign ministers to  
cut off shipments of refined oil to Yugoslavia as another way to 
cut into Milosevic's war machine, which launched its Kosovo 
crackdown in February 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Aided by good weather, NATO airpower reportedly targeted at  
least eight areas of Serbia and its Kosovo province, hitting 
particularly hard at Yugoslavia's third-largest city, Nis. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it struck six tanks, army barracks in Prizen, oil  
depots and an ammunition plant. It said all its aircraft returned 
to their bases safely. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian media reported one person was killed and 12 injured when  
NATO missiles slammed into a residential area of Nis, a southern 
industrial city that is the headquarters of Yugoslav forces in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav state media claimed that almost all sites struck today  
were non-military. In Nis, reports said 10 homes were destroyed, 
and the state-run Tanjug news agency said the country's main 
cigarette factory had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong anti-aircraft fire and explosions could be heard from  
Belgrade and Serbian media said the alliance struck a major 
telecommunications relay facility at Prilike. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Maj. Gen. Charles Wald said 24 Army Apache attack  
helicopters would probably arrive in Albania today. Small numbers 
of U.S. support troops have been arriving in Albania's capital this 
week in advance of the gunships. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopters are to attack Yugoslav forces in Kosovo in  
conjunction with ground-based multiple rocket launchers. The task 
force will involve 3,000 U.S. troops.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Executes Man for 2 Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A man who shot his uncle and another man a  
month after he got out of prison was executed by injection Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arthur Ray Jenkins III, 29, was convicted of capital murder in  
the October 1990 slayings of his uncle, Floyd Jenkins, 72, and Lee 
H. Brinklow, 69. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forgive me for my sins,'' Jenkins said shortly before his  
death, crying out several times as prison officials inserted the 
injection needles into his body. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins had been drinking when he went to a house shared by his  
uncle and Brinklow and got into an argument. He took a .22-caliber 
rifle from a bedroom and shot his uncle and Brinklow, then 
repeatedly stabbed the uncle. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins' attorneys said he was mentally ill as a result of years  
of physical and sexual abuse and received improper treatment during 
a previous prison stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Having been placed on anti-psychotic medication when he was 13,  
he was sentenced at the age of 16 to seven years in prison for 
burglary and grand larceny. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins was released from the jail in 1990 without supervision  
or medication, his lawyers said. He had been out 36 days when he 
committed the two murders.

<HEADLINE> Groups To Meet Bid Deadline for A's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Two groups of investors plan to meet  
Wednesday's deadline for putting down a $12 million deposit to buy 
the Athletics, a deal that would keep the team in Oakland through 
at least the 2004 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Under an agreement worked out months ago with current team  
owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann, public officials have until 
Wednesday to receive bids from investors willing to buy the team 
for $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
	If public officials cannot work out a deal to sell the team,  
Schott and Hofmann will have the right to sell or move the A's. San 
Jose has been mentioned as a city possibly interested in seeking 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	A's president Mike Crowley said Tuesday that two investor groups  
have expressed interest in bidding for the team, though neither has 
actually asked to see the club's books. 
</P>
<P>
	Another group of investors, the Mandalay Group, received  
pre-approval from major league baseball and did look briefly at the 
club's books, but decided not to bid, Crowley said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the groups expected to deposit $12 million in escrow by  
the Wednesday deadline includes former A's executive Andy Dolich, 
Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan and Bob Piccinini, the 
chairman of Modesto-based Save Mart Foods, who is providing the 
deposit for the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are going well,'' Dolich said. ``Our position has  
always been that we'll get it done by the close of business on the 
21st, if not sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other group expected to bid includes former pitcher Steve  
Stone, now a broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs, and former A's coach 
and New York Yankees general manager Bob Watson. That group's 
deposit will be provided mostly by Arizona banker Lyle Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of an agreement reached with Schott and Hofmann in  
October that set the sale price at $120 million, the Athletics 
agreed to remain at the Oakland Coliseum for at least three more 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The A's agreed to stay in Oakland through the end of the 2001  
season, with a right to extend their lease on a year-to-year basis 
through the 2004 season. When Schott and Hofmann bought the A's for 
$85 million in 1995, they signed a nine-year lease at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	If either of the investor groups buys the A's, they will be  
required to keep the team in Oakland through at least the end of 
the 2004 season.

<HEADLINE> Pastor To Lead Same-Sex Union Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A United Methodist pastor ordered suspended for  
blessing the ``marriage'' of two Chicago men will become director 
of a group working to lift the church's ban on same-sex unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Gregory Dell, pastor at Broadway United Methodist  
Church in Chicago, said he will become director of the group ``In 
All Things Charity'' when his suspension takes effect July 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are just a whole lot of clergy out there that have been  
caught not just in this law, but in others that have affected gay 
and lesbian clergy as well,'' he said Tuesday of the church law 
banning same-sex unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which has members throughout the Methodist church,  
was founded in 1997 and counts Dell's church among its sponsors, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, however, the group has had no staff. Dell says the  
group hopes to raise money to pay for him to travel and speak to 
Methodist pastors and members nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury of Methodist pastors in the church's Northern Illinois  
Conference last month ordered Dell suspended for deliberately 
disobeying church law when he presided over a same-sex union in 
September.

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Eating Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An egg a day really is OK, according to  
researchers who found that healthy people eating up to seven eggs a 
week didn't increase their risk for heart attacks or strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study doesn't mean that people should go back to the  
typical Western diet -- a breakfast with two eggs, bacon, sausage, 
butter and toast. This kind of diet is very unhealthy,'' said Dr. 
Frank B. Hu, whose research used data from two long-running 
landmark studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are afraid of eggs -- because the cholesterol is so high  
and their reputation is so bad,'' said Hu, a nutritional 
epidemiologist at Harvard School of Public Health. ``But eggs, per 
se -- I don't think they deserve such a bad reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics, however, did face higher risks of heart attacks or  
strokes with increased egg consumption, according to the study, 
which is being published in Wednesday's Journal of the American 
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A large egg contains about 215 milligrams of cholesterol -- far  
more than most other foods with the same number of calories. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the American Heart Association, which was not  
involved in the study, said the findings won't change her group's 
belief that Americans should limit their dietary cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``These new data do not conflict with the American Heart  
Association's recommendations that healthy individuals consume no 
more than 300 milligrams of dietary cholesterol per day,'' said the 
spokeswoman, Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's nutrition center at Tufts University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	She agreed with the study's authors and what many experts have  
said for a long time -- that it is more important to limit 
consumption of saturated fats and trans fats, the processed fats 
that make doughnuts, commercial cakes and french fries so 
delicious. 
</P>
<P>
	Hu, whose study was funded by the National Institutes of Health,  
noted that past research has shown dietary cholesterol to be less 
of a culprit than initially believed in raising levels of 
cholesterol in the blood. He said his is the first to actually look 
at whether egg consumption had an effect on the rate of heart 
attacks and strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	His findings come from data on 80,082 women in the Nurses'  
Health Study, based at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's 
Hospital. From 1980 to 1994, 939 women developed heart disease and 
563 had strokes. Also tracked were 37,851 men in the Health 
Professional Follow-up Study, based at Harvard School of Public 
Health. From 1986 to 1994, 866 developed heart disease and 258 had 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among healthy men and women, no significant differences in risk  
were found between those consuming an average of up to one egg 
daily and those averaging less than one weekly, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics who averaged eating one egg daily were at  
significantly higher risk than diabetics eating one egg or less a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes alters the body's ability to use cholesterol, a fatty  
substance important to in building cells and in making hormones. 
Cholesterol becomes an artery-clogger when the body develops an 
excess.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Is 'Principal for a Day' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Once you got past the 14-member security team and  
the barricades barring students from certain hallways, Marshall 
Metro looked like any other high school. To the left, the trophy 
case; to the right, Michael Jordan, the new principal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was told that I would be getting a visitor, but I thought it  
would be someone like Al Gore or Clinton,'' said consumer education 
and American history teacher Carol Rolowicz. ``But Michael Jordan? 
This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to this school, 
including when Oprah came 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, it was Michael Jordan holding court Tuesday as  
``Principal for a Day.'' In an effort to get businessmen and 
companies to support the educational process, the Chicago Public 
School system came up with the ``Principal for a Day'' program to 
benefit the children and the educational system. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,150 students enrolled at the West Side high school weren't  
concerned with the details of education. Their sole purpose was 
straining to catch a glimpse of the man whose name adorns their 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The young crowd was awestruck during an early assembly when they  
discovered that the man seated in front of them was ol' No. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	George Crockett's African-American history class reveled in  
rattling off questions to the 6-foot-6 Jordan, who managed to stuff 
his thin frame into a child's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you run for mayor?'' and ``Why don't you coach your  
own team?'' were tossed out in the short informal Q&AMP;A session. When 
there was an awkward pause, Jordan fell into afterschool special 
mode, reminding the young adults about the importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolowicz's class also steamed right ahead with questions,  
including: ``Are you going to buy the Hornets?'' and ``Will you be 
the speaker at our graduation?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A simple ``no, not right now'' was the response to the former,  
while a ``Ummm, I'd like to'' answered the latter. Requests for 
handshakes were abundant; confessions of love were few but adamant. 
</P>
<P>
	Nina Miles kept raising her hand for the principal's attention,  
while Jordan, displaying a Cheshire Cat grin, said, ``Yeah, I can 
feel the love in this room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Junior Mary Walker just stood in the back of the class, afraid  
to approach Jordan when it came time for a group photo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Did Ron Harper tell you what I told him to tell you?'' was all  
that she could say. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was that?'' Jordan asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hi,'' she said with an ``aw-shucks'' smile.  
</P>
<P>
	The students' awe lasted after His Airness left Crockett's  
class. A young student asked if she could sit in the chair Jordan 
recently vacated. Her teacher acquiesced, the teen smiled and made 
her way to the head of the class to sit atop the once and future 
Jordan throne. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just glad Rodman didn't come,'' Rolowicz added.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Details Kid's Online Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government described plans Tuesday for  
enforcing a new law that bans companies from collecting personal 
information from children on the Internet without a parent's 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission's proposed rules would require  
operators of commercial Web sites to make ``reasonable efforts'' in 
most cases to obtain consent from parents before asking children 
under 13 for their names, addresses, telephone numbers or other 
identifying details. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also would prohibit a company from enticing children  
with online games or prizes into disclosing ``more personal 
information than is reasonably necessary.'' They will be adopted 
after a 45-day public comment period and will take effect next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency didn't suggest in its rules how companies should  
contact parents for permission -- such as by e-mail or fax -- saying 
only that it ``must be reasonably calculated, in light of available 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said the agency sought to give  
control to parents over information about their kids, while also 
offering flexibility to different businesses on the Internet and to 
new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FTC, quite properly, left that open,'' said Ronald  
Plesser, an attorney who worked with the Direct Marketing 
Association and other groups. ``I think there will be a range of 
mechanisms. The beauty of technology is that today's problem is 
maybe an easy solution tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems facing regulators involve the faceless nature of  
the Internet, where children often know more about the technology 
than their parents and can easily impersonate an adult with a few 
mouse clicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants to protect children's privacy, but not  
through regulations so onerous they might discourage children from 
using the Internet or hinder the extraordinary potential for 
electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parental consent is the key provision,'' said Katharina Kopp,  
a policy expert at the Washington-based Center for Media Education, 
which lobbied for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 
passed by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without that, the whole legislation is really quite  
meaningless,'' Kopp said. ``We want the FTC to implement effective 
rules that don't create huge loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law doesn't require companies to obtain a parent's  
permission to collect a child's e-mail address to send him 
information on a one-time basis, such as a digital coupon for a 
video game. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proposed rules don't suggest ways companies might  
contact parents, the FTC said separately in a news release that 
possibilities include use of a credit card by a parent, a toll-free 
telephone number, a form signed by a parent or e-mail with new 
digital signature technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed to anticipate this was going to be a hot potato,''  
said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy 
group. ``Rather than put up something that would be shot down from 
all sides, they'll let the commentators fight it out and take what 
they see as a satisfactory compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also require companies to give parents the choice of  
whether to disclose information about their children to other 
businesses, and to review whatever details were collected from 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy law was prompted by an FTC study last year of 1,400  
Web sites, including one where children were asked to give their 
names, addresses, e-mail addresses and ages and say whether they 
ever received gifts of stocks, cash, savings bonds or certificates 
of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Vice President Al Gore hastily stripped from  
his Web site questions asking children for their names, e-mail 
addresses and zip codes after The Associated Press raised questions 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials maintained the questions would not have  
violated the new privacy law, which isn't yet in effect and covers 
only commercial Web sites, but they decided to remove them anyway.

<HEADLINE> Push On for Watercraft Speed Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government and the world's leading  
manufacturer of personal watercraft want the industry to limit the 
speed of water scooters to 65 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombardier Recreational Products, maker of Sea Doo models, took  
the lead Monday by announcing voluntary compliance with the limit 
on 2000 year models, going on sale early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We challenge the rest of the industry to join us in capping  
top speeds,'' said Henry Lonski, vice president and general manager 
of Sea Doo watercraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Hall, a Sea Doo spokeswoman, said: ``There's been this speed  
war going on for years within the watercraft industry. At some 
point it makes sense to address the issue. There's a real fine line 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard welcomed the initiative. According to its  
records, 4,070 personal watercraft were involved in accidents in 
1997. Of those, there were 84 drownings. 
</P>
<P>
	While no direct correlation has been made to speed, the National  
Transportation Safety Board said last year that most accidents 
involve operators who have little experience riding the powerful 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal is to provide a balance between fun and safety.  
Speeds in excess of 65 mph upset this delicate balance,'' said a 
statement issued by Capt. Michael Holmes, chief of the Coast 
Guard's Office of Boating Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack O'Dell, a Coast Guard spokesman, acknowledged that 65 mph  
is fast on either land or water, but he said the limit should help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think people understand: If you fall off a personal  
watercraft at a high rate of speed, it's just like falling off a 
motorcycle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Personal watercraft look much like a motorcycle on water, with  
handlebars and a seat that riders straddle. The standard piston 
engine is replaced with a jet that sucks in water, spits it out the 
tail and propels the craft through the ocean, up rivers or across 
lakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past decade, the machines have boomed in popularity.  
Sales peaked at 205,000 units in 1995, but 130,000 were sold last 
year. About 1.2 million now are in use nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	While sales have fallen recently, top speeds have increased from  
quick to hair-straightening. Kawasaki, which makes the Jet Ski 
model line, sells the Ultra 150, which has a top speed of 68 mph. 
Sea Doo's fastest, the XP, goes 63.5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall estimated that every 1 mph gain in speed costs a  
manufacturer $1 million in development costs. She said Bombardier 
could make a model to compete with Kawasaki's Ultra 150, but the 
money should be spent on making personal watercraft quieter and 
less polluting. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for Kawasaki and other leading manufacturers did not  
immediately return calls seeking comment on the Bombardier 
proposal.

<HEADLINE> Court Relaxes Insurance Deadlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it easier for  
states to relax some deadlines imposed by insurance companies for 
filing disability claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled unanimously that a California man's insurance  
claim may go forward even though he filed for benefits after the 
deadline. Specifically, the court concluded that a federal law does 
not override a California rule that requires insurance companies to 
pay some claims even though they were filed late. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves a much-litigated federal law that protects  
pensions and other employment benefits, the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act, known as ERISA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts had split on how ERISA affects states' efforts to  
let employees collect benefits even when they miss an insurance 
company's filing deadline. ERISA generally overrides state laws 
relating to employee benefit plans, but it does not override state 
laws that regulate insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling upholds the main part of a federal appeals court  
decision that revived a lawsuit filed by a California man who 
unsuccessfully sought long-term disability benefits from Unum Life 
Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	John E. Ward was president and chief executive officer of  
Management Analysis Corp. in San Diego until he resigned in May 
1992. At the time, he suffered from an illness diagnosed later that 
year as diabetic neuropathy. 
</P>
<P>
	He informed the company in mid-1993 he had been approved for  
Social Security disability benefits, but he was not told about the 
company's long-term disability plan through Unum. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1994, Ward found documents that indicated he was  
eligible for long-term disability payments from Unum. He applied, 
but his claim was rejected on grounds he missed the deadline to 
file within one year and 180 days after the onset of his 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward sued, but a federal judge ruled against him.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Ward's  
case based on a California rule that says insurers can't refuse to 
pay late-filed claims unless the delay in filing the claim actually 
harmed the insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also cited a California rule that says an  
employer acts as an insurance company's agent in administering 
group policies. The court said the notice Ward gave to the company 
in 1993 might count as on-time notice to the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said ERISA did not override either of those  
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court decided the 9th Circuit court was  
correct in saying the California rule on late-filed claims is not 
overridden by ERISA. 
</P>
<P>
	``By allowing a longer period to file than the minimum filing  
terms mandated by federal law, the (California) rule complements 
rather than contradicts ERISA and the regulations,'' Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the justices said ERISA does override the California  
rule that said an employer acts as an insurance company's agent. 
That rule ``would have a marked effect on plan administration,'' 
Ginsburg wrote, adding that it would force employers to take on a 
role it had not bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling allows the case to return to the lower court to  
determine whether Unum can avoid paying benefits to Ward by showing 
that his late notice caused harm to Unum. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Unum Life Insurance vs. Ward, 97-1868.

<HEADLINE> Japan Sees Bright Signs in Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Economic conditions remain severe throughout Japan,  
but recent public spending measures have begun to spark 
improvement, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday in a report on the 
nation's regional economies. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, based on findings of the ministry's branch offices,  
said that the employment situation remains severe in all regions 
and that capital spending is expected to fall further this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ministry added that public works have been greatly  
boosted under a record supplementary budget announced last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate bankruptcies have also dropped in most regions due to  
an emergency credit guarantee program established by the government 
last October, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other bright spots include signs that the slump in corporate  
earnings and industrial activity may be coming to an end, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry added that in some regions, personal consumption  
has shown signs of bottoming out, although it still remains 
generally sluggish.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Breast Cancer Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration has approved  
a device that uses electricity to map possible breast lumps and 
possibly reduce reduce the number of women who get unnecessary 
biopsies because their mammograms are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved TransScan Medical Inc.'s T-Scan 2000 on Monday  
as an extra tool for radiologists to use in determining whether 
women with ambiguous mammogram results need an immediate biopsy to 
check for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	American women undergo 30 million mammograms a year. The breast  
X-ray is the gold standard in detecting breast cancer, particularly 
early tumors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mammograms often clearly show which breast lesions should be  
biopsied immediately. But they also can be ambiguous, leaving a 
doctor in doubt as to whether to do a biopsy immediately, or to 
wait six months and X-ray again. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 800,000 biopsies are done every year, from which 180,000  
women are diagnosed with breast cancer. The rest are benign lumps. 
So scientists have hunted ways to reduce unnecessary biopsies 
without missing women who have cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors use ultrasound machines that use sound waves to  
picture lumps as an addition to the mammogram's X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-Scan 2000 is another alternative. It uses electricity to  
create a map of the breast. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-volt shot of electricity is sent into the hand, where it  
travels through the body into the breast. A handheld probe is moved 
over the breast, where it measures the electrical conductivity of 
breast cells. Cancer cells conduct much less electricity than 
healthy cells -- so when the probe flashes its findings onto a 
computer screen, possible tumors show up as bright white spots. 
</P>
<P>
	TransScan's studies suggest that adding the electricity test for  
women with ambiguous mammograms can improve diagnostic accuracy and 
lower unnecessary biopsies by about 20 percent, said company 
president George Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
	The T-Scan should be used only in women whose doctors cannot  
decide about ordering a biopsy based on other standard procedures, 
said Dr. Dan Schultz, FDA's chief of radiological devices. 
</P>
<P>
	The new scan should add less than $100 to a woman's exam,  
Solomon said.

<P>
	FREEPORT, Maine (AP) -- L.L. Bean is recalling about 13,000  
backpack child carriers after getting about 25 reports of children 
slipping out of leg openings or falling out the top and getting 
hurt, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall involves the W695 model. The backpacks are teal with  
gray harnesses and kickstands used to prop the bags up while 
loading children. 
</P>
<P>
	They were sold for $95 through L.L. Bean's catalog and Web site

<HEADLINE> Volcanic Ash Affects Alaska Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Two flights into the eastern Aleutian  
Islands were canceled and other planes were rerouted after a pilot 
spotted a steam and ash plume billowing from the Shishaldin 
Volcano. 
</P>
<P>
	The eruption lasted about six hours, Terry Keith,  
scientist-in-charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Service into Dutch Harbor airport was affected, according to the  
Federal Aviation Administration, and several flights to the Far 
East were directed to detour around the plume. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of the more energetic eruptions of Shishaldin this  
century,'' said Keith. The restless volcano is about 700 miles 
southwest of Anchorage, on Unimak Island just off the end of the 
Alaska Peninsula in the eastern Aleutians. 
</P>
<P>
	The ash cloud above Shishaldin was seen first shortly before  
noon, according to observatory scientists. The corrosive ash rose 
to an altitude of about 45,000 feet, Keith said, with a 
high-altitude plume heading north, while ash below about 40,000 
feet spread south and east. 
</P>
<P>
	Since winds were relatively light, the cloud was fairly stable  
and easy for pilots to avoid, FAA officials said. Operations were 
normal at the Cold Bay airport Monday afternoon despite the 
erupting mountain just 50 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	No ash was falling on False Pass or Cold Bay, Keith said, and  
U.S. Coast Guard officers said no ashfall was reported by ships in 
the area, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Shishaldin is one of the most active volcanoes in the region. It  
has erupted at least 27 times since 1775. The most recent eruptive 
period was in late 1995 and early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Drug Companies Post Strong Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Pharmaceutical companies on Tuesday reported  
generally strong first-quarter earnings, with Johnson &AMP; Johnson and 
SmithKline Beecham PLC beating Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough Corp. and American Home Products Corp.'s results  
were in line with expectations. The shares of all four companies 
rose on the reports, reflecting the stock market's ``very high 
confidence in the industry to post earnings,'' said Sergio 
Traversa, analyst with Mehta Partners. 

</P>
<P>
                         *Johnson &AMP; Johnson    	
</P>
<P>
	J&AMP;J's first-quarter profit rose 11.7 percent, driven by strong  
drug and medical device sales. 
</P>
<P>
	New Brunswick, N.J.-based J&AMP;J earned $1.12 billion, or 82 cents  
a share, up from $1 billion, or 73 cents a share, in the same 
period a year ago. Results beat Wall Street's expectations by 2 
cents a share, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the first quarter rose 14.8 percent from $5.8 billion  
to $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Global drug sales rose 18.4 percent to $2.5 billion, including a  
23 percent jump in the U.S. market. The company said its major 
drugs had strong sales, including Procrit, an anemia drug, 
Risperdal, an antipsychotic medication and Duragesic, a transdermal 
patch for pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's medical device division posted an 18.6 percent  
increase in sales to $2.4 billion. J&AMP;J's 1998 purchase of 
orthopedics products maker DePuy spurred much of the growth. J&AMP;J 
also was aided by strong sales of surgical equipment, sutures and 
glucose monitoring devices, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of consumer goods, including Tylenol, rose 5.4 percent to  
$1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of J&AMP;J rose $6, or 7 percent, to $96.25 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Schering-Plough Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough's first quarter profit rose 20 percent, mainly  
from accelerating sales of Claritin, the world's best-selling 
antihistamine. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based-Schering-Plough earned $539 million, or 36  
cents a share in the first quarter, up from $450 million in the 
same quarter a year ago. Results matched analysts' expectations, 
according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 15 percent from $1.5 billion to $2.2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	Claritin sales comprised about 27 percent of the company's  
sales. Global Claritin sales jumped 29 percent to $565 million, 
including a 33 increase in U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Combined sales of Intron A and Rebetron Combination Therapy for  
hepatitis C, rose 66 percent to $272 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Schering-Plough rose $1.87 1/2 to $50.37 1/2 on the NYSE.  

</P>
<P>
                    *American Home Products Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a special charge in 1998, American Home Product's  
first quarter profit was flat mostly due to weak sales of 
herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based American Home earned $654.9 million or 49  
cents a share in the first quarter, compared to $651.4 million or 
49 cents a share in the same period a year ago. The results matched 
analysts expectations. The 1998 results exclude the $331 million 
sale of the company's medical device business. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 1 percent in the first quarter to $3.4 billion from  
$3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Agricultural product sales declined 18 percent in the first  
quarter due to lower herbicide sales as wholesalers built 
inventories last year and the company dealt with lower prices for 
soybeans and corn. Agriculture products make up about 15 percent of 
the company's sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide drug sales declined 1 percent as strong sales of the  
new rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel and antidepressant drug 
Effexor could not make up for weaker sales of the heart drug 
Cordarone and oral contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of American Home rose $2.56 1/4 to $62.31 1/4 on the NYSE.  

</P>
<P>
                       *SmithKline Beecham PLC    	
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham PLC's first quarter profit rose 15 percent  
from strong growth of the company's antibiotic and depression and 
anti-smoking drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	London-based SmithKline earned $606 million, or 49 cents per  
share in the first quarter, compared to $526 million, or 43 cents 
per share in the same period a year ago. Analysts surveyed by First 
Call had predicted earnings of 47 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue increased 9 percent for the quarter, from $3.11 billion  
to $3.40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline Beecham's pharmaceutical sales grew 12 percent. The  
growth was fueled by the antibiotic Augmentin, which rose 19 
percent to $484 million, and Paxil/Seroxat, a depression drug 
therapy, which rose 17 percent to $461 million. Vaccine sales rose 
12 percent to $297 million, driven partly by the company's new 
vaccine for Lyme disease. 
</P>
<P>
	On the over-the-counter market, smoking cessation products,  
including Nicorette smoking cessation gum and patch, posted a 68 
percent increase in sales to $183 million. 
</P>
<P>
	SmithKline's American Depositary Receipts rose $3.93 3/4 to $66.68 3/4  
on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Side Air Bags May Injure Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government tests indicate Mercedes-Benz side  
air bags could seriously injure a child pressing his face against a 
window or leaning out an open one. 
</P>
<P>
	A safety engineer for DaimlerChrysler AG, Mercedes' parent  
company, said its testing showed the side air bags were safe, even 
for children found in such positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and its  
Canadian counterpart, Transport Canada, recently conducted more 
than 40 tests on side air bags installed by eight automakers. In 
the tests, dummies representing young children were leaning against 
doors, leaning out car windows or kneeling backward in the seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were released Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	None of the dummies were properly seated and restrained in child  
seats or booster seats, which automakers said would eliminate the 
problem of any serious side air bag injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	In one NHTSA test on a Mercedes E-class car, the force on the  
child's neck from the deploying side air bag was about four times 
the acceptable injury level recognized by government safety 
experts, indicating the potential for serious injury, government 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several test measurements indicated chest injuries ``up to six  
times (the recommended) injury levels,'' NHTSA's Randa Radwan 
Samaha said. 
</P>
<P>
	Susan Cischke, a top safety engineer for DaimlerChrysler, said  
the Mercedes' air bag systems ``are very safe and effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight of nine vehicle models tested by Transport Canada had air  
bags that potentially could cause injury to children leaning or 
kneeling against a window or turned around backward on a seat, 
government officials said. It was unclear whether the tests showed 
those injuries could be serious, as indicated in some of the 
Mercedes tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight models were BMW 323i, Ford Explorer, Saab 9-3,  
Volkswagen Beetle, Audi A6 and A4, Volvo S80, all from 1999; and 
the 1998 model General Motors Pontiac Transport. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of serious injuries or deaths from  
side air bags in crashes, and federal regulators believe the safety 
devices can offer substantial protection in side-impact crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, NHTSA officials have been acting to prevent problems  
with side air bags in light of the public outcry over deaths from 
air bags deploying from the front of autos. Those airbags have been 
blamed for killing 131 people, including 73 children, government 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
	NHTSA convened a public meeting Monday to encourage automakers  
voluntarily to develop common testing procedures for side air bags 
and share testing data to reduce injuries to children. Automakers 
said they support the concept.

<HEADLINE> Chase, Mellon Banks Post Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four major U.S. banks posted strong  
first-quarter profits Tuesday, capping a double-digit increase for 
the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan Bank, Wells Fargo and Mellon Bank all reported  
earnings that topped Wall Street's expectations, while Bank One's 
results matched estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The earnings this morning were good,'' said Catherine Murray,  
an analyst with J.P. Morgan. ``Revenue continues to come in higher 
than expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The large national banks saw an impressive 8 percent profit  
increase over the first quarter last year, and beat estimates by 
about 10 percent, according to First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional banks like Mellon posted an average 14 percent gain in  
profits, but the results were just 1 percent higher than estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results are strong, said Brad Ball, an analyst with Credit  
Suisse First Boston. ``Now people are starting to question just how 
sustainable they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors don't seem to agree on how long the good times will  
last as bank stocks were mixed in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank stocks have had a good run over the past six months, and on  
Tuesday, Citigroup and Mellon both announced stock splits and 
dividend increases. Stock splits increase the number of shares 
outstanding, but decrease their price in order to make them more 
affordable to investors. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Chase Manhattan Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Chase Manhattan, the nation's third-largest bank, reported  
profits of $1.17 billion, or $1.32 a share, beating Wall Street's 
estimate of $1.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were 11 percent better than the first quarter last  
year, when Chase earned $1.05 billion, or $80 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating revenues rose 10 percent to $5.41 billion from $4.92  
billion in the first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for 1999 to be a record year in our history,''  
said Dina Dublon, chief financial officer for Chase. 
</P>
<P>
	While most consumers probably think of checking and savings  
accounts when they think of Chase, the New York bank actually makes 
more than half its money selling corporate bonds and complicated 
interest rate contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Chase has a strong business in providing venture capital money,  
private banking for wealthy individuals and loans for medium-size 
companies. Chase's Global Bank, as it is known, earned $844 million 
in the first quarter on revenues of $2.59 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from trading stocks and bonds and related interest  
income rose 21 percent to $837 million, a new record. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses were $2.94 billion in the first quarter, an increase of  
12 percent, as the bank continues to update its computer systems 
for the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Return on common equity was 20.6 percent, up slightly from 20.3  
percent from the year-ago quarter. Return on assets was 1.24 
percent vs. 1.08 percent. Return on assets is a key measurement of 
profitability, indicating how efficiently a financial institution's 
assets are employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the solid results, Chase's stock fell $2 to $83 on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Bank One Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Bank One, the country's No. 4 bank, posted earnings of $995  
million, or 88 cents a share, up 6.6 percent from the first quarter 
last year, when the Chicago-based bank earned $933 million, or 78 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met Wall Street expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	Bank One's 1999 earnings do not reflect three special items: A  
gain of $249 million gain from its merger with First Chicago NBD 
Corp., and a charge of $204 million for accounting changes and 
integration costs. Additionally, Bank One recorded a $111 million 
gain for the sale of its Electronic Payment Services company. 
</P>
<P>
	Including all one-time charges and gains, Bank One earned $1.15  
billion, or 96 88 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``We began to see the promised merger expense and revenue  
synergies, which should gain momentum throughout the year,'' John 
B. McCoy, president and chief executive of Bank One, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues totaled $4.59 billion, up 20 percent from $3.81 in the  
first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Return on assets was 1.85 percent, up from 1.59 percent in the  
first quarter last year. Return on common equity was 22.9 percent, 
an increase from 20.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank One's stock slipped 25 cents to $59 on the NYSE.  

</P>
<P>
                          *Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo, the seventh-largest bank in the country, posted  
profits of $884 million, or 53 cents a share, for the first quarter 
of 1999, a healthy 29 percent increase over the year ago period. 
The results topped analysts' estimate by 3 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter last year, the San Francisco-based bank  
earned $684 million, or 41 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues of $3.99 billion were up from $3.73 billion, as more  
customers bought homes and needed mortgages, and the bank's venture 
capital investments started paying off. Wells Fargo merged with 
Norwest Corp. last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Return on average assets was 1.80 percent, up 1.51 percent from  
the year-ago period. Return on average common equity was 17.33 
percent vs. 14.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells Fargo's stock rose $1.25 to $42.37 1/2 on the NYSE.  

</P>
<P>
                            *Mellon Bank    	
</P>
<P>
	Mellon, which ranks 18th among the nation's banks, earned $231  
million, or 87 cents a share, compared with $206 million, or 78 
cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The results beat analyst estimates by 1 penny a share.  
</P>
<P>
	Mellon's first quarter 1999 earnings reflect a $49 million  
after-tax net gain from divestitures and a $26 million after-tax 
charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting 
principle. Including those one-time events, Mellon earned $254 
million, or 96 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Total interest revenue was $711 million vs. $694 million a year  
ago, while non-interest revenue was $872 vs. $698 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh-based bank also announced an 11 percent increase  
in its quarterly cash dividend to 40 cents a share (pre-split) and 
a two-for-one split of its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The dividend will be paid May 17 to shareholders of record April  
30, and the stock will be split will also be distributed May 17 to 
shareholders of record May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Return on common equity fell slightly to 20.9 percent from 21.6  
percent a year ago. Return on assets also fell to 1.84 percent vs. 
1.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Mellon's stock dipped 6 1/4 cents to $70.93 3/4 on the Big Board.

<HEADLINE> NHL May Back Lemieux Ownership Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The NHL is expected to back Mario Lemieux's  
ownership bid for the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins and hinted it 
could revoke the team's franchise if he does not gain control. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL plans to file legal documents Friday supporting the  
Lemieux group and offering to work with him to get the Penguins out 
of bankruptcy, league and legal sources close to the proceedings 
told The Associated Press. The NHL wants the matter settled by June 
at the latest, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is eager for a new owner -- Lemieux -- and a  
reorganization plan to be in place by then so budgets for the 
1999-2000 season can be made, players can be signed and season 
tickets can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, the league is discouraging Florida investment  
banker Chip Gesner from submitting a bid, one that might further 
slow the process, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people could buy the Penguins, but one person can  
save them: Mario Lemieux,'' Penguins spokesman Tom McMillan said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Bernard Markovitz has scheduled a  
hearing on Lemieux's takeover bid for April 30. Markovitz has no 
obligation to follow the NHL's advice and choose the Lemieux group, 
but the league does have some leverage. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NHL does not agree with the choice of owners, it could  
reject the judge's recommendation and revoke the franchise, 
essentially making it worthless. 
</P>
<P>
	William Daly, the NHL's vice president for legal affairs, said  
the revocation of the franchise is an unwanted but valid way for 
the league to settle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NHL constitution, the Penguins' players then could be  
distributed throughout the league or the franchise could be awarded 
to a new city. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has not set a firm date to resolve the Penguins'  
situation, but the next step could be to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that sets a deadline ... is positive to keeping the  
Penguins in Pittsburgh,'' McMillan said. ``We've been in bankruptcy 
since October and time is of the essence. In the NHL, next season 
begins in June. We have to make decisions about payroll and the 
budget and about signing players. And we've got to sell tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Lemieux retired after the 1996-97 season and the Penguins'  
financial situation worsened, the team's season-ticket base has 
dropped from 12,000 to 8,300. By contrast, expansion franchises 
must guarantee season-ticket sales of 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have another disastrous season ticket-selling  
season,'' McMillan said. ``If Mario's group gets in there, there 
are a lot of things that could be done right away to sell 
tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest hangup to reorganizing the Penguins' finances is the  
lack of a new lease with Spectacor Management Group, which operates 
the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing in the NHL's oldest arena, the Penguins' pay the  
steepest annual rent, an estimated $6 million to $7 million that is 
blamed for much of the team's financial problems. The lease was 
renegotiated several times under co-owner Howard Baldwin to supply 
cash needed to keep the team going. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, the Lemieux group is hopeful that the threat of the  
Penguins folding or being relocated will be enough to spur city and 
county officials into pressuring SMG to renegotiate. However, 
lawyers for Lemieux and co-owner Roger Marino said the lease talks 
have gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, Lemieux remains optimistic he will become the first  
former player in the history of modern major pro sports in the 
United States to buy his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that Wayne (Gretzky) might want to someday,''  
Lemieux said. ``Maybe we could go at it someday as owners the way 
we did as players.''

	25 May Be Dead in H.S. Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Three young men dressed in fatigues  
opened fire in a suburban high school today in what police called a 
suicide mission that may have killed 25 people. Jefferson County 
Sheriff John Stone said two suspects were found dead inside the 
library. He said the gunmen found dead at Columbine High School 
were students. ``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Stone said. 
Police scoured the school as students kept fleeing in spurts. 
Police also led a youth away in handcuffs. ``He's one of the ones 
who shot at us,'' said another student. There were also reports 
during the day of explosions inside Columbine High School.

	Serbs Flushing Kosovars Out  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO launched daylight attacks today  
in Pristina and other parts of Kosovo while accusing Serb forces of 
flushing out ethnic Albanians hiding in the province's hills. U.S. 
helicopters and troops were headed toward Albania in a new phase 
aimed at boosting the alliance's ability to attack Yugoslav ground 
forces and stop their campaign to rid Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian 
majority. NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said Serb military and 
paramilitary forces were shelling hills where ethnic Albanians had 
fled, marching the refugees on roads and putting them on trains to 
the border, then closing the frontier to them.

	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- The U.N. refugee agency declared its  
camps in Macedonia full beyond capacity today, leaving 2,000 to 
3,000 new arrivals from Kosovo stuck in a border no man's land with 
no food, water or blankets. While the exhausted refugees faced a 
second night of driving wind and rain, those fortunate enough to 
cross the border faced new harassment in Macedonia, which has 
reluctantly taken in refugee throngs.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government described plans today for  
enforcing a new law that bans companies from collecting personal 
information from children on the Internet without a parent's 
permission. The Federal Trade Commission's proposed rules would 
require operators of commercial Web sites to make ``reasonable 
efforts'' in most cases to obtain consent from parents before 
asking children under 13 for their names, addresses, telephone 
numbers or other identifying details. The rules also would prohibit 
a company from enticing children with online games or prizes into 
disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s quarterly profit rose 43  
percent from a year earlier on strength across its range of 
products, particularly its Office business software and Windows NT 
software for running corporate computers. Microsoft reported today 
it earned $1.92 billion, or 35 cents a share in its fiscal third 
quarter, which ended March 31. That was up from a profit of $1.34 
billion, or 25 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose

	Health Benefits of Vitamin C Touted  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Government researchers say the recommended daily  
allowance for vitamin C should be doubled or tripled because of 
increasing evidence over the past two decades of its 
cancer-fighting ability. In a paper in tomorrow's Journal of the 
American Medical Association, researchers from the National 
Institutes of Health said the RDA for vitamin C should be raised 
from 60 milligrams to between 100 mg and 200 mg.

	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- In the Marlboro Man's hometown and across  
the nation, cigarette billboards that were once were a celebrated 
part of the American landscape are coming down this week as part of 
the national settlement with the tobacco industry. In many places, 
the rugged cowboy with the cigarette dangling from the corner of 
his mouth will yield to images of young children delivering

smoking-related health costs, all cigarette billboards must be 
removed by Friday.

Giants team physician Dr. Bill Montgomery said Bonds was expected 
to be released from the hospital today and fitted for a brace this 
week.

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Eating Eggs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- An egg a day really is OK, according to  
researchers who found that healthy people eating up to seven eggs a 
week didn't increase their risk for heart attacks or strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our study doesn't mean that people should go back to the  
typical Western diet -- a breakfast with two eggs, bacon, sausage, 
butter and toast. This kind of diet is very unhealthy,'' said Dr. 
Frank B. Hu, whose research used data from two long-running 
landmark studies. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are afraid of eggs -- because the cholesterol is so high  
and their reputation is so bad,'' said Hu, a nutritional 
epidemiologist at Harvard School of Public Health. ``But eggs, per 
se -- I don't think they deserve such a bad reputation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics, however, did face higher risks of heart attacks or  
strokes with increased egg consumption, according to the study, 
which is being published in Wednesday's Journal of the American 
Medical Association. 
</P>
<P>
	A large egg contains about 215 milligrams of cholesterol -- far  
more than most other foods with the same number of calories. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the American Heart Association, which was not  
involved in the study, said the findings won't change her group's 
belief that Americans should limit their dietary cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	``These new data do not conflict with the American Heart  
Association's recommendations that healthy individuals consume no 
more than 300 milligrams of dietary cholesterol per day,'' said the 
spokeswoman, Dr. Alice H. Lichtenstein of the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture's nutrition center at Tufts University in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	She agreed with the study's authors and what many experts have  
said for a long time -- that it is more important to limit 
consumption of saturated fats and trans fats, the processed fats 
that make doughnuts, commercial cakes and french fries so 
delicious. 
</P>
<P>
	Hu, whose study was funded by the National Institutes of Health,  
noted that past research has shown dietary cholesterol to be less 
of a culprit than initially believed in raising levels of 
cholesterol in the blood. He said his is the first to actually look 
at whether egg consumption had an effect on the rate of heart 
attacks and strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	His findings come from data on 80,082 women in the Nurses'  
Health Study, based at Harvard-affiliated Brigham and Women's 
Hospital. From 1980 to 1994, 939 women developed heart disease and 
563 had strokes. Also tracked were 37,851 men in the Health 
Professional Follow-up Study, based at Harvard School of Public 
Health. From 1986 to 1994, 866 developed heart disease and 258 had 
strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among healthy men and women, no significant differences in risk  
were found between those consuming an average of up to one egg 
daily and those averaging less than one weekly, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetics who averaged eating one egg daily were at  
significantly higher risk than diabetics eating one egg or less a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Diabetes alters the body's ability to use cholesterol, a fatty  
substance important to in building cells and in making hormones. 
Cholesterol becomes an artery-clogger when the body develops an 
excess.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Hits Record $19.4B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit soared to a record  
$19.4 billion in February as the global financial crisis depressed 
U.S. exports for a fourth straight month while booming consumer 
demand pushed imports to an all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that February's deficit  
was 15.6 percent higher than the previous record, a $16.8 billion 
imbalance in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, U.S. exports edged down 0.6 percent to $76.6  
billion, led by a $927 million decline in sales of commercial 
aircraft. Imports jumped 2.3 percent to an all-time high of $96 
billion as demand for foreign cars, clothing, toys, televisions and 
stereos soared. 
</P>
<P>
	With back-to-back records, the trade deficit so far this year is  
running at an annual rate of $215 billion, far surpassing last 
year's all-time high of $169 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists believe that as long as the U.S. economy remains  
strong and many of America's major export markets remain in 
recessions caused by the steep plunge in financial markets that 
began in Asia in July 1997, the U.S. trade deficit will continue to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	A widening trade deficit is the one cloud on an otherwise bright  
economic horizon for the United States, which has managed to remain 
what Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has termed an ``oasis 
of prosperity'' in a sea of economic trouble around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, however, expressed concerns last week about a growing  
movement toward protectionism in this country, a development that 
has the White House worried as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is concerned that erecting U.S. trade  
barriers will trigger copycat responses while jittery markets are 
fearful that political pressures will make nations turn inward in 
response to the worst global economic crisis in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, worried about a growing protectionist mood in  
Congress, balked earlier this month at reaching a sweeping trade 
agreement with China. That disappointed many in the business 
community who have complained for years about China's high trade 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	For February, the deficit with China narrowed slightly to $4.6  
billion. But America's deficit with Japan shot up 13.1 percent to 
$5.3 billion. The administration is pursing a number of trade 
negotiations with Japan in hopes of showing progress in opening 
that market to U.S. firms by the time of Prime Minister Keizo 
Obuchi's visit next month. 
</P>
<P>
	In one bright spot, America's surplus in services, which  
includes such things as tourism and consulting fees, rose 4 percent 
to a monthly record of $6.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus in services, however, did little to dent a record  
$26.2 billion deficit in the goods area. U.S. exporters continued 
to find it hard to make overseas sales because of an economic 
crisis that has pushed one-third of the global economy into 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The February drop in exports included a $130 million decline in  
farm sales, to $3.6 billion, with the drop led by falling shipments 
of soybeans and wheat. American farmers, who grow one-third of 
their crops for export, are suffering their worst times in a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to commercial aircraft, manufactured exports of  
telecommunications equipment and electric generators also dropped 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
	On the import side, foreign shipments of autos and automotive  
parts rose to a record $14.6 billion, up $710 million for the 
month. Other increases included computer accessories, up $449 
million; clothing, up $202 million; toys, up $156 million; and 
televisions and VCRs, up $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with Mexico climbed to a record $1.8 billion  
in February while U.S. exports to Brazil, which became the latest 
victim of the global currency turmoil in January, dropped to $910 
million, the lowest level since April 1996.

<HEADLINE> Allies Urged on Economic War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said today  
they will use this week's NATO summit to push for allied agreement 
on economic sanctions including an oil embargo to deny Yugoslavia 
the ability to wage war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO allies remain ``rock solid'' behind the goal of the  
month-old airstrikes to continue the campaign until the Serb 
military halts attacks on ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will prevail here. We are not putting a time limit on it,''  
Albright said at a White House news conference with President 
Clinton's foreign policy team. ``There is a sense of determination 
and unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the three-day 50th anniversary summit, which begins Friday,  
U.S. leaders will urge NATO allies to ``consider new economic 
measures designed to deny Belgrade the ability to wage war against 
its own people,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, she said the administration would like to see an  
oil embargo to prevent supplies from reaching Yugoslav ports. NATO 
airstrikes have destroyed 100 percent of Yugoslavia's oil-refining 
capacity and have hit supplies as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Although NATO leaders haven't yet embraced the proposal,  
Albright said she has talked to allied foreign ministers who are 
beginning to ``see the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said he believed an oil supply  
clampdown would occur. ``We think it's important that all sources 
of resupply of fuel and energy be eliminated. How that is to be 
achieved is a matter of discussion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Clinton administration is pushing for removal  
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Albright said the Serbs 
would be better off with a democratic leader, but airstrikes aren't 
meant to get rid of Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said that President Milosevic is responsible for the  
ethnic cleansing and all the depredations that are taking place,'' 
Albright said. ``But that is not the goal.'' Instead, it is ``get 
the Serb forces out of Kosovo and the refugees back into Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said  
NATO summit leaders may discuss the matter of sending group troops 
to Yugoslavia, an idea that has been repeatedly rejected by the 
allies and the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he said, NATO wants to keep up the air campaign and he  
doesn't expect that to change. ``The consensus is to stay the 
course,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, Albright has been beseeching her fellow foreign  
ministers to approve a cutoff in shipments of refined oil to 
Yugoslavia, possibly with at-sea intercepts of vessels, and 
soliciting cooperation from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	In a parallel move, American diplomats are appealing to  
governments in Europe and elsewhere to withhold any oil shipments 
to Yugoslavia, according to a senior U.S. official speaking Monday 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	France has registered doubts about interdiction of oil shipments  
in the absence of a declaration of war against Yugoslavia, while 
the Greek government would prefer that the Clinton administration 
work through the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The French foreign ministry said Monday it supported ``the quick  
adoption of a common stand'' on restricting oil supplies to 
Yugoslavia, but that the European Union and the Balkans nations 
should be asked to take on the task of finding a formula. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, calling on U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York, sought to shift the focus 
of NATO's efforts. He said the United Nations should take the lead 
in devising a political framework to end the bombing and to permit 
ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their homes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With Annan bound for Moscow, Albright telephoned Foreign  
Minister Igor Ivanov in a bid for at least Russian acquiescence to 
the U.S. proposal and for continued withholding of technology and 
intelligence to Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin has ruled out Russian intervention in  
the Balkans conflict. But he urged Clinton on the telephone Monday 
to call off the airstrikes and revert to diplomacy as the path to a 
settlement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin still has not indicated whether he plans to attend the  
NATO summit meeting here next weekend that will dwell on Kosovo 
instead of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the 
anti-Soviet alliance as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, though, the NATO alliance remains essentially united on  
the air campaign, which began March 24, and Russia has not crossed 
the line between sympathy for the Serbs and actively supporting 
them, administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is hoping to sell the idea of an oil cutoff to the  
allies with the argument that it is the logical follow-up to the 
devastating bombardment of Yugoslav refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to try to prevent them from pursuing other  
means to fuel this evil war machine,'' State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shying away from calling the cutoff a blockade, Rubin said: ``An  
example of a way to go about this is a regime of some kind of 
visiting and searching ships, which would enable one to distinguish 
between products that would fuel the Yugoslav war machine and other 
kinds of products.'' He said he didn't know which countries were 
shipping refined oil to Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Rebounding From Poor Day / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology stocks  
showing signs of recovery from Monday's rout but blue chips losing 
more ground. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 34.93 at 10,405.60 after having fallen 53 points on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was up 32.02 at 2,377.63 after  
plunging 5.6 percent Monday amid a sharp selloff in 
Internet-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile technology stocks that took big hits Monday were  
mostly higher. Microsoft led the Nasdaq trading in volume and was 
up 1 33/64 at 82 33/64. Dell, Intel and Cisco were all higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares, which were pounded sharply lower on Monday,  
were recovering too, with Amazon.com up 9 1/16 at 168. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the tech group will stay down. This is just a  
normal pause to refresh,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market 
strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc., St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;  
Co., in Kansas City, Mo., said he was encouraged at signs of gentle 
recovery in tech stocks after Monday's debacle. Investors embarked 
on the day expecting a recovery in tech shares, so they placed some 
bets in that stock sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``When tech stocks cratered yesterday, investors in general had  
someplace else to go,'' Belski said. ``While the vim and vigor is 
not present on this upside bounce that was there in other 
recoveries in the tech sector, it's good that people have 
alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While technology stocks recovered, industrial shares, which have  
been popular purchases for more than a week, were lower today. One 
of the biggest decliners was United Technologies, which fell 4 1/4 to 
140 3/4 despite reporting better-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in  
Charlotte, N.C., said attributed some of the blue-chip decline to 
profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is also a little bit of apprehension out there,'' he  
said. ``The fall in technology stocks over the last few sessions 
has created caution elsewhere in the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a transition period and no one is sure what is  
coming next,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 477 million shares, 
down from 462 million shares on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.94 at 1,300.42, the  
NYSE composite index was up 3.55 at 619.43, and the Amex composite 
index was unchanged at 735.11.

<HEADLINE> Wings' Chelios Known for Intensity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- You only need to ask Chris Chelios who his sports  
hero was growing up to understand his style of play. No one brings 
the intensity of Dick Butkus to the ice like Chelios. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays every shift like it could be his last,'' said Anaheim  
coach Craig Hartsburg, who coached Chelios with the Blackhawks. 
``He is a warrior.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios says it's the way he's played since junior hockey. He  
had been a small center in youth hockey, but was thrown back on 
defense when he moved into junior hockey in Moose Jaw, 
Saskatchewan. He was the only American in the league at the time 
and felt he had something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	``People challenged you. It was just my way,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	It's been his way ever since.  
</P>
<P>
	Chelios, a three time winner of the Norris Trophy as the NHL's  
top defenseman, is one of the first Americans to dominate in the 
NHL and was the first U.S. born player to captain the Montreal 
Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	He plays with a belligerent style, the kind that causes home  
fans to love him and opposing fans to hate him. He gives hard hits 
and is frequently the targets of hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been hurting for years so it doesn't matter to me,'' he  
said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
	He's already won over the Detroit fans who two years ago in the  
playoffs were hanging him in effigy. He said playing in Detroit, 
home of one of the Original Six teams, is a special feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it in Montreal, I felt it in Chicago and I feel it  
here,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He's fit in quickly with his new teammates and is carrying a  
lighter load. The Blackhawks needed him to play 30 minutes a night, 
running the power play and killing penalties. The Red Wings have 
more depth on defense and don't need him to do everything. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest challenge for Chelios and the Red Wings against the  
Mighty Ducks will be to contain Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya, who 
finished second and third in the league in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to stay close to them, not give them much room,''  
Chelios said. ``We've got to put our best game on the ice and make 
them adjust to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wings plan on doing that with physical play.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have the opportunity to hit those guys, you have  
to hit them,'' center Kris Draper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wings have to be careful, though. The Ducks have the  
league's best power-play unit with a 25.5 percent success rate, 
compared with 18 percent for the Red Wings. And with two referees 
on the ice, there may be more penalty calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we're going to have to be disciplined,'' Chelios said.  
</P>
<P>
	Discipline isn't a word frequently associated with Chelios or  
Ulf Samuelsson, another player with a nasty streak. Putting the two 
of them on the same team creates a unit only a hometown fan can 
love. Especially when some other fans may resent the appearance 
that Red Wings owner Mike Ilitch might be trying to buy his way to 
another Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who cares?'' forward Darren McCarty asked. ``The commitment  
our ownership has shown is that he is willing to go out and do what 
it takes to win. That's not a bad thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Chelios and Samuelsson, the Wings added forward  
Wendel Clark and goalie Bill Ranford. Since the trade, Detroit is 
9-2-1, has outscored opponents 37-20, has one shutout and has given 
up just one goal in five games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team really got re-energized and everybody got their jump  
back,'' defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios said he knows he'll be nervous before the first playoff  
game Wednesday night. He always is come playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
	He still remembers his first playoff game in 1984 against the  
Boston Bruins. He scored the first goal of the game and the 
Canadiens upset the Bruins before falling to the New York 
Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, he helped lead Montreal to a Stanley Cup. He  
thought it would be the first of many. He went to the finals again 
with the Canadiens in 1989 and with Blackhawks in 1992, but he's 
still looking for his second title. 
</P>
<P>
	The quest for that title is still what drives him.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every time the playoffs come around it's fun,'' he said. ``I'm  
just going to go out and play.''

<HEADLINE> Straw Reportedly Passes Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's future depends on the  
results of his latest drug tests, due to be received by the 
commissioner's office sometime this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder came through the first test OK,  
according to a published report today. 
</P>
<P>
	The test was given last week, 24 hours before he was arrested in  
Tampa, Fla., for cocaine possession and solicitation. It indicated 
``there was no problem,'' The Record of Hackensack, N.J., reported, 
quoting sources said to be familiar with Strawberry's legal 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the results revealed traces of a drug, Strawberry faced at  
least a six-month ban from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was tested again during a weekend visit to New York  
when he met with officials of the players association, the 
commissioner's office and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Those close to Strawberry were confident that the latest tests  
will be fine as well, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball had been testing the outfielder twice a week as part of  
the aftercare program that followed his 60-day suspension in 1995 
for a positive test for cocaine use. Strawberry has not tested 
positive for illegal drugs since then, the Yankees said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, was at the Yankees' training camp as part of its  
extended spring training program. He was still rehabilitating from 
colon cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of right now, he is not resuming workouts,'' Cashman said  
Monday. ``From the club's perspective, he's got his legal issues 
and personal issues to deal with. It's best for him at this 
particular moment to deal with that. Baseball is second right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear if the Yankees have stopped paying Strawberry, who  
is not on their 40-man roster. He has a minor league contract and a 
consulting deal with the team, which together total $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has been advancing money to Strawberry and may have  
stopped those advances, one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	No arraignment date has been set for Strawberry, but when he is  
formally charged, he will plead innocent, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entrapment is a pretty wide avenue,'' attorney Joseph  
Ficarrota told The Record from his office in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has said he as only joking with the female undercover  
officer posing as a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Ficarrota will argue that the charges should be dropped since no  
money changed hands between Strawberry and the woman, Strawberry 
was arrested after driving beyond the motel where the woman told 
him to meet here, and there was no tape recording of the 
conversation between the outfielder and the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ficarrota succeeds in getting the solicitation charge  
dropped, he will argue there was no probable cause for the 
subsequent search which police said produced three-tenths of a gram 
of cocaine inside a rolled up $20 bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Without probable cause, the search would be illegal, Ficarrota  
told the newspaper, and its results inadmissable.

<HEADLINE> Colleagues Sue Winner of Fla. Lotto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Tonda Dickerson's days of juggling dishes  
and coffee cups at the Waffle House ended soon after a customer 
rewarded her with a Florida Lotto ticket worth $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But when she turned in her apron without sharing the jackpot  
with four co-workers, a sizzling dispute ensued. Her four 
co-workers filed suit claiming there had been an agreement to 
divide any winnings equally. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of moving out of her Grand Bay mobile home, the  
28-year-old former waitress was in court Monday testifying there 
was no such agreement to divide lottery winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Her Waffle House co-workers, however, testified there was a  
share-the-wealth plan and that in conversations around the hot 
grill they often discussed how they would spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was always stated that if we hit, we split,'' one of the  
four co-workers, Matthew Adams, told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile County Circuit Judge Robert Kendall said the jury's  
verdict will be an advisory one, meaning he will make the final 
decision on whether Mrs. Dickerson must share her wealth. 
Deliberations were expected to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Seward Jr., the Waffle House customer from Bayou La Batre  
who gave away the lottery tickets, has said he expected the 
restaurant employees to share any winnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Adams said Seward ate breakfast daily at the restaurant and on  
March 7 handed out tickets to five employees as tips. Mrs. 
Dickerson's winning ticket was in an envelope with her name on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Seward, 41, who managed a seafood restaurant until suffering a  
stroke, declined requests for interviews and sat huddled with 
relatives after testifying Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The co-workers' attorney, Steve Clements, said the case was  
about telling the truth and the ``corrupting influence of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson's lawyer, Dwight Reid, accused the co-workers of  
cooking up a ``nefarious scheme'' to claim part of the money. 
Besides, he said, there was no written contract to divide the 
money, which is required by Alabama law. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute occurred at the one of the national chain's  
restaurants near Interstate 10 in Grand Bay on the Alabama coast. 
The yellow and black, diner-style eateries are famous for pecan 
waffles and hash browns. 
</P>
<P>
	When Mrs. Dickerson went to Tallahassee, Fla., to pick up the  
jackpot, lottery officials refused to pay her because of the 
dispute with co-workers Sandra Deno, Angela Tisdale, Jackie Fairley 
and Adams. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the other workers had offered to settle. Under the  
proposed agreement, Mrs. Dickerson would receive 30 percent of the 
jackpot, with each of the four other employees receiving a 17.5 
percent share. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson declined, even though she could end up with only  
a 20 percent cut if a jury decides the five should equally split 
the money.

<HEADLINE> Russia Defaults on a $1.3B Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will not be able to pay off $1.3 billion in  
Ministry of Finance bonds that mature next month, the latest sign 
of the country's worsening debt crisis, an official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia already has defaulted on some domestic and foreign debt  
since an economic crisis hit last August, but it wanted to keep 
current on its Ministry of Finance bonds, known as MinFins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, as hard as we tried to accumulate money and  
stabilize the situation, we can't do this,'' First Deputy Finance 
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told the Interfax news agency from 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a formal announcement was expected later today or  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to make the payment will further erode confidence in  
Russia's recession-hit economy. An International Monetary Fund team 
is in Russia assessing the country's suitability for a new loan. 
The IMF has agreed in principle to give Russia the loan, but the 
size and the terms have not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has foreign debts of around $150 billion. About $17.5  
billion of that amount falls due this year, though the country has 
said it can only pay half that at most. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the country has sizable domestic debts, including  
the MinFins, which are classified as domestic debt though they are 
denominated in dollars. Russia has met all its previous MinFin 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The payment for the current batch of MinFins is not due until  
May 14, but there has been widespread speculation that the 
government would not be able to meet its obligations to 
bondholders, which include Russians and foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia will probably have to begin negotiating this matter  
again with Russian and foreign holders of MinFin bonds,'' Kasyanov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been trying to encourage international lenders to  
return to the country to help revive an economy that's been 
slumping since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. It is one of the 
worst depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the growing number of defaults has already scared away most  
lenders. Few analysts believe Russia will be able to pay debts 
accumulated during the Soviet era. Russia has tried to stay current 
on debt run up in the post-Soviet period. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's hard currency reserves are down to less than $11  
billion, a small sum for a country of Russia's size and population.

<HEADLINE> Boys Charged With Raping Woman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Five boys have been charged with  
raping a 21-year-old mentally retarded woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The boys, ranging in age from 12 to 16, were being held in  
juvenile detention, were charged with sexual battery on a mentally 
impaired person. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman told police that four of the boys raped her as another  
boy cheered them on after she went to a neighbor's home to speak 
with the grandmother who lived there. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys pulled her inside, locked the door and began  
touching her, then pulled her to the floor, she told police. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabrina Gibson, mother of one of the suspects arrested Friday,  
said the boys told her the woman came into the house on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``She started taking her clothes off, saying, 'It's hot, it's  
hot,''' Gibson said. ``They tried to tell her to get out. She 
wouldn't get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson said the boys told her they didn't touch the woman, and  
she left the home.

<HEADLINE> Many Ignore Closed-End Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They're holding a 5-percent-off sale at the  
mutual fund store, but not many investors are showing up to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The markdown can be found in the category of investment  
companies known as closed-end funds, a sort of oddball cousin to 
traditional open-end mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Open-end fund sponsors stand ready at any time to buy and sell  
shares in direct transactions with the public, at a price 
determined by the net asset value of the fund's portfolio. By 
contrast, closed-end funds have a fixed amount of shares that trade 
in the stock market, just like the stocks of the companies in which 
they invest. 
</P>
<P>
	So buyers or sellers at any time may find that the going price  
stands either at premium (above) or discount (below) a fund's net 
asset value per share. This complicates matters, but it also 
sometimes creates interesting opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Closed-end funds seem to be the forgotten stepchild in the  
mutual fund world, a misunderstood investment option that can be 
quite successful,'' say analysts at the fund tracking firm of 
Wiesenberger in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``While nearly 10,000 options exist for investors in open-end  
funds, only about 500 are available in the closed-end fund 
universe,'' Wiesenberger says in a new report on the subject. ``One 
reason investors shy away from the closed-end fund option is the 
presence of the premium or discount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This extra layer of complexity can narrow or widen at any time.  
At last tally by the research firm of Lipper Inc., the median level 
stood at a 4.8 percent discount (hence the ``5 percent off'' 
characterization). In other words, half of all closed-end funds 
showed discounts of greater than 4.8 percent, and the other half 
were trading at smaller discounts or premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the premium or discount on a given closed-end fund  
seems logical. For instance, most funds concentrating on single 
foreign countries or areas of the globe outside the United States 
have lately traded at substantial discounts, given that foreign 
markets in general have lagged behind Wall Street for the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A closed-end bond fund may trade consistently at some discount  
to its NAV simply because its expenses cut into the portfolio's 
yield before it is passed along to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, a fund may trade at a premium if it owns exotic  
securities that are scarce or not easy to buy directly, especially 
if those securities are considered hot properties. 
</P>
<P>
	But on many occasions, the reasons for a premium or discount may  
be hard to figure out. A mysterious discount tends to put many 
would-be buyers off, no matter how attractive the resulting price, 
simply by creating the impression that the smart money knows 
something bad that just hasn't come to light yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiesenberger says its research shows that people brave enough to  
invest regularly in deeply discounted closed-end funds can make 
some good money -- but that the game gets very chancy and volatile 
at times. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if you aren't interested in anything this complicated, it  
pays to be aware of closed-end funds whenever you invest in mutual 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, before you buy an open-ended bond fund at NAV, you  
might check to see if there is a closed-end fund with a similar 
portfolio that is trading at a discount big enough to offer you a 
better return (don't forget to factor trading costs into the 
equation). 
</P>
<P>
	That same principle applies in reverse: If you are attracted to  
a closed-end fund that is trading at a premium, ask yourself 
whether a piece of a similar portfolio could be bought at NAV 
through an open-end fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Mutual Fund Forecaster in Deerfield Beach, Fla.,  
notes that plans have been filed to bring out a closed-end fund 
specializing in Internet stocks, LCM Internet Growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If investors clamor to buy these shares, the premium could  
skyrocket,'' says the letter's editor-in-chief, Norman Fosback. 
``If so, we counsel avoiding it. Eventually, we expect to see LCM 
Internet Growth shrink to a discount below NAV. That could create 
an intriguing buying opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Polygamy Goes on Trial in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- A man accused of beating his daughter after  
she ran away from an arranged marriage to his brother goes on trial 
Wednesday in a case that has many calling for a crackdown on Utah 
polygamy. 
</P>
<P>
	John Daniel Kingston, 43, is charged with felony child abuse for  
allegedly beating his 16-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now living in foster care, says her father drove her  
to a family owned farm near the Idaho line in May and whipped her 
for disobeying Daniel Ortell Kingston, who had made her his 15th 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	But to many, the real defendant in the case is not the father,  
but a way of life in Utah that has survived in the shadows for more 
than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Though polygamy is banned by the state constitution and  
denounced by the Mormon church, the attorney general's office 
estimates there are 25,000 practitioners in Utah alone. 
</P>
<P>
	And though lawyers for both sides say the trial is not about  
polygamy, the Kingston clan is one of the most prominent polygamous 
groups in Utah, and the issues have become inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Polygamy) is the very reason this whole thing is coming  
down,'' said Owen Allred, the leader of a separate polygamous clan 
based in Bluffdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally speaking, our people are very peaceful,  
mind-your-own-business people,'' Allred said in a telephone 
interview. But right now, he said, he feels like his way of life is 
on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	No large-scale bigamy cases have been prosecuted since the  
1950s, when agents raided the town of Short Creek on the 
Utah-Arizona line. The incident backfired when the public, enraged 
by images of families being torn apart, protested and the state 
backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-polygamy groups say prosecutors should attack once more.  
They say the brothers should face bigamy as well the other charges 
-- child abuse against John Kingston and incest charges against 
Daniel Kingston, who is to be tried in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really missing the boat on this one,'' said Carmen  
Thompson, executive director of the advocacy group Tapestry of 
Polygamy, comprised of former polygamous wives. ``When you see 
crimes stemming directly from the polygamy issue, the polygamy 
should be prosecuted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clan led by patriarch Merlin Kingston goes by the name of  
the ``Latter-day Church of Christ'' and has about 1,000 members. 
The brothers are the sons of the clan's leader, who died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not the largest polygamous group, the Kingstons are the  
most affluent, with assets estimated around $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When the issue exploded with charges filed against the Kingston  
last year, Gov. Mike Leavitt -- the great-grandson of polygamists -- 
said he thought the practice might be protected by the First 
Amendment. He soon backed away from that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say it is difficult to prosecute bigamy, the only  
charge associated with plural marriage. Marriages are often 
performed in secret ceremonies, evidence can be skimpy or 
nonexistent, and they don't want to gamble time and resources while 
more pressing crimes demand attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concentrated and focused on the abuses,'' said Palmer  
DePaulis, chief of staff for Utah Attorney General Janet Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the office is trying to educate members of  
polygamous groups, including the children, how to recognize child 
abuse, date rape and domestic violence. There is also a hotline for 
wives of polygamists. 
</P>
<P>
	But others say that approach treats the symptoms, not the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the underlying problem is the polygamous relationship  
that exists and they ought to be prosecuting that relationship, not 
just the child abuse,'' said Dexter Anderson, a Millard County 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Kingston case ``opened the floodgates,'' Thompson said  
her office has fielded hundreds of calls from plural wives looking 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that even if the prosecutor doesn't see this as  
a polygamy case, the public does see it as a polygamy case,'' she 
said. ``How long is the abuse going to continue?''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Profits Jump 43 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s quarterly profit jumped 43  
percent from a year earlier on strength across its range of 
products, particularly its Office business software and Windows NT 
software for running corporate computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, the world's dominant maker of personal computer  
software, reported Tuesday it earned $1.92 billion, or 35 cents a 
share, in its fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31. That was 
up from a profit of $1.34 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the 
year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose to $4.33 billion from $3.77 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The profit beat the predictions of analysts surveyed by First  
Call Corp., who had expected 32 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial results were released at the close of markets,  
where Microsoft stock rose $2.12 1/2 a share at $83.12 1/2 on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market amid a strong rebound from Monday's selloff of 
technology and Internet stocks. In after-hours trading, shares of 
Microsoft were trading slightly lower at $82.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Not included in the third-quarter results is $400 million in  
revenue from early sales of Microsoft's new Office 2000 package of 
business software. Microsoft said it would defer that revenue into 
the current quarter. The product starts retail sales on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``Financially and operationally it was a very nice quarter, if  
somewhat complicated from an accounting standpoint,'' Greg Maffei, 
chief financial officer, said on a conference call with reporters 
and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd say it's more of the same in terms of where the growth is  
coming from,'' said Scott McAdams, president of brokerage McAdams 
Wright Ragen in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which has no debt and pays no stock dividend, also  
reported a whopping $21.76 billion in cash and short-term 
investments, an increase of 56 percent from the $13.93 billion it 
had on hand last June 30. Long-term investments grew from $4.7 
billion to $7.47 billion in the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	The company doesn't have any new plans for its cash stockpile,  
said Carla Lewis, director of investor relations. Microsoft 
typically taps its reserves for research and development, business 
deals and to fund employee stock options. 
</P>
<P>
	Maffei partly tied the company's latest profit to strong demand  
for its server software, and said sales in Asia were rebounding. 
Licenses for SQL Server, its database software for large 
corporations, rose 50 percent from the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Software sales to computer manufacturers were up 29 percent from  
last year, and sales of operating system software accounted for a 
bit more than $2 billion of the revenue for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Windows operating system runs the basic functions of  
90 percent of the world's personal computers. The company is 
fighting federal charges that it illegally wields its Windows 
monopoly to stifle competition in the technology industry. 
</P>
<P>
	While some manufacturers have suffered because of stronger  
demand for lower-cost computers, the higher number of machines sold 
benefited Microsoft, Maffei said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there were jitters during the quarter and after, the PC  
market seems to be fundamentally healthy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, which typically plays down profit expectations, was  
cautious about growth for the rest of calendar 1999. Microsoft said 
customers were deferring purchases of new software in order to get 
ready for the so-called Y2K bug, in which computers incorrectly 
interpret the year 2000 as the year 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of fiscal 1999, Microsoft reported  
profits of $5.58 billion or $1.02 a share, compared with net income 
of $3.13 billion or 59 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues grew 
to $13.22 billion from $10.49 billion.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Shooting Reopens Old Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sabrina Steger was already crying when she picked up the phone.  
</P>
<P>
	She had been in tears all afternoon since she first heard about  
Tuesday's shooting at a suburban Colorado high school. A place 
filled with children -- like her 15-year-old daughter, Kayce, who 
was gunned down in December 1997 when another student opened fire 
on a group of students praying in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobbing to a reporter, the Paducah, Ky., woman said she relives  
the terrifying scene of her daughter's death every time a new 
shooting happens at another school. Tuesday's attack was at least 
the sixth in the less than 18 months since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Dec. 1, 1997, all over again. How many more times does  
this have to happen?'' sobbed Steger. ``It doesn't get any 
easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others in communities across the country that have been  
devastated by school shootings said the latest violence just brings 
to the surface nightmares they have never entirely put behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter said a week ago, 'I wonder when it's going to  
happen again,''' said James Strand, who owns the dance hall where 
Andrew Wurst, 15, gunned down middle school teacher John Gillette 
at a graduation dance in Edinboro, Pa., last April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, 'I think it's just a matter of when and where,'''  
Strand said. ``And she was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strand, whose wife and four children were at the dance, chased  
Wurst down and held him until police came. The survivors of the 
Columbine High School shooting have hard days ahead, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken any innocence. It has stripped it from me and it  
has stripped it from my wife and my children,'' he said. ``Now we 
watch everything we do and everywhere we go, and that's the biggest 
loss for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edinboro residents had been planning a prayer vigil Saturday to  
mark the painful anniversary of the Gillette shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a very hard week for me. And this is not  
helping,'' Debbie Gillette, the teacher's widow, said of the 
Colorado shooting. ``It makes me sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell Wright, whose wife, teacher Shannon Wright, was killed  
in March 1998 in Jonesboro, Ark., said he heard about the Colorado 
shootings on his car radio as he was driving on nearly the same 
stretch of road that he was on when he learned his wife had been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just instantly think back to what happened in your own  
life last year and you feel for the families and what they're about 
to go through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Springfield, Ore., Thurston High School principal Larry Bentz  
broadcast news of the Colorado shootings over his school's intercom 
as soon as he learned of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather they hear it from me than from rumors,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But still reeling from their own school rampage 11 months  
earlier, several students mistakenly thought the nightmare was 
happening again at Thurston. 
</P>
<P>
	``A whole bunch of people started to get scared and stuff. Some  
people started going toward the door thinking it was happening 
here,'' said Thurston student Willie Kumle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Littleton shooting has been a violent reminder to this small  
town of last May's tragedy, when student Kip Kinkel allegedly 
walked into the school's cafeteria and opened fire, killing two 
students and wounding more than 20 others. He is also accused of 
fatally shooting his parents a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's creepy really,'' said James Ready, 17, a junior at  
Thurston. ``I honestly thought ours would be the last one, that 
people would have grown up by now.''

<HEADLINE> Calif. To Test Nonpolluting Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG, Ford Motor Co. and  
the state of California are teaming up to road test up to 50 cars 
and 20 buses powered by the futuristic technology of fuel cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our long-term goal is very simple: zero emissions in the  
air,'' Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday at a news conference featuring 
two prototypes: a small Mercedes that looked much like a Volkswagen 
Beetle and a Ford sedan similar in size to the company's Taurus. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuel cells produce electricity through the chemical reaction of  
hydrogen and oxygen. The result is power to run vehicles with 
little or no pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten percent of new cars sold in California must be zero-emission  
vehicles starting in 2003, under State Air Resources Board rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real test is not whether it can drive, but whether it  
holds up under day-to-day traffic and whether its emissions are as 
low as predicted,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another factor is cost. A mass-produced fuel cell system costs  
$30,000 to produce, while gasoline engines typically cost $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferdinand Panik, senior vice president for DaimlerChrysler said  
DaimlerChrysler and Ford plan to put fuel-cell powered vehicles on 
the market by 2004. The companies hope to sell the cars at 10 
percent over the cost of gasoline-powered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The test will initially involve 10 cars, driven by company  
employees, as well as a handful of buses, Panik said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the fleet will grow and members of the public will  
get to test the cars. 
</P>
<P>
	The hydrogen for fuel-cell cars comes in liquid form. Motorists  
would likely get it at a service station. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the state and the two automakers, the partnership  
includes oil companies Atlantic Richfield Co, Shell Oil Co. and 
Texaco Inc. and Ballard Power Systems Inc., a fuel-cell company 
partially owned by Ford and DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford and DaimlerChrysler are not the only car companies joining  
forces to develop fuel-cell vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota Motor Corp. and General Motors announced Monday they have  
a five-year deal to develop cars and trucks using fuel cells and 
other environmentally friendly fuel systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of tighter vehicle-emission controls is one factor  
driving the interest, said Mike Flynn, associate director of the 
University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
	John White of the Sierra Club predicts fuel cells will  
eventually replace gasoline and provide the long-distance driving 
capability that another alternative, electricity, lacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology ``will enable us to respond to global warming and  
the need to begin to transition from petroleum,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Bowlin, Arco's chief executive officer, also considers  
fuel cells to be the automotive fuel of the future, though he 
believes oil companies will still be key suppliers when that change 
takes place. Hydrogen for the fuel cells can come from several 
sources, including gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not talking about a revolution here; I am talking about  
evolution,'' he said. ``It may be a decade or two before fuel cells 
begin to make a significant dent in the gasoline fleet.''

<HEADLINE> Importers Complain About Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A French chef complained that his recipes  
won't taste right without Dijon mustard. A German delicatessen 
operator worried that without German raspberry jam her Linzertortes 
won't be the same. 
</P>
<P>
	For a full day, more than 50 witnesses went before a government  
hearing panel Monday to urge that products they cared about be 
exempted from 100 percent tariffs the Clinton administration is 
threatening to impose on more than $900 million of European 
products in a nasty trade fight involving beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Importers of foie gras, truffles, Belgian chocolates, mineral  
water and a host of other European delicacies all argued they were 
being caught unfairly in a trade war between the world's two 
largest trading partners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where is the beef in motorcycles?'' asked Edward W. Moreland,  
Washington representative for the American Motorcycle Association. 
He said the group's 234,000 cycle enthusiasts can't understand why 
European motorcycle imports were being threatened in a food fight 
involving beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffrey Buben showed up in his chef's uniform to say he was  
worried that business at Bistro Bis, his new French restaurant in 
Washington, would be hurt without Dijon mustard, a key ingredient 
in many of his restaurant's dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dijon mustard is a unique product, and nothing else in the  
United States comes close,'' he told the officials from nine 
government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of the hearing was to gather information the  
administration will use when it pares down the original list of 
more than $900 million in European products to a smaller amount on 
which the punitive tariffs will actually be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The prohibitive tariffs are designed to knock European products  
out of the U.S. market in retaliation for Europe's ban on American 
beef from cattle treated with growth hormones. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Trade Organization has ruled in favor of the U.S.  
cattle industry's arguments that the 10-year ban was not justified 
on scientific grounds. American cattle producers on Monday put the 
price of their annual losses at $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The products targeted in the beef dispute are in addition to  
$194.2 million in European imports ranging from fancy handbags to 
bed linen that have been subjected to punitive tariffs since March 
3 in a separate fight with the European Union over trade barriers 
imposed on bananas produced by American companies. 
</P>
<P>
	While the beef hearing was under way, U.S. and EU officials were  
meeting in Washington to search for a compromise that will avert 
the beef sanctions from going into effect in June. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said after the  
talks with Sir Leon Brittan, the EU's top trade official, that the 
United States was willing to consider labeling U.S. beef as coming 
from America, but the American side is resisting EU attempts to 
include language pointing out the use of growth hormones on grounds 
that there is no scientific evidence the hormones are harmful. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key question is whether the EU will respect the clear and  
unambiguous WTO ruling to lift its ban on U.S. meat,'' Barshefsky 
said after the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hildi Fehr, owner of a German delicatessen and restaurant just a  
few blocks from the White House, told the government hearing 
officers she is concerned about the loss of a host of European 
products from Rittersport chocolate and Zweiback toast to various 
European fruit jams and syrups. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Schwartau raspberry jam is very important to me,'' she  
said, calling it a key ingredient in her Linzertortes. ``I have 
tried to use American substitutes ..., but the small jars don't 
have the same intense flavor or consistency as the German raspberry 
jam,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of American breakfast cereals could go up if the  
government keeps oats on the list, because the United States 
imports one-third of the oats it uses, mainly from Canada, Sweden 
and Finland, officials representing American cereal makers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Capalbo, owner of Capalbo Gift Baskets Inc. of Nutley,  
N.J., said he can't believe his own government is making it so 
difficult for him to decide what Irish food products he can afford 
to include in his catalogue, which must be printed soon for next 
year's Christmas season.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Close Mixed / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices closed mixed Tuesday after  
languishing in negative territory for most of the session. The U.S. 
dollar was lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.98 yen at midafternoon, down 0.18 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 117.58 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 22.90 points,  
or 0.14 percent, to close the day at 16,697.11. On Monday, the 
index lost 177.37 points, or 1.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices recouped early losses as foreign and  
individual investors poured funds into the Japanese market. A 
tumble in hi-tech issues, triggered by a selloff of technology 
shares in New York, had kept the Tokyo market lower for most of the 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index lost  
138.43 points Monday to 2,345.61 for its second steepest drop ever. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell after five straight sessions 
of record highs, slipping 53.36 points, or 0.5 percent to 
10,440.53. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was down 3.79 points, or 0.28 percent, to 
1,328.90. The TOPIX lost 10.34 points, or 0.77 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar edged higher from levels  
overnight in New York, mainly on technical gains as U.S. funds 
bought euros against the yen to cover short, or oversold, 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was also supported as both Japanese Finance Minister  
Kiichi Miyazawa and the ministry's international bureau head 
Haruhiko Kuroda expressed displeasure at the recent strengthening 
of the yen against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	In other major currencies, the euro was traded at 125.98 yen, up  
from 125.87 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond dropped to 1.485 percent from Monday's close of 1.575 percent, 
driving its price up to 102.78 yen from 101.97 yen.

<HEADLINE> Court Asked To Review Hopwood Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The University of Texas on Tuesday asked a  
federal appeals court to reconsider a decision that led to a ban on 
race-based policies for admissions, financial aid and scholarships 
at the state's public colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case addresses one of the most important issues of our  
time ... and it deserves the fullest possible hearing and a most 
careful decision by the federal courts,'' said university president 
Larry Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Hopwood ruling by the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of  
Appeals in New Orleans came in a lawsuit against the University of 
Texas law school's affirmative action admissions policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling, which determined the policy discriminated against  
whites, was allowed to stand in 1996 by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Attorney General Dan Morales, a Democrat, then issued a  
legal opinion directing Texas colleges to adopt race-neutral 
policies for admissions, financial aid and scholarships. Critics 
said the legal opinion was too broad. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislators asked the new attorney general, Republican John  
Cornyn, for a new opinion. Cornyn's office helped university 
officials write the appeal filed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The original appeals court ruling was made by a three-judge  
panel. The university, which has fought the lawsuit since it was 
filed, asked Tuesday that the full nine-member court reconsider 
that decision. 
</P>
<P>
	According to University of Texas System Regent Patrick Oxford,  
the Hopwood ruling left the university at a competitive 
disadvantage in recruiting students. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal Office for Civil Rights insists Texas colleges  
implement ``race-conscious'' measures to increase minority 
enrollment, Oxford said. The Hopwood ruling contradicts the civil 
rights office's policies and ``we cannot properly serve Texas in 
such confused circumstances,'' Oxford said. 
</P>
<P>
	A state Comptroller's Office study released in January showed a  
drop in the number of minorities applying for, being admitted to 
and enrolling in some of the state's most selective public schools.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Replaces Kosovo on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Colorado school shooting temporarily pushed  
pictures of panic and horror from Yugoslavia off TV screens 
Tuesday, replacing them with similar scenes from this country. 
</P>
<P>
	It was adrenaline television, most of it beamed to the nation  
from local news operations in Denver. There were gripping pictures 
of students running from the school, relieved reunions with parents 
and crying, anxious people wondering where their loved ones were. 
</P>
<P>
	As the day wore on, the news became grimmer.  
</P>
<P>
	ABC, CBS and NBC broke into regular programming to give details,  
but it was primarily a story for the cable news networks. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's coverage was similar to MSNBC's early in the story, since  
both relied primarily on reports from KUSA-TV, the NBC affiliate. 
Fox News Channel used pictures from KMGH-TV, the ABC affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN's effort to secure affiliate agreements with 600 local  
stations in the United States and Canada paid off for the news 
network, since it was able to choose from among pictures provided 
by four separate local stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a considerable amount of journalistic heft,'' said Earl  
Casey, CNN senior vice president. Its rivals relied primarily on 
their own affiliates as they rushed to get journalists to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, CNN reporter Tony Clark was landing in Denver to  
cover a story on aircraft being used in the Yugoslavian conflict 
Tuesday afternoon, and he was quickly dispatched to the school 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	While the siege was continuing, MSNBC said it was careful not to  
televise aerial pictures that showed activities of police SWAT 
teams, on the chance that suspects inside the school may have had 
access to TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are constantly aware of security issues and not showing  
pictures that would jeopardize the safety of students,'' MSNBC 
spokesman Cory Shields said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, MSNBC did show pictures of students being evacuated  
from Columbine High School and cowering in a corner to try to stay 
out of sight of anyone inside the school building. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS quickly announced it was airing a ``48 Hours'' special on  
the shooting Thursday, calling it ``Young Guns.''

<HEADLINE> First Union May Go West for Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- First Union Corp. chief executive Ed  
Crutchfield is doing some California dreaming of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Crutchfield, speaking today at the bank holding company's annual  
shareholders' meeting in Charlotte, hinted he would like to follow 
the lead of crosstown rival BankAmerica Corp. and go west for its 
next major merger. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's clearly a huge banking market on the West Coast,''  
Crutchfield told about 150 people at this morning's meeting at bank 
headquarters. ``Unfortunately, there are few banks left to 
acquire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte-based BankAmerica completed what was the nation's  
largest bank merger when the former NationsBank combined with San 
Francisco-based BankAmerica last year in a stock deal valued at 
$41.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Crutchfield said there are other ways First Union can expand on  
the West Coast, such as purchasing brokerage houses and other 
financial institutions. But he said he would love to buy a big 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a desire of ours. I wish we were there today,'' he said  
in response to a shareholder's question. ``It's a big desire on my 
part, particularly California, which has 10 percent of the 
country's population. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's on our radar screen and very high,'' Crutchfield said.  
``The question is, how do we do it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, shareholders elected former White House Chief of  
Staff Erskine Bowles and nine other nominees to the board of 
directors of the nation's sixth-largest bank. Bowles, 53, is a 
general partner with Forstmann Little &AMP; Co. of New York and also 
managing director of Carousel Capital Co. of Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Crutchfield said he was pleased with First  
Union's 1998 financial performance. The company said in January it 
earned $2.89 billion, a 7 percent gain over the $2.7 billion in 
earnings for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in excellent position to leverage the platform we've  
built,'' he said. ``I must say that 1999 is going to be a 
challenging year. We will focus our efforts on controlling costs 
and gaining new sources of revenue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crutchfield also said in a interview that he doesn't anticipate  
additional major employment cutbacks. First Union announced last 
month it was cutting 5,850 jobs and leaving two non-core businesses 
as it restructured following the $16.1 billion merger with 
CoreStates Financial Corp.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Going Without Pacific Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military, stretched thin following a  
post-Cold War downsizing, is feeling the pinch. Because of dual 
defense needs in Kosovo and Iraq, no aircraft carrier is plying the 
Pacific. Instead, Air Force planes there have gone on alert for any 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap in carrier coverage for the Pacific could last until the  
fall, when the USS Constellation is to arrive, defense officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Kitty Hawk that was in the Pacific was ordered to the  
Persian Gulf on April 3 to free up the USS Theodore Roosevelt to 
join the NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. The Roosevelt arrived in 
the Adriatic Sea on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Pentagon again is scrambling U.S. military assets  
around the globe to meet a NATO request for 300 more U.S. warplanes 
for Kosovo. That could mean adding a second carrier, sending the 
USS Enterprise and its 75 aircraft -- which just completed a 
six-month Gulf deployment -- to the Aegean Sea instead of home, U.S. 
defense officials said. The Enterprise reached the Mediterranean on 
Tuesday. More warplanes could come from forces around Iraq and 
Korea, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also is considering basing new planes in Turkey and  
Hungary, both NATO members, which could eliminate the need for a 
second carrier. Bulgaria and Romania on Tuesday gave NATO 
permission to use their air space. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior defense official, describing the search for resources,  
said the U.S. military's ``elasticity'' is reduced since the Cold 
War when the Navy had 600 ships, for example, compared with 324 
today. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Navy had 15 aircraft carriers plus one reserve,  
which is just enough to keep one each in the three places the 
Pentagon would like to protect 365 days a year -- the Gulf, the 
Mediterranean and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Navy has had just 12 aircraft carriers since 1994, which  
means there are always gaps of weeks and sometimes months when the 
Pacific, Mediterranean or the Gulf goes without. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a strategic planner for the Joint Chiefs  
of Staff, acknowledged that as NATO's Kosovo air campaign 
continues, ``Over time, it will take a little bit of a toll.'' But 
he said the shifting of carriers and aircraft demonstrates the 
flexibility of today's leaner military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We adjust our forces as necessary,'' Wald said. ``If an  
aircraft carrier moves, we can backfill that with aircraft, and 
vice versa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the U.S. military standoff with Iraq, which last flared  
with four days of airstrikes in December, the Navy kept one or two 
aircraft carriers in the Gulf for 555 days in a row. That meant a 
gap in the Mediterranean and higher alert status for Air Force 
planes at Aviano air base in Italy -- a major takeoff point for 
airstrikes now. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress considers a $6 billion White House request to pay  
for NATO military and humanitarian actions, House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., said the Kosovo crisis has shown, ``Our troops are 
stretched too thin and our defense capabilities are now grossly 
inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the Pacific unguarded by a carrier for long could send  
the wrong signal to North Korea, China or Indonesia, now 
experiencing violence ahead of elections, the first defense 
official acknowledged. A visible U.S. military presence helps 
maintain stability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military doctrine calls for the Pentagon to be prepared to  
fight two regional wars at the same time. Defense officials insist 
that's still possible, even with the U.S. armed forces trimmed to 
2.4 million active duty and reserves compared with 3.8 million in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In times of conflict, presidents today rely more than they used  
to on the National Guard and reserves. President Clinton is 
expected as early as this week to call up as many as 33,000 of 
those troops who would primarily support the expected 300 
additional U.S. warplanes, including refueling tankers flown mostly 
by reservists. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen hasn't yet given final approval  
for the new aircraft nor recommended the call-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Since NATO airstrikes began March 24, the Pentagon has diverted  
planes from the Pacific command and from Iraq operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 300 additional U.S. aircraft would bring the NATO force to  
about 1,000 planes, nearly 800 of them American. More than 20,000 
U.S. troops on ships and European bases are involved in the 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO deployment is still relatively small compared with the  
six-week 1991 Gulf War, when the U.S. military used more than 3,400 
combat aircraft, six aircraft carriers and 700,000 troops, 
including some who took part in a 100-hour ground war to kick Iraq 
out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	If a crisis erupted in the Pacific now, the Navy could deploy  
the USS Constellation within two to three weeks, defense officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force planes also could be in action within 24 hours from  
bases in Japan and Alaska, although that would require using 
increasingly scarce refueling tankers. Planes based in the United 
States -- such as B-52 bombers -- could help in two regions, said an 
Air Force official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier, scheduled to deploy in  
the fall from Florida to the Mediterranean, could be called up 
faster and sent anywhere, defense officials said.

<HEADLINE> IMF Hopeful About Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund reported today  
that ``significant positive developments'' in the world economy 
this year raise hopes that the worst may be over for a financial 
crisis that pushed one-third of the globe into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Issuing its latest ``World Economic Outlook,'' the IMF insisted  
there are still plenty of threats around. But for the first time 
since the crisis erupted, the 182-nation international lending 
organization was able to revise its previous growth forecast 
slightly upward instead of being forced to admit it had been overly 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF said it believes the global economy will expand by 2.3  
percent this year, just 0.1 percentage point higher than a forecast 
it made four months ago. That would still make this year the 
weakest since the last global recession in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	But looking further into the future, the agency saw a solid  
rebound in 2000 with the economy returning to growth of 3.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Global economic growth should pick up again in 2000 as  
adjustments in the emerging market economies run their course,'' 
the IMF economists wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	But for that to occur, the IMF said, the world's largest  
economy, the United States, must achieve a ``soft landing'' with 
growth slowing to a more sustainable pace to keep inflation 
pressures at bay. Japan, the second-largest economy, will have to 
finally exhibit signs of emerging from its worst recession in a 
half-century, the IMF concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	If weaknesses in Japan are prolonged further, if recent weakness  
in continental Europe intensifies or if the United States suffers a 
sharper slowdown than expected, risks to the global economy will 
rise markedly, the IMF said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF forecasts also saw threats coming from the current NATO  
bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, warning of severe disruptions to 
neighboring countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	For the United States, the IMF predicted growth will slow from  
last year's sizzling 3.9 percent rate to 3.3 percent, with an even 
further slowdown to 2.2 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy was projected to shrink again this year, with  
output falling 1.4 percent -- double last year's plunge. However, 
the IMF said there are hopeful signs that Japan's economy finally 
may be emerging from its decade-long period of weakness. It 
predicted an end to the Japanese recession and slight growth of 0.3 
percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF was even more optimistic about other Asian countries,  
where plunging currencies and stock markets, triggered steep 
downturns, beginning first in Thailand in July 1997 and then 
spreading to other nations in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Activity has recently turned around in Korea and seems to have  
bottomed out in Malaysia and Thailand,'' the IMF said. ``Investor 
sentiment toward many emerging market economies has rallied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This assessment echoed a forecast released Monday by the Asian  
Development Bank, which reported ``distinct signs that this sharp 
contraction may be bottoming out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This view is a far cry from concerns last fall after Russia  
defaulted on billions of dollars in debt, throwing stock markets 
from New York to Buenos Aires into a tailspin. The Federal Reserve 
responded with a series of U.S. interest rate cuts that restored 
confidence and helped cushion the shocks when Brazil was forced to 
devalue its own currency in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's new economic forecast was released in advance of the  
agency's annual spring meetings. Those sessions are expected to be 
devoted to discussions about what still must be done to overhaul 
the global financial architecture to prevent future Asian-style 
currency crises.

<HEADLINE> Japan Trade Surplus Rises 23 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world rose 23  
percent in fiscal 1998 from the previous year for the second 
highest total ever recorded, the government announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise trade surplus, the measure of all goods exported  
by Japan minus those imported, rose 23.1 percent to 14.097 trillion 
yen ($118.46 billion), the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure was the second largest after the 14.402 trillion yen  
($121.02 billion at current exchange rates) recorded in fiscal 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's trade surplus with the United States rose 24 percent to  
6.687 trillion yen ($56.19 billion) for the fiscal year, the fifth 
largest surplus on record. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's trade surplus for March, the last month of the  
fiscal year, increased 7.5 percent to 1.334 trillion yen ($11.2 
billion) from the same month last year, the ministry said. The 
surplus is figured before adjustment for seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
	The March surplus was in line with the average forecast of  
Tokyo-based economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	A Japanese Finance Ministry official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said that the government believes Japan's trade balance 
with the world is stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that despite the 23 percent jump last fiscal year, a  
quarterly breakdown showed that the rate of increase slowed sharply 
in the third and fourth quarters of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus rose 46.3 percent in the first quarter and 42.8  
percent in the second quarter. In the third quarter, it rose 7.8 
percent, and gained just 3.6 percent in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Japan's trade surplus fell 32.2 percent for the  
first decline in three months and only the second since April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry official said the narrowing trade balance trend was  
due mainly to continued low levels of exports to the rest of Asia, 
compounded with a fall in export levels to the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United  
States also rose in March, jumping 29.1 percent to 570.30 billion 
yen ($4.79 billion), the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	For fiscal 1998, Japanese exports to America rose 4.2 percent,  
coming to 15.160 trillion yen ($127.40 billion) -- the second 
largest figure ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan has been under heavy pressure from the United States and  
other trading partners to rein in the surplus by bolstering its 
weak economy to spark demand for imports.

<HEADLINE> Fancy Teas Brewed in No-Frills Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASTONBURY, Conn. (AP) -- Mix an intense peach extract with  
chunky leaves of tea and you get Stoopid Love, a smooth, fruity 
brew packaged in a cardboard matchbox. 
</P>
<P>
	Add one 31-year-old CEO, a large dollop of marketing savvy and a  
bunch of energetic teen-age employees, and you get Steep Co., the 
Connecticut company that makes Stoopid Love and 23 other gourmet 
teas. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Piazza launched Steep in 1995, hoping to catch a wave from  
the booming coffeehouse culture. Today, he sells his brews to 
coffee shops and restaurants around the country, rounding out his 
client list with big-name places like MTV and the trendy Manhattan 
bistro Balthazar. 
</P>
<P>
	His base of operations: a no-frills shop in a suburban strip  
mall. A sign from the previous tenant, Village Travel, still hangs 
above the door. Rag dolls made of tea bags hang ghoulishly in the 
window. Music, ranging from Broadway tunes to alternative rock to 
swing, blares from a CD player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our clients would die if they saw this,'' Piazza said  
with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza's entry into entrepreneurship was nearly as haphazard as  
his surroundings. In the early 1990s, with an English degree from 
Wesleyan University and no real career goals, Piazza was biding 
time in an insurance company's management-training program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was OK,'' he says now. ``The pay was good, and it wasn't  
very hard. But it certainly wasn't creative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept his day job but enrolled in classes at New York's School  
of Visual Arts. And then he fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many a twentysomething, Piazza wooed Karen Norton over the  
course of long road trips, with good music in the tape deck and 
frequent stops at coffeehouses, which were popping up all over the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	As they watched teen-agers, wired young professionals and  
sleep-deprived parents shelling out several dollars a pop for fancy 
coffee, they began to toy with the idea of starting a business 
themselves. And Piazza, who preferred tea, wondered if it could 
possibly catch on as coffee had. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Norton began going to trade shows to meet with  
wholesalers and suppliers. They wrote surveys and placed them in 
coffee shops, querying customers about their favorite beverages. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, Piazza determined that while most people liked the  
taste of tea, young Americans linked it with England, or with their 
parents. So he set out to create a tea that a hip, young 
coffeehouse denizen would be proud to order. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the blend. He ordered ingredients from a German  
wholesaler he'd met at a trade show. ``We went to visit them, and 
they were real cool folks,'' he said. ``So I hired them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from the ``cool folks'' factor, they made whole-leaf tea,  
while most tea companies chop the tea ingredients into tiny pieces 
called fannings. ``It's the difference between steak and 
hamburger,'' Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the package. Since the whole-leaf tea, with its flowers  
and twigs, didn't fit properly into a flat tea bag, Piazza found a 
New York company that wrapped tea in tiny round balls. The balls, 
of course, didn't fit into a typical paper tea envelope. So Piazza 
designed tiny cardboard matchboxes, each imprinted with a stylized 
``S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted it to be cool,'' he said. ``I mean, I'd been drinking  
tea out of a box with little teddy bears on it for years, and 
that's a little weird.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next, the names. Darjeeling and Earl Grey may be exotic, but  
Piazza wanted quirky. So he christened mint tea Urban Catnip. A 
mellow vanilla green tea became Corduroy Hips. And he named a berry 
blend Josie's Heart, in honor of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowning touch: Each tea got its own loopy slogan imprinted  
on the box. Soogar Dreams, a chamomile tea, offers this gentle 
wish: ``Say good-night, Sleepyhead. Close them big brown eyes and 
I'll close mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the tea was made, Piazza hit the road again, this time with  
friend Damion Silver. They crammed boxes in the back of their car 
and showed up unannounced at 400 coffeehouses between Connecticut 
and California. His sales pitch, he admits, was hopelessly 
unpolished. 
</P>
<P>
	``I basically said, 'I have this really good tea. Do you want to  
buy it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of places said no. Some were content with their existing  
teas; others were reluctant to deal with a vendor with no track 
record, Piazza recalls. But eventually, they sold their entire 
supply and returned to Connecticut with a profit of $800 and a 
solid list of clients. It was enough to convince Piazza he could 
make a go of it. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first full year, Steep sold 5,000 boxes of tea, at $12  
retail and $7.50 wholesale. Last year, the company sold 5,000 boxes 
each week. Sales are growing thanks to a Web site and a steady push 
into chichi places like the Armani Exchange store on New York's 
Fifth Avenue. Steep provided the tea for the store's 1998 opening. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza said small, independent coffeehouses remain his target  
customers, and most of his higher-end clients have come to him 
through recommendations. He likes to say he has no real marketing 
strategy, but he recently made a pitch to Rosie O'Donnell with some 
of his mother's cookies and samples of Steep. 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza has also plugged his tea in magazines as diverse as Teen  
(which exulted, ``What a hip sip!''), Vegetarian Times and InStyle. 
But the media has gotten him in trouble, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, a Hartford television station did a story on Steep,  
which was then operating out of Piazza's Glastonbury home. The next 
morning, the town's zoning board showed up at Steep, warning Piazza 
he couldn't run the business out of his home. That's why Steep is 
now housed in a strip mall, and why one of Piazza's goals for 1999 
is to ``observe and follow rules and regulations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't mean they'll turn down the music. Steep has become a  
favorite hangout for the high-school students who work there, 
filling the tiny matchboxes and treating Piazza like a favorite 
older brother. And no wonder: Piazza lures them with free tea, 
boxes of Cracker Jack and plenty of room to experiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the coolest job a kid could ever have,'' said Adam  
Bothamley, a 16-year-old Glastonbury High School student. When he's 
not filling orders, he mixes herbs, trying to concoct new blends, 
and dreams up names for the teahouse Piazza hopes to open some time 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I give them a lot of responsibility because I can't give them  
a lot of money,'' Piazza said. Piazza also relies on ``Steep 
North,'' a kitchen-table collaboration between his retired parents 
and several older relatives in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kind of just depend on folks to show up and help out,''  
Piazza said. ``It may look a little random, but it all gets done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piazza works at all hours, fueled on four or five hours of sleep  
a night and plenty of caffeine. Some days, he said, exhaustion sets 
in and he longs for the days when he and Norton (now his fiancee) 
could come home at 5 p.m., have a leisurely dinner and catch a 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then I get these little fixes,'' he said. A big new order,  
a glossy magazine story, even a tasty new flavor can spur him on to 
the next challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Early this year, Steep received its first takeover offer, from a  
New York natural foods company. The money was good, he said, and 
the prospect of wide distribution and marketing muscle was 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	But ultimately, he wasn't ready to give up his business. In  
making his decision, he thought about his father, who held one 
position for defense contractor Raytheon Corp. for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess along the way he had opportunities to advance, but my  
dad felt that he was doing OK with what he already had,'' Piazza 
said. ``I figure that if Steep stays just a small mom and pop, so 
be it. There's a certain solid something that you can hang your hat 
on once you accept that.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Obese women are six times more likely than  
thin women to have a silent, smoldering inflammation inside their 
arteries that may increase their already high risk of developing 
heart disease, researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the findings are verified, they suggest scientists should  
study whether the aspirin some heart patients take might also help 
overweight people reduce their chances of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Being overweight is an automatic warning sign for heart disease:  
The fatter people are, the more likely they are to have high 
cholesterol and clogged arteries, high blood pressure, diabetes and 
other cardiovascular risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one knew if those extra pounds could cause yet another  
risk: low-grade inflammation inside a person's arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	In otherwise seemingly healthy people, scientists recently  
discovered that this low-grade inflammation can simmer for years 
and significantly increase a person's risk of a heart attack or 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows what causes the subtle inflammation. One theory has  
been that it might be bacteria, and indeed, some research suggests 
that antibiotics may help fight heart disease. On the other hand, 
doctors already frequently prescribe aspirin to certain people at 
high risk of heart attacks because it thins their blood -- and 
aspirin also reduces inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch scientist Marjolein Visser knew that fat cells themselves  
can produce a substance called interleukin-6 that causes 
inflammation when it seeps into the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	So she studied whether obesity could be another culprit, using a  
U.S. database of 16,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to measure this ``micro-inflammation'' is using a  
blood test that detects C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP levels 
skyrocket when people are sick, with colds, inflammatory diseases 
like rheumatoid arthritis, even heart disease. But lower levels, 
between 0.2 milligrams and 1 mg per deciliter of blood, are the 
ones that signal the simmering inflammation that has scientists 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Visser discovered that obese women are six times more likely to  
have this low-grade inflammation than normal-weight people. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men were twice as likely to have it, a gender difference  
Visser couldn't explain, except to say that women in the study were 
much more overweight than men studied. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised'' the risk was so high, Visser said Tuesday,  
before presenting her findings at a biology meeting here. If 
verified, ``it could have quite an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visser, a weight specialist at Amsterdam's Vrije University,  
statistically controlled for other diseases that might have caused 
the study participants' CRP levels to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	She found equal risk when examining only healthy people under  
age 40. Even ``at a young age, when you're obese there's this 
inflammation, and we know it's bad for you,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study isn't proof that obesity inflames people's arteries,  
cautioned Dr. Richard J. Havlik of the National Institute on Aging, 
which funded the research. But the federal agency is intrigued 
enough that it is funding more research into the link -- and probing 
whether obesity-caused inflammation might have ramifications for 
other diseases, too. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Visser is preparing to see whether losing weight causes  
CRP levels to drop immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Her findings, however, raise the question of whether aspirin or  
any of the dozens of other anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, 
could help obese people ward off heart disease, and she cautions 
that nobody has tested that yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing to do if you're obese is lose weight instead of  
hitting the aspirin bottle,'' she cautioned.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pushes Racial Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring racial unity ``the defining moral  
issue of our time,'' former Sen. Bill Bradley today put the quest 
for societal integration at the center of his campaign to win the 
White House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, the sole Democrat thus far to challenge Vice President  
Al Gore for the party's nomination, said the problem of race is 
``central to our American future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In running for president, I'm betting that far more than a  
majority of people in America want to achieve a deeper racial 
unity,'' he said in remarks prepared for a speech today at Cooper 
Union in New York City. An advance text of his remarks was released 
Monday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was speaking in a city where the shooting death of an  
unarmed African immigrant by four white police officers has ignited 
a storm of protests and caused a major political headache for Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Ronald Reagan was president, everyone knew that if you  
wanted to please the boss, you cut taxes, increased military 
spending and fought communism,'' he said. ``If I'm president, I 
want one thing to be known: If you want to please the boss, one of 
the things you'd better show is how in your department or agency 
you've furthered tolerance and racial understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley recited a litany of prejudices and injustices: church  
bombings, incidents of people beaten or killed because they were of 
Chinese descent or gay, the police practice of pulling over drivers 
because they are racial minorities. And he spoke about his own 
experience with the prejudices directed at his black teammates when 
he played professional basketball, and how they drove him into 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me the quest for racial unity remains the defining moral  
issue of our time. It's the reason I first ran for public office,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, pointing to the case of West African immigrant Amadou  
Diallo, who on Feb. 4 was hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired by four 
white New York City plainclothes officers, said the fight for 
racial equality has changed since the civil rights movement of past 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``While legal barriers are down, divisions still remain, but  
they are divisions of the heart more than of the law,'' he said. 
``If you're black, you know that being within the radar of white 
fear and suspicion can be dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This tragic event was in most ways different from the church  
burnings of 1994. ... It was not an act of senseless hatred. It 
cannot be dismissed as an act of aberrant individuals,'' he said, 
adding that the solution is to eradicate ``white indifference and 
black suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is expected to formally announce his candidacy later  
this year and trails the better-known Gore in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who has tried to portray himself as a more traditional  
liberal Democrat than the vice president, argued that in addition 
to moral concerns, Americans ought to focus on improving racial 
relations out of economic self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the year 2010 in America, less than 60 percent of the  
people entering the work force are going to be native-born white 
Americans,'' he said. ``That means that the economic future of the 
children of white Americans will depend increasingly on the talents 
of non-white Americans. That's not ideology. That's demographics.''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Accountability Bill Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government would be required to  
report each year on the costs its numerous regulations impose on 
businesses and government bodies under a bill approved Tuesday by a 
House subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would increase the federal government's  
accountability and improve the quality of regulatory programs, said 
its sponsors, Reps. Tom Bliley, R-Va., and David McIntosh, R-Ind. 
The GOP has introduced several measures to curb the creation of new 
rules and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	``As many Americans filed their federal income taxes last week,  
I'm sure many wondered where their hard-earned dollars were 
going,'' Bliley said. ``This bill will help answer that question by 
providing an annual accounting statement of regulations at all 
federal agencies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House Government Reform Committee's panel on national  
economic growth, natural resources and regulators affairs approved 
the bill by voice vote over the objections of some Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, said the Clinton administration  
has joined labor, environmental, consumer protection and public 
health groups in opposing the bill because it could tie up already 
overburdened government agencies with work that may end up being of 
little value. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure may ``seriously hamper the work of federal  
government agencies which are mandated to protect the public from 
adverse consequences and certain business practices,'' threats to 
the environment and public health and unfair labor practices, 
Kucinich said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, he said, the bill puts too much emphasis on the impact  
of regulations on businesses and other organizations and too little 
on how the regulations affect the people they are designed to 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to  
compile accounting statements on the costs of federal regulations. 
Accompanying reports would analyze the impact of regulations on the 
private sector, including small businesses, wages, consumer prices 
and economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that the bill will not impose any undue burden on  
OMB since much of the needed information is already available,'' 
McIntosh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee approved a Kucinich amendment that would have  
OMB also look at impacts on public health, public safety, the 
environment, consumer protection, equal opportunity and other 
policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., has introduced similar legislation  
in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1074.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Internet toy retailer eToys Inc. announced today  
that it will merge with BabyCenter, Inc., which runs a Web site 
that offers advice to new and expectant mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Santa Monica, Calif.-based eToys will issue shares of its common  
stock to BabyCenter's stockholders in exchange for their 
outstanding shares of BabyCenter capital stock. 
</P>
<P>
	eToys sells products from more than 500 manufacturers, including  
mass market brands like Mattel and Hasbro, and specialty names like 
Brio and Creativity for Kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts told USA Today that eToys hopes the content-heavy site  
of San Francisco-based BabyCenter will drive sales as moms using 
BabyCenter will turn to eToys to buy toys for toddlers. BabyCenter 
sells products and supplies for infants. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal gives eToys another boost with its initial public stock  
offering later this month expected to be one of the most-sought 
after of the year.

<HEADLINE> Roba's Boston Win Is An Easy One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Maybe Fatuma Roba finally will have some  
down-the-stretch competition. Maybe Louise Sauvage will race away 
to an easy victory for a change. 
</P>
<P>
	None of that happened in the past three Boston Marathons in  
which Roba easily won the women's division, or in the past two 
women's wheelchair races when Sauvage edged Jean Driscoll at the 
finish line twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Sauvage and Driscoll were so close in both races that they were  
clocked in the same official time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew she was behind me, but I didn't know how close she was  
until I saw her on the TV later,'' Sauvage, of Australia, said 
Tuesday. ``I like the competition. I like her to be there pushing 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next year, Driscoll may not be there. The Champaign, Ill.,  
resident said she hasn't decided if she'll run in the 104th Boston 
Marathon in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to evaluate my season in the fall. I have to see  
whether I have the heart or mental strength to do this again,'' she 
said. In Monday's race, she didn't have the physical strength to 
overtake Sauvage. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 11,481 racers started the marathon and 11,293 --  
including seven women wheelchair competitors -- finished. Franz 
Nietlispach of Switzerland easily won his fourth men's wheelchair 
race and third in a row. In the men's open division, Joseph Chebet 
became the ninth straight Kenyan champion after finishing second in 
his previous three marathons, one in Boston and two in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet's time of 2 hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds was 27 seconds  
faster than runnerup Silvio Guerra of Ecuador. The Sauvage-Driscoll 
battle was much closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Furiously spinning the wheels of her chair with her arms,  
Driscoll worked hard to take over the lead, but Sauvage held her 
off. Both were timed in 1:42:23 over the 26-mile, 385-yard course. 
They were timed in 1998 in 1:41:19. 
</P>
<P>
	``Number 8 has been very elusive,'' seven-time winner Driscoll  
said. ``I think the close losses are why it hurts so much the next 
morning. It's heartbreaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she deliberately stayed behind Monday, hoping to race  
past Sauvage near the end, but ``she's a very good sprinter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sauvage also won in 1997, racing by herself for the last four  
miles. If Driscoll's chair hadn't been upended on trolley tracks, 
that race also might have gone down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do my best when I have somebody pushing me,'' Sauvage said  
after Monday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not matter how Roba feels about that since no runner has  
been able to push her over the final several miles as she won the 
last three races by 42 seconds, 3:56 and 2:26. Next year, the 
Ethiopian who won the 1996 Olympic gold medal can become the first 
four-time winner of the women's open division since it became an 
official part of the race in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to get the same invitation'' to run in the race, Roba  
said, ``and, hopefully, to win the fourth Boston Marathon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She won her third after China's Sun Yingjie pushed a blistering  
pace before being overtaken just past the midpoint and finishing 
11th. Roba and Kenya's Catherine Ndereba ran together for a while 
before Roba surged ahead with about eight miles to go and kept 
stretching her lead. Ndereba came in sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a Chinese girl running ahead of me (but) the only  
one who scared me was the Kenyan girl who was next to me,'' Roba 
said. ``At 25 kilometers (15.53 miles) I knew I was going to win 
the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All she had to do was run more than 10 more miles to make it  
official. She did it so quickly, in 2:23:35, that she was 24th 
overall, the best finish by a woman in the race's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I do my training in Ethiopia, I only do my own pace,''  
Roba said. ``So I don't worry about who's ahead of me or who's 
behind me. I always have my own strategy. That's what I'm going to 
continue to do.''

<HEADLINE> Centenarians' Longevity Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Mathematics professor Dirk Struik has learned a  
lot in his 104 years. But ask him about the secret to living a long 
life, and he is momentarily speechless. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived this long because I didn't die,'' deadpanned  
Struik, a native of the Netherlands who began teaching at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	After a bit of reflection, the centenarian boils it down to a  
simple formula: ``I have good friends. I'm healthy. Above all, I'm 
active.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those are three of the most important factors in living long and  
staying healthy, according to two Harvard scientists who studied 
more than 100 centenarians to try to unlock the secret of 
longevity. 
</P>
<P>
	Though only the genetically blessed can expect to live more than  
a century, the researchers say they have identified some factors 
that could help everyone extend life and keep its quality high. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trick is not staying young; it's aging well,'' said Dr.  
Thomas Perls, director of the New England Centenarian Study and 
co-author of the recently published book ``Living to 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to say everyone can live to 100,'' said the  
book's other author, Margery Silver, associate director of the 
study and a neuropsychologist. ``But most people do not live up to 
their genetic potential, their maximum age span.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are as many as 64,000 centenarians in the country,  
according to U.S. Census Bureau statistics. By 2050, that number 
could surge to between 500,000 and 1 million, Perls said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, a joint project of Harvard Medical School and Beth  
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, began in 1994 and looked at 
centenarians -- 85 percent of them women, 15 percent men -- in eight 
Boston-area communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Several factors showed up in the lives and personalities of many  
of the subjects, including what Perls and Silver call the 
``centenarian personality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They handle emotional stress incredibly well,'' said Perls,  
39. 
</P>
<P>
	Study subjects had lost spouses, endured hardships, even  
survived the horrors of the Holocaust. Yet they were generally 
optimistic and, in most cases, funny. ``They use humor all the 
time,'' Perls said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's incredibly important to keep your mind active and not  
become a mental couch potato,'' Perls added. Activities as mundane 
as balancing a checkbook or tough as learning to play an instrument 
were reported by many centenarians. 
</P>
<P>
	More surprising, among the factors Perls and Silver did not find  
to be significant in the lives of the over-100s were diet and 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Diet, considered by many doctors to be central to long life, was  
tough to study because it varied widely, Perls said. Researchers 
did find one common factor: Nearly all subjects reported they had 
always eaten in moderation. 
</P>
<P>
	As for education, which has been suggested to have a  
proportional correlation to longevity, only two of the subjects had 
advanced degrees.

<HEADLINE> Adams Burial Crypt To Reopen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	QUINCY, Mass. (AP) -- The church crypt containing the remains of  
father and son presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams will 
reopen despite earlier concerns that it would be closed to visitors 
for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State William F. Galvin, who also is chairman of  
the state Historical Commission, said Monday he will grant $15,000 
to the United First Parish to continue to maintain the crypt. 
</P>
<P>
	The church was built in 1828 and contains the remains of John  
Adams and his wife, Abigail, and John Quincy Adams and his wife, 
Louisa Catherine. 
</P>
<P>
	The grant will allow the church, also known as Church of the  
Presidents, to reopen the crypt to visitors as soon as May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The church announced earlier this month that it no longer could  
afford to subsidize the daily visits, although it would continue to 
open the crypt for prearranged visits. 
</P>
<P>
	John Adams was the country's second president, serving from 1797  
to 1801. His son, John Quincy Adams, was the sixth president, 
serving from 1825 to 1829.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Police said two suspects were dead after  
a pair of young gunmen dressed in long, black trench coats opened 
fire in a suburban Denver high school. At least 20 people were 
injured. Police also led a student away from the school in 
handcuffs. ``He's one of the ones who shot at us,'' said another 
student. Officials said an unknown number of injured people 
remained in the school. Police scoured the school as dozens of 
students fled on foot. There were also reports of explosions inside 
Columbine High School. Shortly after the school was stormed by SWAT 
teams., three youths wearing black were stopped by police in a

were staging ``a kind of safari operation,'' shelling hills where 
ethnic Albanians fled to flush them out, marching the refugees on

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds will be out of the lineup for  
at least 2 1/2 months after surgery today on his throwing arm. The 
All-Star left fielder underwent an operation to repair a triceps 
tendon in his left arm and a bone spur in his elbow. San Francisco 
Giants team physician Dr. Bill Montgomery said Bonds was expected 
to be released from the hospital today and fitted for a brace this 
week.

<HEADLINE> Texas Instruments' Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas Instruments Inc. reported a sharp increase  
in first-quarter profit on Tuesday, beating Wall Street 
expectations amid strong demand for microprocessors used as the 
brainpower for cellular phones, computer modems and other 
electronic products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based chip company earned $233 million, or 58 cents a  
share, in the three months ended March 31. That was up from a 
profit of $11 million, or 3 cents a diluted share, in the year-ago 
quarter, when results were hurt by one-time charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell to $2.04 billion from $2.19 billion due to the  
company's sale of its slumping memory chip business to Micron 
Technologies last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a $41 million one-time charge in 1999's first quarter,  
Texas Instruments would have earned 65 cents a share, beating the 
61 cents forecast by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite beating expectations, the company's stock was down 5  
percent in trading, falling $5 to $100 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Instruments chief executive Tom Engibous said the company  
expects further growth in semiconductor sales in the second 
quarter. The company aims to boost sales of digital signal 
processors, the specialized chips used as brains in 
telecommunications equipment, and processors that run computer hard 
disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher revenues also are expected from chips used in calculators  
sold during the back-to-school season.

<HEADLINE> CNN and Peter Arnett Part Ways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Veteran correspondent Peter Arnett fought to  
keep his job with CNN last summer after he narrated an ill-fated 
report charging the U.S. military used nerve gas on American 
defectors during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine months and one story later, CNN and Arnett agreed on a  
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN and Arnett issued a terse statement Monday saying Arnett was  
leaving after 18 years effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are grateful for Peter's contributions to CNN and we wish  
him the very best in the future,'' said Cable News Network chairman 
Tom Johnson, declining further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett said that ``I've had a long and wonderful relationship  
with CNN and have been proud to be part of this great news 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett was the correspondent for the June 1998 ``Tailwind''  
report that charged the U.S. military used sarin on a 1970 mission 
in Laos. The story was retracted after an internal investigation 
could not substantiate the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN fired two producers of the report, and others resigned or  
offered to quit. Arnett was reprimanded but kept his job after 
telling management that he had little to do with the reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Arnett made only one appearance on the air at CNN,  
reporting about Algeria on Dec. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett, who covered conflicts in Bosnia in 1994 and Yugoslavia  
in 1996 and 1997, was notably absent from coverage of the current 
Yugoslav conflict and CNN never explained why. 
</P>
<P>
	``They gave me a beeper, and they said, `Sit by the beeper.' But  
it hasn't beeped,'' he told The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett, who did not return repeated phone calls from The  
Associated Press on Monday, told USA Today that he felt ``my legs 
have been cut out from under me'' by CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an organization I love,'' he said. ``But this is  
pretty shabby treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett won a Pulitzer Prize in 1966 for reporting from Vietnam  
for The Associated Press. He left to join CNN during the cable 
network's infancy, in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Arnett's aggressive reporting from Iraq made him unpopular with  
the military, and many journalists were angry with him last summer 
when ``Tailwind'' exposed the notion that sometimes television 
reporters don't actually report the stories they narrate. 
</P>
<P>
	No other network publicly expressed interest in Arnett on  
Monday. American television networks have been cutting back on 
international coverage during the 1990s, relying more on news 
services for all but the biggest stories.

<HEADLINE> Hank Aaron Reigns as Career HR King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Like any red-blooded baseball fan, Hank Aaron  
watched in awe last summer as Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa staged a 
seasonlong celebration of his signature hit -- the home run. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never thought anybody would hit 70,'' said Aaron, who never  
hit more than 47 in any one season but finished with a record 755. 
``Seventy. Nobody ever dreamed of 70 when I was hitting my little 
40.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of Aaron's 40-something seasons -- he reached that total  
eight times and was in the 30s seven other times -- added up to one 
of baseball's most cherished records. 
</P>
<P>
	A quarter-century ago, Aaron's pursuit of Babe Ruth's record of  
714 home runs was accompanied by racial overtones and threats on 
his life and family. 
</P>
<P>
	His run at Ruth was less celebrated than it was acknowledged. At  
the end, there was relief rather than joy about the achievement. 
The scars of that time are buried in the deepest part of his 
psyche, overshadowed by the good times he now enjoys. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a new award carrying his name that will go to baseball's  
best hitter and a slick new photo book reflecting on his life and 
his achievement. President Clinton attended his 65th birthday party 
and invited him to visit the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The acclaim is coming 25 years after the fact, but Aaron  
understands. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good things come to those who wait,'' he said. ``I had no  
choice but to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron watched baseball embrace McGwire and Sosa as they chased  
Roger Maris' single season record of 61 and felt a little jealous. 
</P>
<P>
	``McGwire, every time he hit a homer, he raised his son,'' he  
said, recalling the home plate greeting that became a ritual 
between father and son. ``I was unable to do that. If I had, how 
wonderful it would have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron's pursuit of Ruth was largely ignored by everyone  
involved, including Aaron. The record sort of crept up on him, but 
that's what happens when you play 23 years and keep hitting 30 and 
40 home runs every season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think of home runs,'' he said. ``I think of other  
things. My stealing percentage was very good. I was able to field 
with anybody. Not one time did I strike out 100 times in a season. 
That's what's required to hit 40 or 45 homers. If I made contact, I 
had a good chance of getting a base hit or hitting it out of the 
park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, he did that with regularity, which is what is  
required to catch him. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron thinks Ken Griffey Jr. has the best shot.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's 29 and he has 350,'' Aaron said. ``If he keeps doing what  
he's doing, he can break it. It will take a ballplayer an awful 
long time having good years to hit 755. I played a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing that can get in the way is if he gets hurt or  
gets complacent. That's the worst thing than can happen. You start 
thinking you're better than you are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron's last 40-homer season was 1973, when he finished with  
713, one homer behind Ruth's record. He homered in Cincinnati 
during the Braves' opening series there in 1974 to tie the record 
and then broke it in Atlanta's home opener. 
</P>
<P>
	He hit 20 home runs that season, then returned to Milwaukee with  
the Brewers for two final seasons. There was no farewell tour, no 
chance for baseball to say goodbye. He just walked away from the 
game after the 1976 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went out the same way I came in,'' he said. ``I didn't have  
a celebration. I wouldn't want it any other way. I knew I was going 
to retire. I knew I played as long as I could. There was no 
baseball left in me.''

<HEADLINE> Mormon Family Library Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mormon church President Gordon B.  
Hinckley, speaking at the funeral of a slain church security guard, 
expressed outrage that a mentally ill man was able to buy the 
handgun used to kill two people and wound four others. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to more than 1,000 mourners Monday at the Westbrook  
Stake Center in West Jordan, Hinckley said there was no answer to 
why Donald Thomas, a 62-year-old grandfather, had to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``This terrible incident becomes a warning to all of  
ever-present danger'' when ``warped minds'' can still easily obtain 
firearms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley expressed dismay that ``such a person'' was somehow  
permitted to ``arm himself with an automatic weapon to cut down and 
kill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, Russian immigrant Sergei Babarin, 70, had been  
treated for a mood disorder and reportedly had not been taking his 
medication before walking into the church's Family History Library 
on Thursday with a .22-caliber handgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Babarin opened fire without warning, killing a patron, Patricia  
Irene Frengs, 55, police said. Authorities said he then fired into 
Thomas' chest and wounded four others before being killed in an 
exchange of gunfire with police. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot live and work in a bunker mentality,'' said  
Hinckley, the leader of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day 
Saints. ``This entire episode was gruesome ... and we hope never to 
experience it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The library reopened Monday for the first time since the  
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley said that he regularly had exchanged morning greetings  
with Thomas, whom he remembered as ``a self-effacing man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He would look down on this vast congregation today and say,  
`How come all this for me?''' Hinckley said, then answered: ``It is 
because of our love and appreciation and respect for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hinckley said the church would make provisions for the continued  
care and support of Thomas' widow, Konadee, who suffers from 
multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people lined up outside the building before it  
opened about a half hour late due to a devotional service for the 
library staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Kempe said he was ``a little apprehensive, but I'm not  
going to stop coming. I'm still going to do it -- because it's 
important to me, and I come every Monday.''

<HEADLINE> GM's Pearce Back After Cancer Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Harry Pearce says his brush with death has  
changed him. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice chairman of General Motors Corp. -- a top candidate to  
replace chairman Jack Smith when he retires -- returned to the 
public spotlight Monday for the first time since undergoing nearly 
a year of treatment for leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce conducted a news conference announcing a joint venture  
with Toyota Motor Corp. to do research and development into 
advanced technology vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel absolutely great,'' Pearce said. ``My physicians tell  
me I'm progressing extremely well. And I'm back at work, full 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce, 56, was diagnosed last year with leukemia. He underwent  
a stem-cell transplant at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research 
Center in Seattle and until recently had continued to work from 
home as he recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview that will appear in the May 10 edition of  
Fortune magazine, Pearce says the painful experience of facing the 
possibility of death and the difficult treatment for leukemia 
changed the way he views work and people. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a very real transformation in how I think,''  
Pearce said. ``Even people I didn't care for in the past, I find 
myself re-examining and looking for the good, and often finding it. 
This experience focuses your attention on what I would call real 
value. You're less egocentric because you realize in a very direct 
way how the support of others has contributed to your still being 
around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your relationship with other people -- your family, your  
friends, your fellow employees -- becomes much more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pearce's position in GM's succession plan was cast in doubt last  
summer when his illness was discovered. But with his leukemia in 
remission and his role at Monday's event, it's clear that Pearce 
has resumed a high-profile role with the world's largest automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortune said the lawyer made it clear he would like to succeed  
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I owe the corporation is the ability to deliver 100  
percent,'' Pearce told the magazine. ``If I can deliver that, 
leukemia should not be an issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	G. Richard Wagoner Jr., 46, was elevated to president and chief  
operating officer in October and is seen as Pearce's top competitor 
to replace Smith, who recently turned 61. The mandatory retirement 
age at GM is 65, but there has been some speculation that Smith may 
step down sooner.

<HEADLINE> Anheuser-Busch Abandons Plastic Idea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Anheuser-Busch Cos. has ended a month-old  
experiment to see how well its beer would sell in plastic bottles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Tuesday, the company siad it was suspending the  
tests because of ``limited consumer interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The test marketing began about the middle of March, with  
Budweiser and Bud Light being sold in 16-ounce plastic bottles in 
convenience stores in Dallas and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Anheuser-Busch had viewed the plastic bottles as a potential  
alternative to the traditional aluminum can or glass bottle. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, the nation's No. 2 brewer, started selling beer in  
plastic bottles in some markets in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer in plastic bottles has been available in Europe and  
Australia for years.

	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Andre Agassi and Boris Becker  
withdrew from the Monte Carlo Open today, Agassi because of a 
shoulder injury and Becker because of his father's death.

<HEADLINE> Congress Party Seeks India Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The long-dominant Congress Party was  
confident Tuesday of staging its comeback to power, most likely as 
a minority government with little hope of a long life. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said Italian-born Sonia Gandhi would head the  
new administration. But key backers were voicing reservations about 
her, and it was not clear whether she would become prime minister 
or ask a party colleague to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, heir to India's foremost political dynasty, is the  
widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and daughter-in-law of Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi, both of whom were assassinated. Indira's 
father was India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bharatiya Janata Party, which led the government ousted  
Saturday in a vote of confidence, claimed it had enough support to 
block Congress. In that event, a new election would be almost 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Activity on forming a government was expected to be suspended  
until after parliament enacts the national budget early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arjun Singh, a senior Congress official, said the new  
administration would most likely be a minority government led by 
Sonia Gandhi because it ``would be easier to manage'' than an 
unwieldy coalition of divergent parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Party spokesman Ajit Jogi told The Associated Press on Tuesday  
that Congress would have letters of support from a majority of 
parliament to prove to President K.R. Narayanan it will be able to 
govern. The president must decide which party can form the next 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president calls us tomorrow evening, we will  
immediately respond with all the letters,'' Jogi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Congress legislators admitted the government was not likely  
to last the four years until the next scheduled election. Congress, 
which has governed India for 45 of its 51 years as an independent 
nation, can at best hope to garner support from 272 legislators, 
but that razor-edge majority would be difficult to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still talking with all the leaders to evolve a  
consensus,'' Mrs. Gandhi said as she left a meeting with veteran 
communist leader Jyoti Basu. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry and business officials were awaiting the passage of the  
budget that pledged to step up the pace of free-market reforms, 
downsize government and raise taxes. The budget was seen as 
investor friendly, and there had been fears it could fall victim to 
politics after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets tumbled more than 250 points Saturday but revived  
after all political parties agreed to pass the budget unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi has met almost every opposition leader, but most  
were reluctant to commit their support before she had enough 
backers to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am assuring you that there is no difficulty, no problem in  
forming an alternative government,'' said Arjun Singh. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the  
United States hopes the next Indian government will take concrete 
steps on a nuclear arms nonproliferation agreement and improvement 
of relations with neighboring Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Washington had expressed regret at both India's and  
Pakistan's tests earlier this month of long-range nuclear capable 
missiles.

	H.S. Shooting Death Toll May Be 25  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men dressed in fatigues  
unleashed a barrage of gunfire in a suburban Denver high school 
today in what police say was a suicide mission that may have killed 
25 people. Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said two suspects 
were found dead inside the library at Columbine High School. 
Students fled in spurts during the afternoon as police tried to 
secure the building. By early evening, officers had yet to remove 
any bodies because of the danger of explosives and the need to 
preserve evidence. FBI agents and police SWAT teams were slowly 
making their way through the building tonight. The dead suspects 
were found with devices that could be bombs, said a sheriff's 
spokesman.

	Colo. Parents Search for Their Kids

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- In the chaotic aftermath of the nation's  
latest deadly school shooting today, students scrambled for safety 
and their parents endured an agonizing wait for news. Crying and 
shaking, some rescued students from Columbine High School were 
taken by bus to an elementary school, where some parents stood on 
fences, straining to try to see their children. Cries of ``There 
she is!'' or ``I don't see her!'' went up as the buses rolled to a 
stop.

	Kosovars Used As Human Shields  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO attacks continued today in  
Pristina as the alliance began investigating reports of Serbs using 
ethnic Albanians as human shields. Officials told reporters at NATO 
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, that the alliance was looking 
into reports of 700 ethnic Albanian boys as young as 14 being used 
either as ``human shields or as blood banks for Serb casualties.'' 
Refugees also said as many as 700 men were used as human shields 
last week near the town of Orahovac. There was no independent 
confirmation of the report.

	U.S. Going Without Pacific Carrier  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military, stretched thin following a  
post-Cold War downsizing, is feeling the pinch because of dual 
defense needs in Kosovo and Iraq. No aircraft carrier is currently 
plying the Pacific. Instead, Air Force planes there have gone on 
alert for any trouble. The gap in carrier coverage for the Pacific 
could last until the fall, when the USS Constellation is to arrive, 
defense officials said. The USS Kitty Hawk that was in the Pacific 
was ordered to the Persian Gulf on April 3 to free up the USS 
Theodore Roosevelt to join the NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. The 
Roosevelt arrived in the Adriatic Sea on April 5.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The enforcement of a new law banning companies

Commission's proposed rules would require operators of commercial 
Web sites to make ``reasonable efforts'' in most cases to obtain 
consent from parents before asking children under 13 for their 
names, addresses, telephone numbers or other identifying details.

	Health Benefits of Vitamin C Touted

increasing evidence over the past two decades of its 
cancer-fighting ability. In a paper in tomorrow's Journal of the 
American Medical Association, researchers from the National 
Institutes of Health said the RDA for vitamin C should be raised 
from 60 milligrams to between 100 mg and 200 mg.

</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds had surgery on his throwing arm  
today and will be out of the San Francisco Giants' lineup for at 
least 2 1/2 months. The All-Star left fielder underwent an operation 
to repair a triceps tendon in his left arm and a bone spur in his 
elbow. Giants team physician Dr. Bill Montgomery said Bonds was 
expected to be released from the hospital today and fitted for a 
brace this week.

<HEADLINE> Ney, Sanders Team on Seniors Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an unusual political alliance, a Republican  
congressman from Ohio teamed Tuesday with one of the most liberal 
members of Congress to propose a significant change in Social 
Security law. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea: link Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, or  
COLAs, to the costs America's elderly actually face. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it is one of the most fair ways to be fair to  
senior citizens,'' said Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that Bob and I are trying to do is bring forth truth in  
COLAs,'' said Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security benefits are adjusted yearly based on inflation  
as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. To determine 
inflation, the agency looks at a wide range of things people buy. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders and Ney are trying to convince their colleagues that the  
elderly tend to spend their money on such things as medicine and 
health care, while the COLA formula also considers such things as 
cellular phones and computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellular phone and computer prices have been falling, while  
health-care costs have been rising. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most senior citizens in Vermont are trying to pay their  
heating bill or buy the food they need. They do not have cellular 
phones,'' Sanders told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation they are pushing would use for calculating  
Social Security's COLA an experimental version of the Consumer 
Price Index devised by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Known as 
CPI-E, it calculated a 1.9 percent elderly cost-of-living increase 
for 1998, compared with 1.3 percent for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	To an average retirement stipend, that would mean about an extra  
$44 a month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders and Ney are a sort of political odd couple who usually  
do not agree on how the government should do its work. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Americans for Democratic Action, a leading liberal  
organization, gave Sanders a perfect 100 percent score in 1998 for 
being completely in synch with its positions. ADA Ney a 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The reverse is true for the American Conservative Union, which  
gave Sanders an 8 and Ney an 80. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was introduced with the endorsements of dozens of  
senior citizen groups and bipartisan co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-0hio, said he endorsed the bill because  
it makes sense to segregate older people's living costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer price index is determined largely by snooping  
into consumers' shopping carts, and what's in the cart matters,'' 
said LaTourette. ``Some carts have more Metamucil than Mountain Dew 
and more Geritol than Gummi Bears.''

<HEADLINE> NATO's 50th Turning Into War Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NATO is remaking its 50th anniversary  
celebration into a war council, with Western leaders preparing to 
impose new sanctions such as an oil embargo to force Yugoslavia to 
stop its aggression in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our alliance consensus is rock solid,'' Secretary of State  
Madeleine Albright said Tuesday, ``and NATO operations will 
continue until this crisis ends on just and durable terms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of more than 40 nations will hold a three-day summit  
starting Friday to mark the success of the alliance formed a 
half-century ago to protect Western Europe against Soviet invasion. 
With that threat removed, the leaders will commit themselves to 
combating new challenges, such as terrorism and the spread of 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	With presidents and prime ministers from NATO's 19 member  
countries and officials of two dozen countries affiliated with the 
Partnership for Peace, it will be the largest gathering of heads of 
state in Washington's history. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a working meeting of a military alliance  
in the middle of the conflict,'' said Sandy Berger, President 
Clinton's national security adviser. Russia, angry about NATO 
airstrikes against Serbia, has not said whether it will send a 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the hope for a free and united Europe ``will not  
succeed unless it embraces a partnership with democratic Russia. 
And it will not succeed unless it is embraced by Russia. That is 
the kind of alliance that must and will emerge from the Washington 
summit.'' He spoke at a ceremony in the East Room as he presented 
the Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, to 
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House briefing on the summit, Defense Secretary  
William Cohen said NATO was not reassessing its decision against 
using ground troops in Kosovo. However, he said, ``It could be done 
very quickly'' if the leaders change course. 
</P>
<P>
	The summit will open Friday morning with a three-hour leaders'  
meeting on Kosovo. To demonstrate NATO's resolve, the alliance will 
underscore its insistence on the withdrawal of Serbian troops from 
Kosovo, the return of hundreds of thousands of displaced people and 
the deployment of an international security force, Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the summit would send ``a signal that the military,  
economic and political pressure on Belgrade will intensify'' until 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic accedes to NATO's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will consider new economic measures designed to deny  
Belgrade the ability to wage war on its own people, such as an 
embargo on oil products,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some allies are said to be reluctant to impose a naval  
blockade. Cohen said NATO officials were discussing how to deny 
Milosevic a resupply of fuel and energy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all understand that his resupply of fuel has to be  
stopped and we will take measures to achieve that,'' Cohen said. 
``Acting collectively, we will do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen denied that the allies miscalculated how long it would  
take to stop Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had planned for a phased air campaign for however long was  
necessary,'' he said. ``There was never any time limit put on it. 
There was never any limitation saying it will be over by the 
summit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said the allies also will discuss reconstruction aid  
for the Balkans, humanitarian assistance for refugees and 
information about alleged atrocities that will be referred to a war 
crimes tribunal.

<P>
	One of the most important clubs in Jose Maria Olazabal's bag  
when he won the Masters was so new that MacGregor didn't even have 
time to stamp its name on it. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal got a custom-made sand wedge during the BellSouth  
Classic the week before in Atlanta, where he missed the cut. The 
33-year-old Spaniard doesn't like to change equipment, but this was 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I put my hands on it, it went straight in the  
bag,'' Olazabal said during a conference call from Spain. ``I liked 
how it came off the club. I had a lot of control with the ball. And 
I think you know how well I chipped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal was 4-of-6 in saving par from around the green during  
the Masters. His best save Sunday was on the par-3 12th from the 
back bunker, one of the most daunting shots at Augusta National 
because the green slopes toward Rae's Creek. 
</P>
<P>
	While everyone else in contention left it on the top fringe,  
Olazabal blasted out to within 2 feet to make par. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know you're going to miss greens, so chipping and putting  
is going to be very important,'' he said. ``That sand wedge was 
very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That sand wedge now has a name. MacGregor plans to call it the  
``Commemorative 1999 Masters'' edition. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta National asks all of its champions to donate one club  
for its trophy room. Will Olazabal send his sand wedge? 
</P>
<P>
	``No way,'' he said. ``I'm going to keep my hands on this  
one.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

<P>
	 *CROSS-HANDED LOPEZ:* Nancy Lopez has become obsessed with  
improving her putting. The latest effort is a cross-handed grip. 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez putted her left-hand low for the first time in competition  
Sunday in The Village Charity Classic. She finished last behind 
Helen Alfredsson and Juli Inkster, but felt good about her stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	``My putting was much more solid,'' she said. ``Today was a good  
test.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lopez believes putting is what has kept her from winning the  
past few years. In January, she reviewed videotape of her 1978 
season and noticed she gave her putts a hard, long look before 
pulling the trigger. When she's home in Georgia, she works almost 
exclusively with the flat stick. 
</P>
<P>
	She got the idea to go cross-handed from her husband last week  
when they played Old Waverly, site of the U.S. Women's Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was rolling the ball much more direct and I was not breaking  
down my left wrist,'' Lopez said. ``I did miss some putts, but it's 
just a matter of practicing and gaining confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPANISH CELEBRATION:* With only three of the top 20 in the  
Greater Greensboro Classic, much of the attention will be in Spain 
this week for two reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Maria Olazabal will be playing for the Peugeot Open for the  
first time since winning the Masters, and Sergio Garcia will be 
making his professional debut. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia, the 19-year-old British Amateur champion known as ``El  
Nino,'' was the first European to be low amateur at Augusta 
National. While that doesn't guarantee success as a pro, he has a 
lot more going for him than Justin Rose, the English teen-ager who 
turned pro after tying for fourth in the British Open. Rose has not 
made a professional cut in 18 tries. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia has played 30 professional events in the past six years.  
He made 12 of 13 cuts last year, and has a 37-2 record in match 
play since 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are delighted to welcome Sergio,'' said Ken Schofield,  
executive director of the European tour. ``We've followed his 
progress ever since he made the cut at the Mediterranean Open at 
the age of 14.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LPGA SPONSOR:* The impact of the World Golf Championship may  
have trickled down to the LPGA Tour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sarazen World Open, usually played after the Tour  
Championship, no longer exists because of the $5 million Stroke 
Play Championship that will be held that same week at Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
	How does that benefit the LPGA?  
</P>
<P>
	Subaru of America, the title sponsor of the Sarazen Open the  
past two years, signed a two-year deal to become title sponsor of 
the Naples LPGA Memorial in January. It also announced endorsement 
deals with Juli Inkster and Meg Mallon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Subaru has created some very unique partnerships that focus on  
the growing area of women's sports,'' said Subaru president George 
Muller. ``We're extremely excited about the opportunity to develop 
a strong relationship with the LPGA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is LPGA commissioner Ty Votaw. Along with Naples, the Boston  
Classic in August is expected to announce a new title sponsorship 
agreement Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* During the LPGA Championship media day, children from  
the LPGA Urban Youth Program in Wilmington, Del., greeted defending 
champion Se Ri Pak in her native Korean. ... Tiger Woods will make 
his first trip to Taiwan in November as defending champion of the 
Johnnie Walker Classic. Woods won in February in Thailand, beating 
Ernie Els in a playoff. This year's tournament has been pushed to 
Nov. 11-14 and will be the first leg of the 2000 European tour. ... 
Tickets to the Walker Cup at Nairn, Scotland in September are being 
limited to 7,500 per day. ....After another close call in the 
Masters, followed by a letdown in the MCI Classic, Greg Norman is 
taking off the next six weeks. He won't show up again on the PGA 
Tour until the Memorial Tournament, two weeks before the U.S. Open. 
... Mark O'Meara went to Wayne Gretzky's final game and gave him a 
pair of golf shoes. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MONEY MATTERS:* Andrew Magee is 22nd on the money list with  
$585,422. Take out his runner-up finish in the Match Play 
Championship and he has earned $85,422 in eight events. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE WEEK:* Payne Stewart took only 95 putts last week  
in the MCI Classic, third-lowest in tour history. Kenny Knox had 93 
putts in 1989 and Bob Tway needed only 94 putts in 1986 -- both on 
the small greens of Harbour Town. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s quarterly profit jumped 43  
percent from a year earlier on strength across its range of 
products, particularly its Office business software and Windows NT 
software for running corporate computers. Microsoft reported it

expectations. Revenue rose to $4.33 billion from $3.77 billiion. 
Not included in the third-quarter results is $400 million in 
revenue from early sales of Microsoft's new Office 2000 package of

Johnson's first-quarter profit rose 11.7 percent, driven by strong 
drug and medical device sales. Schering-Plough Corp.'s first 
quarter profit rose 20 percent, mainly from accelerating sales of 
Claritin, the world's best-selling antihistamine. American Home 
Products Corp.'s first quarter profit was flat mostly due to weak 
sales of herbicides; SmithKline Beecham PLC's first-quarter profit 
rose 15 percent from strong growth of the company's antibiotic and 
depression and anti-smoking drugs. Johnson &AMP; Johnson shares were up 
6 at 96 1/4; Schering-Plough was up 1 7/8 at 50 3/8; and American Home was

billion, or 80 cents a share, in the three months ended March 31,

<HEADLINE> United Technologies Profits Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- United Technologies Corp. reported its  
first-quarter profits climbed 18 percent, boosted by growth at its 
Pratt &AMP; Whitney jet engine division and its building businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also announced Tuesday that job cuts are expected in  
the second and third quarter due to restructuring charges related 
to previously-announced plans to sell the UT Automotive division. 
Spokesman Peter Murphy said the company does not yet know how large 
the restructuring charges will be or how many workers will lose 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The plans are being developed now and we won't know the answer  
to that question until they're finished,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter was $308 million, or $1.25 per share,  
compared with $260 million, or $1.04 per share, in the first 
quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 3 percent to $5.44 billion, up from $5.31  
billion a year ago. The figures exclude the company's automotive 
segment, which has been classified as a discontinued operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pratt &AMP; Whitney's operating profit increased more than 20  
percent on 9 percent revenue growth, due to higher military engine 
shipments and growth in the overhaul and repair business. The 
results exclude a government contract settlement gain in the first 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Carrier air conditioning unit, operating profit increased  
15 percent on 1 percent revenue growth, reflecting contributions 
from recent acquisitions and improved cost controls. The results 
exclude restructuring charges in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At Otis elevators, operating profit increased 58 percent on a 3  
percent revenue gain. Otis also took significant restructuring 
charges in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Flight Systems unit, operating profit fell 38 percent on  
a 10 percent revenue decline, due to lower helicopter shipments and 
restructuring at the Sikorsky division. 
</P>
<P>
	AT UT Automotive, operating profit declined 4 percent on an 11  
percent increase in revenues. UTC announced last month that it is 
selling UT Automotive to Lear Corp. for $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of United Technologies fell $3.06 1/4 to $141.93 3/4 in trading  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Sanyo To Cut 6,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese electronics maker Sanyo Electric Co. will  
slash 6,000 jobs -- nearly 11 percent of its work force -- over the 
next three years in a major restructuring drive. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts, which will reduce Sanyo's work force to 49,000 from  
the current 55,000, aim to help the company bring down costs and 
boost profitability amid a slump in the electronics industry, 
spokeswoman Yumiko Yagata said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanyo estimates it posted a consolidated pretax loss of about 15  
billion yen, or $127 million, in fiscal 1998 which ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement comes as many major Japanese corporations are  
forced to scuttle traditional business practices like lifetime 
employment in order to cope with Japan's worst recession in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Hitachi Ltd., Japan's largest machinery  
manufacturer, said it would cut 6,500 jobs by March 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Work force reductions have also been announced recently by  
Mitsubishi Electric Corp., NEC Corp. and Sony Corp., three of 
Japan's biggest electronics companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanyo's jobs cuts will be accomplished mainly by job freezes,  
early retirement and transfers of employees to non-group 
affiliates, Yagata said.

<HEADLINE> Wright Brothers Flight To Be Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- John Glenn says there's one word to describe  
what's happened to aviation since the Wright brothers' first flight 
nearly 100 years ago -- ``amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you can go down and buy a ticket to go anywhere in the  
world and your biggest worries are whether you're going to have a 
window seat and whether the food's going to be hot and suit your 
palate and whether your baggage is going to get lost,'' Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronaut and former senator spoke at a ceremony Monday at  
the United States Air Force Museum to begin the countdown to the 
100th anniversary of the first flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn was named secretary general of the 2003 celebration.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be the biggest celebration anywhere in the  
world, I think, of any commemorative type nature in the year 2003 
because the impact that aviation has had on every single nation in 
the world,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilkinson Wright, great nephew of the Wright brothers and family  
spokesman, said it is not too soon to begin planning the 
celebration. He said Dayton residents already are starting to get 
excited. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a very good feeling about it,'' said Wright. ``They're  
beginning to get the idea this is something big and important for 
the Dayton area. For the first time we're going to have a lot of 
highly visible things going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orville and Wilbur Wright designed and built their cloth and  
wood airplane in Dayton and took it to Kill Devil Hills, N.C., 
because of the area's giant dunes, soft sand and strong wind. 
</P>
<P>
	On Dec. 17, 1903, their 750-pound aircraft carried Wilbur Wright  
aloft for 12 seconds over nearby Kitty Hawk. It was the first time 
in history that a machine lifted a man into the air in full flight 
under its own power. 
</P>
<P>
	``The achievement of their simple yet astonishing goal has  
changed the world and with it our view of ourselves and our 
universe in ways they could not have imagined,'' said Brad Tillson, 
chair of the organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Tillson said the celebration will include a special air show in  
2003 and an annual international arts festival tied, in part, to 
the Wright brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers have said the celebration will cost up to $20 million  
and require the same sort of marketing as that done to draw the 
Olympics to a city. They predict the series of events will draw 3 
million visitors.

<HEADLINE> Colorado Suspects Called Outcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They are called the ``Trench Coat  
Mafia,'' a group of about 10 students who wear long black coats, 
keep to themselves and follow shock rocker Marilyn Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their dark lifestyle, they had not shown an inclination  
for violence before Tuesday, according to some of their fellow 
students at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities and school district officials said they had never  
heard of the group. A reference to it in last year's Columbine 
yearbook reveals nothing more than general teen-age exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, some students said they believed the two gunmen who  
went on a shooting rampage at Columbine were members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, a 16-year-old student, said he saw several members  
of the group make a video about their guns in a video production 
class. He also said several members of the group recently bragged 
that they had gotten new guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students said the killers targeted minorities and athletes.  
Kelly said he heard Trench Coat Mafia members making ``generally 
derogatory remarks'' about blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Beard, a student, said on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' that  
members of the group ``talked about how jocks, how all the football 
players, were in a world of their own, thinking they were on top of 
everything and nothing mattered to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dedication to the Trench Coat Mafia in the 1998 Columbine  
yearbook lists 13 members and carries the following message: ``Who 
says we are different? Insanity's healthy! Remember rocking parties 
at Kristen's, foosball at Joe's and fencing at Christopher's! Stay 
alive, stay different, stay crazy. Oh, and stay away from CREAM 
SODA!!! Love always, the chicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But other students had developed a less innocent image of the  
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really dark people,'' said Wes Lammers, a 17-year-old  
junior. ``There were a lot of jokes that one day they might snap or 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Brackley, 15, said she was very aware of the group even  
though it was small. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw them threaten anybody or bully anybody, but we  
avoided them because they were different,'' she said. ``Anyone 
dressed in black you're scared of because it signifies gothic or 
death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Josh Nielsen, a 17-year-old junior: ``They're not  
well-liked in the school and no one treated them well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, in Moses Lake, Wash., a 14-year-old boy in black cowboy  
boots, black jeans, a black cowboy hat and a long black duster coat 
shot two students and a teacher to death.

<HEADLINE> Angels Say There's No Jinx </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- The Anaheim Angels insist centerfielder Jim  
Edmonds isn't the victim of a team jinx, despite evidence to the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angels, who have had a rash of injuries in recent years,  
learned Monday they will be without Edmonds for about four months 
due to a severely injured right (non-throwing) shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds, who won his second straight Gold Glove last season and  
has averaged nearly 28 homers over the last four years, will 
undergo arthroscopic surgery Thursday to repair a torn labrum. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never get used to it but you learn to deal with it and  
move on,'' outfielder Garret Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	With nine players on the disabled list, Angels manager Terry  
Collins said he's no longer surprised when a player is hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had a theory about why we've been injured so much I'd  
have an idea how to stop it,'' Collins said. ``But I don't, it's 
just been freaky injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the start of spring training, shortstop Gary DiSarcina broke  
his left forearm in a fluke accident. He was hit by a fungo bat 
swung by coach George Hendrick. 
</P>
<P>
	DiSarcina, who hit .287 and drove in 56 runs last season, is  
expected to miss the first three or four months of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the spring, pitcher Jason Dickson felt tenderness in  
his right shoulder. It turned out he has a torn labrum and could 
miss the season. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first inning of his first game with the team on April 5,  
Mo Vaughn, who signed an $80 million, six-year contract with the 
Angels last November, sprained his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn is expected to be activated and back in the lineup on  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no jinx. Things just happen, and I'll be damned if we  
let it become an excuse,'' said Vaughn, who feels the Angels have 
played well despite the injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we played poorly, I would feel worse, but we've kept our  
heads above water,'' Vaughn said. ``Guys have really stepped up and 
filled the gaps where we needed them to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among them has been Todd Greene, who has seen his playing  
time increase at DH because of the injuries. Greene has four homers 
and 15 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing one hell of job right now, so it's been a plus for  
us,'' said pitcher Jack McDowell, who is recovering from right 
shoulder surgery. ``We have enough talent to get by until people 
get back.''

<HEADLINE> Montana Pollution Case Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) -- A federal judge has approved a $260  
million settlement between the state of Montana and Atlantic 
Richfield Co., ending 16 years of court battles. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves 100 years of pollution in the Upper Clark Fork  
River Basin from mining and smelter operations. Arco inherited the 
problems in the 1970s, when it acquired the Anaconda Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The 130-mile-long stretch from the headwaters of the Clark Fork  
River has been designated the largest Superfund cleanup site in the 
nation by the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is good to finally be at this point,'' said Montana  
Attorney General Joe Mazurek, who helped negotiate the deal struck 
last June. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Hatfield approved the settlement Monday  
by signing two consent decrees. The decrees involve the state and 
federal government, the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and 
Arco. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana initiated the suit in 1983, seeking $765 million to  
restore the river basin to its condition before settlers began 
digging for gold, silver and copper in Butte. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes $215 million plus interest that has been  
accruing since April 1998. Besides state government's sum, the 
settlement includes $18.3 million for the tribes and about $26.7 
million for various federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazurek said Arco already has paid the state $30 million,  
including $15 million to cover the state's legal costs. The other 
$15 million payment is the first installment for the cleanup of 
Silver Bow Creek, headwaters of the Clark Fork River. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, the lawsuit secured $80 million for the state to clean  
up the creek. The rest of the state's share, about $118 million 
plus interest, will be put into a trust.

<HEADLINE> Stakes Behind the Census Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the political struggle over the 2000  
census, there is a collision just ahead -- the money for it runs out 
in less than two months, and congressional Republicans will use 
that leverage in their effort to block a planned double count. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration still plans a traditional head count, to be  
followed by a statistically adjusted census. 
</P>
<P>
	In this dispute, there's always another chapter --  
understandably, given the future congressional power and the 
billions of federal aid dollars involved in the decennial count of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been a contentious issue since 1996, when the Clinton  
administration announced plans to use statistical sampling, a sort 
of polling technique, to measure the 10 percent of the population 
most difficult to count, and therefore most likely to be missed in 
a census conducted the traditional way. 
</P>
<P>
	It should be done the constitutional way, Republicans said, and  
began trying to bar sampling to adjust the 2000 figures. The 
Constitution requires an ``actual enumeration'' of the population 
every decade to apportion the 435 House seats among the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court ruled on Jan. 25 that there must be a head  
count without sampling to reallocate seats in the House among the 
states after 2000. But it didn't preclude the use of 
sampling-adjusted census numbers when the states draw their 
congressional and legislative district lines. And that's the point 
of maximum political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	By Census Bureau estimate, 1.4 percent of the population went  
uncounted in the 1990 census, the first to be judged less accurate 
than the one before it. The Republican administration and the 
Democratic Congress then in power asked the National Academy of 
Sciences to consider ways to avoid a replay in 2000. That led to 
the sampling plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue isn't statistical, it is political, because most  
of the missing persons in the last census, and presumably the next 
one, are from lower-income and minority neighborhoods, precincts 
most likely to be Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampling to count them in would work to Republican disadvantage.  
The GOP contends that sampling would conjure up people who don't 
exist, risk rigging by the administration and, according to the 
party chairman, add nearly 4 1/2 million Democrats to the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Nicholson said that would put Republican control of the  
House and state legislatures at risk. An analysis conducted for the 
Republican National Committee two years ago said sampling could 
cost the GOP 24 House seats. The current House has only 11 more 
Republicans than Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats cite those warnings now in saying that the Republicans  
made a partisan issue of the census. Republicans argue the 
opposite, and say their concerns are about an honest, 
constitutional count without the estimates and guesswork they say 
would go into sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest census debate, Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode  
Island, chairman of the Democrats' House campaign committee, said 
it was curious to hear Republicans saying they didn't want politics 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello everybody,'' he said. ``This is the most political issue  
we will probably face in the next two years. ... This goes to who 
is going to control this House for the next 10 to 20 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also will determine the allocation of $182 billion a year in  
federal aid distributed on the basis of population. 
</P>
<P>
	Which would leave the political dispute. It was on display when  
the House passed a bill to require a nine-week window after the 
head count, during which local governments could review the numbers 
and seek adjustments. ``It invites 39,000 individual jurisdictions 
to tell us that they have more people than we found,'' said Rep. 
Dan Miller of Florida, the Republican point man on the census. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said it invites delay, costs money, and failed when it  
was tried in 1990. They said the Republicans are trying to put in 
wrinkles to strengthen their hand against sampling. The bill passed 
on party lines April 14 and was sent to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown issue is coming soon. The appropriation for the  
census, and for the entire Departments of Commerce, State and 
Justice, plus the federal courts, runs out on June 15. Congress set 
an early expiration date for the spending by those departments, to 
keep leverage on the census issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans want to prevent spending for sampling and a  
two-number census. Democrats say that an appropriations bill 
barring sampling would invite a veto.

<HEADLINE> Lions May Be Shot To Save Bighorns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The Fish and Wildlife Service declared the  
Sierra Nevada bighorn an endangered species Tuesday, a move that 
could lead to the shooting of mountain lions found to have preyed 
on the sheep. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about 100 adult bighorns survive in the High Sierra  
wilderness, mostly around Yosemite and Sequoia-Kings Canyon 
national parks in California and along the Nevada line. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time is running out for the Sierra Bighorn,'' said John  
Wehausen, president of the Sierra Nevada Bighorn Sheep Foundation 
in Bishop, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the service's action, state and federal agencies have the  
tools they need to protect these rare animals from the threats that 
jeopardize their continued existence,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal biologists determined the bighorns warrant emergency  
protection under the Endangered Species Act on at least a temporary 
basis due primarily to threats of disease from domestic sheep and 
predation from the mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
	The emergency listing is effective through Dec. 16. In the  
meantime, the agency will take public comment through June 21 on a 
proposal to declare the sheep endangered on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	Fish and Game authorities in California historically shot  
mountain lions that were threatening bighorn sheep herds, but 
California voters in 1990 approved a ballot measure banning the 
sport hunting of big cats. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal listing overrides the state prohibition and would  
again allow the shooting of problem mountain lions if necessary, 
said Jay Watson, regional director for The Wilderness Society in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Mountain lion advocates maintain that the lions are only part of  
a complex deterioration of the region's ecosystem that is plaguing 
the bighorn sheep and other fish and wildlife there.

<HEADLINE> Schott Sells Control of Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott signed a $67 million deal today  
to sell controlling interest in the Cincinnati Reds to a group 
headed by Carl Lindner, currently one of the team's limited 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, 70, owns 6 1/2 of the 15 shares in the team's partnership,  
including the shares that make her the general partner. She agreed 
to sell 5 1/2 of her shares, including the general partner shares, to 
Lindner and two other limited partners. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, in which 36.6 percent of the Reds' shares would change  
hands, values the franchise at about $182 million. The sale is 
subject to the approval of major league owners, a process that 
usually takes 6-15 months but might move faster in the case because 
the purchasers already are in the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Jim Bowden called it ``a great day for  
Cincinnati baseball.'' He also said he and managing executive John 
Allen will remain in place. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowden said that Lindner, who owns the Great American Insurance  
Co., played a pivotal role in getting him an extension as general 
manager last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, who will remain on as a limited partner, was ordered by  
baseball officials last year to sell her controlling interest or 
face an extension of what amounts to a suspension from most of the 
team's operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Although details of the sale weren't disclosed, a source  
familiar with the talks, speaking on the condition he not be 
identified, said Schott would get to keep a luxury suite, an office 
at the stadium and a group of seats. 
</P>
<P>
	However, major league baseball has the right to delete those  
provisions and is expected to prevent her from keeping an office at 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement completes four months of meandering attempts by  
Schott to sell her controlling interest in the team. She reached an 
agreement with Larry Dolan, the brother of Cablevision Systems 
Corp.'s chairman, to sell for $65 million in February, then tried 
to back out and sell to a group led by her cousin, Steve, for $67 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner and the two other limited partners, George Strike and  
William Reik, sued Schott last week in Hamilton County Common Pleas 
Court. The limited partners said she was denying them their 
contractual right to match the Dolan offer and buy her out. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge granted the limited partners a temporary restraining  
order last Friday, putting more pressure on Schott to reach a deal.

	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott agreed Tuesday to sell control of  
the Cincinnati Reds for $67 million, leaving her one step away from 
the end of her tumultuous 15-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
	The other major league owners have to approve the sale to  
Cincinnati financier Carl Lindner and two of the other limited 
partners, a process that usually takes 6-15 months but is expected 
to move quickly, perhaps with a vote as soon as June. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball had ordered her to sell her controlling interest in the  
Reds and end a tenure that included one suspension for inflammatory 
remarks and other disciplinary measures, such as giving up 
day-to-day decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner would become the team's controlling partner. Limited  
partners George Strike and William Reik also would be part of the 
new ownership group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carl Lindner, George Strike and Bill Reik have been excellent  
limited partners in the current partnership,'' NL president Len 
Coleman said. ``I think with their leadership, once the background 
work is done, the fans in Cincinnati will be blessed with a bright 
future for baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the sale is approved, it would mark a dramatic change for the  
Reds. Lindner owns the Great American Insurance Co. and is a 
behind-the-scenes executive like the Reds' owners before Schott, 
who became a limited partner in 1981 and the general partner in 
December 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	His style will be much different than Schott's -- no dogs on the  
field, few interviews with reporters. He plans to keep John Allen 
as managing executive and Jim Bowden as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``All great organizations have great ownership and great  
leadership,'' Bowden said. ``Obviously, Mr. Lindner and the limited 
partners have first-class character and run first-class 
organizations. I think it's a great day for Cincinnati Reds 
baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was a built-in pressure on Schott to sell -- her  
partnership agreement expired at the end of 2000, when the limited 
partners were prepared to oust her. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball suspended her for one year in February 1993 and fined  
her $25,000 for language the sport's executive council judged 
``racially and ethnically offensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She returned early the following April, but after additional  
remarks brought unfavorable attention she agreed in June 1996 to 
give up control of the team's day-to-day operations through 1998. 
Last October, baseball said she would sell the team and not return 
to daily control. 
</P>
<P>
	The three limited partners also sued her last week, contending  
she was ignoring their right to buy the team by matching a $65 
million offer from Larry Dolan, the brother of Cablevision Systems 
Corp.'s chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a difficult time for Mrs. Schott,'' said her  
lawyer, Frank Kelley. ``To own a major league team and not be able 
to run it has been heart-rending. She did not want to sell her 
interest, which has been such an important part of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schott, 70, owns 6 1/2 of the 15 shares in the team's partnership,  
including the shares that make her the general partner. She agreed 
to sell all but one share to Lindner's group. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, in which 36.6 percent of the Reds' shares would change  
hands, values the franchise at about $182 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Although details weren't disclosed, a source familiar with the  
terms said Schott would keep an office in the stadium, a luxury 
suite and a block of lower-level seats. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the terms must be approved by major league baseball,  
which doesn't want Schott keeping a high profile and will probably 
prevent her from having an office. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Schott's tenure, the Reds won a World Series in 1990 but  
later began feeling the effects of her decision to decimate the 
farm system to save money. 
</P>
<P>
	Since she agreed to sell the team last November rather than face  
another suspension from baseball, the club's front office has been 
limited by the uncertainty. Lindner is expected to keep the front 
office intact as the team prepares for a new stadium in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got confidence in club management, which should make  
things smoother,'' manager Jack McKeon said. ``A big key is his 
confidence in John and Jim. That should help keep continuity there 
and take a burden off everybody's back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner couldn't make any changes in the club until he gets  
baseball's approval. Players hope he'll put more money into the 
organization in the short term to speed up the rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still very early in the process,'' Allen said. ``We'll  
have to wait and see if there's any major changes in direction. 
Over the last three years, our focus has turned to player 
development and I wouldn't expect to see a change in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds went from having the second-largest payroll in the  
National League in 1995 -- their last time in the playoffs -- to the 
fourth-smallest on opening day 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great if the people who take over the team are interested  
in restoring what once was here, such as getting some good players 
in here,'' team captain Barry Larkin said. ``What's important is 
what happens on the field.''

<HEADLINE> Quotes From Colo. School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Quotes from the shootings at Columbine High School:  

</P>
<P>
	``I looked out the window and there was a kid with a trench coat  
and a shotgun and pipe bombs in the parking lot. And then he shot a 
girl outside and then he came into the cafeteria and you could 
hear, like, bombs and shutguns going off. And then he came into the 
library and shot everybody around me. Then he put a gun to my head 
and asked if we all wanted to die and that he was going to kill us 
if we were of color, and if we had a hat, and if we played sports. 
I just started screaming and crying and telling him not to shoot me 
and so he just shot the girl in the head in front of me, and then 
he shot the black kid because he was black. And he shot him in the 
face.'' -- Unidentified girl. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a little group but they were part of the school. They  
dressed differently and they acted differently. They always dressed 
in black, usually in trench coats. I never saw them threaten 
anybody or bully anybody, but we avoided them becase they were 
different. Anyone dressed in black you're scared of because it 
signifies gothic or death. ... I'm angry someone would do this to 
us. There are lives ruined, families ruined, and our whole school 
year is ruined.'' -- student Casey Brackley. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``It was around 11 a.m. or so. It was soon after that they  
started shooting and when they went into the lunch room and started 
firing rounds. There was a girl about 50 yards away from us laying 
against the curb who had been shot in her leg. Another kid was 
lying face down at the bottom of the steps and he had been shot in 
the back point-blank. Then the one kid who shot the kid in the back 
went up a hill and threw a bomb into the parking lot and that 
exploded. Then they went inside and continued to shoot at people. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in the parking lot next to the picnic area where  
people eat outside. We were about 50 yards away. By some cars. We 
heard a lot of popping sounds. It didn't even sound like gunfire. 
It was happening so fast. Then we saw one girl fall against the 
curb and then the guy in the trench coat came down the stairs and 
shot the guy in the back I had seen. Just point-blank. He had a gun 
2 feet long. Maybe a sawed off. He was just casually walking. He 
wasn't in any hurry.'' -- student Wade Frank. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just coming back from lunch when all the shooting  
started. Some of my friends were coming from the school, screaming 
and crying. I started crying. I was terrified and I didn't know 
what to do at first.'' -- student Jamie Roark. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them opened his cape and had a shotgun. Finally, I  
started figuring out these guys shot to kill, for no reason. ... 
They didn't care what race you were. It didn't matter. They wanted 
to shoot to have fun. They're sick people.'' -- student Nick Foss.

<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``A bunch of people stood up to look outside, then a loud bang  
happened and everyone around the window just fell under the tables. 
I saw a guy standing with a gun and he fired it torward the ground. 
...
</P>
<P>
	``I went under the table where I was eating and I could see  
outside. I saw another guy in his trench coat throwing pipe bombs 
in the parking lot.'' -- student Braden Pesusich.

<HEADLINE>  Chebet, Roba Win Boston Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Joseph Chebet found the secret of going from  
perennial runnerup to champion: train harder. 
</P>
<P>
	It might take a lot more than that for someone other than a  
Kenyan to win the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet became the ninth straight runner from Kenya to win the  
race Monday, and three of his countrymen also finished in the top 
10. At one point, though, Ecuador's Silvio Guerra held a huge lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra said he wasn't intimidated by the threat that loomed  
behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get used to being around just Kenyans,'' he said. ``I  
prepare to run with Kenyans and African guys because they're the 
best in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Chebet, who picked up the $80,000 first prize in the race's  
103rd running, may be the best of them all at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In his six career marathons, he won his first two and finished  
second in the next three -- two in New York City and one in Boston 
last year -- before beating Guerra by 27 seconds in a time of 2 
hours, 9 minutes, 52 seconds. Two of his second-place finishes were 
by three seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, it was my first time in Boston,'' Chebet said.  
``This year I tried to change my training from last year. I tried 
to train harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, he's not completely ready,'' said his coach, Dr.  
Gabriele Rosa. ``He decided to train longer now and he was more 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While five different Kenyans have won the last nine races,  
Fatuma Roba of Ethiopia has dominated the women's division by 
herself. On Monday, she became the second woman to win three 
straight Boston Marathons, matching the accomplishment of Uta 
Pippig of Germany from 1994 through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And she did it easily, with a margin of 2 minutes, 26 seconds  
over Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland. The winning time was 
2:23:25. Last year's victory margin was 3:56. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only difference is last year I had a knee problem, but  
this year I was physically good,'' Roba said. ``I was expecting a 
better time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Few runners could have run a much better time than Sun Yingjie  
of China did early in the women's race as she set a blistering 
pace. But she lost the lead just past the midpoint, leaving Roba 
and Catherine Ndereba of Kenya running together. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba began to pull away about 17 miles into the 26-mile,  
385-yard race. At one point, two spectators carrying green, yellow 
and red Ethiopian flags ran behind her. 
</P>
<P>
	``That gave me a boost and I started running with a new pace,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spotlight in the women's race also fell on Lynn Jennings,  
the three-time world cross-country champion from Newmarket, N.H., 
who was making her official marathon debut at age 38. 
</P>
<P>
	She hoped to run faster than her 12th-place time of 2:38:37,  
``but I'm glad I qualified for the Olympic trials,'' Jennings said. 
</P>
<P>
	She did better than another outstanding runner from New England.  
Bill Rodgers, who has won the Boston and New York City marathons 
four times each, failed to finish in his first competitive marathon 
since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Now 51, he was hoping to break the American course record for a  
runner older than 50, 2:31:34, held by Norm Green. But he dropped 
out because of dehydration with about six miles to go on an 
unseasonably warm day. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not absolutely on, the marathon will really get you,  
especially if you're pushing hard`'' said Rodgers, who felt tired 
during the week preceding the race. ``Next time I run Boston I 
think I'm going to be a back-of-the-pack runner. I'm going to have 
fun out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's field of 12,797 was the second largest ever in Boston,  
exceeded only by the 38,708 official entrants in the centennial 
race in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	In the wheelchair competitions, it was more of the same as Franz  
Nietlispach of Switzerland, in a time of 1:21:36, and Louise 
Sauvage of Australia, in 1:42:23, each won for the third 
consecutive year. For the second straight year, the women's race 
was so close between Sauvage and seven-time champion Jean Driscoll 
of Champaign, Ill., that both had the same official time. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no such drama in the men's and women's divisions as  
neither winner was threatened over the last four miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Roba, the 1996 Olympic champion, was followed by 1997 New York  
City champion Rochat-Moser at 2:25:51, two-time Olympic medalist 
Yuko Arimori of Japan at 2:26:39 and South African Colleen de Reuck 
at 2:27:53. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra led by as much as a quarter-mile before Chebet took the  
lead with about four miles left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to push hard, but after 20 miles, I started to get  
blisters on my feet and slowed down,'' said Guerra, who was seeking 
to become the first South American winner since Colombia's Elviro 
Mejia in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	That just wasn't going to happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Not with Kenyans running, even though one of them, defending  
champion Moses Tanui, dropped out near the 23-mile mark, apparently 
with leg cramps. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerra finished second at 2:10:18 and was followed by two South  
Africans -- Frank Pooe at 2:11:37 and Abner Chipu at 2:12:45. 
Kenya's John Kagwe, who beat Chebet at New York in 1997 and 1998, 
wound up fifth for the second straight year at 2:13:57. The top 
American finisher, Joe LeMay of Danbury, Conn., was 13th in 
2:16:11. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other streak of nine winners from one country came when  
Americans won from 1916 through 1925 with few foreigners in the 
field. There was no individual competition in 1918, only a team 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Kenyans are dominant.  
</P>
<P>
	``They have the best professional distance runners in the  
world,'' Rodgers said before the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Chebet is one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody in the world is trying to catch the Kenyans,''  
Chebet said, ``but they can't.''

<HEADLINE> ETrade Earnings Exceed Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Outpacing the rapid growth of the online trading  
industry, ETrade Group topped forecasts Tuesday for the first three 
months of 1999, showing robust gains in revenues and new customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding a one-time gain of $20 million from an investment,  
ETrade lost $14.3 million, or 12 cents per share, in its second 
quarter ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	While the second-largest Internet broker earned $4.5 million, or  
5 cents per share in the same period last year, the loss was 
smaller than the roughly 17 cents per share that analysts surveyed 
by First Call expected the company to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade's shares were up $4.18 3/4 at $78 in Tuesday trading on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market after plunging 50 percent over the past week 
amid a barrage of profit-taking among online-broker stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported second-quarter revenues of $126.7 million,  
up 44 percent from the final three months of 1999 and more than 
double its revenue tally in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade said it added 233,000 new accounts during the latest  
quarter, an increase of 77 percent over the prior quarter's 
customer growth and more new accounts than the company added in all 
of 1998. As of March 31, the company had slightly more than 900,000 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade handled 4.3 million trades in the latest quarter, an  
increase of 55 percent from the final three months of 1999. By 
contrast, the overall industry's trading volume rose between 30 
percent and 35 percent during the first three months of 1999, 
according to a preliminary estimate by Credit Suisse First Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, the accelerating growth came during a quarter that saw  
Web brokers suffer repeated slowdowns and outages as investors 
overwhelmed their online systems. 
</P>
<P>
	ETrade, based in Palo Alto, Calif., said it expects to continue  
to lose money in the near future due to aggressive spending on 
marketing, technology upgrades and customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took strong positive action during the quarter to build our  
technology infrastructure and in our efforts to ensure that our 
customers have access to high-quality service and support,'' said 
Christos M. Cotsakos, chairman and chief executive of ETrade.

<HEADLINE> New Child Health Program Taking Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A $24 billion program to provide health  
insurance for children in working poor families enrolled nearly 1 
million kids during its inaugural year, and government officials 
said Tuesday they expect to more than double that by the end of 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	States expect to cover about 2.5 million of the nation's 11  
million uninsured children by the time the program is fully 
implemented in October 2000, the Department of Health and Human 
Services said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's close to the 2.3 million children estimated by the  
Congressional Budget Office in 1997 when the bill was approved as 
part of a massive budget deal but far short of the 5 million 
children that President Clinton and others hoped the program would 
reach. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, only about 3 million children are eligible for the  
program. But the administration hopes that some of an estimated 4 
million kids who are eligible for Medicaid but not enrolled will be 
found as states sign children up for the new kids' health program. 
</P>
<P>
	When the program was created, the nation had 10 million  
uninsured children. Since then, the number has grown to 11 million, 
and many fear it will grow more as families leave welfare and don't 
realize that children often remain eligible for health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement Tuesday was the first time the government gave  
actual enrollment numbers for the program, the largest 
administration health initiative to become law, and administration 
officials celebrated their success. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost 1 million more children in America have insurance,''  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton announced in a health care speech 
at Hofstra University in Hempstead, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the best things about this job is knowing that we can  
really make a difference in the lives of working families,'' said 
HHS Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mrs. Clinton noted that some states have made more progress  
than others in finding children who need insurance and qualify for 
the new program. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of creativity, but there's a long way to go,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The program provides health insurance to children whose families  
are not poor enough to qualify for the traditional Medicaid program 
but cannot afford to buy coverage on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to find these children, the federal government is working  
with the states and private groups to simplify the enrollment 
process for Medicaid and for the new program. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, there were 43 states and U.S. territories operating  
children's health programs. They had their choice between creating 
programs or expanding Medicaid. Last year, about 540,000 children 
were in state programs and 442,000 children were in Medicaid 
expansions. 
</P>
<P>
	The slow start has meant that states spent just $500 million  
last year -- less than one-eighth of the $4.3 billion allocated. And 
in 1999, the Congressional Budget Office projects that states will 
spend just $1 billion of the $4.3 billion available. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Peacock, an HHS spokesman, said the program's slow start  
should come as no surprise. The average program has been in 
operation for only about six months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of this very historic, very progressive  
program,'' he said. ``Some states are just beginning to implement 
their programs.''

<HEADLINE> Goldman Sachs Exec Eyes Hedge Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jon Corzine, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, is  
discussing plans to join Long-Term Capital Management, the 
Connecticut investment fund that nearly collapsed last summer and 
threatened global financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Corzine, who will leave Goldman Sachs after the investment bank  
goes public next month, helped spearhead the consortium of 14 banks 
that bailed out Long-Term Capital Management to the tune of $3.63 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Corzine may try to raise money from other investors to  
repay the loans from the banks, according to a person familiar with 
the plans. All of the discussions are in the early stages and may 
come to naught. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Corzine's office was not immediately returned.  
</P>
<P>
	The consortium of banks put out a press release Tuesday saying  
they have a ``policy not to comment on market speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Long-Term Capital Management, founded by John Meriwether, has  
recovered much of its ground over the past six months. The fund's 
risk has decreased by about half, while returns are up more than 20 
percent. The banks, which include Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and 
J.P. Morgan, are expecting to be repaid in the second half of the 
year.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pushes Racial Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Declaring racial unity ``the defining moral  
issue of our time,'' former Sen. Bill Bradley today put the quest 
for societal integration at the center of his campaign to win the 
White House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, the sole Democrat thus far to challenge Vice President  
Al Gore for the party's nomination, said the problem of race is 
``central to our American future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In running for president, I'm betting that far more than a  
majority of people in America want to achieve a deeper racial 
unity,'' he said in remarks prepared for a speech today at Cooper 
Union in New York City. An advance text of his remarks was released 
Monday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was speaking in a city where the shooting death of an  
unarmed African immigrant by four white police officers has ignited 
a storm of protests and caused a major political headache for Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Ronald Reagan was president, everyone knew that if you  
wanted to please the boss, you cut taxes, increased military 
spending and fought communism,'' he said. ``If I'm president, I 
want one thing to be known: If you want to please the boss, one of 
the things you'd better show is how in your department or agency 
you've furthered tolerance and racial understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley recited a litany of prejudices and injustices: church  
bombings, incidents of people beaten or killed because they were of 
Chinese descent or gay, the police practice of pulling over drivers 
because they are racial minorities. And he spoke about his own 
experience with the prejudices directed at his black teammates when 
he played professional basketball, and how they drove him into 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me the quest for racial unity remains the defining moral  
issue of our time. It's the reason I first ran for public office,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, pointing to the case of West African immigrant Amadou  
Diallo, who on Feb. 4 was hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired by four 
white New York City plainclothes officers, said the fight for 
racial equality has changed since the civil rights movement of past 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``While legal barriers are down, divisions still remain, but  
they are divisions of the heart more than of the law,'' he said. 
``If you're black, you know that being within the radar of white 
fear and suspicion can be dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This tragic event was in most ways different from the church  
burnings of 1994. ... It was not an act of senseless hatred. It 
cannot be dismissed as an act of aberrant individuals,'' he said, 
adding that the solution is to eradicate ``white indifference and 
black suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley is expected to formally announce his candidacy later  
this year and trails the better-known Gore in fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who has tried to portray himself as a more traditional  
liberal Democrat than the vice president, argued that in addition 
to moral concerns, Americans ought to focus on improving racial 
relations out of economic self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
	``By the year 2010 in America, less than 60 percent of the  
people entering the work force are going to be native-born white 
Americans,'' he said. ``That means that the economic future of the 
children of white Americans will depend increasingly on the talents 
of non-white Americans. That's not ideology. That's demographics.''

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Billboards Are Coming Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- The Marlboro Man is about to ride into the  
sunset. 
</P>
<P>
	All cigarette billboards must be removed by Friday, a result of  
the national $206 billion settlement between the tobacco industry 
and 46 states to settle state claims for smoking-related health 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement allows states to take over billboard leases that  
had been held by tobacco companies and put anti-smoking ads on them 
at the companies' expense until the leases expire. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 3,600 billboards nationwide are eligible for  
conversion to anti-smoking messages, according to the National 
Association of Attorneys General. 
</P>
<P>
	New signs in Washington state show a sinking Titanic with the  
slogan ``Tobacco Kills a Titanic Full of Washingtonians. Every 10 
Weeks.'' More than 1,500 people died when the Titanic sank in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	In Richmond, where Philip Morris makes Marlboros and other  
brands at the world's largest cigarette plant, one new billboard 
shows a young girl and a younger boy and reads: ``My sister never 
told me not to smoke. She showed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The billboard will be part of a Virginia campaign featuring the  
slogan, ``Keep Kids Tobacco Free.'' Some of the 66 billboards being 
changed in Virginia will warn of stiff fines for people who sell 
cigarettes to minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the changes, tobacco images like the Marlboro Man and  
R.J. Reynolds' Joe Camel will remain ingrained in the public's 
consciousness, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who saw them as part of American visual folklore will  
continue to refer to them,'' said James Fraser, library director at 
Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, N.J., and author of 
``The American Billboard: 100 Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Hayes, spokeswoman for the Outdoor Advertising  
Association of America in Washington, D.C., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're definitely part of the American landscape,'' she said.  
``People will continue to have an appreciation for them as a part 
of Americana, a part of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the best-known signs: a Camel billboard that for 25 years  
blew smoke rings into New York's Times Square before a Winston 
billboard displaced it in 1966. In West Hollywood, Calif., a 
64-foot-tall Marlboro Man overlooked the Sunset Strip before he was 
recently retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Health activists welcome the removal of such attention-grabbing  
gimmicks, which they have long claimed were designed to appeal to 
children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they say more needs to be done.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get rid of this pervasive, highly visible form of  
tobacco advertising,'' said Eric Lindblom of the Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted that the settlement still allows ads no larger than  
14 square feet to be displayed at businesses that sell or 
manufacture tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rather large loophole,'' he said. ``That means they can  
put those signs anywhere that sells cigarettes even if it were 
right next to a school or playground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Banzhaf III, executive director of Action on Smoking and  
Health, a Washington-based anti-smoking group, said the demise of 
tobacco billboards is a mostly symbolic victory. Increasing 
cigarette taxes and imposing more restrictions on public smoking 
would have greater practical effect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this tricks people into thinking we're making real  
progress, it's more harmful than helpful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From a business standpoint, neither the tobacco companies nor  
the outdoor advertising industry are panicking over the loss of 
cigarette billboards. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry spends about $505 million a year on ads,  
about 30 percent of it on outdoor advertising, said the research 
firm Competitive Media Reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Crosslin, spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in  
Winston-Salem, N.C., said her company will rely more on ``print, 
direct-mail to age-verified smokers, and special events in 
age-restricted venues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry voluntarily gave up broadcast advertising  
in the early 1970s to avoid a government ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hayes estimated the tobacco industry accounted for about 9  
percent of billboard revenue in 1998, but the figure had been 
steadily dropping since the mid-1980s. She said she expects ads 
from luxury car makers and Internet providers to make up for the 
lost tobacco ads.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally lower  
Tuesday on profit-taking, but the key index in Tokyo rebounded in a 
late rally triggered by foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 22.90  
points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 16,697.11. On Monday, the 
index lost 177.37 points, or 1.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices recouped early losses as foreign and individual investors  
stayed bullish on the Japanese market. A tumble in hi-tech issues, 
triggered by a sell-off of technology shares in New York, had kept 
Tokyo stocks lower for most of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index lost  
138.43 points Monday, falling to 2,345.61, for its second-steepest 
drop ever. The Dow Jones industrial average fell after five 
straight sessions of record highs, slipping 53.36 points, or 0.5 
percent, to 10,440.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.04 yen in the late  
afternoon, down 0.12 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its 
late New York level of 117.58 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong slumped as investors took profits  
following three straight sessions of sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 356.66 points, or 2.8 percent, closing at 
12,409.78. On Monday, the index had gained 276.14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit-taking was expected after the index rose nearly 8  
percent over the past three sessions, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said investors largely discounted a government land auction  
on Tuesday, which fetched relatively good prices. The land auction 
was the first since the Hong Kong government froze land sales nine 
months ago following a plunge in property prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares also plunged on profit-taking, with the main  
index falling more than 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said Monday's explosion at the Istiqlal Grand Mosque in  
Jakarta, following months of religious violence between Muslims and 
Christians in parts of Indonesia, made investors jittery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 4.3 percent,  
or 22.177 points, to 485.970 points. On Monday, the index had 
surged 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares prices closed mostly lower on profit-taking.  
The Straits Times Index fell 1.8 percent, or 32.83 points, to 
1,809.48. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed little changed. The market's key  
Weighted Stock Price rose 4.56 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,627.74. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower as the local  
market took a breather after four straight session gains. The 
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 20.77 points, or 0.9 percent, to 
2,192.04. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Profit-taking took some steam out of Philippine shares,  
but advances made by selected blue-chip stocks pushed up the main 
index for a 13th straight day. The Philippine Stock Exchange index 
of 30 selected companies rose 2.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 
2,358.65. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed lower, ending a run of record  
finishes as investors sold blue chips. The All Ordinaries Index 
closed at 3,090.1, down 23.00 points, or 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher in reaction to plans by  
heavily indebted Daewoo Group to sell off its shipbuilding and 
other key businesses. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 
3.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 770.43. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed mixed. The benchmark  
Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, rose 6.11 
points or 0.99 percent, to 621.53. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower following a two-day  
rally. The SET Index fell 6.08 points, or 1.5 percent, to 406.11.

<HEADLINE> GOP Proposes Surplus Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans brought legislation to the Senate  
floor Tuesday that would make it difficult to spend anticipated 
Social Security surpluses on anything but shoring up the retirement 
program or reducing the national debt. The White House threatened 
to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders say strict new rules are needed to stop  
lawmakers from spending government surpluses that come from Social 
Security's payroll taxes, as opposed to income taxes, in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal here is to lock this money up,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``We want to make it as difficult as 
possible to breach that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate began debating the proposed restrictions Tuesday, but  
objections from Democrats -- including a veto threat from the 
Clinton administration -- are expected to hold up any votes until at 
least later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's advisers at the White House Office of  
Management and Budget said in a statement Tuesday that the GOP 
measure would too tightly restrict the government's day-to-day cash 
flow, especially in the event of ``any unanticipated slowdown in 
the economy.'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin first raised that 
concern last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the  
Republican measure ``doesn't commit a nickel'' of income tax 
surpluses that Democrats want for Medicare, the health insurance 
program for the elderly. Republicans instead want expected income 
tax surpluses for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the administration's statement said ``the  
legislation is flawed because it ... fails to ensure that the 
surplus is used to protect the payment of benefits to Social 
Security beneficiaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to try to give Social Security a tangible claim on  
the economic growth that would be expected to result from a lower 
national debt: IOUs giving the program a claim on income-tax 
dollars after baby boomers retire. He also has called for 
government investment of some of Social Security's cash reserves in 
the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Clinton's IOUs would be just paper promises that  
would have to be made good by taxpayers or borrowing in the future, 
and the stock market investments would bring private financial 
markets under undue government influence. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have yet to endorse any specific alternative for  
using the surpluses to benefit Social Security, but in both the 
House and Senate they are encouraging the development of plans by 
other influential Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, is close to unveiling one such plan that would use the 
Social Security tax surpluses to finance new personal accounts 
workers could invest in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with Archer's plan say the investment returns  
workers earned would be substituted, on an individual basis, for 
traditional Social Security benefits, probably at something close 
to a dollar-for-dollar exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Rick  
Santorum of Pennsylvania, whom Lott has picked to head a GOP task 
force, are collaborating with moderate Democrats on a plan 
combining similar personal accounts with upfront trimming of Social 
Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Democrats and Republicans can resolve their considerable  
differences and enact Social Security changes, however, the 
Republican bill that reached the Senate floor Tuesday would wall 
off Social Security surpluses for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would require that the surpluses be used to pay off  
the government's debt to private bondholders. To ensure that 
happens, it would periodically lower the statutory limit on that 
public debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaching the declining debt limit would require agreement by 60  
senators -- more than a majority. The main exception would be for 
money used to enact Social Security reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Other exceptions would include national defense emergencies --  
such as the current conflict in Yugoslavia -- and a recession that 
held economic growth to less than 1 percent for at least six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders say they will bring similar legislation  
to the floor soon. A nonbinding version passed Congress as part of 
the GOP budget resolution last week, but actually putting the new 
spending restrictions into effect would require a change in law and 
Clinton's signature.

<HEADLINE> Many Ignore Closed-End Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They're holding a 5-percent-off sale at the  
mutual fund store, but not many investors are showing up to shop. 
</P>
<P>
	The markdown can be found in the category of investment  
companies known as closed-end funds, a sort of oddball cousin to 
traditional open-end mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Open-end fund sponsors stand ready at any time to buy and sell  
shares in direct transactions with the public, at a price 
determined by the net asset value of the fund's portfolio. By 
contrast, closed-end funds have a fixed amount of shares that trade 
in the stock market, just like the stocks of the companies in which 
they invest. 
</P>
<P>
	So buyers or sellers at any time may find that the going price  
stands either at premium (above) or discount (below) a fund's net 
asset value per share. This complicates matters, but it also 
sometimes creates interesting opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Closed-end funds seem to be the forgotten stepchild in the  
mutual fund world, a misunderstood investment option that can be 
quite successful,'' say analysts at the fund tracking firm of 
Wiesenberger in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	``While nearly 10,000 options exist for investors in open-end  
funds, only about 500 are available in the closed-end fund 
universe,'' Wiesenberger says in a new report on the subject. ``One 
reason investors shy away from the closed-end fund option is the 
presence of the premium or discount.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This extra layer of complexity can narrow or widen at any time.  
At last tally by the research firm of Lipper Inc., the median level 
stood at a 4.8 percent discount (hence the ``5 percent off'' 
characterization). In other words, half of all closed-end funds 
showed discounts of greater than 4.8 percent, and the other half 
were trading at smaller discounts or premiums. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes, the premium or discount on a given closed-end fund  
seems logical. For instance, most funds concentrating on single 
foreign countries or areas of the globe outside the United States 
have lately traded at substantial discounts, given that foreign 
markets in general have lagged behind Wall Street for the past five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	A closed-end bond fund may trade consistently at some discount  
to its NAV simply because its expenses cut into the portfolio's 
yield before it is passed along to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Conversely, a fund may trade at a premium if it owns exotic  
securities that are scarce or not easy to buy directly, especially 
if those securities are considered hot properties. 
</P>
<P>
	But on many occasions, the reasons for a premium or discount may  
be hard to figure out. A mysterious discount tends to put many 
would-be buyers off, no matter how attractive the resulting price, 
simply by creating the impression that the smart money knows 
something bad that just hasn't come to light yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiesenberger says its research shows that people brave enough to  
invest regularly in deeply discounted closed-end funds can make 
some good money -- but that the game gets very chancy and volatile 
at times. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if you aren't interested in anything this complicated, it  
pays to be aware of closed-end funds whenever you invest in mutual 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, before you buy an open-ended bond fund at NAV, you  
might check to see if there is a closed-end fund with a similar 
portfolio that is trading at a discount big enough to offer you a 
better return (don't forget to factor trading costs into the 
equation). 
</P>
<P>
	That same principle applies in reverse: If you are attracted to  
a closed-end fund that is trading at a premium, ask yourself 
whether a piece of a similar portfolio could be bought at NAV 
through an open-end fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The newsletter Mutual Fund Forecaster in Deerfield Beach, Fla.,  
notes that plans have been filed to bring out a closed-end fund 
specializing in Internet stocks, LCM Internet Growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``If investors clamor to buy these shares, the premium could  
skyrocket,'' says the letter's editor-in-chief, Norman Fosback. 
``If so, we counsel avoiding it. Eventually, we expect to see LCM 
Internet Growth shrink to a discount below NAV. That could create 
an intriguing buying opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Italian, German Telecoms Near Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA and Germany's Deutsche Telekom  
AG are nearing a megadeal that would create a new global competitor 
to U.S. giants such as AT&AMP;T. 
</P>
<P>
	The move, pairing two former state monopolies, would be subject  
to intense regulatory scrutiny and would undoubtedly present the 
telecommunications companies with political and cultural obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia-Deutsche Telekom combination would dwarf its  
competitors in Europe and would most likely become the largest 
merger in history, topping the pending $74 billion oil industry 
deal between Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	A Telecom Italia official who spoke on condition of anonymity  
said the two firms' chief executives -- Franco Bernabe and Ron 
Sommer -- were to outline the merger agreement at a news conference 
today in London. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after separate board meetings Monday, the press  
conference was postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Telecom Italia official said today the complexity of the  
merger and the number of issues still to be settled led to the 
postponement. Telecom Italia's board will resume discussions later 
in the day, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Times reported today the main problem appeared to  
be over the structure of the merged company, with the German group 
demanding a 56 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom spokesman Stephan Althoff on Monday declined to  
comment on reports that the two companies planned to fold their 
stock into a new telecommunications holding company on a 60-40 
percent basis. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian prime minister's office has said that any accord  
must be on an equal footing, underlining fears in Italy of foreign 
ownership of the strategic telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia may not be the only partner Deutsche Telecom is  
eyeing. The German business weekly Manager Magazin issued a news 
release Monday saying that Deutsche Telekom is also negotiating a 
takeover of U.S. telecommunications company Sprint Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report to be published Friday in the magazine,  
Telekom boss Ron Sommer has been negotiating a deal with Sprint 
Corp.'s CEO William Esrey for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Althoff dismissed the story as ``just speculation.''  
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Telekom has a market capitalization of about $117  
billion while Telecom Italia is at about $77 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said Monday that any merger  
between Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom would require a 
privatization of the German company. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot imagine that a privatized Telecom Italia may merge  
with a company whose main shareholder is the German state,'' 
D'Alema told reporters. Deutsche Telecom is 72 percent-owned by the 
German government. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian government owns 3.4 percent of Telecom Italia, but  
it has veto power over the acquisition of more than 3 percent of 
the shares of the telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	Olivetti has offered $12.31 a share for Telecom Italia. Olivetti  
plans to proceed with its tender offer despite the other merger 
talks, company spokesman Ugo Panerai said Monday. Olivetti has 
already filed a prospectus with the Italian regulatory body Consob.

<HEADLINE> Orioles Put Will Clark on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- One day after Cal Ripken went on the  
disabled list for the first time in his career, he was joined by 
Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, whose fractured left thumb in expected to keep him out of  
Baltimore's lineup for four weeks, was injured Sunday when he was 
struck by a sharp grounder off the bat of Toronto's Willie Green. 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles placed him on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday,  
retroactive to Monday, when the first baseman was examined in 
Baltimore by Dr. Hugh Baugher. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was placed on the disabled list Monday with nerve  
irritation in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who signed with the Orioles as a free agent in December,  
was hitting .370 with three homers and seven RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Infielder Jessie Garcia was recalled from Triple-A Rochester.  
The Orioles said a second player will be added to the active roster 
in the next day or two.

<HEADLINE>  25 May Be Dead in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men in fatigues and black  
trench coats attacked students with guns and explosives in a 
suicide mission at a suburban Denver high school Tuesday, and the 
sheriff said 25 people may have been killed. The gunmen were found 
dead in the library. 
</P>
<P>
	Several students said the killers -- believed to be former  
students at Columbine High School -- were gunning for minorities and 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen were found dead with devices on them that authorities  
said could be bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Sheriff John Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 people were wounded at the 11:30 a.m. attack. Shots  
ricocheted off lockers as the gunmen opened fire with what students 
said were automatic weapons. One girl was shot nine times in the 
chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them  
shooting,'' said Jake Apoeaca, 16. ``He saw us and then he started 
shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt threw two hand 
grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we started 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many students dived to the floors and sprinted for the exits.  
Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the help 
of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours while 
SWAT teams searched for the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from a second-floor  
window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by two SWAT team 
members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said 25 people may have been killed, students and  
teachers alike. But by early evening, officers had yet to remove 
any bodies because of the danger of explosives and the need to 
preserve evidence. FBI agents and police SWAT teams slowly made 
their way through the building. 
</P>
<P>
	A third young man was led away from the school in handcuffs more  
than four hours after the attack. Sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis 
said that suspect was believed to be a friend of the gunmen but did 
not take part in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Lammers, 17, was among several students who said the gunmen  
were targeting minorities and athletes at the 1,800-student high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Other students said the killers might have been part of a group  
of eight to 10 students who wear black trench coats every day and 
are known as the ``Trench Coat Mafia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are jerks,'' said Jason Greer, 16. ``They are really  
strange, but I've never seen them do anything violent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hours after the attack, wounded victims lay inside the  
building and police were unable to get to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hundreds of officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school. Frantic parents were sent to a nearby 
elementary school, where they searched for word of their children. 
Some students had called their parents on cellular phones from 
inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers hugged parents and each other and wept and they  
recalled the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	As TV images of the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter  
ambulances used a sports field as a landing pad, and officers in 
helmets and camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. Students 
who fled the building wept and held their hands above their heads 
while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	Three youths wearing black -- but not trench coats -- were stopped  
by police in a field near the school. The Colorado Bureau of 
Investigation said the three were friends of the gunmen who were 
being taken in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the shootings took place around the school,  
including in the cafeteria and library. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard the gunshots and we were running,'' said Kaley Boyle,  
a junior. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said a student who gave her name as Janine. ``We didn't 
think it was real and then we saw blood.'' Her voice broke with 
anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was two young men, wearing black trench coats.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff,''  
she said. ``Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We 
saw three people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something 
blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. Nearby schools were locked 
down, with students prohibited from entering or leaving for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton became the latest American community shocked by school  
violence. Since 1997, a series of school shootings have led to 
calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of troubled 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed in an attack at a school in Pearl, Miss.,  
three at West Paducah, Ky., five at Jonesboro, Ark., and two in 
Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Colorado Rockies and basketball's Denver Nuggets  
postponed their Tuesday night games.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With 10 Church Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 36-year-old Indiana man with an interest in  
satanism was indicted Tuesday on charges of burning 10 churches in 
Indiana and Georgia, including one in which a volunteer firefighter 
died, the National Church Arson Task Force announced. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the largest number of fires charged to one individual  
during the task force's nearly 3-year-old investigation, said 
Treasury Undersecretary James Johnson, the task force co-chairman. 
The task force has opened investigations of 752 church fires, 
bombings or attempted bombings and has charged 331 individuals in 
249 of those attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant, Jay Scott Ballinger, who was arrested last  
February on a federal complaint charging him with seven southern 
Indiana church fires, ``is a white man charged with setting fire to 
predominantly white churches,'' Acting Assistant Attorney General 
Bill Lann Lee, task force co-chairman, said at a news conference at 
the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger has admitted to federal agents that he burned 30 to 50  
churches in 11 states between 1994 and 1998, according to an 
affidavit by Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent Scott D. 
McCart. In that February document, McCart said satanic materials 
were found in Ballinger's Yorktown, Ind., home. Ballinger traveled 
with his girlfriend, Angela Wood, 24, of Atlanta, as she worked as 
a stripper in several states. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood and another man, Donald A. Puckett, 37, of Lebanon, Ind.,  
have told federal agents they took part with Ballinger in burning 
an Indiana church where they painted an upside-down cross on the 
steps as part of a satanic ritual, McCart's affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Indianapolis returned 12 counts charging  
Ballinger with the seven Indiana fires. A separate federal grand 
jury in Atlanta returned six counts charging him with three 1998 
fires in northern Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of those, at New Salem United Methodist Church in  
Commerce, Ga., volunteer firefighter Loy Williams, 27, died, and 
three firefighters were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of that death, Ballinger could face the death penalty if  
he is convicted and Attorney General Janet Reno authorizes seeking 
that penalty. Otherwise, the Georgia fires carry a minimum penalty 
of 50 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana fires carry a total minimum penalty of 90 years in  
prison and a maximum of 210 years. Ballinger also faces a top fine 
of $3,000,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He is in custody at a federal medical facility in Minnesota, Lee  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood and Puckett were not indicted Tuesday, Lee said. They were  
charged in the same criminal complaint brought in February against 
Ballinger with assisting him in the 1994 arson of the Concord 
Church of Christ in Boone County, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Puckett filed a petition to enter a plea of guilty to  
that charge. Lee said Puckett and Wood ``have not been cleared'' 
and the investigation of fires set by Ballinger continues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone who sets fire to a house of worship is not just  
attacking a building, they are attacking a community,'' Lee said, 
adding that the task force would continue operations ``as long as 
needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The task force has maintained a 34 percent arrest rate in the  
fires it has investigated, which Johnson said is ``more than double 
the nationwide arson arrest rate of 16 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger has been in federal custody since his arrest after  
suffering burns from a church fire he allegedly set in Ohio. 
Off-duty Ball State, Ind., Police Sgt. Steve Hiatt said he 
overheard paramedics describing Ballinger's suspicious burns and 
remembered Ballinger's name from a 1997 church fire investigation. 
He stopped by the hospital and questioned Ballinger, who was 
bandaged with severe burns to his face, chest, legs and hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger has been mostly unemployed since he settled back into  
his parents' rural home in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, parents complained he was recruiting teen-agers into a  
cult. At Ballinger's home, Daleville Police Sgt. Mark Brewer 
confiscated about 50 contracts signed in blood by teen-agers who 
agreed to give their souls to the devil and do ``all types of 
evil'' in exchange for wealth, power and sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballinger was not charged and successfully sued to get the  
contracts back, Brewer said.

	DETROIT (AP) -- The nation's franchised auto dealers bought a  
record $5.3 billion worth of advertising last year, a 4 percent 
increase over 1997 spending, the National Automobile Dealers

<HEADLINE> IRS Oversight Board Still Not Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- This year's tax filing season is over, too  
late for a citizens oversight board authorized by Congress last 
year. The reason? The White House is three months late in 
appointing six members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first real opportunity to see whether the IRS  
restructuring bill is working as well as we had hoped has gone 
by,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways 
and Means Committee. ``That is disappointing to say the least.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's IRS reform law created a nine-member panel with the  
power to review agency operations to ensure taxpayers are treated 
properly. The law provided the panel access to some private tax 
documents in its work. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel also will oversee management of the agency, recommend  
future candidates to run the IRS and advise the president when it 
feels an incumbent commissioner should be removed. 
</P>
<P>
	Three board members are permanent: the treasury secretary, the  
IRS commissioner and a representative of the National Treasury 
Employees Union. The law required that President Clinton submit for 
Senate approval the six citizen nominees by Jan. 22, six months 
after the law took effect, but as of Tuesday that had not happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of Congress wonder if the delay is caused by  
political pressure from White House friends seeking one of the 
panel's five-year terms. The board is supposed to comprise members 
with some tax and management expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ought to have the stamina to withstand that pressure,''  
said Rep. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who co-chaired an IRS restructuring 
commission. ``They ought to be able to pick the experts, not 
politicians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., the restructuring panel's other  
co-chairman, said he didn't believe the Clinton administration has 
``ulterior motives'' in delaying the nominations, even though 
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin initially and fiercely opposed 
creation of the board over questions about its powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things that have to be done to make the IRS a  
better agency,'' said Kerrey. ``Now, it's sort of a headless 
operation. We'll notice how much this delay has hurt us when the 
board is appointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kerrey added that the White House has been distracted by other  
major events since the IRS reform law passed, starting with the 
Monica Lewinsky affair and impeachment and continuing with the war 
in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv, however, said Congress was  
unrealistic in setting a six-month deadline for appointments 
because FBI background checks on potential nominees must include 
exhaustive examinations of their past tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we worked very hard on with the Congress to  
produce legislation that was workable,'' Toiv said. ``The president 
was very supportive of the taxpayer bill of rights, that it be done 
the right way. We hope to have our appointments very soon.''

<HEADLINE> IRS Oversight Board Still Not Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A citizen oversight board authorized last year  
to help make the IRS more sensitive to taxpayers should have been 
up and running during this year's tax filing season, but it doesn't 
exist yet. The White House is three months late in nominating six 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Congress members worry that the delay could slow changes in  
the way the Internal Revenue Service does business. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of things that have to be done to make the IRS a

sort of a headless operation. We'll notice how much this delay has

</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the administration missed a  
golden opportunity to check up on the IRS as Americans wrestled 
with their tax returns during the filing season that ended last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our first real opportunity to see whether the IRS  
restructuring bill is working as well as we had hoped has gone

</P>
<P>
	``The administration has lots of other things on its mind,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Republicans, citing the initial Treasury opposition, say  
the delay raises questions about how seriously the Clinton 
administration is trying to implement the reform law. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ignoring this duty demonstrates to the American people that  
IRS abuses are not a major concern,'' House Majority Leader Dick 
Armey, R-Texas, said in a letter to Clinton.

	White House spokesman Barry Toiv, however, said Congress was  
unrealistic in setting a six-month deadline for appointments 
because FBI background checks on potential nominees must include 
exhaustive examinations of their past tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite early opposition, Toiv said, the administration is  
satisfied with the compromise struck on creation of the board, 
which gave it more of an advisory role in comparison to early 
versions of the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we worked very hard on with the Congress to  
produce legislation that was workable,'' Toiv said. ``The president 
was very supportive of the taxpayer bill of rights, that it be done 
the right way. We hope to have our appointments very soon.''

<HEADLINE> Giants' Hayes Suspended for 4 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- San Francisco Giants third baseman Charlie Hayes  
was suspended for four games by the National League on Tuesday for 
charging Arizona pitcher Todd Stottlemyre from second base last 
week and instigating a brawl. 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes and Stottlemyre were also fined $2,000 each by NL  
president Len Coleman. Hayes decided not to appeal the penalty, and 
started serving the penalty Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got four games and I'm taking it now,'' Hayes said. ``That's  
all I've got to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre said he will not appeal the fine.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't want to agree or disagree with it. I just want  
to put it behind me. I think it's best for me to put it behind me 
and I think it's best for the club not to become an obstacle 
through an appeal process or anything like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure I disagree or agree with how it was done. But I'm  
going to accept it and pay the fine and move on. That's probably 
the best scenario for everybody,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre was still surprised the whole incident occurred.  
</P>
<P>
	``How they rule on him I don't want to make an opinion one way  
or another. I think the whole situation probably shouldn't have 
happened but it did,'' he said. ``I think it did because in the 
heat of battle he was obviously frustrated and wanted to take out 
some of his frustrations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes charged the mound from second base in the sixth inning at  
Phoenix last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't land a punch, but I did try to hurt him,'' Hayes said  
after the game. ``He can say `Hi' to me, and I'll try to slap him. 
I just don't like him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to knock him out,'' Hayes said. ``I didn't want  
to wrestle. He talks like he's Bob Gibson. I'm the only one he can 
get out. ... I'm sick of people like that. Who does he think he is, 
Sandy Koufax or somebody? To me he's a .500 pitcher, 12-and-12. I 
don't think nobody likes him. I don't think some of his teammates 
like him. He's going to get some of them hurt. He needs to just 
pitch and just shut up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stottlemyre said this is the first time anyone had gone after  
him from second base. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought he was yelling at me from first base, so when he got  
to second base, I had something to say to him,'' Stottlemyre said. 
``That was enough to trigger him, and here he came. I don't know 
why he was frustrated. I guess you'll have to ask him. ... He 
missed me all night at the plate and he missed me on the mound.''

<HEADLINE> Flyers Try To Win Without Lindros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Now taking the ice for the Stanley Cup  
playoffs: A team disguised as the Philadelphia Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Eric Lindros, it's hard to think of the Flyers any other  
way. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers head into a first-round series against the Toronto  
Maple Leafs in the unfamiliar role of underdog. The reason for that 
is easy to pinpoint: Lindros is out with a collapsed lung, and his 
chances of playing again this season are slim. 
</P>
<P>
	Without him, the Flyers finished with a 3-1-1 record in their  
last five regular-season games to capture the fifth playoff seeding 
in the Eastern Conference. They still believe they have a chance 
against Toronto, a team they dominated in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they just don't seem like the Flyers without No. 88.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're only missing one guy now,'' forward Keith Jones said.  
``We can't make any excuses. It's laid on the table for us, our 
lines are set and I think we're all comfortable with what we have 
to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who begin the series in Toronto Thursday night, got  
a rare dose of good news on the injury front this week. Forward 
Mark Recchi, feared out for the first round with another head 
injury, was cleared to play against the Maple Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors determined that Recchi's most recent bout with headaches  
and dizziness was caused by migraines, not another concussion. 
Recchi returned to practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt fine out there,'' said Recchi, limited to eight games  
since the Flyers acquired him from Montreal to bolster their 
offense for the playoffs. ``Hopefully it won't happen again. But if 
I do get the numbness, I'll probably have to sit out that game. 
Obviously I'll be all right. I'll be able to bounce back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers were 3-1 against the Leafs this season, but that was  
with Lindros in the lineup. Philadelphia won the most recent 
meeting, 3-1 at Toronto as Lindros scored his 40th and, as it 
turned out, last goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros was injured in the same April 1 game at Nashville in  
which Recchi suffered his second head injury in three weeks. About 
12 pounds lighter from his ordeal, Lindros showed up at a couple of 
practices this week, but was unable to do anything more strenuous 
than glide around the ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our jobs have always been the same, whether he (Lindros) is in  
there or isn't in there,'' Rod Brind'Amour said. ``You still have 
to go out there and execute and do all the things right to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi is likely to play on the Flyers' revamped top line with  
Brind'Amour and John LeClair. He doesn't plan to use his head for 
worrying. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to be an effective player in the playoffs if I  
play passive,'' Recchi said. ``I have to go out there and create 
things. Getting hit is part of the game and I can't worry about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The series provides an intriguing matchup of goaltenders. With  
Curtis Joseph available last summer, the Flyers signed the older 
(35 vs. 32) and cheaper ($3.5 million vs. $6 million) John 
Vanbiesbrouck. Joseph signed with Toronto, getting the biggest 
contract among free-agent goalies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beezer's 2.18 goals-against average was better than Joseph's  
2.56. Now, Vanbiesbrouck gets to prove that he was the better 
choice, not a second option. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it a `Cujo against John' kind of thing?'' Vanbiesbrouck  
said. ``I don't think it is. There's more to this. We've got some 
great players, they've got some great players. There's going to be 
some magnificent play. Toronto's going to be a high-spirited, 
high-flying team.''

<HEADLINE> People Might Feel the Cost of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top congressional Republicans acknowledged  
Tuesday that the multibillion-dollar costs of the clash with 
Yugoslavia and an accompanying military buildup will come from 
Social Security surpluses, and might affect the size of the party's 
proposed tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after President Clinton asked Congress for $6.05 billion  
for the Balkans conflict, Republican House and Senate leaders said 
the first votes on the measure could come next week. But the 
leaders seemed to disagree over how insistent they should be about 
adding more defense funds. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said it is ``our  
first moral obligation'' to strengthen a Pentagon left overburdened 
worldwide by the Clinton administration. He used no figure, but 
said Monday that a $10 billion measure would be ``insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the perception of us being stretched too thin is for  
any number of places around the world an invitation, a provocation, 
to make a strike and see if we can get away with it,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the sentiment in his more moderate chamber, Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the GOP should use ``as 
much restraint as we can'' and limit the bill to single-digit 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a measure costing $15 billion to $18 billion, as some  
House conservatives have said they want, does not have ``any 
realistic chance'' of being enacted. Citing shortages of ships, 
ammunition and personnel, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., chairman of 
the House Armed Services military procurement subcommittee, said he 
believed the bill should run ``well beyond $20 billion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a limit to how much you can sensibly spend in a period  
of time,'' Lott said. ``You run the risk if you make it too big it 
collapses in a puddle, and that creates problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey and Lott also disagreed over whether language should be  
included boosting military pay and pensions. Lott said it should, 
but Armey suggested that should be considered later because it 
wasn't as urgent as paying for the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the price tag, Armey and Lott said they believed the  
money will come from this year's federal budget surplus, which is 
expected to be about $110 billion and comes entirely from Social 
Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a significant admission, because in this year's budget  
fight with Clinton, Republicans have promised repeatedly that they 
will use Social Security surpluses only to overhaul the program or 
reduce the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has asked for that money, and the American  
people need to understand that it's coming out of Social 
Security,'' Lott told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said separately that if voters see the war's costs  
trimming the national debt reduction that is achieved this year, 
``I think they understand the need, the priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said defense spending should go up next year, too, and  
finding the money to pay for that would cause Republicans to 
``re-examine our priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that would include a debate over whether money should be  
shifted from domestic to defense spending, and ``whether the tax 
reduction might be less than it might otherwise need to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-written budget approved by Congress last week calls for  
10-year tax cuts of at least $778 billion, with about $15 billion 
of the cuts coming next year. Fiscal 2000 begins Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Group: National Parks Are Decaying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dirty air is choking the Great Smoky Mountains  
National Park. Deteriorating sewers are polluting the streams of 
Yellowstone. Historic ruins in the Chaco Culture National 
Historical Park in New Mexico are falling apart because of neglect 
and vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	The examples were cited Tuesday by a private parks advocacy  
group as examples of a national park system that is in need of 
billions of dollars in repairs and protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our national parks are not being protected or respected,''  
said Thomas Kiernan, president of the National Parks and 
Conservation Association, as the group released a list of its 10 
``most endangered parks'' in the federal system of 378 parks, 
monuments and historical sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Kiernan said the 10 parks were examples of the problems facing  
the federal park system and that other parks may be just as 
endangered. These were selected because they were symbolic of the 
kinds of problems parks are facing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The list of 10 is an embarrassment. ... We can and must do a  
lot more,'' he said at a news conference. But Kiernan acknowledged 
that overcoming years of neglect and funding shortfalls will be 
expensive -- perhaps as much as $6 billion over many years. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is growing interest in Congress this year to spend  
more for conservation, including land purchases, there's no 
indication Congress is prepared to spend that kind of money on the 
federal park system. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sens. Harry Reid of Nevada and Bob Graham of Florida  
attended the news conference to promote legislation they have 
introduced that would provide $500 million a year for park 
improvements and address outside threats to federal parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid noted that 65 million people visit the 54 national parks  
and more than 100 million more visit the numerous monuments and 
historic areas annually. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're the envy of the rest of the world with our national  
parks,'' said Reid, but ``our national parks are being overused, 
over-loved. They're being loved to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The park groups' 10 most endangered list cited an array of  
problems, including traffic congestion, air pollution, a push for 
wider used of motorized vehicles, poor maintenance and inadequate 
safeguards against vandalism and looting that have led to the 
destruction of historic sites. Historic artifacts often are being 
left to rot, rust or mildew. In some cases, the biodiversity of 
parks is being undermined by invading non-native species; and in 
many parks, no one knows what species actually are present, the 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The group did not rank the 10 parks, but provided a list in  
alphabetical order: 
</P>
<P>
	--Chaco Culture National Historic Park, New Mexico. Historic  
ruins have been severely damage because of lack of maintenance, 
exposure to weather, tourism, vandals and looting. 
</P>
<P>
	--Denali National Park, Alaska. Made the list because of concern  
about a possible road being built through the heart of the park. 
The proposed 80-mile northern access road would threaten wildlife 
and habitat, according to the group. Sen. Frank Murkowski, 
R-Alaska, argues the road is needed to provide access and will not 
be environmentally damaging. 
</P>
<P>
	--Everglades, Biscayne National Park and Cypress National  
Preserve, Florida. Decades of development has siphoned away and 
polluted waters. A restoration project is under way, but 
environmentalists are concerned about redevelopment of a nearby 
former air base. 
</P>
<P>
	--Gettysburg National Military Park, Pennsylvania. Civil War  
uniforms, guns, swords, saddles and photographs have been damaged 
by mold, rust and rot. 
</P>
<P>
	--Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona. It is beset by an overflow  
of visitors, traffic congestion, air pollution and noise from tour 
overflights. 
</P>
<P>
	--Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Tennessee and North  
Carolina. Severe air pollution in summer months. Average view 
during summer 13 miles, compared with 60 miles 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	--Haleakala National Park, Hawaii. Many native species have been  
driven to extinction because of invasion of non-native plants, 
insects, reptiles and viruses that continue to undermine the park's 
biodiversity. 
</P>
<P>
	--Mojave National Preserve, California. Development and growth  
around the park threatens the parks desert wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	--Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota. Pressure for use of  
motorized vehicles from motorized watercraft to snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	--Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. The  
``poster child for neglect,'' the group says. A crumbling sewage 
system has caused pollution to spill into streams, lakes and the 
park's famous geyser, Old Faithful.

<HEADLINE> GM Boss' Pay Declines After Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. chairman Jack Smith was paid  
$3.2 million in salary, bonus and dividends last year, a 27 percent 
drop that partly reflected the automaker's strike-damaged financial 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Smith cashed in previously granted stock options  
worth $3.9 million, got another $1.6 million in stock under a 
long-term executive incentive plan, and was given an estimated $3.7 
million worth of stock options that he can exercise over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensation figures for Smith and four other top GM  
executives are included in GM's annual proxy statement filed 
Tuesday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who also holds the title of chief executive, got a total  
compensation package worth an estimated $12.4 million, up 12 
percent from $11 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, Alex Trotman, who retired Jan. 1 as chairman,  
president and CEO of Ford Motor Co., received a total compensation 
package worth $73 million last year, of which $14.9 million was in 
salary, bonus and dividends. Trotman's pay was inflated by the 
$30.1 million in stock options he exercised and $24.1 million worth 
of stock he received under Ford's long-term incentive plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The compensation totals can vary widely year to year based on  
the amount of previously granted stock options the executive 
decides to cash in and the extent to which the company's financial 
performance affects long-term incentive plan payouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensation for Smith and Trotman is determined in large part  
by formulas that consider how each automaker met financial and 
management goals for the year and, in the case of stock options, 
over several years. Last year, GM earned $3 billion, down 53 
percent from the $6.3 billion it earned in 1997. Ford's operating 
earnings increased 10 percent last year to $6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's $1.08 million bonus was down 56 percent from the $2.45  
million he received in 1997. But at the start of 1998, Smith was 
granted a raise in his salary to $1.95 million from the $1.75 
million he received the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Finish Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Tuesday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for rains that could delay 
spring plantings. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn and soybeans found the most support on continuing rains  
the Midwest, which have increasingly stalled fieldwork and could lead 
to smaller acreage planted and lower yields if the wet weather pattern 
holds. 
</P>
<P>
        Corn futures also were boosted after Russia announced it would  
buy 250,000 metric tons of U.S. corn, a purchase many linked to Clinton 
administration donations to that financially troubled country. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans also were supported by a lack of farmer selling out  
of Brazil and the United States, which boosted cash market prices. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures rose after the U.S. Agriculture Department reported  
Monday that winter wheat crop conditions had declined, although most 
of the gains came largely on the strength of the corn and soybean markets. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for July delivery rose 5 3/4 cents to $2.69 a bushel;  
May corn rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.24 a bushel; May oats rose 3 1/4 cents 
to $1.24 a bushel; May soybeans rose 7 1/2 cents to $4.95 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and lean hog futures rose strongly on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange as higher cash market prices signaled renewed domestic demand 
from slaughterhouses. Pork bellies retreated. 
</P>
<P>
        June live cattle rose .80 cent to 63.70 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle rose .32 cent to 71.62 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
rose .75 cent to 55.97 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .47 cent 
to 55.45 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> 20 Hurt in Colorado H.S. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men dressed in long, black  
trench coats opened fire in a suburban high school today, 
scattering students as gunshots ricocheted off lockers. At least 20 
people were injured, including one girl shot nine times. Others 
wounded were trapped inside for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosions also were reportedly heard in Columbine High School.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 4 1/2-hours later, police led away a student from the school  
in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the ones who shot at us,'' said Chris Wisher,  
another student. Police had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two hours after the 11:30 a.m. shooting, SWAT team  
members entered the building and 15 to 20 students fled. The 
frightened students ran out with their hands in the air and were 
later frisked by police. Several other groups of youths ran from 
the school in the following hours after an armored car was brought 
to an entrance for cover. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no confirmation that the gunmen were still inside by  
late afternoon. SWAT team members searching the building were able 
to see some wounded students but couldn't reach them because the 
area wasn't secure, said Steve Davis, spokesman for the Jefferson 
County Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Television images, broadcast nationwide, showed police cars and  
ambulances at a staging area near the school, and helmeted officers 
in camouflage gear. At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from 
a second-floor window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by 
two SWAT team members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there are a few more victims,'' Davis said a short  
time earlier. ``We're hearing from deputies who can see from their 
vantage points more victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said police were looking for two suspects, but ``where in the  
building is unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One student, Kami Vest, called her father as she hid in the  
school with 30 other students. ``They have been able to call out on 
a cell phone and tell us they are OK,'' Dale Vest said. He said at 
midafternoon that she remained in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton asked Americans to pray for the students,  
parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the school was stormed, three youths wearing black  
-- but not trench coats -- were stopped by police in a field near the 
school. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation told KUSA-TV the three 
were friends of the gunmen and were taken in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses said there were two gunmen and the shootings took  
place around the school, including the cafeteria and library. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we just though they were firecrackers until we saw  
the guns come out of the trench coats,'' said student Justin Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said another student, who gave her name as Janine. ``We 
didn't think it was real and then we saw blood.'' Her voice broke 
with anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was two young men, wearing black trench coats.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff. ...  
Me and my friends got to my car and drove off,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Sapin, another student, also said the gunmen were all in  
black, in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they started walking down the hallway, I ran and I ran  
and I hid in the bushes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight to 10 students in the school wear black trench coats every  
day, students said. Josh Nielsen said they are known as the 
``Trench Coat Mafia.'' Another student, Jason Greer, called them 
``jerks.'' ``They are really strange, but I've never seen them do 
anything violent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, a 16-year-old junior, said members of the group kept  
to themselves and were ``kind of gothic. They are wearing dusters. 
They wear them every day, all black clothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're into guns and stuff like that,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	At the adjacent Clement Park, students were shaking and crying  
as parents wandered about, looking for their children. Police 
helicopters whirled overhead and hundreds of police officers 
patrolled the area and a nearby park. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 19 people were taken to hospitals, including a girl who  
suffered nine gunshot wounds to the chest. Kari Mackecher, 
spokesman for HealthOne, which runs Swedish Hospital, said four 
students were taken there, all in serious condition but conscious, 
and a fifth was en route. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other hospitals reported getting 14 people, at least one of  
them in critical condition. The 20th injured person was the young 
man taken out of the school window at midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver and Littleton police, and Jefferson County and Arapahoe  
sheriff's deputies were helping on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. Single-family homes line 
winding roads through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The school opened in 1973 and has an enrollment of about 1,800.  
Nearby schools were put on a lockdown status, with students 
prohibited from entering or leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of school shootings since 1997 shocked the nation and  
led to calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of troubled 
students. Two were killed at a school in Pearl, Miss., three at 
West Paducah, Ky., five at Jonesboro, Ark., and two at a school in 
Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE> `Iowa 47' Families Mark Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A former USS Iowa commander has criticized  
the Navy for not apologizing to relatives of the 47 sailors killed 
in an explosion on the battleship. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Capt. Larry Seaquist said at a ceremony Monday marking  
the disaster's 10th anniversary that the Navy, which initially 
blamed one of the dead sailors for the blast, misled families about 
the nature of its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	That made it difficult for relatives and shipmates of the dead  
men to come to grips with the tragedy because they feel 
``tarnished,'' Seaquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been very nice if the leadership of the Navy  
would have been here to say something simple to you, like `We 
apologize,''' Seaquist said in a speech at the Norfolk Naval Base 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the Iowa's skipper a year before the explosion.  
</P>
<P>
	Seaquist said afterward that he's mystified the Navy would  
``continue to miss the opportunity to do the right thing for the 
families and the crew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Naval Base spokesman Cmdr. Mike Andrews said, ``What  
Capt. Seaquist says is his opinion; that's his right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews noted that Adm. Frank B. Kelso III, then the chief of  
naval operations, publicly apologized in 1991 to the family of 
Clayton Hartwig. Kelso said there was no proof to the Navy's 
initial claim that Hartwig, despondent over a homosexual affair, 
deliberately detonated gunpowder, killing himself and 46 shipmates. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig's sister, Kathy Hartwig-Kubicina of Cleveland, said she  
and other Iowa families were grateful to Seaquist for his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we've ever asked for is somebody to stick up for us,''  
Mrs. Hartwig-Kubicina said. The family's $12 million defamation 
suit against the Navy is pending in federal court in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The World War II-era warship was conducting exercises in the  
Caribbean on April 19, 1989, when an explosion ripped through a 
turret with 16-inch guns. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 veterans and relatives of the victims attended  
Monday's ceremony at Iowa Point on the Navy base, the Iowa's home 
port until the ship was decommissioned in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members read poetry and bits of Scripture and talked  
about the men they lost. The names of all 47 crewmen were read 
aloud, and a bell was rung after each name. That was followed by a 
21-gun salute and the playing of taps as family members sobbed.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Report Improved Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A pilot sickout at American Airlines helped lift earnings at  
competing U.S. carriers in the first quarter, but bad winter 
weather caused scheduling problems that offset some of the gains. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at United Airlines parent UAL Corp. fell but still beat  
Wall Street's expectations; Northwest Airlines narrowed its losses; 
America West's earnings inched higher and discount carrier 
Southwest had a 37 percent surge in profits. 

</P>
<P>
                             *UAL Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The parent company of United Airlines reported a decline in  
first-quarter earnings Tuesday as winter storms in January grounded 
planes. But the earnings still surpassed Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the three months ended March 31 fell 14 percent  
to $187 million, or $1.54 a share, from $218 million, or $1.68 a 
share, the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings easily surpassed Wall Street expectations of $1.39  
a share, according to a survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 2.6 percent to $4.16 billion from $4.06 billion as  
the carrier filled more planes, especially in March. The carrier 
also benefited from an American Airlines pilots' sickout in 
February that drove passengers to competing carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based carrier reported its traffic  
in the Asian region improved on a year-over-year basis, reflecting 
some recovery in that region's economy. It was the first 
improvement since September 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite higher tickets costs instituted by most of the major  
carriers, United reported the amount of revenue it received from 
flying one passenger one mile fell 1.8 percent to 12.54 cents from 
12.77 cents as it paid higher costs to workers to improve on-time 
performance and higher salaries as a result of recent wage 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline said it was on track in the second quarter to match  
record earnings made in that year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the earnings beat expectations, UAL's stock fell $4  
or 4.8 percent to $79.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                      *Northwest Airlines Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	Continued fallout from a 1998 pilot strike and other labor  
problems cost Northwest Airlines $90 million in the first quarter, 
resulting in a net loss of $46 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss for the three months ended March 31, which amounted to  
58 cents a share, compared with income of $71 million, or 66 cents 
a share, in the same period in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures do not reflect a one-time gain of $18 million from  
sale of securities. Including the gain, the quarterly loss was $29 
million, or 36 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest's per-share loss was smaller than the 75 cents  
expected by analysts, according to a survey by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 6 percent to $2.28 billion, from $2.43 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``While we are dissatisfied with any loss, we are pleased with  
the pace of our recovery from last year's disruptions,'' said John 
Dasburg, president and chief executive. ``We expect to be 
profitable in the remaining three quarters of the year and for the 
full year of 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to labor problems, severe weather in January and  
March also hurt Northwest's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest still has not reached contract  
agreements with its largest labor groups, representing flight 
attendants, ground workers and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock rose 56 1/4 cents or 1.8 percent to $31 on the  
Nasdaq Stock Market. 

</P>
<P>
 *America West Holdings Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	The parent of America West Airlines reported a 3 percent gain in  
first-quarter profits Tuesday despite a March feud with flight 
attendants that took the company to the brink of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix-based America West, which also owns a vacation travel  
business, The Leisure Co., earned $26 million in the first three 
months of the year, up slightly from $25 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks largely to a share repurchase program, per-share earnings  
posted a larger gain, increasing to 63 cents from 53 cents. The 
per-share earnings surpassed Wall Street expectations of 61 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 7.5 percent to $520 million from $483 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Late last month, America West officials said the impact of a  
threatened flight attendants strike was substantially offset by the 
pilots' sickout at American Airlines. The 10-day sickout led to 
increased bookings at America West and other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	America West, which has hubs in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Columbus,  
Ohio, narrowly averted a strike by reaching a contract agreement 
with its flight attendants' union just hours after the flight 
attendants could have walked off the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock fell 18 3/4 cents to $20.81 1/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
                       *Southwest Airlines Co.    	
</P>
<P>
	Southwest Airlines reported its first-quarter profit rose 37  
percent, led by strong passenger demand and lower jet fuel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based discount carrier earned $95.8 million, or 27  
cents per share, in the three months ended March 31. That compared 
to $70 million, or 20 cents a share, in the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 14 percent to $1.08 billion from $943 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The airline expects strong growth again in the second quarter,  
during which it will begin service to its 54th city, Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock fell 43 3/4 cents to $32.06 1/4 on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) --Traffic stopped and Israelis stepped out of  
their cars on streets and highways Tuesday to remember soldiers 
fallen in battle and countrymen killed in terror attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Sirens sounded across the country at 11 a.m., signaling the  
start of two minutes of silence on a day of mourning for fallen 
loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags flew at half-staff, and radio and television stations  
broadcast mournful songs and interviews with the families of men 
and women who lost their lives during compulsory military service. 
</P>
<P>
	``We come here to unite and remember,'' Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu said during a ceremony at Mt. Herzl National Cemetery in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	``No nation can assure its security, existence, or future if it  
does not have the inner preparedness to pay the heavy price in the 
struggle for national existence,'' Netanyahu said, wearing a black 
skullcap. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands left roses and carnations on Mt. Herzl's pink  
limestone graves, gleaming in brilliant sunshine. An elderly woman 
draped in a shawl stooped over a grave, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town at the Cinematheque cafe, a young woman dressed in  
bright summer colors set down her orange juice and stood to gaze 
across the valley of Gehenna at the Old City walls -- the site of 
fierce battles in the 1967 and 1948 wars. She wept. 
</P>
<P>
	The mourning was marred by scuffles in the ultra-Orthodox  
Jerusalem neighborhood of Mea Shearim, where signs had been posted 
instructing residents to make a point of conducting their business 
throughout the siren. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultra-Orthodox regard such public displays as heathen icons  
and believe that mourning must come through the recitation of 
psalms and the study of religious texts. 
</P>
<P>
	Other ultra-Orthodox Jews stood at attention out of respect for  
secular Israelis, who constitute the bulk of military conscripts. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Israel remembers over 20,000 soldiers and fighters  
killed in battle since the start of Zionist settlement at the turn 
of the century. 
</P>
<P>
	The day was also marked in Macedonia at a field hospital set up  
by the Israeli army to attend to refugees from the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	The mood shifted abruptly in Israel at sundown Tuesday, when  
Israelis ushered in the country's 51st Independence Day with 
barbecues, parties and air shows.

entering Israel over the two-day holiday.

<HEADLINE> FDA Panel Recommends Painkiller OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government advisers recommended approval  
Tuesday of a powerful and potentially safer painkiller, Merck &AMP; 
Co.'s Vioxx, which promises competition for one of the nation's 
biggest-selling drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Advisers to the Food and Drug Administration voted Tuesday that  
Vioxx effectively treats osteoarthritis pain and that it is an 
effective analgesic for acute pain like that caused by dental work 
and certain surgeries. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx has been trumpeted as a new type of drug that relieves  
aches and inflammation with fewer stomach-damaging side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of people now depend on aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen  
and a host of other pills called ``non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs,'' or NSAIDs, to relieve pain. 
</P>
<P>
	But NSAIDs can cause ulcers, stomach bleeding and other  
gastrointestinal side effects, especially in long-term users. They 
are blamed for causing 107,000 hospitalizations every year, and for 
killing 16,500. 
</P>
<P>
	The reason: NSAIDS target an enzyme called cyclo-oxegenase that  
is responsible for much inflammation. But there are two types of 
this enzyme. Cox-2 is believed to cause inflammation, while Cox-1 
protects the stomach lining. NSAIDs hit both. 
</P>
<P>
	So scientists developed more specific drugs to target just  
Cox-2. The first Cox-2 inhibitor to hit the market was Monsanto's 
Celebrex, for arthritis pain. Doctors have written more than 2 
million prescriptions in its first three months of sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Vioxx promises stiff competition, particularly as FDA's advisers  
on Tuesday said the drug was proven to treat both arthritis pain 
and pain from other causes. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the advisory panel wasn't convinced that Merck had  
proved that, over the long term, Vioxx will cause fewer problematic 
ulcers. It decided the drug must bear the same ulcer warning as 
NSAIDs -- and Celebrex -- do, although Vioxx's label can include 
reports of studies that suggest the risk will turn out to be lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA isn't bound by its advisers' recommendations, but  
typically follows them.

<HEADLINE> Court Relaxes Insurance Deadlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today made it easier for  
states to relax some deadlines imposed by insurance companies for 
filing disability claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled unanimously that a California man's insurance  
claim may go forward even though he filed for benefits after the 
deadline. Specifically, the court concluded that a federal law does 
not override a California rule that requires insurance companies to 
pay some claims even though they were filed late. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves a much-litigated federal law that protects  
pensions and other employment benefits, the Employee Retirement 
Income Security Act, known as ERISA. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower courts had split on how ERISA affects states' efforts to  
let employees collect benefits even when they miss an insurance 
company's filing deadline. ERISA generally overrides state laws 
relating to employee benefit plans, but it does not override state 
laws that regulate insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling upholds the main part of a federal appeals court  
decision that revived a lawsuit filed by a California man who 
unsuccessfully sought long-term disability benefits from Unum Life 
Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
	John E. Ward was president and chief executive officer of  
Management Analysis Corp. until he resigned in May 1992. At the 
time, he suffered from an illness diagnosed later that year as 
diabetic neuropathy. 
</P>
<P>
	He informed the company in mid-1993 he had been approved for  
Social Security disability benefits, but he was not told about the 
company's long-term disability plan through Unum. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1994, Ward found documents that indicated he was  
eligible for long-term disability payments from Unum. He applied, 
but his claim was rejected on grounds he missed the deadline to 
file within one year and 180 days after the onset of his 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward sued, but a federal judge ruled against him.  
</P>
<P>
	However, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated Ward's  
case based on a California rule that says insurers can't refuse to 
pay late-filed claims unless the delay in filing the claim actually 
harmed the insurer. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court also cited a California rule that says an  
employer acts as an insurance company's agent in administering 
group policies. The court said the notice Ward gave to the company 
in 1993 might count as on-time notice to the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court said ERISA did not override either of those  
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court decided the 9th Circuit court was  
correct in saying the California rule on late-filed claims is not 
overridden by ERISA. 
</P>
<P>
	``By allowing a longer period to file than the minimum filing  
terms mandated by federal law, the (California) rule complements 
rather than contradicts ERISA and the regulations,'' Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the justices said ERISA does override the California  
rule that said an employer acts as an insurance company's agent. 
That rule ``would have a marked effect on plan administration,'' 
Ginsburg wrote, adding that it would force employers to take on a 
role it had not bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's ruling allows the case to return to the lower court to  
determine whether Unum can avoid paying benefits to Ward by showing 
that his late notice caused harm to Unum. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Unum Life Insurance vs. Ward, 97-1868.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Argues Price for Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan and Charlotte Hornets  
owner George Shinn don't agree on how much the retired Chicago 
Bulls star should pay for a half interest in Shinn's team, The 
Charlotte Observer reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told the newspaper that Shinn values the team at $160  
million, and wants Jordan to pay $80 million. Jordan wants to pay 
less, in part because his presence is likely to raise the team's 
value almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's prestige also could a key element in local lobbying for  
a new basketball arena in downtown, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and Shinn have been unavailable for comment during  
negotiations. However, Jordan confirmed Saturday, while at a hockey 
game, that he's interested.

	A source familiar with negotiations said there wasn't a conflict  
between Shinn and Jordan about the price. The number is negotiable 
and talks have been friendly.

decisions, and both would be consulted on every major issue.

for the Chicago Bulls. It has been estimated endorsement deals pay 
about $40 million annually.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Seeks To Buy Half of Hornets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Michael Jordan wants to pay less than the  
$80 million asking price for half of the Hornets, in part because 
he believes his name alone would probably increase the team's 
value, The Charlotte Observer reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	There isn't a conflict between Jordan and Hornets owner George  
Shinn about the price; the number is negotiable and talks have been 
friendly, a source familiar with negotiations told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Shinn values the Hornets at $160 million and Jordan  
doesn't want to pay as much as half of that for a 50-percent stake. 
The former NBA superstar feels that as a co-owner, he would help 
push the team's value even higher, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's prestige also could be a key element in lobbying for a  
new downtown basketball arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told the paper that both of them would have veto power  
on major team decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets spokesman Harold Kaufman declined to comment on the  
report, saying only that Jordan and Shinn agreed from the start to 
``have a continuing dialogue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan and Shinn have been unavailable for comment during  
negotiations. The two have met at least twice recently and have 
negotiated on the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan, who retired before the season after helping the Chicago  
Bulls win six NBA championships, grew up in North Carolina and has 
family and business ties to Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	He has made hundreds of millions of dollars from NBA and  
endorsement contracts. Last season he made $33 million playing for 
the Bulls. It has been estimated that endorsement deals pay about 
$40 million annually.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Hits Record $19.4B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit surged to another  
record as aftershocks from the global financial crisis cut further 
into the ability of American manufacturers and farmers to sell 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit widened to $19.4 billion in February. That was  
a 15.6 percent increase from the previous record, January's 
imbalance of $16.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to counter complaints that he has not done enough to  
deal with the surging trade deficit, President Clinton called on 
the international community to redouble its efforts to overhaul the 
global financial architecture to ``tame the cycles of boom and 
bust'' and prevent future Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told a White House gathering Tuesday that Treasury  
Secretary Robert Rubin will be putting forward new ideas on crisis 
management at upcoming meetings of the 182-nation International 
Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a moment for complacency. It is a moment to act to  
prevent financial crisis from reaching catastrophic stages in the 
future,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional and labor union critics of Clinton's free trade  
policies said the dramatic widening of the deficit in the year's 
first two months pointed to a need for policies to protect American 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, however, insisted in his brief remarks that the U.S.  
economy is continuing to perform strongly as a result of his 
policies, in spite of the rising trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics pointed to the 380,000 jobs lost in the past year at  
U.S. manufacturing plants forced to cut back production because of 
slumping exports, and they warned that Clinton's current policies 
must be changed. ``We oppose an agenda that is headed down a low 
road to nowhere,'' AFL-CIO President John Sweeney said Tuesday in 
comments on the widening deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan expressed anxiety last  
week about rising protectionist forces in the United States, but 
congressional supporters of quotas to block a flood of steel 
entering the country said the new trade numbers will give them 
extra ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	They also promised to fight any effort by the administration to  
strike a deal with China that would clear its entry into the World 
Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our China policy is driven by the interests of U.S.  
corporations,'' said Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. ``We cannot trust 
the Chinese government to keep their promises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, U.S. exports shrank for a fourth consecutive month,  
falling 0.6 percent to $76.6 billion. The downturn was led by a 
$927 million drop in commercial aircraft sales. Exports of farm 
goods including wheat and soybeans fell $130 million, while sales 
of telecommunications equipment dropped by $157 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports jumped 2.3 percent to a record $96 billion, and demand  
for autos and automotive parts rose to an all-time high of $14.6 
billion. Demand for foreign-made consumer products also set a 
record as imports of clothing, toys, television sets and stereos 
all posted big gains. 
</P>
<P>
	While manufacturers and farmers have been hit hard by the  
foreign financial crisis, the U.S. economy has forged ahead on the 
strength of strong consumer demand supported by an unemployment 
rate at its lowest level in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists said the worse-than-expected February trade figures  
were likely to shave up to 2 full percentage points from overall 
economic growth in the first three months of this year, but that 
would still leave the economy expanding at a healthy rate of around 
4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first two months of this year, America's trade deficit  
is running at an annual rate of $215 billion, far worse than last 
year's record $169 billion imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of  
Manufacturers, sees no relief in sight ``until the world economy 
recovers, and that is still some time away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund issued a forecast Tuesday  
predicting world growth will slow to just 2.3 percent this year, 
down from 2.5 percent last year. But the IMF said it believes the 
global crisis was bottoming out and forecast a rebound to 3.4 
percent growth next year. 
</P>
<P>
	By country, America's largest deficits last month were $5.3  
billion with Japan, which is struggling to emerge from recession, 
and $4.6 billion with China, where the administration is pushing 
for market-opening trade concessions before dropping its objections 
to China's WTO membership. 
</P>
<P>
	The deficit with Mexico rose to a record $1.8 billion in  
February, while the imbalance with Western Europe, a region 
suffering from its own slowdown in growth, climbed to $2.2 billion, 
up 65 percent from January.

<HEADLINE> 20 Hurt in Colorado H.S. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men dressed in long, black  
trench coats opened fire in a suburban high school today, 
scattering students as gunshots ricocheted off lockers. At least 20 
people were injured, including one girl shot nine times. Others 
wounded were trapped inside for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Explosions also were reportedly heard in Columbine High School.  
</P>
<P>
	Some 4 1/2-hours later, police led away a student from the school  
in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the ones who shot at us,'' said Chris Wisher,  
another student. Police had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two hours after the 11:30 a.m. shooting, SWAT team  
members entered the building and 15 to 20 students fled. The 
frightened students ran out with their hands in the air and were 
later frisked by police. Several other groups of youths ran from 
the school in the following hours after an armored car was brought 
to an entrance for cover. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no confirmation that the gunmen were still inside by  
late afternoon. SWAT team members searching the building were able 
to see some wounded students but couldn't reach them because the 
area wasn't secure, said Steve Davis, spokesman for the Jefferson 
County Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Television images, broadcast nationwide, showed police cars and  
ambulances at a staging area near the school, and helmeted officers 
in camouflage gear. At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from 
a second-floor window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by 
two SWAT team members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe there are a few more victims,'' Davis said a short  
time earlier. ``We're hearing from deputies who can see from their 
vantage points more victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said police were looking for two suspects, but ``where in the  
building is unknown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One student, Kami Vest, called her father as she hid in the  
school with 30 other students. ``They have been able to call out on 
a cell phone and tell us they are OK,'' Dale Vest said. He said at 
midafternoon that she remained in hiding. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton asked Americans to pray for the students,  
parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the school was stormed, three youths wearing black  
-- but not trench coats -- were stopped by police in a field near the 
school. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation told KUSA-TV the three 
were friends of the gunmen and were taken in for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses said there were two gunmen and the shootings took  
place around the school, including the cafeteria and library. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we just though they were firecrackers until we saw  
the guns come out of the trench coats,'' said student Justin Woods. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said another student, who gave her name as Janine. ``We 
didn't think it was real and then we saw blood.'' Her voice broke 
with anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was two young men, wearing black trench coats.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff. ...  
Me and my friends got to my car and drove off,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Sapin, another student, also said the gunmen were all in  
black, in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they started walking down the hallway, I ran and I ran  
and I hid in the bushes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight to 10 students in the school wear black trench coats every  
day, students said. Josh Nielsen said they are known as the 
``Trench Coat Mafia.'' Another student, Jason Greer, called them 
``jerks.'' ``They are really strange, but I've never seen them do 
anything violent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, a 16-year-old junior, said members of the group kept  
to themselves and were ``kind of gothic. They are wearing dusters. 
They wear them every day, all black clothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're into guns and stuff like that,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	At the adjacent Clement Park, students were shaking and crying  
as parents wandered about, looking for their children. Police 
helicopters whirled overhead and hundreds of police officers 
patrolled the area and a nearby park. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 19 people were taken to hospitals, including a girl who  
suffered nine gunshot wounds to the chest. Kari Mackecher, 
spokesman for HealthOne, which runs Swedish Hospital, said four 
students were taken there, all in serious condition but conscious, 
and a fifth was en route. 
</P>
<P>
	Five other hospitals reported getting 14 people, at least one of  
them in critical condition. The 20th injured person was the young 
man taken out of the school window at midafternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver and Littleton police, and Jefferson County and Arapahoe  
sheriff's deputies were helping on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. Single-family homes line 
winding roads through the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	The school opened in 1973 and has an enrollment of about 1,800.  
Nearby schools were put on a lockdown status, with students 
prohibited from entering or leaving. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of school shootings since 1997 shocked the nation and  
led to calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of troubled 
students. Two were killed at a school in Pearl, Miss., three at 
West Paducah, Ky., five at Jonesboro, Ark., and two at a school in 
Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Conflict Takes Toll on Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The economic fallout from the conflict in the  
Balkans extends well beyond burned-out villages in Kosovo and 
abandoned factories in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Fears that the strife may spread already have taken a toll on  
Europe's new single currency, the euro, which is limping along at a 
level well below the expectations of its 11 member nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, economists see investor confidence fading for  
projects in countries bordering Yugoslavia, and European 
governments face bigger bills to support and resettle a growing 
number of Kosovar refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the best indicators of business confidence in Europe is  
the value of the euro, which has steadily retreated since its 
introduction Jan. 4. Some economists say the turmoil in the Balkans 
is at least partly to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell to a new low of $1.0590 during trading Monday but  
was up at $1.0624 in late New York trading Tuesday. It rose as high 
as $1.1877 on its first day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Neil Parker, an economist at The Royal Bank of Scotland, said  
Tuesday that an erosion in confidence due to the conflict has 
probably shaved 2 1/2 U.S. centsoff the euro's value. The bombing and 
burning is far too close to home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's undermined confidence and stability in Europe as a  
whole.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And while the economic costs have been somewhat limited,  
physical distance from the conflict is no guarantee of immunity 
from its effects. If the euro continues to slump against leading 
world currencies, exporters 1,000 miles away in Britain may soon 
feel a competitive pinch from less expensive goods that are priced 
in euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain has chosen not to join the common currency for now.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the value of the euro gets dragged down relative to  
sterling, then that's going to affect the U.K.,'' said Douglas 
Godden of the Confederation of British Industry, an employers' 
lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
	Nations paying the highest price are those closest to the  
conflict. Hungary, Bulgaria and other countries that depend on 
waterways for much of their trade have suffered disruptions in 
growth since the Danube River was closed to commerce, said Glenn 
Davis, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais U.K. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting has also discouraged Western investors.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people have been very badly burned in Asia, Latin  
America and Russia over the last few years, and you're going to 
look very stupid if you put money into a war situation,'' Davis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Germany, Europe's economic linchpin, the effects of the  
Kosovo crisis have been mild so far. 
</P>
<P>
	But Germany has already accepted 10,000 refugees from Kosovo,  
and payments for additional humanitarian efforts could eventually 
put pressure on a federal budget already stretched by the costs of 
integrating the former communist East Germany, said Thomas Mayer, a 
Frankfurt-based economist for the investment bank Goldman Sachs. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries likely to become destinations for displaced  
Kosovars -- Italy, Austria and Switzerland -- could come under 
similar budgetary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and Britain, which have contributed the  
largest forces to the military campaign against Yugoslavia, have 
seen their leadership roles translate into a strengthening of their 
respective currencies. Parker of the Royal Bank of Scotland said 
this trend is a function of short-term euphoria more than financial 
logic. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders seeking a safe haven for funds have also bid up the  
value of the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
	If the conflict drags on into the summer, governments may have  
to consider cutting spending or, a less likely prospect, raising 
taxes, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone is feeling economic pain.  
</P>
<P>
	Exporters based in Germany and elsewhere in the countries that  
share the euro are likely to benefit from a cheaper euro when they 
try to sell in overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense-related industries may profit from NATO's need to  
replenish stocks of cruise missiles and other high-tech ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It depends on how good the Serbs are at shooting down NATO  
planes,'' said Malcolm House, an economist at the Federation of the 
Electronics Industry, a London-based trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the long run, companies that make constructions materials  
and consumer goods might be in a position to profit once Serbs and 
Kosovars begin rebuilding their lives.

<HEADLINE> Device Stops Grocery Cart Thieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- They carry bags of groceries, sure, but  
shopping carts are far more versatile. They serve as a portable 
suitcase for transients, a go-cart for children, a laundry hamper 
for apartment dwellers and a barbecue pit for beachgoers. 
</P>
<P>
	The humble carts are so popular that grocers spend millions of  
dollars annually trying to keep wayward carts on their property. 
</P>
<P>
	CartTronics, a San Diego-based company, has developed a cheap  
alternative -- a device that locks the cart's front wheel when it 
rolls outside the parking lot. It's the grocery store's equivalent 
of a car alarm and the device is catching on with chains 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's virtually foolproof,'' said David Perisher, manager at  
Molly Stone's Market in the upscale Pacific Heights neighborhood in 
San Francisco. ``You try to get a cart off of my lot, you can't do 
it. Because that front wheel locks down, all you can do is drag it, 
it creates so much resistance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perisher installed the Cart Anti-theft Protection System, or  
CAPS, last fall on his 60 carts, which have all stayed put. Saad 
Hirmez, owner of the Apple Tree Market in the San Diego community 
of Ocean Beach, has had the same success with his 35 carts since 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zero carts lost. Impressive, huh?'' Hirmez said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Supermarket Institute in Washington, D.C., estimates that a  
shopping cart is stolen every 90 seconds in the United States. 
About 1.8 million shopping carts were taken from retail stores last 
year at a replacement cost of about $175 million, according to the 
Washington D.C.-based Food Marketing Institute. An additional $117 
million was spent by grocers to hire contractors to retrieve 
abandoned carts. 
</P>
<P>
	Those were staggering, but encouraging statistics to Jeff  
French, chairman and founder of CartTronics. After a friend told 
him about the problems his business had with constant cart thefts, 
French decided to invest in a solution. He and several others spent 
the next few years testing and perfecting CAPS. 
</P>
<P>
	What they came up with was a system controlled by a  
low-frequency radio signal. An antenna is installed in the ground 
around the supermarket's perimeter, delineated by a painted stripe. 
The antenna, not affected by climate or temperature, emits a 
low-frequency radio signal that, when the cart passes over the 
stripe, triggers a plastic cover to drop over the wheel. The wheel 
then becomes useless but there is no damage to it should a customer 
try to force movement. Store employees unlock the device with a 
hand-held remote. 
</P>
<P>
	Installation takes less than a day and costs between $18,000 to  
$20,000 for a supermarket with 200 carts, French said. Stores where 
theft is prevalent can recoup that investment within months, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 stores in California, Kentucky, Nevada, Oregon and  
Texas are using the device, including the California-based Safeway 
supermarket chain and its subsidiaries like Vons. French said four 
of the top 10 grocery chains operating in the United States are 
expected to add the device to their shopping carts this year, but 
he declined to name them since contracts are still under 
negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	A recent convert was Super Warehouse Foods in suburban Houston,  
which used to lose hundreds of shopping carts annually because 
customers would push their groceries home but weren't considerate 
enough to roll the empty carts back to the store. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, it's really trimmed down,'' said store manager Daniel  
Rivera, who added that there are a few determined shoppers who have 
dragged or carried the disabled cart home. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other anti-theft devices on the market, but they have  
proved problematic, grocers said. A fifth-wheel system designed to 
lock if the cart was raised over a curb often engaged accidentally, 
even if the cart wasn't lifted. A pay system was too cumbersome -- 
shoppers plunked down a quarter to unlock the cart and the coin was 
returned when the cart was placed back in the corral. 
</P>
<P>
	Erecting bars at a store entrance to prevent carts from going  
into the parking lot also kept out physically disabled customers, a 
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
	There are few glitches with the CAPS system, or grumbling from  
customers. During an afternoon at Apple Tree Market, most shoppers 
said they liked the added security. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocean Beach resident Judy Hurst said she used to dread going to  
the store on a big shopping day for fear there wouldn't be a cart 
available. Now, she always finds one, and delights in pushing it to 
the perimeter, just to test system. Sure enough, less than a foot 
from the stripe, the wheel locked. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nifty,'' she said.

<HEADLINE>  25 May Be Dead in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Three young men in fatigues and black  
trench coats opened fire at a suburban Denver high school Tuesday 
in what police called a suicide mission, and the sheriff said 25 
people may have been killed. Two of the suspects were found dead in 
the library. 
</P>
<P>
	Several students said the killers were gunning for minorities  
and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead suspects, believed to be former students at Columbine  
High School, had devices on them that could be bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A third young man was led away from the school in handcuffs more  
than four hours after the attack, which began at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	By early evening, FBI agents and police SWAT teams were still  
moving through the school, searching for victims and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 people were wounded at Columbine, which has 1,800  
students. Shots ricocheted off lockers as the gunmen opened fire 
with what students said were automatic weapons and set off 
explosives. One girl was shot nine times in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them  
shooting,'' said Jake Apoeaca, a 16-year-old sophomore. ``He saw us 
and then he started shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt 
threw two hand grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we 
started running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many students dived to the floors and sprinted for the exits.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went down to the ground. It was like, quick, and we were out  
of there in an instant,'' said Jason Greer, a 16-year-old 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from a second-floor  
window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by two SWAT team 
members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said 25 people may have been  
killed. Two gunmen were found dead inside the library, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Davis, a sheriff's spokesman, said possible bombs were  
found on the suspects, and a device found at one suspect's home may 
have been a homemade bomb. 
</P>

	It was not immediately known whether the others killed were  
students or teachers. 
</P>

handcuffs, but student Chris Wisher said: ``He's one of the ones 
who shot at us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Lammers, 17, was among several students who said the gunmen  
were targeting minorities and athletes. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  25 May Be Dead in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two students in black trench coats swept  
through their suburban high school with guns and explosives in a 
horrifying suicide attack Tuesday that may have left 25 people 
dead. Several students said the killers were gunning for minorities 
and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was by far the bloodiest in a string of school shootings that  
have rocked U.S. communities over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them opened his cape and had a shotgun. Finally I  
started figuring out these guys shot to kill, for no reason,'' said 
a student, Nick Claus. The gunman ``didn't say anything. When he 
looked at me, the guy's eyes were just dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen -- both juniors at Columbine High School in this  
Denver suburb -- were found dead in the school library with 
self-inflicted gunshot wounds and what appeared to be bombs around 
their bodies, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Sheriff John Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Students said the gunmen, whose names were not released,  
apparently belonged to a clique of outcasts called the ``Trench 
Coat Mafia'' who wore long black coats, boasted of owning guns and 
disliked blacks, Hispanics and football players. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said that the motive for the attack was unknown and that  
school officials had had no reports of trouble from the students. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said 25 people may have been killed, students and  
teachers alike. But by early evening, officers had yet to remove 
any bodies because of the danger of explosives and the need to 
preserve evidence. FBI agents and police SWAT teams slowly made 
their way through the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to take us some time because of how many rooms  
we have bodies in,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 23 people were hospitalized, most of them with gunshot  
wounds. One girl suffered nine shrapnel wounds. At least 11 victims 
were in critical or serious condition; one was in guarded 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack began at 11:30 a.m. The killers, wearing fatigues and  
trench coats, started firing in the parking lot and then entered 
the school. They shot as they walked into the cafeteria, then 
walked upstairs to the library and continued firing with what were 
thought to be semiautomatic weapons and a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullets ricocheted off lockers as students sprinted for the  
exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them  
shooting,'' said Jake Apoeaca, 16. ``He saw us and then he started 
shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt threw two hand 
grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we started 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Frank, an 18-year-old senior, said he saw one of the  
killers shoot someone point-blank in the back with a 2-foot gun, 
possibly a sawed-off shotgun. ``He was just casually walking,'' 
Frank said. ``He wasn't in any hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from a second-floor  
window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by two SWAT team 
members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	More than four hours after the attack, a young man was led away  
from the school in handcuffs. Davis said that the young man was 
believed to be a friend of the gunmen but did not take part in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said explosives were found in two cars in the school  
parking lot and bomb squad officers were disarming them. Also, the 
homes of the two gunmen were being searched. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, a series of school shootings around the country have  
led to demands for stricter laws, tighter security and closer 
monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed in an 
attack in Pearl, Miss., three in West Paducah, Ky., five in 
Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said: ``Perhaps now America  
will wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it could 
happen in a place like Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Lammers, 17, was among several Columbine High students who  
said the gunmen were targeting minorities and athletes at the 
1,800-student high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said the killers might have been part of a group of  
eight to 10 students known as the Trench Coat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, 16, said several members of the Trench Coat Mafia  
had a video production class and made a video about guns they had. 
He also said that several members recently bragged about getting 
new guns, and that he heard members making derogatory remarks about 
blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really dark people,'' Lammers said. ``There were a lot  
of jokes that one day they might snap or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hours after the attack, wounded victims lay inside the  
building and police were unable to get to them because they feared 
that the gunmen might still be alive and holding hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hundreds of officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school. Frantic parents were sent to an elementary 
school nearby, where they waited for word of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers hugged parents and each other and wept and they  
recalled the shootings. Some students had called their parents on 
cellular phones from inside the building to whisper that they were 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
	As TV images of the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter  
ambulances used a sports field as a landing pad, and officers in 
helmets and camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. Students 
who fled the building wept and held their hands above their heads 
while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	Three youths wearing black -- but not trench coats -- were stopped  
by police in a field near the school. State law officers said the 
three were friends of the gunmen and were being taken in for 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said a student who gave her name as Janine. ``We didn't 
think it was real and then we saw blood.'' Her voice broke with 
anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>

	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff,''  
she said. ``Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We 
saw three people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something 
blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. Nearby schools were locked 
down after the attack, with students prohibited from entering or 
leaving for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Colorado Rockies and basketball's Denver Nuggets  
postponed their Tuesday night games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Legislature has been debating a bill that would  
allow people to carry concealed weapons, and the shootings brought 
emotional reaction from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's supporters said a teacher or administrator with a  
concealed gun could have stopped the tragedy; its opponents said 
the rampage was evidence that society is already overrun with guns.

<HEADLINE> Mitchell Book Talks of Peace Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- George Mitchell remains upbeat about the  
possibility of peace in Northern Ireland despite a stalemate in the 
formation of a Protestant-Catholic government. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, who presided over the peace talks for two years, said  
Monday the important thing is people are talking. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to keep the process moving forward. Otherwise it  
becomes open to violence or disruption of the process,'' he said. 
``I think it will be many years before there is genuine 
reconciliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former senator, federal judge and peace negotiator wraps up  
a two-day swing through his native Maine today to promote a book he 
wrote about his experience as chairman of the peace talks: ``Making 
Peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He started the swing Monday at Border's book store in Bangor,  
where more than 100 people stood in line to have their books 
signed. He also made stops in Brunswick and Waterville. 
</P>
<P>
	He travels to Cleveland on Wednesday before wrapping up the week  
in New York and Washington, D.C. He said the schedule has been as 
grueling as his old Senate campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell's 188-page book opens with the final days leading up to  
the signing of the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998, the 
culmination of two years he served as chairman of the peace talks 
in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	Weary from lack of sleep, Mitchell was on pins and needles as he  
anxiously awaited word whether the last of the parties, David 
Trimble's Ulster Unionists, would sign the accord. And he wasted no 
time when he received word Trimble would accept it. Mitchell called 
a meeting 15 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
	``As majority leader of the United States Senate, I had learned  
that when you've got the votes, you vote. Delay can only hurt,'' he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, 65, admitted Monday that his first draft for editors  
at Alfred A. Knopf was deemed too detailed. At their suggestion, he 
added more about his personal sacrifices and cut the length of the 
book by a third. 
</P>
<P>
	In the final version, Mitchell recounts some painful  
experiences, including being unable to attend the funeral of his 
brother, Robbie. He also writes of the anguish he felt when his 
wife, Heather, miscarried while he was in Belfast. His wife later 
became pregnant again and gave birth to their son, Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell penned the book the old-fashioned way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wrote that book entirely in long hand on a yellow legal  
pad,'' Mitchell said. ``Most of the writing was done in August at 
Seal Harbor, where my wife and I rented a vacation home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before signing books, Mitchell held a news conference in which  
he likened the difficulty of bringing lasting peace to Northern 
Ireland to other international flashpoints. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're seeing is the same as in the Balkans and in the  
Middle East,'' Mitchell said. ``It's hard to get a peace agreement. 
It's even harder to implement a peace agreement.''

	25 May Be Dead in Colorado Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men dressed in fatigues and  
black trench coats walked into a suburban Denver high school today 
and began the bloodiest U.S. school shooting in recent years, an 
incident police are calling a ``suicide mission.'' The gunmen, who 
authorities say may have killed 25 people, were found dead in the 
library at Columbine High School. Several students said the killers 
were gunning for minorities and athletes. The gunmen -- both juniors 
at Columbine -- were found dead of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, 
with what appeared to be bombs around their bodies, a sheriff's 
spokesman said. Authorities also said explosives were found in two 
cars in the school parking lot and bomb squad officers were 
disarming them.

	Clinton: 'Wake Up' to School Violence  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, in the wake of the school  
shooting at a suburban Denver high school, called on the nation to 
``wake up'' to school violence. Out of respect for Colorado's 
grief, Clinton canceled a political trip tomorrow to Texas. He said 
a team of counselors has been mobilized and will head to Littleton, 
Colo., where the death toll -- which police estimated at 25 -- was 
still being confirmed.

	NATO Attacks Continue in Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- U.S. helicopters and troops were  
headed toward Albania tonight in a new military phase aimed at 
boosting the NATO alliance's ability to attack Yugoslav ground 
forces and stop their campaign to rid Kosovo of its ethnic Albanian 
majority. NATO launched daylight attacks today and continued them 
after dark across Yugoslavia and accused Serb forces of flushing 
out ethnic Albanians hiding in the province's hills. Yugoslav media 
reported pre-dawn attacks Wednesday in several areas of central 
Serbia, including Novi Sad and the town of Valjevo, where six 
missiles struck a factory, triggering a huge fire. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Military Pressed for Resources  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The dual military needs in both Yugoslavia and  
Iraq are putting the pinch on the U.S. military, leaving no U.S. 
aircraft carrier in the Pacific Ocean. Instead, Air Force planes 
there have gone on alert. The gap in carrier coverage for the 
Pacific could last until the fall, when the USS Constellation is to 
arrive, defense officials said. The USS Kitty Hawk that was in the 
Pacific was ordered to the Persian Gulf on April 3 to free up the 
USS Theodore Roosevelt to join the NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. 
The Roosevelt arrived in the Adriatic Sea on April 5.

	Tribes Seek Tougher Grave Law  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of Indian remains and sacred  
artifacts haven't been returned to tribes because of delays by 
museums and loopholes in a federal grave-protection law, a Senate 
committee was told today. Some 14,000 human remains out of 200,000 
identified nationally have been returned to tribes under the 1990 
law, the committee said, and many of the remains that haven't been 
returned can't be identified by tribe. But tribal leaders told the 
Senate Indian Affairs Committee the law is too narrowly written.

said today. A dozen victims have died of Japanese encephalitis and 
more than 90 most recently from a new virus named Nipah for the

<HEADLINE>  25 May Be Dead in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Three young men in fatigues and black  
trench coats opened fire at a suburban Denver high school Tuesday 
in what police called a suicide mission, and the sheriff said 25 
people may have been killed. Two of the suspects were found dead in 
the library. 
</P>
<P>
	Several students said the killers were gunning for minorities  
and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead suspects, believed to be former students at Columbine  
High School, had devices on them that could be bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	A third young man was led away from the school in handcuffs more  
than four hours after the attack, which began at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	By early evening, FBI agents and police SWAT teams were still  
moving through the school, searching for victims and explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 20 people were wounded at Columbine, which has 1,800  
students. Shots ricocheted off lockers as the gunmen opened fire 
with what students said were automatic weapons and set off 
explosives. One girl was shot nine times in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them  
shooting,'' said Jake Apoeaca, a 16-year-old sophomore. ``He saw us 
and then he started shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt 
threw two hand grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we 
started running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many students dived to the floors and sprinted for the exits.  
</P>
<P>
	``I went down to the ground. It was like, quick, and we were out  
of there in an instant,'' said Jason Greer, a 16-year-old 
sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from a second-floor  
window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by two SWAT team 
members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	Jefferson County Sheriff John Stone said 25 people may have been  
killed. Two gunmen were found dead inside the library, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Davis, a sheriff's spokesman, said possible bombs were  
found on the suspects, and a device found at one suspect's home may 
have been a homemade bomb. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known whether the others killed were  
students or teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not comment on the student led from the school in  
handcuffs, but student Chris Wisher said: ``He's one of the ones 
who shot at us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Lammers, 17, was among several students who said the gunmen  
were targeting minorities and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	For hours after the attack, wounded victims lay inside the  
building and police were unable to get to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hundreds of officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school. Frantic parents were sent to a nearby 
elementary school, where they searched for word of their children. 
Some students had called their parents on cellular phones from 
inside the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers hugged parents and each other and wept and they  
recalled the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	As TV images of the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter  
ambulances used a sports field as a landing pad, and officers in 
helmets and camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. Students 
who fled the building wept and held their hands above their heads 
while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight to 10 students in the school wear black trench coats every  
day and are known as the ``Trench Coat Mafia.'' But it was not 
immediately clear whether any of them were involved in the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are jerks,'' Greer said. ``They are really strange, but  
I've never seen them do anything violent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three youths wearing black -- but not trench coats -- were stopped  
by police in a field near the school. The Colorado Bureau of 
Investigation said the three were friends of the gunmen who were

<HEADLINE> Bono Blood Sample To Be Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIO, Calif. (AP) -- A judge ordered a coroner to provide a  
blood sample of Sonny Bono to determine whether he was the father

	The ruling Monday by a Riverside County court requires the

<HEADLINE>  25 May Be Dead in School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two students in black trench coats swept  
through their suburban high school with guns and explosives in a 
horrifying suicide attack Tuesday that may have left 25 people 
dead. Several students said the killers were gunning for minorities 
and athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	It was by far the bloodiest in a string of school shootings that  
have rocked U.S. communities over the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of them opened his cape and had a shotgun. Finally I  
started figuring out these guys shot to kill, for no reason,'' said 
a student, Nick Claus. The gunman ``didn't say anything. When he 
looked at me, the guy's eyes were just dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gunmen -- both juniors at Columbine High School in this  
Denver suburb -- were found dead in the school library with 
self-inflicted gunshot wounds and what appeared to be bombs around 
their bodies, sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears to be a suicide mission,'' Sheriff John Stone said.  
</P>
<P>
	Students said the gunmen, whose names were not released,  
apparently belonged to a clique of outcasts called the ``Trench 
Coat Mafia'' who wore long black coats, boasted of owning guns and 
disliked blacks, Hispanics and football players. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said that the motive for the attack was unknown and that  
school officials had had no reports of trouble from the students. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff said 25 people may have been killed, students and  
teachers alike. But by early evening, officers had yet to remove 
any bodies because of the danger of explosives and the need to 
preserve evidence. FBI agents and police SWAT teams slowly made 
their way through the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just going to take us some time because of how many rooms  
we have bodies in,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 23 people were hospitalized, most of them with gunshot  
wounds. One girl suffered nine shrapnel wounds. At least 11 victims 
were in critical or serious condition; one was in guarded 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack began at 11:30 a.m. The killers, wearing fatigues and  
trench coats, started firing in the parking lot and then entered 
the school. They shot as they walked into the cafeteria, then 
walked upstairs to the library and continued firing with what were 
thought to be semiautomatic weapons and a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullets ricocheted off lockers as students sprinted for the  
exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first we thought it was fireworks, then we saw them  
shooting,'' said Jake Apoeaca, 16. ``He saw us and then he started 
shooting at us. Then a guy in a white T-shirt threw two hand 
grenades on the roof. We hit the ground and then we started 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wade Frank, an 18-year-old senior, said he saw one of the  
killers shoot someone point-blank in the back with a 2-foot gun, 
possibly a sawed-off shotgun. ``He was just casually walking,'' 
Frank said. ``He wasn't in any hurry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of students hid in classrooms before escaping with the  
help of police in an armored car. Others were trapped for hours 
while SWAT teams searched for the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, a bloodied young man dangled from a second-floor  
window, his right arm limp, and was helped down by two SWAT team 
members. His condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
	More than four hours after the attack, a young man was led away  
from the school in handcuffs. Davis said that the young man was 
believed to be a friend of the gunmen but did not take part in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said explosives were found in two cars in the school  
parking lot and bomb squad officers were disarming them. Also, the 
homes of the two gunmen were being searched. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, a series of school shootings around the country have  
led to demands for stricter laws, tighter security and closer 
monitoring of troubled students. Two people were killed in an 
attack in Pearl, Miss., three in West Paducah, Ky., five in 
Jonesboro, Ark., and two in Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton said: ``Perhaps now America  
will wake up to the dimensions of this challenge, if it could 
happen in a place like Littleton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Lammers, 17, was among several Columbine High students who  
said the gunmen were targeting minorities and athletes at the 
1,800-student high school. 
</P>
<P>
	Students said the killers might have been part of a group of  
eight to 10 students known as the Trench Coat Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, 16, said several members of the Trench Coat Mafia  
had a video production class and made a video about guns they had. 
He also said that several members recently bragged about getting 
new guns, and that he heard members making derogatory remarks about 
blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really dark people,'' Lammers said. ``There were a lot  
of jokes that one day they might snap or something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For hours after the attack, wounded victims lay inside the  
building and police were unable to get to them because they feared 
that the gunmen might still be alive and holding hostages. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hundreds of officers from throughout the Denver area  
surrounded the school. Frantic parents were sent to an elementary 
school nearby, where they waited for word of their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers hugged parents and each other and wept and they  
recalled the shootings. Some students had called their parents on 
cellular phones from inside the building to whisper that they were 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
	As TV images of the scene were broadcast nationwide, helicopter  
ambulances used a sports field as a landing pad, and officers in 
helmets and camouflage gear took cover behind squad cars. Students 
who fled the building wept and held their hands above their heads 
while police frisked them. 
</P>
<P>
	Three youths wearing black -- but not trench coats -- were stopped  
by police in a field near the school. State law officers said the 
three were friends of the gunmen and were being taken in for 
questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said a student who gave her name as Janine. ``We didn't 
think it was real and then we saw blood.'' Her voice broke with 
anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was two young men, wearing black trench coats.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff,''  
she said. ``Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We 
saw three people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something 
blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. Nearby schools were locked 
down after the attack, with students prohibited from entering or 
leaving for hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's Colorado Rockies and basketball's Denver Nuggets  
postponed their Tuesday night games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colorado Legislature has been debating a bill that would  
allow people to carry concealed weapons, and the shootings brought 
emotional reaction from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's supporters said a teacher or administrator with a  
concealed gun could have stopped the tragedy; its opponents said 
the rampage was evidence that society is already overrun with guns.

<HEADLINE> Straw Reportedly Passes Drug Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry's future depends on the  
results of his latest drug tests, due to be received by the 
commissioner's office sometime this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees outfielder came through the first test OK,  
according to a published report today. 
</P>
<P>
	The test was given last week, 24 hours before he was arrested in  
Tampa, Fla., for cocaine possession and solicitation. It indicated 
``there was no problem,'' The Record of Hackensack, N.J., reported, 
quoting sources said to be familiar with Strawberry's legal 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the results revealed traces of a drug, Strawberry faced at  
least a six-month ban from baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was tested again during a weekend visit to New York  
when he met with officials of the players association, the 
commissioner's office and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Those close to Strawberry were confident that the latest tests  
will be fine as well, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball had been testing the outfielder twice a week as part of  
the aftercare program that followed his 60-day suspension in 1995 
for a positive test for cocaine use. Strawberry has not tested 
positive for illegal drugs since then, the Yankees said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, 37, was at the Yankees' training camp as part of its  
extended spring training program. He was still rehabilitating from 
colon cancer surgery in October. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of right now, he is not resuming workouts,'' Cashman said  
Monday. ``From the club's perspective, he's got his legal issues 
and personal issues to deal with. It's best for him at this 
particular moment to deal with that. Baseball is second right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear if the Yankees have stopped paying Strawberry, who  
is not on their 40-man roster. He has a minor league contract and a 
consulting deal with the team, which together total $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has been advancing money to Strawberry and may have  
stopped those advances, one of the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	No arraignment date has been set for Strawberry, but when he is  
formally charged, he will plead innocent, his attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Entrapment is a pretty wide avenue,'' attorney Joseph  
Ficarrota told The Record from his office in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has said he as only joking with the female undercover  
officer posing as a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Ficarrota will argue that the charges should be dropped since no  
money changed hands between Strawberry and the woman, Strawberry 
was arrested after driving beyond the motel where the woman told 
him to meet here, and there was no tape recording of the 
conversation between the outfielder and the officer. 
</P>
<P>
	If Ficarrota succeeds in getting the solicitation charge  
dropped, he will argue there was no probable cause for the 
subsequent search which police said produced three-tenths of a gram 
of cocaine inside a rolled up $20 bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Without probable cause, the search would be illegal, Ficarrota  
told the newspaper, and its results inadmissable.

<HEADLINE> Escaped Suspect Turns Himself In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A man whose testimony helped put two  
innocent men in prison for murder turned himself in Tuesday, one 
week from the day he escaped from a work detail after learning he 
was now a suspect in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Gore walked away from a prison work crew April 14, one day  
before the two men he helped put behind bars were released. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, Ron Williamson, 46, and Dennis Fritz, 49, were cleared  
after DNA evidence showed they were not the men who strangled and 
assaulted a 21-year-old woman, a crime for which they were 
convicted in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The men spent 12 years in prison. Williamson was on death row;  
Fritz was sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, 38, returned to the Lexington Correctional Center on  
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Gore is the prime suspect in a reopened  
investigation into the crime. No charges have been filed against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	DNA results were compared to a databank of DNA samples from  
state inmates, and the results matched a DNA profile of Gore, who 
was serving time for burglary, kidnapping and shooting with intent 
to injure.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Abortion Protests Hit Buffalo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Demonstrators on both sides of the abortion  
issue shouted at each other in confrontation outside the clinic 
where Dr. Barnett Slepian worked before a sniper shot him to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The confrontation came on the third day of a planned week-long  
series of demonstrations organized by Operation Save America to 
fight abortion, teen sex and child pornography. 
</P>
<P>
	About three dozen abortion opponents began their demonstration  
before 7 a.m. outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices, where a sign on 
the front door read ``Our clinic remains open in honor of Dr. 
Slepian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Slepian, an abortion provider and frequent target of protests,  
was shot in October while in his suburban home. Authorities are 
searching for an anti-abortion activist for questioning and a 
prosecutor said today he expects the case to go to a grand jury 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion opponents, shouting and carrying signs with photos  
of aborted fetuses, were faced by more than 100 supporters of 
abortion rights who chanted their own slogans. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-abortion activists obeyed a court-ordered 60-foot  
buffer zone in front of the clinic. About 100 police officers were 
on hand to keep the two sides apart; there were no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Flip Benham, national director of Operation Rescue,  
declared a partial victory in the anti-abortion campaign, saying he 
believes all of the attention brought by Operation Save America has 
kept women from making appointments for abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Buffalo GYN Womenservices spokeswoman Susan Ward said today  
the demonstrations haven't ``affected us in any way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clinic is the only public clinic providing abortions in the  
city, although the procedure also is available from some private 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Erie County District Attorney Frank Clark said he expects to  
present the Slepian homicide case to a grand jury on Monday. The 
killing also is being investigated by federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Sending a case to a grand jury usually suggests prosecutors  
believe they have enough evidence to support an indictment, but 
authorities have not publicly identified a suspect on the killing. 
Abortion opponent James Kopp, 44, is being sought as a material 
witness.

<HEADLINE> Ventriloquist Wences Dies at 103 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Senor Wences, the master ventriloquist who  
delighted ``Ed Sullivan Show'' audiences by bantering in a comic 
Spanish accent with his puppet-in-a-box Pedro (``S'OK?'' 
``S'awright!'') and his falsetto-voiced hand puppet Johnny, died 
Tuesday at 103. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spanish-born Wences, whose real name was Wenceslao Moreno,  
died at his home in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Golden Age of television in the 1950s and '60s,  
Wences bickered and bantered with his puppets while he drank, 
smoked and juggled. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his puppets was gravelly-voiced Pedro, who consisted only  
of a head in a box. Pedro was born out of necessity when Wences' 
ventriloquist's dummy was damaged and only the head was spared. 
</P>
<P>
	Another puppet was Johnny, whose comeback line was: ``Deefeecult  
for you, easy for me.'' Wences created Johnny by scrunching up his 
fist, drawing a mouth where thumb and index finger met, and draping 
a blond wig over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Wences would talk to his puppets with his face right in theirs,  
as if daring the audience to watch his lips, which, of course, 
never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro's voice would become clearer as the door to his box  
opened, and muffled as it closed. Audiences forgot the sound was 
really coming from outside the box. 
</P>
<P>
	Wences would stuff a hankie in Johnny's mouth and have the  
puppet speak with a muffled voice while he himself smoked a 
cigarette. Then he would give Johnny a drag, and the puppet -- that 
is, Wences' hand -- would somehow emit perfect smoke rings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of us were in awe of Wences,'' ventriloquist Jimmy Nelson  
once said. ``He could get laughs just by saying, `S'awright!' And I 
still don't know how he got those smoke rings out of Johnny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no jokes, just what one writer has described as  
``bizarre, farcical, Spanish-accented patter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing he taught me was it's not about the joke,''  
said twentysomething ventriloquist Michele LaFong, who became 
friends with Wences and inherited his original Pedro and Johnny 
puppets. ``Even though you know what's coming, you laugh anyway. 
That's the difference between someone who relies on a punch line or 
someone who's just plain funny.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In between his many Sullivan show appearances, he entertained  
four presidents, toured with Dean Martin &AMP; Jerry Lewis, did a 
Broadway show with Danny Kaye and played every casino in Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a precise, economical act: 19 minutes with a one-minute  
encore. He would ask the promoter for only a card table and a glass 
of water. 
</P>
<P>
	He continued touring into his early 90s.  
</P>
<P>
	Wences was born in Penarada, Spain, and discovered his gift for  
mimicry amusing his classmates in grade school. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1934, when he came to the United States, Wences was  
conventional -- ``another ventriloquist with a dummy,'' as he put 
it. But two years later, en route to Chicago, his act was 
transformed when his dummy, Pedro, was crushed in a baggage car 
accident. Wences bought a box, stuck the head inside, and -- on 
stage that day -- inquired if he was OK. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro replied: ``S'awright!''  
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service and burial will be held in Spain this  
weekend.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Addresses Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton called for changes  
in the nation's medical insurance system on Tuesday at the same 
time she acknowledged her failed 1993 effort to reform health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to try that again, rest assured,'' she said in a  
speech at Hofstra University, adding: ``I come from the school of 
smaller steps now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spoke on day two of her road trip to New York,  
where she is considering running for the U.S. Senate seat of Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	She called for a patient's bill of rights to force health  
insurers to provide access to specialists; enhanced privacy 
regarding medical records; tax breaks to encourage small businesses 
to provide health insurance for employees; and support for 
President Clinton's proposal to shore up Medicare with part of the 
federal budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Clinton said nothing about her political plans,  
several others were talkative on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state's Democratic Party, said  
the first lady is giving her potential candidacy ``very serious 
consideration ... She continues to look like a candidate, sound 
like a candidate while doing the valid work of a first lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton began Tuesday at the Village Elementary School in  
Syosset, where she watched third-graders observing tiny live frogs 
swimming in tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	She laughed when she was told that another first lady -- Eleanor  
Roosevelt -- visited the Long Island school 41 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm used to following Mrs. Roosevelt,'' she said. ``I don't  
know that I've ever been anywhere in the world, literally, that she 
hadn't been first.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Proposes Surplus Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans brought legislation to the Senate  
floor Tuesday that would make it difficult to spend anticipated 
Social Security surpluses on anything but shoring up the retirement 
program or reducing the national debt. The White House threatened 
to veto the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders say strict new rules are needed to stop  
lawmakers from spending government surpluses that come from Social 
Security's payroll taxes, as opposed to income taxes, in coming 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal here is to lock this money up,'' said Senate Majority  
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``We want to make it as difficult as 
possible to breach that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate began debating the proposed restrictions Tuesday, but  
objections from Democrats -- including a veto threat from the 
Clinton administration -- are expected to hold up any votes until at 
least later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's advisers at the White House Office of  
Management and Budget said in a statement Tuesday that the GOP 
measure would too tightly restrict the government's day-to-day cash 
flow, especially in the event of ``any unanticipated slowdown in 
the economy.'' Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin first raised that 
concern last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said the  
Republican measure ``doesn't commit a nickel'' of income tax 
surpluses that Democrats want for Medicare, the health insurance 
program for the elderly. Republicans instead want expected income 
tax surpluses for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the administration's statement said ``the  
legislation is flawed because it ... fails to ensure that the 
surplus is used to protect the payment of benefits to Social 
Security beneficiaries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to try to give Social Security a tangible claim on  
the economic growth that would be expected to result from a lower 
national debt: IOUs giving the program a claim on income-tax 
dollars after baby boomers retire. He also has called for 
government investment of some of Social Security's cash reserves in 
the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Clinton's IOUs would be just paper promises that  
would have to be made good by taxpayers or borrowing in the future, 
and the stock market investments would bring private financial 
markets under undue government influence. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders have yet to endorse any specific alternative for  
using the surpluses to benefit Social Security, but in both the 
House and Senate they are encouraging the development of plans by 
other influential Republican lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, is close to unveiling one such plan that would use the 
Social Security tax surpluses to finance new personal accounts 
workers could invest in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Those familiar with Archer's plan say the investment returns  
workers earned would be substituted, on an individual basis, for 
traditional Social Security benefits, probably at something close 
to a dollar-for-dollar exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican Sens. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire and Rick  
Santorum of Pennsylvania, whom Lott has picked to head a GOP task 
force, are collaborating with moderate Democrats on a plan 
combining similar personal accounts with upfront trimming of Social 
Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Unless Democrats and Republicans can resolve their considerable  
differences and enact Social Security changes, however, the 
Republican bill that reached the Senate floor Tuesday would wall 
off Social Security surpluses for the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would require that the surpluses be used to pay off  
the government's debt to private bondholders. To ensure that 
happens, it would periodically lower the statutory limit on that 
public debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Breaching the declining debt limit would require agreement by 60  
senators -- more than a majority. The main exception would be for 
money used to enact Social Security reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Other exceptions would include national defense emergencies --  
such as the current conflict in Yugoslavia -- and a recession that 
held economic growth to less than 1 percent for at least six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders say they will bring similar legislation  
to the floor soon. A nonbinding version passed Congress as part of 
the GOP budget resolution last week, but actually putting the new 
spending restrictions into effect would require a change in law and 
Clinton's signature.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed generally lower  
Tuesday on profit-taking, but the key index in Tokyo rebounded in a 
late rally triggered by foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 22.90  
points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 16,697.11. On Monday, the 
index lost 177.37 points, or 1.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices recouped early losses as foreign and individual investors  
stayed bullish on the Japanese market. A tumble in hi-tech issues, 
triggered by a sell-off of technology shares in New York, had kept 
Tokyo stocks lower for most of the session. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index lost  
138.43 points Monday, falling to 2,345.61, for its second-steepest 
drop ever. The Dow Jones industrial average fell after five 
straight sessions of record highs, slipping 53.36 points, or 0.5 
percent, to 10,440.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.04 yen in the late  
afternoon, down 0.12 yen from late Monday in Tokyo but above its 
late New York level of 117.58 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong slumped as investors took profits  
following three straight sessions of sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 356.66 points, or 2.8 percent, closing at 
12,409.78. On Monday, the index had gained 276.14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The profit-taking was expected after the index rose nearly 8  
percent over the past three sessions, brokers said. 
</P>
<P>
	They said investors largely discounted a government land auction  
on Tuesday, which fetched relatively good prices. The land auction 
was the first since the Hong Kong government froze land sales nine 
months ago following a plunge in property prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares also plunged on profit-taking, with the main  
index falling more than 4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said Monday's explosion at the Istiqlal Grand Mosque in  
Jakarta, following months of religious violence between Muslims and 
Christians in parts of Indonesia, made investors jittery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 4.3 percent,  
or 22.177 points, to 485.970 points. On Monday, the index had 
surged 6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares prices closed mostly lower on profit-taking.  
The Straits Times Index fell 1.8 percent, or 32.83 points, to 
1,809.48. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed little changed. The market's key  
Weighted Stock Price rose 4.56 points, or 0.1 percent, to 7,627.74. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower as the local  
market took a breather after four straight session gains. The 
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 20.77 points, or 0.9 percent, to 
2,192.04. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Profit-taking took some steam out of Philippine shares,  
but advances made by selected blue-chip stocks pushed up the main 
index for a 13th straight day. The Philippine Stock Exchange index 
of 30 selected companies rose 2.67 points, or 0.1 percent, to 
2,358.65. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian shares closed lower, ending a run of record  
finishes as investors sold blue chips. The All Ordinaries Index 
closed at 3,090.1, down 23.00 points, or 0.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher in reaction to plans by  
heavily indebted Daewoo Group to sell off its shipbuilding and 
other key businesses. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 
3.84 points, or 0.5 percent, to 770.43. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian shares closed mixed. The benchmark  
Composite Index, which tracks 100 blue-chip stocks, rose 6.11 
points or 0.99 percent, to 621.53. 
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Thai stock prices closed lower following a two-day  
rally. The SET Index fell 6.08 points, or 1.5 percent, to 406.11.

<HEADLINE> Two Gunmen Open Fire in Colo. H.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men wearing masks and dressed  
in long, black trench coats opened fire in a suburban high school 
today, scattering students as gunshots ricocheted off lockers, 
witnesses said. At least seven people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also reports of explosions in Columbine High School,  
which was ringed by ambulances and more than 100 police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two hours after the 11:30 a.m. shooting, SWAT team  
members entered the building and 15 to 20 students fled. There was 
no confirmation that the gunmen were still inside, but police said 
some students had been hiding in a choir room. 
</P>
<P>
	Television images, broadcast nationwide, showed police cars and  
ambulances at a staging area near the school, and helmeted officers 
in camouflage gear. At least one person was seen being carried to 
an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's  
Department, said ``we do have injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now all I've got is there have been several shots fired,  
some explosions heard and some fire in the school,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses said there were two gunmen and the shootings took  
place around the school, including the cafeteria and library. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard the gunshots and we were running,'' said Kaley Boyle,  
a junior at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said a student who gave her name as Janine. ``We didn't 
think it was real and then we saw blood.'' Her voice broke with 
anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was two young men, wearing black trench coats.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff. ...  
Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We saw three 
people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Sapin, another student, also said the gunmen were all in  
black, in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hid behind the school in the bushes and I saw them. When  
they started walking down the hallway, I ran and I ran and I hid in 
the bushes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight to 10 students in the school wear black trench coats every  
day, students said. Josh Nielsen said they are known as the 
``Trench Coat Mafia.'' Said another classmate, Jason Greer, ``They 
are jerks. They are really strange, but I've never seen them do 
anything violent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the adjacent Clement Park, students were shaking and crying  
as parents wandered about, looking for their children. Police 
helicopters whirled overhead and hundreds of police officers 
patrolled in the area of the school and park. 
</P>
<P>
	Kari Mackecher, spokesman for HealthOne, which runs Swedish  
Hospital, said four students were taken there, all in serious 
condition. One girl had nine gunshot wounds to the chest, a second 
girl had one gunshot wound to the chest, one boy had one gunshot 
wound in the back, and another youth had three gunshot wounds in 
the chest and arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're in serious condition and all were conscious when they  
came in,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fifth person was en route, but there was no information  
available. 
</P>
<P>
	At Denver Health Medical Center, a boy and a girl were being  
treated for gunshot wounds, said spokeswoman Stephanie Denning. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions of the injured were not known.  
</P>
<P>
	Denver and Littleton police, and Jefferson County and Arapahoe  
sheriff's deputies were helping on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. It opened in 1973 and has 
an enrollment of about 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of school shootings since 1997 shocked the nation and  
led to calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of troubled 
students. Two were killed at a school in Pearl, Miss., three at 
West Paducah, Ky., five at Jonesboro, Ark., and two at a school in 
Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE> `60 Minutes' Does Well in Ratings / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nielsen Media Research had good news for ``60  
Minutes'' this week, but not everybody at CBS shared in the joy. 
</P>
<P>
	The venerable newsmagazine tied with ``Frasier'' as the  
top-rated prime-time show last week, Nielsen said Tuesday. It was 
the second time this season ``60 Minutes'' has topped the ratings, 
the first time that has happened since 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the network's decision to send ``CBS Evening News''  
anchor Dan Rather to report from Belgrade last week failed to pay 
off in the ratings. ABC anchor Peter Jennings and NBC anchor Tom 
Brokaw stayed in New York while Brokaw traveled. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS continued its evening news ratings slump, finishing well  
behind ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and the ``NBC Nightly News.'' 
CBS saw a 2 percent increase in its news viewership over the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jennings-led ABC broadcast finished with a 7.6 rating and 17  
share, NBC had a 7.3 rating and 16 share and CBS was at 6.4 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Reruns dominated the prime-time landscape last week and,  
typically, many TV viewers went elsewhere. CBS won the week with an 
8.3 rating and 14 share, NBC had a 7.7 rating and 13 share, ABC was 
at 6.8 and 12 and Fox was at 6.0 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Two specials pleased executives at ABC and UPN. ``David Blaine:  
Magic Man,'' the one-hour ABC show about the magician, finished 
tied for 15th in the week's ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scared Straight! 20 Years Later,'' UPN's update of a memorable  
20-year-old documentary about prison inmates trying to convince 
delinquent youth to stay away from crime, was the network's 
highest-rated Thursday night telecast ever. 
</P>
<P>
	It enabled UPN, with its 2.2 rating and 4 share for the week, to  
pull closer than usual to the WB, which had a 2.7 rating and 5 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 12-18, the top 10 shows, their networks  
and ratings were: ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 12.7; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 
12.7; ``Friends,'' NBC, 12.0; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Having Our Say,'' 
CBS, 11.8; ``ER,'' NBC, 11.6; ``Just Shoot Me'' special, NBC, 11.4; 
``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC, 11.3; ``Touched By an Angel,'' CBS, 11.2; 
``Law and Order,'' NBC, 10.4; ``Dateline NBC-Monday,'' NBC, 10.0; 
``The Practice,'' ABC, 10.0.

<HEADLINE> Amgen Profits Soar 31 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Amgen's first-quarter earnings soared 31  
percent, easily surpassing Wall Street estimates, on the strength 
of the biotechnology firm's Epogen anemia-fighting drug. 
</P>
<P>
	Amgen stock rose 13 percent Tuesday even before the profit  
report was released after the close of trading on the Nasdaq stock 
market. Shares of Amgen rose $8.06 to $69 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned $247 million, or 46 cents per share, up from  
$187 million, or 35 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
Results beat Wall Street estimates by 2 cents, according to First 
Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose 21 percent to $688 million from $567 million.  
</P>
<P>
	Epogen, Amgen's top product that treats anemia in dialysis  
patients, posted a 30 percent increase in sales to $395 million to 
$304 million. Sales of Neupogen, which stimulates the growth of 
white blood cells in cancer patients, rose 10 percent to $287 
million from $261 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it has made progress in testing its  
next-generation anemia drug called NESP. Amgen expect to start 
advanced human testing of the drug in dialysis patients by the end 
of the year.

<HEADLINE>  U.N. Declares Macedonia Camps Full </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- The U.N. refugee agency declared its  
camps in Macedonia full beyond capacity Tuesday, leaving 2,000 to 
3,000 new arrivals from Kosovo stuck in a border no man's land with 
no food, water or blankets. 
</P>
<P>
	While the exhausted refugees faced a second night of driving  
wind and rain, those fortunate enough to cross the border faced new 
harassment in Macedonia, which has reluctantly taken in the refugee 
throngs. 
</P>
<P>
	With its largest camp packed with 25,000 refugees, the U.N. High  
Commissioner for Refugees was forced to put recent arrivals outside 
the enclave's fence because local farmers would not sell or lease 
land to expand the Brazda camp. That leaves those on its fringes 
vulnerable to raids by a local population resentful of the influx 
of ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonian civilians come nightly to the exposed tents, throwing  
stones, shining flashlights into the tents and shouting, while the 
exiles cower inside, the Kosovo Albanians said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is there no place where we are safe?'' asked one, Adem  
Muruglica. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 2,000-3,000 refugees reportedly staggered over a  
mountain crossing, overwhelming a remote hamlet of 60 houses called 
Milana, the U.N. refugee agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both groups of refugees said thousands more were behind them,  
driven out by Serb purges of ethnic Albanian communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation was different in Albania, where borders with  
Kosovo were open Tuesday, but only a few refugees crossed to safety 
-- apparently blocked by Serb forces or fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Already concerned about the virtual halt to refugee crossings  
into Albania, aid workers also worried about the fate of a reported 
15-mile-long convoy of refugees seen coming south from the Kosovo 
capital of Pristina on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy -- estimated to include 9,000-16,000 people --  
disappeared, according to other refugees' accounts to aid workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something must have happened to those people,'' said Kris  
Janowski, UNHCR spokesman in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. agency estimated Tuesday that no more than 500,000 to  
800,000 people remain in Kosovo, of a prewar total of 2 million, 
most of them ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Macedonia gave aid workers permission to build one new camp near  
the Lojane border crossing in Macedonia that could take up to 
5,000, but refused permission for two others. 
</P>
<P>
	When new arrivals backed up at the Lojane border crossing, 15  
miles north of Skopje, the Macedonian government agreed to allow in 
a few hundred that the UNHCR said it could squeeze into an existing 
camp, Redmond said. 
</P>
<P>
	But twilight found all the refugees still in no man's land --  
raising fears of a recurrence of a border closing early in the 
refugee crisis, when dozens died after days trapped in the border 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR chiefs were negotiating with Macedonian leaders to find  
new places for the arrivals. To relieve some pressure on the camps, 
the U.N. refugee agency was expanding refugee airlifts to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're scrambling now to take these people -- we dearly want to  
get them across,'' UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said.

<HEADLINE> Celtics' Battie Faces Assault Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Tony Battie of the Celtics is facing charges of  
dragging a police officer behind his car after the officer told him 
to move it. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie's arraignment was postponed to Wednesday in Boston  
Municipal Court as the court grappled with a busy schedule 
following the Patriots' Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie was arrested around 2:20 a.m. Saturday in front of the  
Cosmopolitan Club, Boston police spokeswoman Sgt. Detective Margot 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said he was asked several times by an officer to move his  
car, but Battie refused. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie also was said to have refused the officer's request for  
proper identification and tried to drive off when the officer 
attempted to arrest him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer's arm was caught in the driver's window, Hill said,  
and the officer was forced to pull out his service revolver before 
Battie stopped the car. 
</P>
<P>
	Battie faces a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous  
weapon (the car), and a charge of refusing to identify himself to 
an officer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Celtics general manager Chris Wallace would not comment on the  
incident. Battie scored four points in Boston's 120-104 loss to 
Indiana.

<HEADLINE>  Mrs. Clinton Addresses Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton called for changes  
in the nation's medical insurance system on Tuesday at the same 
time she acknowledged her failed 1993 effort to reform health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to try that again, rest assured,'' she said in a  
speech at Hofstra University, adding: ``I come from the school of 
smaller steps now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton spoke on day two of her road trip to New York,  
where she is considering running for the U.S. Senate seat of Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	She called for a patient's bill of rights to force health  
insurers to provide access to specialists; enhanced privacy 
regarding medical records; tax breaks to encourage small businesses 
to provide health insurance for employees; and support for 
President Clinton's proposal to shore up Medicare with part of the 
federal budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mrs. Clinton said nothing about her political plans,  
several others were talkative on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state's Democratic Party, said  
the first lady is giving her potential candidacy ``very serious 
consideration ... She continues to look like a candidate, sound 
like a candidate while doing the valid work of a first lady.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton began Tuesday at the Village Elementary School in  
Syosset, where she watched third-graders observing tiny live frogs 
swimming in tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	She laughed when she was told that another first lady -- Eleanor  
Roosevelt -- visited the Long Island school 41 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm used to following Mrs. Roosevelt,'' she said. ``I don't  
know that I've ever been anywhere in the world, literally, that she 
hadn't been first.''

<HEADLINE> Waitress Must Share $10M Lottery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- A former Waffle House waitress who won a $10  
million jackpot after being given a lottery ticket as a tip was 
ordered Tuesday to share the money with four co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury took 45 minutes to decide against Tonda Dickerson, 28,  
who denied that she had agreed to split any winnings. Her lawyer 
described the co-workers as rats coming out of the woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
	The four co-workers had also received lottery tickets as tips  
and testified that they and Mrs. Dickerson had a share-the-wealth 
plan. A couple who regularly dine at the Waffle House in Grand Bay 
testified that Mrs. Dickerson told them of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson, who had turned down a settlement offer that  
would have given her $3 million of the Florida jackpot, left court 
without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Her former co-workers were jubilant.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a 5-year-old girl and she's going to get a new  
collection of toys,'' said Jackie Fairley, 21. ``I want a new 
wardrobe and a new car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A beaming Sandra Deno, 45, said: ``I might work two days a week.  
I don't really have any hard feelings toward Tonda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Robert Kendall said he will decide how the money will be  
divided after consulting with attorneys and Florida lottery 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson's attorney, Dwight Reid, said he expects the five  
will share equally. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dickerson was given the lottery ticket on March 7 by a  
breakfast regular at the Waffle House, Edward Seward Jr., who said 
he wanted only a new pickup truck if the ticket won. The co-workers 
all testified that Seward regularly gave them lottery tickets.

<HEADLINE> Barbour Lobbies for Medicare Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Republicans wanted to squeeze savings out  
of Medicare in 1995, party chairman Haley Barbour was a leading 
planner and pitchman. Now a lobbyist for the nursing home industry, 
Barbour wants to boost Medicare spending, saying it is perilously 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour says he still thinks the $200 billion-a-year health-care  
program for the elderly and disabled must be buttressed for the 
retirement of baby boomers. He says he is merely helping companies 
hurt by lower Medicare reimbursements than envisioned in the 1997 
balanced-budget deal between President Clinton and Congress, which 
sought five-year Medicare savings of $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't find anything inconsistent with that,'' he said in an  
interview recently. Had the budget deal proposed the savings that 
have materialized, ``It would never have passed Congress,'' he 
said. ``Nobody would have voted for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some, however, contrast Barbour's insistence that nursing homes  
are getting $1.5 billion a year less than expected with his earlier 
claims that Medicare spending must be reined to keep it afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour was a vocal defender of the original GOP plan that  
Congress approved in 1995 and Clinton vetoed, which exceeded the 
budget deal's savings. It would have extracted $270 billion in 
savings from Medicare over seven years to help finance tax cuts and 
balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to say it's relatively common where you find people  
in public life reverse a position. Coin is king,'' said Bill Hogan, 
director of investigative projects for the Center for Public 
Integrity, a private group often critical of lobbying practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing undisputed figures that Medicare spending has temporarily  
slowed, Barbour and executives of the skilled nursing facility 
companies he represents say patient care is threatened. The 
industry, which cares for 1.5 million of the sickest nursing home 
residents, recently has endured layoffs, operating losses and 
plummeting stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survival of our business is at stake,'' said Kirill  
Goncharenko, spokesman for Mariner Post-Acute Network, one of the 
biggest nursing home companies. He says Barbour ``knows how to 
handle difficult and complex issues in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour says the culprit is federal Health Care Financing  
Administration rules that have squeezed more savings from the 
system than lawmakers intended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're underspending what the balanced-budget agreement called  
for by big dollars, and that is more than the system can stand,'' 
Barbour says. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the problem is less dire and has other causes, too.  
These include reduced medical inflation, a natural slowdown after 
unusually fast nursing home growth and a federal crackdown on 
Medicare fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully premature to say a giveback is necessary,'' said  
Marilyn Moon, an analyst for the liberal-leaning Urban Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hash, deputy HCFA director, said the agency will  
``continue to monitor'' its regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour's effort seems like a long-shot. With lawmakers eager to  
cut taxes or increase domestic spending, GOP aides say there 
probably won't be anything for nursing-home operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership has shown no interest in reopening the balanced  
budget agreement of 1997,'' said John Czwartacki, spokesman for 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour is trying anyway, using contacts from his four years as  
Republican National Committee chief and before that as political 
adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., also now a lobbyist, is working  
the Democrats. Fazio, who was one of the House Democrats' leaders, 
voted for the 1997 budget deal but says things have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare needs to be reformed but adequately funded, and I  
find that totally consistent with what I'm doing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As party chairman, Barbour was a fixture at Republican strategy  
sessions as the plan moved through Congress and a frequent guest on 
television shows. Republicans say he helped devise their strategy 
of describing their goal as saving Medicare from insolvency, then 
projected for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after leaving the RNC, the 51-year-old Mississippian  
is a partner in Barbour, Griffith and Rogers, one of the capital's 
top lobbying shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm reported earning $7.3 million last year, according to  
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks 
political spending. Its list of 35 clients from 1998 includes 
BellSouth Corp., Philip Morris and the Swiss government.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The parents of a girl killed when she  
caught the drawstring of her jacket on a school bus handrail have 
settled their $30 million lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrea Chen, 14, was getting off her school bus on Feb. 8, 1996,  
when one end of the drawstring around the bottom of her parka 
slipped between the handrail and the wall of the stairway leading 
down from the bus. 
</P>
<P>
	Though regulations say a school bus cannot leave until departing  
children are 15 feet away, the bus drove off. The parka was still 
attached to the handrail and Andrea was dragged beneath the bus and 
crushed by its back wheels. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms of the settlement were not disclosed but the parents'  
lawyer, Donald Silverman, said, ``It's an extraordinary amount for 
the wrongful death of a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement came Monday, after a jury had been selected for  
the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman said Michael and Sin-Chai Chen were recovering money  
from the bus company, Advance Transit Co., as well as from an 
insurer for the company and for driver Eugenio Cordero. Advance 
Transit did not return calls for comment. There was no telephone 
listing for Cordero.

<HEADLINE> Allies Urged on Economic War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said today  
they will use this week's NATO summit to push for allied agreement 
on economic sanctions including an oil embargo to deny Yugoslavia 
the ability to wage war in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO allies remain ``rock solid'' behind the goal of the  
month-old airstrikes to continue the campaign until the Serb 
military halts attacks on ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province, 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright declared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will prevail here. We are not putting a time limit on it,''  
Albright said at a White House news conference with President 
Clinton's foreign policy team. ``There is a sense of determination 
and unity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the three-day 50th anniversary summit, which begins Friday,  
U.S. leaders will urge NATO allies to ``consider new economic 
measures designed to deny Belgrade the ability to wage war against 
its own people,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, she said the administration would like to see an  
oil embargo to prevent supplies from reaching Yugoslav ports. NATO 
airstrikes have destroyed 100 percent of Yugoslavia's oil-refining 
capacity and have hit supplies as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Although NATO leaders haven't yet embraced the proposal,  
Albright said she has talked to allied foreign ministers who are 
beginning to ``see the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said he believed an oil supply  
clampdown would occur. ``We think it's important that all sources 
of resupply of fuel and energy be eliminated. How that is to be 
achieved is a matter of discussion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Clinton administration is pushing for removal  
of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Albright said the Serbs 
would be better off with a democratic leader, but airstrikes aren't 
meant to get rid of Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have said that President Milosevic is responsible for the  
ethnic cleansing and all the depredations that are taking place,'' 
Albright said. ``But that is not the goal.'' Instead, it is ``get 
the Serb forces out of Kosovo and the refugees back into Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said  
NATO summit leaders may discuss the matter of sending group troops 
to Yugoslavia, an idea that has been repeatedly rejected by the 
allies and the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, he said, NATO wants to keep up the air campaign and he  
doesn't expect that to change. ``The consensus is to stay the 
course,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent days, Albright has been beseeching her fellow foreign  
ministers to approve a cutoff in shipments of refined oil to 
Yugoslavia, possibly with at-sea intercepts of vessels, and 
soliciting cooperation from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	In a parallel move, American diplomats are appealing to  
governments in Europe and elsewhere to withhold any oil shipments 
to Yugoslavia, according to a senior U.S. official speaking Monday 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	France has registered doubts about interdiction of oil shipments  
in the absence of a declaration of war against Yugoslavia, while 
the Greek government would prefer that the Clinton administration 
work through the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The French foreign ministry said Monday it supported ``the quick  
adoption of a common stand'' on restricting oil supplies to 
Yugoslavia, but that the European Union and the Balkans nations 
should be asked to take on the task of finding a formula. 
</P>
<P>
	Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis, calling on U.N.  
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York, sought to shift the focus 
of NATO's efforts. He said the United Nations should take the lead 
in devising a political framework to end the bombing and to permit 
ethnic Albanian refugees to return to their homes in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	With Annan bound for Moscow, Albright telephoned Foreign  
Minister Igor Ivanov in a bid for at least Russian acquiescence to 
the U.S. proposal and for continued withholding of technology and 
intelligence to Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin has ruled out Russian intervention in  
the Balkans conflict. But he urged Clinton on the telephone Monday 
to call off the airstrikes and revert to diplomacy as the path to a 
settlement in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin still has not indicated whether he plans to attend the  
NATO summit meeting here next weekend that will dwell on Kosovo 
instead of celebrating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the 
anti-Soviet alliance as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, though, the NATO alliance remains essentially united on  
the air campaign, which began March 24, and Russia has not crossed 
the line between sympathy for the Serbs and actively supporting 
them, administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is hoping to sell the idea of an oil cutoff to the  
allies with the argument that it is the logical follow-up to the 
devastating bombardment of Yugoslav refineries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to try to prevent them from pursuing other  
means to fuel this evil war machine,'' State Department spokesman 
James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shying away from calling the cutoff a blockade, Rubin said: ``An  
example of a way to go about this is a regime of some kind of 
visiting and searching ships, which would enable one to distinguish 
between products that would fuel the Yugoslav war machine and other 
kinds of products.'' He said he didn't know which countries were 
shipping refined oil to Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE>  Everglades Blaze Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES (AP) -- The flames that have roared  
through the Everglades, cutting off the region's main east-west 
highway and casting smoke over Miami, are part of a natural cycle 
that forestry officials say will actually help renourish the 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is actually like a rebirth process,'' said John Fish, a  
spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. ``Three months from 
now you probably won't even be able to tell this burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columns of brown and gray smoke rose from the Everglades as the  
wildfire, which has consumed 160,000 acres, charred the dry 
sawgrass that is home to the alligator, the egret and the whitetail 
deer. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire is burning accumulated dry brush and excess plant  
growth, making room for new growth, forestry officials said. Such 
fires have swept the Everglades even before the arrival of humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters had the blaze contained within a perimeter of wet  
areas, levees and Interstate 75, the main east-west highway known 
as Alligator Alley. The highway was ordered closed over the 
weekend, but the smoke thinned enough Tuesday to allow authorities 
to reopen it to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Alligators lay on blackened patches of sawgrass, basking in the  
sun, while herons pecked through the dark ash for bits of food and 
anhingas, fish-eating birds, dove into the murky wetland in search 
of prey. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wildlife undoubtedly died, but most animals survived by  
fleeing the flames or submerging themselves in pockets of water, 
Fish said. New sawgrass will sprout quickly, and wildlife will 
flourish in the area that is burning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the fire will help the ecosystem, forestry officials  
said, containing it is important because in such dry weather, 
flames could quickly get out of control and threaten new areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames were burning in a section of the Everglades' roughly  
2 million acres that is outside Everglades National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A new blaze started just east of the fire's containment area  
burned seven acres Tuesday before it was brought under control, and 
officials blamed arson after a Ford Explorer was spotted in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week  
and may have been ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic 
converter. Aided by swirling winds, it quickly became the largest 
of at least 2,542 fires that have burned more than 230,000 acres in 
Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Division of Forestry counted 27 new fires across  
Florida on Monday alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Forestry officials expect erratic winds and dry weather to  
continue in the coming days, making new fires quick to start and 
difficult to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall far below normal during Florida's  
December-through-April dry season, officials fear a repeat of last 
summer, when fires scorched nearly 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 
people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida National Guard announced Tuesday that it is  
mobilizing more than 240 soldiers to help in fire emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers on Tuesday allocated $5.6 million for  
firefighting equipment, and Gov. Jeb Bush said the state will rent 
a helicopter equipped with a 2,200-gallon water tank to fight fires 
threatening homes and will buy four 660-gallon water buckets for 
other choppers. 
</P>
<P>
	The state offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to  
the arrest and conviction of any wildfire arsonist.

<HEADLINE> Online Trading Swamped by Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fed up with online trading delays, Ed Ellks  
decided to change brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a question of `if' I will be closing my account,'' he  
said, ``but instead, when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was January.  
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Ellks, 31, a technology manager from Warren,  
Ohio, is still buying and selling stock with Ameritrade, resigned 
to the cyberspace log-jams hobbling just about every Internet 
stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the cheap commissions and the sheer simplicity of  
trading by mouse click, investors like Ellks love online trading so 
much that the fledgling industry can't keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Periodic system crashes and frequent delays have prompted  
government investigations and a handful of lawsuits charging 
financial losses, but with a seemingly unceasing bull market to 
soothe the portfolio, the backlash has been modest. 
</P>
<P>
	Market experts wonder how long patience will prevail.  
</P>
<P>
	``What happens when this market takes a dramatic turn, when  
Internet stocks come out of favor, and the online systems can't 
handle the orders?'' asked Martin Unger, an attorney who has 
represented brokerages for 25 years. ``The losses could be out of 
sight. The risk to the public is humongous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing a train wreck ahead, Web brokers are upgrading their  
computer systems, of course, but they are also targeting the 
easy-money, freewheeling behavior of many online investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Some firms have imposed trading restrictions, while others are  
trying to educate people and explain the risks of online investing 
-- especially when it comes to Internet stocks that ricochet around 
in bursts of five and 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear, however, whether any of these approaches will do  
much good given the unrelenting growth of online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three months of 1999, online trades averaged  
roughly 450,000 per day, jumping more than 30 percent for the 
second consecutive quarter, according to Credit Suisse First 
Boston. At last count, one of every seven trades was being made 
over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine firms process the vast majority of Internet trades. Like  
traditional discount brokers they offer low commissions -- $7 to $30 
per trade. They also offer online access to analyst reports and 
other stock research, but they don't give investment advice like 
the Merrill Lynches of the world, which can charge $100 or $200 for 
a typical small investor's trade. 
</P>
<P>
	On any typical day, the crush of business flowing into the  
online trading houses leaves many investors in limbo, waiting to 
place their orders or wondering if those orders have been received 
and filled. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ellks used to buy or sell up to eight times a day, so far  
this year he has placed only about 40 orders, fearful he'll get 
saddled with a bad price on a fast-moving stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess my level of expectation for Ameritrade has dropped  
significantly,'' said Ellks, who noted some recent improvement in 
the speed of Ameritrade's system. ``Initially, I expected to be 
able to place a trade, change an order, cancel an order, all within 
about 30 seconds. Now I'm just happy to be able to do it at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritrade, which had a 56 percent jump in order volume during  
the first quarter, hired two technology specialists as top 
executives in March and plans to spend $100 million in the next 12 
months to 18 months to address its growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Schwab, the biggest online brokerage, has already  
upgraded its computer system to handle 100,000 customers at a time. 
It plans to double that by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Schwab's 2.5 million online accounts, including 250,000  
new ones in the first quarter alone, simple arithmetic suggests 
that upgrading computer capacity isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	So many brokers are also suggesting that investors protect  
themselves with an old-fashioned strategy. By using ``limit 
orders,'' they can set a specific share price as the most they're 
willing to pay when buying or the least they're willing to receive 
when selling. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition many brokers are restricting the practice called  
``buying on margin'' when it comes to fast-moving stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Margin buying involves purchasing stock, then borrowing money  
using those shares as collateral and buying even more stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab has raised its margin requirements on 106 volatile  
stocks, capping the amount investors can borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, should a stock drop sharply, the broker won't need to  
sell an investor's holdings as fast to cover the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab also has been limiting Web access to other stocks as  
needed, requiring customers to speak with a live broker by phone to 
place orders involving those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the smaller online brokerages, including National  
Discount Brokers and Muriel Siebert &AMP; Co., say they've scaled back 
on advertising to prevent their business from growing too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the National Association of Securities Dealers, a  
self-regulatory group, is proposing that online brokers turn away 
aspiring ``day traders'' -- those who buy and sell the same stock 
within minutes or hours in hopes of a quick profit -- if they lack 
the necessary finances or know-how. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some experts point out that the industry can only go so  
far in restraining investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea of a discount broker is not to give advice.  
Then the broker is not subject to lawsuits,'' said Bill Burnham, an 
industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Once you get in 
the way of a trade, you're providing advice. If someone wants to 
gamble all their money on the stock market, they can do it. I can't 
see how you can stop that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A more difficult challenge, then, is making online investors  
less headstrong with their new-found powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are using the Internet inappropriately, trying to  
trade like professionals on the cheap,'' said Burnham. ``I see 
people complaining that they couldn't do a trade in 10 seconds, 
that they had to wait two or five minutes. In 1987, that was a 
lightning trade.''

<HEADLINE> Colorado Suspects Called Outcasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- They are called the ``Trench Coat  
Mafia,'' a group of about 10 students who wear long black coats, 
keep to themselves and follow shock rocker Marilyn Manson. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their dark lifestyle, they had not shown an inclination  
for violence before Tuesday, according to some of their fellow 
students at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities and school district officials said they had never  
heard of the group. ``We were not aware of the Trench Coat Mafia 
until today,'' Superintendent Jane Hammond said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A reference to the group in last year's Columbine yearbook  
reveals nothing more than general teen-age exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, some students said they believed the two gunmen who  
went on a shooting rampage at Columbine were members of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Classmates and Denver media identified the gunmen as Eric Harris  
and Dylan Klebold. Police refused to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Kelly, a 16-year-old student, said Harris and several  
members of the group made a video in class about guns they had. He 
also said that several members recently bragged about getting new 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students said the killers targeted minorities and athletes.  
Kelly said he heard Trench Coat Mafia members making ``generally 
derogatory remarks'' about blacks and Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Student Andrew Beard, said Harris and Klebold often said they  
``hated the jocks'' ``because they thought they could do anything 
they wanted, walk through life smoothly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beard said members of the group often came to school in  
steel-toed combat boots, some of them wearing Nazi crosses. 
</P>
<P>
	A dedication to the Trench Coat Mafia in the 1998 Columbine  
yearbook lists 13 members and carries the following message: ``Who 
says we are different? Insanity's healthy! Remember rocking parties 
at Kristen's, foosball at Joe's and fencing at Christopher's! Stay 
alive, stay different, stay crazy. Oh, and stay away from CREAM 
SODA!!! Love always, the chicks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But other students had developed a less innocent image of the  
group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really dark people,'' said Wes Lammers, a 17-year-old  
junior. ``There were a lot of jokes that one day they might snap or 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Brackley, 15, said she was very aware of the group even  
though it was small. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never saw them threaten anybody or bully anybody, but we  
avoided them because they were different,'' she said. ``Anyone 
dressed in black you're scared of because it signifies gothic or 
death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Josh Nielsen, a 17-year-old junior: ``They're not  
well-liked in the school and no one treated them well.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Defaults on a $1.3B Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia will not be able to pay off $1.3 billion in  
Ministry of Finance bonds that mature next month, the latest sign 
of the country's worsening debt crisis, an official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia already has defaulted on some domestic and foreign debt  
since an economic crisis hit last August, but it wanted to keep 
current on its Ministry of Finance bonds, known as MinFins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, as hard as we tried to accumulate money and  
stabilize the situation, we can't do this,'' First Deputy Finance 
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov told the Interfax news agency from 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a formal announcement was expected later today or  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure to make the payment will further erode confidence in  
Russia's recession-hit economy. An International Monetary Fund team 
is in Russia assessing the country's suitability for a new loan. 
The IMF has agreed in principle to give Russia the loan, but the 
size and the terms have not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has foreign debts of around $150 billion. About $17.5  
billion of that amount falls due this year, though the country has 
said it can only pay half that at most. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the country has sizable domestic debts, including  
the MinFins, which are classified as domestic debt though they are 
denominated in dollars. Russia has met all its previous MinFin 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The payment for the current batch of MinFins is not due until  
May 14, but there has been widespread speculation that the 
government would not be able to meet its obligations to 
bondholders, which include Russians and foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russia will probably have to begin negotiating this matter  
again with Russian and foreign holders of MinFin bonds,'' Kasyanov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been trying to encourage international lenders to  
return to the country to help revive an economy that's been 
slumping since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. It is one of the 
worst depressions ever suffered by an industrialized nation. 
</P>
<P>
	But the growing number of defaults has already scared away most  
lenders. Few analysts believe Russia will be able to pay debts 
accumulated during the Soviet era. Russia has tried to stay current 
on debt run up in the post-Soviet period. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's hard currency reserves are down to less than $11  
billion, a small sum for a country of Russia's size and population.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Celebrex Linked to 10 Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Monsanto's highly successful painkiller Celebrex  
has been linked to 10 deaths and 11 cases of gastrointestinal 
hemorrhages in its first three months on the market, The Wall 
Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of the 10 people who died suffered from gastrointestinal  
bleeding or ulcers, according to ``adverse incident'' reports 
submitted to the Food and Drug Administration that were obtained by 
the Journal under the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other deaths were attributed to heart attacks, one to drug  
interaction and one to kidney disorder. No cause of death was given 
for the 10th fatality. 
</P>
<P>
	A Monsanto spokeswoman said Tuesday that there is no evidence  
that Celebrex actually caused the deaths or other health problems 
in people taking the drug. More than 2 million consumers have taken 
Celebrex. ``You can't draw any conclusions from the adverse 
incident reports,'' said spokeswoman Scarlett Lee Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Journal did not specify the sources of the adverse event  
reports, which could come from health professionals, consumers or 
the drug company itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex, manufactured by St. Louis-based Monsanto Co.'s G.D.  
Searle &AMP; Co. subsidiary, went on the market in January to treat 
osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex was touted by Monsanto as an effective pain reliever  
much like ibuprofen, but was much less likely to cause severe 
stomach problems such as bleeding ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	So far it has been a gigantic success: 2.5 million prescriptions  
have been filled in its first 13 weeks on the market, compared with 
the record 2.7 million prescriptions of anti-impotency drug Viagra 
filled during its first three months. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert DeLap, director of an FDA office of drug evaluation, told  
the Journal that more research needs to be done before coming to a 
conclusion about Celebrex's safety. ``Do we think there's a signal 
that the product poses some special risk? No, not at the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Searle officials told the Journal they remain excited about  
Celebrex's performance. ``We really feel the drug is performing as 
expected. The safety profile is what we would expect,'' said Steve 
Geis, the company's vice president for arthritis clinical research. 
</P>
<P>
	Geis declined to go into details about any cases of death linked  
to the drug, but said that many patients taking Celebrex have other 
illnesses and are taking multiple medications.

<HEADLINE> Court Asked To Block CBS Broadcast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A chain of psychiatric hospitals on Tuesday  
requested a restraining order to prevent CBS from televising a ``60 
Minutes II'' investigation where a hidden camera was used to film 
allegations of falsified records and patient mistreatment. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing was scheduled for Federal District Court in Charlotte,  
N.C., for Wednesday afternoon, less than eight hours before the 
broadcast is scheduled to begin. 
</P>
<P>
	At CBS's urging, a social worker equipped with a camera on his  
eyeglasses got a job working at a Charlotte facility operated by 
Charter Behavioral Health Systems, which runs 91 psychiatric 
hospitals in 32 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The social worker, Terrance Johnson, documents allegations that  
Charter employees falsify patient records. His camera also catches 
a physically restrained boy left gasping and crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Charter is asking a judge to stop the broadcast because CBS  
breached patient confidentiality by sending in Johnson with a 
camera, company spokeswoman Karen Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes a sad statement if you can't be treated in a hospital  
and not know that the confidentiality of whatever illness you're 
dealing with is not going to be videotaped,'' Ms. Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Any patients caught by the hidden camera have their faces and  
bodies blurred out and their voices altered, CBS News President 
Andrew Heyward said. ``We're completely concealing the identity,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Jenkins said confidentiality was breached not just by  
the camera, but by the hiring of a clinical worker who was 
reporting his findings to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Heyward said CBS also rejects Charter's contentions that the  
network violated a law regarding recording someone without their 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very proud of this broadcast,'' Heyward said. ``I feel  
it performs an important public service and it is in the public 
interest for the broadcast to be seen. It is not in the public 
interest for this broadcast to be suppressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over use of hidden cameras by a television news  
organization comes two years after a North Carolina jury slammed 
ABC for the technique in an investigation of the Food Lion 
supermarkets. The jury ordered ABC to pay Food Lion $5.5 million 
because of the story. That award was later reduced to $315,000 and 
is still being appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	There were two other uses of hidden cameras during newsmagazine  
stories this week. ``Dateline NBC'' used them for a story Monday 
about bad meat, and ``60 Minutes'' used them Sunday to interview 
someone who had come into contact with Olympic Park bombing suspect 
Eric Robert Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks say the Food Lion case did not scare them from using  
hidden cameras, but they are using strict standards to govern them. 
The ABC, CBS and NBC policies on hidden cameras are similar. 
Management must specifically approve their use, usually in writing 
and after review by lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The networks couldn't say whether their use of hidden cameras  
had increased or decreased since the Food Lion case, but NBC 
executive David McCormick said he suspects it has dropped.

<HEADLINE> Obese Women Risk Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Obese women are six times more likely than  
thin women to have a silent, smoldering inflammation inside their 
arteries that may increase their already high risk of developing 
heart disease, researchers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the findings are verified, they suggest scientists should  
study whether the aspirin some heart patients take might also help 
overweight people reduce their chances of heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Being overweight is an automatic warning sign for heart disease:  
The fatter people are, the more likely they are to have high 
cholesterol and clogged arteries, high blood pressure, diabetes and 
other cardiovascular risk factors. 
</P>
<P>
	But no one knew if those extra pounds could cause yet another  
risk: low-grade inflammation inside a person's arteries. 
</P>
<P>
	In otherwise seemingly healthy people, scientists recently  
discovered that this low-grade inflammation can simmer for years 
and significantly increase a person's risk of a heart attack or 
stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows what causes the subtle inflammation. One theory has  
been that it might be bacteria, and indeed, some research suggests 
that antibiotics may help fight heart disease. On the other hand, 
doctors already frequently prescribe aspirin to certain people at 
high risk of heart attacks because it thins their blood -- and 
aspirin also reduces inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch scientist Marjolein Visser knew that fat cells themselves  
can produce a substance called interleukin-6 that causes 
inflammation when it seeps into the bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
	So she studied whether obesity could be another culprit, using a  
U.S. database of 16,000 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The only way to measure this ``micro-inflammation'' is using a  
blood test that detects C-reactive protein, or CRP. CRP levels 
skyrocket when people are sick, with colds, inflammatory diseases 
like rheumatoid arthritis, even heart disease. But lower levels, 
between 0.2 milligrams and 1 mg per deciliter of blood, are the 
ones that signal the simmering inflammation that has scientists 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	Visser discovered that obese women are six times more likely to  
have this low-grade inflammation than normal-weight people. 
</P>
<P>
	Obese men were twice as likely to have it, a gender difference  
Visser couldn't explain, except to say that women in the study were 
much more overweight than men studied. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised'' the risk was so high, Visser said Tuesday,  
before presenting her findings at a biology meeting here. If 
verified, ``it could have quite an impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Visser, a weight specialist at Amsterdam's Vrije University,  
statistically controlled for other diseases that might have caused 
the study participants' CRP levels to rise. 
</P>
<P>
	She found equal risk when examining only healthy people under  
age 40. Even ``at a young age, when you're obese there's this 
inflammation, and we know it's bad for you,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study isn't proof that obesity inflames people's arteries,  
cautioned Dr. Richard J. Havlik of the National Institute on Aging, 
which funded the research. But the federal agency is intrigued 
enough that it is funding more research into the link -- and probing 
whether obesity-caused inflammation might have ramifications for 
other diseases, too. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Visser is preparing to see whether losing weight causes  
CRP levels to drop immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Her findings, however, raise the question of whether aspirin or  
any of the dozens of other anti-inflammatory drugs, like ibuprofen, 
could help obese people ward off heart disease, and she cautions 
that nobody has tested that yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing to do if you're obese is lose weight instead of  
hitting the aspirin bottle,'' she cautioned.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Edge Higher / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices edged higher Tuesday in quiet  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/16  
point, or 63 cents per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.50 percent from 5.51 percent 
late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were unchanged, and intermediate maturities were unchanged to up 
1/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.38 percent as the  
discount rose 0.04 percentage points from the auction Monday to 
4.27 percent. Six-month yields were 4.53 percent, as the discount 
was unchanged at 4.37 percent. One-year yields were 4.64 percent as 
the discount rose by 0.01 percentage point from late Monday to 4.43 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 4.44 percent from 4.63 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 124 3/8 from 124 11/32. The average 
yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.23 percent.

<HEADLINE> People Might Feel the Cost of War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top congressional Republicans acknowledged  
Tuesday that the multibillion-dollar costs of the clash with 
Yugoslavia and an accompanying military buildup will come from 
Social Security surpluses, and might affect the size of the party's 
proposed tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after President Clinton asked Congress for $6.05 billion  
for the Balkans conflict, Republican House and Senate leaders said 
the first votes on the measure could come next week. But the 
leaders seemed to disagree over how insistent they should be about 
adding more defense funds. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said it is ``our  
first moral obligation'' to strengthen a Pentagon left overburdened 
worldwide by the Clinton administration. He used no figure, but 
said Monday that a $10 billion measure would be ``insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the perception of us being stretched too thin is for  
any number of places around the world an invitation, a provocation, 
to make a strike and see if we can get away with it,'' Armey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the sentiment in his more moderate chamber, Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the GOP should use ``as 
much restraint as we can'' and limit the bill to single-digit 
billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a measure costing $15 billion to $18 billion, as some  
House conservatives have said they want, does not have ``any 
realistic chance'' of being enacted. Citing shortages of ships, 
ammunition and personnel, Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., chairman of 
the House Armed Services military procurement subcommittee, said he 
believed the bill should run ``well beyond $20 billion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a limit to how much you can sensibly spend in a period  
of time,'' Lott said. ``You run the risk if you make it too big it 
collapses in a puddle, and that creates problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey and Lott also disagreed over whether language should be  
included boosting military pay and pensions. Lott said it should, 
but Armey suggested that should be considered later because it 
wasn't as urgent as paying for the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever the price tag, Armey and Lott said they believed the  
money will come from this year's federal budget surplus, which is 
expected to be about $110 billion and comes entirely from Social 
Security surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	That was a significant admission, because in this year's budget  
fight with Clinton, Republicans have promised repeatedly that they 
will use Social Security surpluses only to overhaul the program or 
reduce the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has asked for that money, and the American  
people need to understand that it's coming out of Social 
Security,'' Lott told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said separately that if voters see the war's costs  
trimming the national debt reduction that is achieved this year, 
``I think they understand the need, the priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armey said defense spending should go up next year, too, and  
finding the money to pay for that would cause Republicans to 
``re-examine our priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that would include a debate over whether money should be  
shifted from domestic to defense spending, and ``whether the tax 
reduction might be less than it might otherwise need to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP-written budget approved by Congress last week calls for  
10-year tax cuts of at least $778 billion, with about $15 billion 
of the cuts coming next year. Fiscal 2000 begins Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> Japan Phone Co. Cutting 2,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's leading international long-distance phone  
service provider will cut 2,000 jobs -- about one-third of its work 
force -- over the next five years as part of a restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	KDD Corp. President Tadashi Nishimoto announced the widely  
expected move, saying the retrenchment will trim the company's 
payroll to 3,800 employees from 5,800 by early 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	The reductions will be achieved through early retirement and  
attrition, as opposed to layoffs, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once a protected monopoly, KDD has seen its dominant market  
share slide amid greater competition sparked by recent government 
moves to deregulate Japan's telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	KDD also plans to streamline its board of directors to 10  
members from 32 and split up its business operations into three 
main units responsible for sales, networks and management. 
</P>
<P>
	Company head Nishimoto said KDD's operating revenues for the  
fiscal year that ended March 31 will probably be slightly lower 
than forecast. But revenues from operations outside of its core 
business will probably be slightly higher than expected, he said.

	NATO Notes 'Disturbing Developments'  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO is reporting ``disturbing  
developments'' -- reports ``too numerous'' to ignore -- of Serb 
soldiers raping ethnic Albanian women and using tear gas to move 
ethnic Albanians out of their homes in Pristina. NATO spokesman 
Jamie Shea said Serb military and paramilitary forces were staging 
``safari-style'' operations, shelling hills where ethnic Albanians 
fled to flush them out, marching the refugees on roads, putting 
them on trains to the border and then closing the border to them. 
Shea told reporters at NATO headquarters that the alliance was 
investigating reports of ethnic Albanians used as ``human shields 
in front of tanks,'' mass executions, and ethnic cleansing 
operations spreading from Kosovo into border villages of 
Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller republic.

troops to the area. President Clinton has not asked for such 
authority. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the prime sponsor of the 
``necessary force'' proposal and a presidential candidate, pushed 
the idea as Congress discussed President Clinton's request for $6

<HEADLINE> Online Trading Swamped by Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fed up with online trading delays, Ed Ellks  
decided to change brokers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a question of `if' I will be closing my account,'' he  
said, ``but instead, when.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was January.  
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, Ellks, 31, a technology manager from Warren,  
Ohio, is still buying and selling stock with Ameritrade, resigned 
to the cyberspace log-jams hobbling just about every Internet 
stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the cheap commissions and the sheer simplicity of  
trading by mouse click, investors like Ellks love online trading so 
much that the fledgling industry can't keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Periodic system crashes and frequent delays have prompted  
government investigations and a handful of lawsuits charging 
financial losses, but with a seemingly unceasing bull market to 
soothe the portfolio, the backlash has been modest. 
</P>
<P>
	Market experts wonder how long patience will prevail.  
</P>
<P>
	``What happens when this market takes a dramatic turn, when  
Internet stocks come out of favor, and the online systems can't 
handle the orders?'' asked Martin Unger, an attorney who has 
represented brokerages for 25 years. ``The losses could be out of 
sight. The risk to the public is humongous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fearing a train wreck ahead, Web brokers are upgrading their  
computer systems, of course, but they are also targeting the 
easy-money, freewheeling behavior of many online investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Some firms have imposed trading restrictions, while others are  
trying to educate people and explain the risks of online investing 
-- especially when it comes to Internet stocks that ricochet around 
in bursts of five and 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	It's unclear, however, whether any of these approaches will do  
much good given the unrelenting growth of online trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three months of 1999, online trades averaged  
roughly 450,000 per day, jumping more than 30 percent for the 
second consecutive quarter, according to Credit Suisse First 
Boston. At last count, one of every seven trades was being made 
over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine firms process the vast majority of Internet trades. Like  
traditional discount brokers they offer low commissions -- $7 to $30 
per trade. They also offer online access to analyst reports and 
other stock research, but they don't give investment advice like 
the Merrill Lynches of the world, which can charge $100 or $200 for 
a typical small investor's trade. 
</P>
<P>
	On any typical day, the crush of business flowing into the  
online trading houses leaves many investors in limbo, waiting to 
place their orders or wondering if those orders have been received 
and filled. 
</P>
<P>
	While Ellks used to buy or sell up to eight times a day, so far  
this year he has placed only about 40 orders, fearful he'll get 
saddled with a bad price on a fast-moving stock. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess my level of expectation for Ameritrade has dropped  
significantly,'' said Ellks, who noted some recent improvement in 
the speed of Ameritrade's system. ``Initially, I expected to be 
able to place a trade, change an order, cancel an order, all within 
about 30 seconds. Now I'm just happy to be able to do it at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ameritrade, which had a 56 percent jump in order volume during  
the first quarter, hired two technology specialists as top 
executives in March and plans to spend $100 million in the next 12 
months to 18 months to address its growing pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Schwab, the biggest online brokerage, has already  
upgraded its computer system to handle 100,000 customers at a time. 
It plans to double that by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	But with Schwab's 2.5 million online accounts, including 250,000  
new ones in the first quarter alone, simple arithmetic suggests 
that upgrading computer capacity isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
	So many brokers are also suggesting that investors protect  
themselves with an old-fashioned strategy. By using ``limit 
orders,'' they can set a specific share price as the most they're 
willing to pay when buying or the least they're willing to receive 
when selling. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition many brokers are restricting the practice called  
``buying on margin'' when it comes to fast-moving stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Margin buying involves purchasing stock, then borrowing money  
using those shares as collateral and buying even more stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab has raised its margin requirements on 106 volatile  
stocks, capping the amount investors can borrow. 
</P>
<P>
	That way, should a stock drop sharply, the broker won't need to  
sell an investor's holdings as fast to cover the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab also has been limiting Web access to other stocks as  
needed, requiring customers to speak with a live broker by phone to 
place orders involving those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the smaller online brokerages, including National  
Discount Brokers and Muriel Siebert &AMP; Co., say they've scaled back 
on advertising to prevent their business from growing too fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the National Association of Securities Dealers, a  
self-regulatory group, is proposing that online brokers turn away 
aspiring ``day traders'' -- those who buy and sell the same stock 
within minutes or hours in hopes of a quick profit -- if they lack 
the necessary finances or know-how. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some experts point out that the industry can only go so  
far in restraining investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole idea of a discount broker is not to give advice.  
Then the broker is not subject to lawsuits,'' said Bill Burnham, an 
industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Once you get in 
the way of a trade, you're providing advice. If someone wants to 
gamble all their money on the stock market, they can do it. I can't 
see how you can stop that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A more difficult challenge, then, is making online investors  
less headstrong with their new-found powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people are using the Internet inappropriately, trying to  
trade like professionals on the cheap,'' said Burnham. ``I see 
people complaining that they couldn't do a trade in 10 seconds, 
that they had to wait two or five minutes. In 1987, that was a 
lightning trade.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reacts to School Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six months after hosting a White House  
conference on school violence, President Clinton asked Americans to 
pray Tuesday for Colorado's terrorized Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	A somber Clinton opened a Roosevelt Room announcement on the  
economy with acknowledgment of reports that dominated national 
television since the first shots were heard in the suburban Denver 
school Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know there has been a terrible shooting in a high  
school in Littleton, Colo.,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the situation -- as I left to come out here --  
apparently is ongoing, I think it would be inappropriate for me to 
say anything other than I hope the American people will be praying 
for the students, the parents and the teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll wait for events to unfold, and then there will be more  
to say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president called attention to a spate of school shootings in  
recent years when he traveled last summer to Springfield, Ore., and 
visited the Thurston High School cafeteria. There, police said, a 
15-year-old pupil opened fire, killing two classmates and wounding 
22 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton followed up that emotional visit by convening in October  
a White House school-violence conference with Vice President Al 
Gore, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and close to 800 educators 
and law-enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He ordered Education Secretary Richard Riley and Attorney  
General Janet Reno to work with school officials and law 
enforcement authorities on developing an ``early warning guide'' 
that might help prevent the kind of youth rage that erupted in 
deadly school gunfire in Oregon, Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi 
and Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE>  Multiple Golf Titles Hard To Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Greg Norman walked up the 18th fairway with the Masters champion  
for the second time in four years. If Davis Love III had birdied 
the two reachable par-5s on the back nine of Augusta National, 
perhaps he could have worn the green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later in the MCI Classic, Payne Stewart was in a familiar  
role -- complimenting someone else's final round and offering 
congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players, two weeks, one common denominator.  
</P>
<P>
	Winning is the best way to measure success, and all three have  
had their share. Together, they have won 42 tour events and five 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	But as golf has become deeper in talent and multiple wins have  
become a rarity, there is rarely enough appreciation for 
consistently being in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Of active players with at least 10 years' experience on the PGA  
Tour, no one has done that as well as these three. 
</P>
<P>
	For Stewart, who lost the MCI Classic in a playoff to Glen Day,  
it was the 25th time in his career that he has finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman finished third at Augusta, but he's no stranger to second  
place. Among active players, only Tom Watson has as many runner-up 
finishes (31) on the PGA Tour. Eight of Norman's seconds have come 
in the majors, and he's the only player to lose all four majors in 
a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was the Masters runner-up for the second time in five  
years. He has finished second 14 times in his career, three of them 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed I didn't win,'' Love said. ``But I'm pleased  
to have played another Masters and to have a chance to get nervous 
on the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no substitute for winning. Day made that clear when he  
choked back tears after his first PGA Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, anything less is too often perceived as failure.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Tiger Woods won once, was second twice and third  
twice. He had more top 10s than anyone (13), but was hounded by 
questions about his ``slump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval can appreciate the feeling. He was the ultimate PGA  
Tour bridesmaid for nearly three years -- seven times a runner-up 
from 1995 until he finished the 1997 season with three straight 
victories. He took a lead into the final round five times without 
winning during those ``lean'' years, and never once considered 
himself a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was being criticized for not having won,'' Duval said at the  
beginning of the year, before his 59 or the four wins that pushed 
his count to 11. ``It's kind of like if you don't win, you're a 
bum. What about kids who are coming up who don't have as much 
talent as some other people? They gave their heart, busted their 
tail, finished third, had a great golf tournament. That's not 
failing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval then pointed to the year-by-year listing in the PGA Tour  
media guide that shows number of victories, second- and third-place 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next stat they show is top 10s,'' he said. ``Why is that?  
Because top 10 is a good week out here. It's good playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How good?  
</P>
<P>
	Consider the following statistical review, in which 10 points  
were awarded for a victory, five points for second, three points 
for third and one point for a top 10. An additional 10 points were 
given for each major. 
</P>
<P>
	The total points were then divided by the number of years on  
tour, and yielded the following results: 
</P>
<P>
	--Watson, who turns 50 in September, averaged 31.4 points per  
season and was the highest ranked among active players on the 
strength of his 34 victories, eight majors and 31 second-place 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Norman, who joined the tour in 1983, was second at 29.9 points.  
While Norman has won 18 times and has only two majors, he has 
matched Watson's total of runner-up finishes in only 17 years on 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stewart was third at 24.1 points per year. Along with 10  
victories (two majors) and 25 seconds, Stewart has finished third 
20 times. Only Watson and Tom Kite have more seconds and thirds 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	--Love has been so good for so long that it's hard to believe he  
just turned 35. With 13 wins and 14 seconds, he was fourth at 23.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Woods were both around 40, although neither has been  
on tour longer than five years. Ernie Els was at 24.5 points in his 
sixth year on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus clocked in at 42.1, which accounts for every year  
through 1998. While his record of 18 professional majors might 
never be broken, it should be noted that Nicklaus finished second 
19 times in the majors alone.

                            *John Broome    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Broome, a DC Comics writer whose 25-year  
career included the popular superheroes Green Lantern and Flash, 
died March 14 of a heart attack. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	He died while traveling through Thailand with his wife Peggy.  
</P>
<P>
	Broome, who wrote under his own name and the pseudonyms John  
Osgood and Edgar Ray Merritt, was responsible for the colorful 
writing in The Justice Society of America. The comic depicted the 
first team of superheroes, and Captain Comic, a character with 
great mental powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Other comics Broome wrote included Detective Chimp, about a  
chimp who worked with a sheriff in a small town to solve crime. It 
was written from the chimp's viewpoint. He also wrote the comic 
Atomic Knights. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Lantern, first created during the Golden Age of Comics in  
the 1940s, was revised by Broome in the '50s and '60s. He also 
wrote most of the stories of Flash, during the same period. Both 
comic characters survive into today. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring in 1970, Broome moved to Paris and later to  
Tokyo, where he taught English. 

</P>
<P>
                          *Flora Carabella    	
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Actress Flora Carabella, the widow of Marcello  
Mastroianni, died Monday night after a long illness, Italian news 
reports said. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flora was not just (Marcello's) wife. She was a joyful,  
committed, independent woman, always lively,'' said actress Sophia 
Loren. ``In the end, she couldn't bear the pain of Marcello's loss. 
Marcello was the man of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carabella worked with the famed director Luchino Visconti at the  
beginning of her career. She married Mastroianni in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	They separated in 1970 but never divorced and remained friends  
until his death in 1996. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Gordon Hughes    	
</P>
<P>
	SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Gordon Hughes, a director-writer  
who worked with such entertainers as Ronald Reagan, Frank Sinatra 
and Lucille Ball during a half-century stage, radio and TV career, 
died Monday of heart failure. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes began his entertainment career in 1933 with stage  
productions in the Midwest and East Coast. He also directed Reagan 
in Des Moines, Iowa, at the Little Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was the first radio director to receive NBC national  
credits on the air while directing Arch Obler's ``Lights Out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later moved to Hollywood and directed the radio soap opera  
``The Guiding Light.'' He also did shows for Sinatra, Miss Ball, 
Gene Autry and Steve Allen on the CBS radio network. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes then moved to television, where he produced, directed and  
wrote such shows as ``My Little Margie'' and ``Charlie My Boy.'' He 
wrote ``This is Your Life'' and ``Truth or Consequences'' shows.

<P>
                          *Shijaku Katsura    	
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Shijaku Katsura, a popular performer of traditional  
``rakugo'' comic monologues, died Monday at a hospital in western 
Japan. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Katsura had been in a coma since last month, when he tried to  
hang himself in his home in Suita, 250 miles west of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Toru Maeda in Kobe, Katsura gained popularity with his  
lively and innovative performances in a western Japan dialect, 
though he also performed in English. He also was known for his 
humorous looks, characterized by his bald pate and broad smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Laughing is a way to release stress,'' he once said.  
</P>
<P>
	After dropping out of the literature department at Kobe  
University, Katsura made his debut in 1962 under his previous stage 
name, Koyone. Using his English skills, Katsura developed his 
trademark ``rakugo,'' entertaining audiences in Europe, the United 
States and Australia since 1987.

</P>
<P>
	HEREFORD, Texas (AP) -- Orvil Gene ``Speedy'' Nieman, publisher  
of the Hereford Brand for 26 years, died Monday after a long 
illness. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieman had retired July 1 as publisher and president of The  
Brand and North Plains Printing, Inc., and assumed the honorary 
title of publisher emeritus. He wrote his weekly column, ``Hereford 
Bull,'' until March, when ill health prevented him from coming to 
the office every day. 
</P>
<P>
	He had served as a director and president of the Texas Press  
Association, president of the Panhandle Press Association and 
president of the West Texas Press Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieman was editor of the Lamesa Daily Reporter in 1951 before  
going back to Texas Tech to complete his journalism degree. While 
at Tech, he worked as a sports writer at the Lubbock 
Avalanche-Journal and as a sports reporter and editor at Lamesa. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieman graduated in 1954 and went to work as a sports writer at  
the San Angelo Standard-Times. He later was editor of newspaper 
operations for the Lamesa Daily Reporter, Brownfield News and Lamb 
County Leader News. He worked on the news staff at the Midland 
Reporter-Telegram in 1964 before he became publisher, editor and 
co-owner of the Slaton Slatonite in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his wife, Lavon, published the Slatonite until 1971, when  
they sold their interest and entered a partnership with Roberts 
Publishing Co. of Andrews to purchase The Hereford Brand and its 
printing plant. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1972, Nieman became publisher, editor and partner in the  
Brand and the newly re-organized North Plains Printing. Nieman 
converted the Brand from a semi-weekly to a five-day daily 
newspaper in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife; two sons, and two grandchildren.

	DOUGLAS, Wyo. (AP) -- John Markle Rider, former Wyoming newspaper  
publisher and editor, died Sunday of cancer. He was 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider bought the Douglas Budget from his mother in 1992. Under  
his leadership, the paper won numerous awards, including the 
national first-place award for general excellence for a weekly 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from the newspaper business in 1985. He served on the  
Converse County Commission from 1989 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	He is survived by his wife, two daughters, a son and a brother.

<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- John G. Ryan, a director and former president and  
chief operating officer of Global Marine Inc., died Sunday of skin 
cancer. He was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan was elected president and chief operating officer of Global  
Marine in May 1997. The Houston-based company is one of the largest 
offshore drilling contractors and the world's largest provider of 
offshore drilling management services. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan joined the company in 1982 as assistant general counsel and  
in 1985 was named senior vice president, general counsel and 
secretary. He was appointed chief executive officer in 1993.

<P>
                      *Hernando Santos Castillo    	
</P>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Hernando Santos Castillo, chairman of  
the El Tiempo newspaper and a political powerbroker who was perhaps 
the most influential Colombian journalist of his generation, died 
Tuesday at age 76. 
</P>
<P>
	He died from complications of a cerebral hemorrhage suffered  
April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos was close to every Colombian president since 1958. He  
helped some get elected with endorsements in the country's leading 
newspaper and counseled them all, sometimes with an earful. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos' father, Enrique Santos Montejo, was a celebrated  
columnist and his granduncle, Eduardo Santos, was a former 
president who founded El Tiempo in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos became El Tiempo's news editor in the 1960s, sharing the  
position with his older brother Enrique, and took over as chairman 
two decades later. Enrique Santos remains managing editor of the 
newspaper, where five of Hernando's seven children work alongside 
two of Enrique's. 
</P>
<P>
	Up until his death, Hernando Santos was a full-time journalist  
who worked nearly every day. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two decades, El Tiempo has hedged against hard  
times by expanding into cable television, book publishing and 
telecommunications. But Hernando Santos' main role was always as 
editorial director of the newspaper, which generally reflected the 
orientation of his grandfather's Liberal Party. 

</P>
<P>
                           *Senor Wences    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Senor Wences, the master ventriloquist who  
delighted ``Ed Sullivan Show'' audiences by bantering in a comic 
Spanish accent with his puppet-in-a-box Pedro (``S'OK?'' 
``S'awright!'') and his falsetto-voiced hand puppet Johnny, died 
Tuesday at 103. 
</P>
<P>
	Wences, whose real name was Wenceslao Moreno, bickered and  
bantered with his puppets while he drank, smoked and juggled, 
during the Golden Age of television. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his puppets was gravelly-voiced Pedro, who consisted only  
of a head in a box. 
</P>
<P>
	Another puppet was Johnny, whose comeback line was: ``Deefeecult  
for you, easy for me.'' Wences created Johnny by scrunching up his 
fist, drawing a mouth where thumb and index finger met, and draping 
a blond wig over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	Wences would talk to his puppets with his face right in theirs,  
as if daring the audience to watch his lips, which, of course, 
never moved. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro's voice became clearer as the door to his box opened, and  
muffled as it closed. Audiences forgot the sound was really coming 
from outside the box. 
</P>
<P>
	In between his many Sullivan show appearances, he entertained  
four presidents, toured with Dean Martin &AMP; Jerry Lewis, did a 
Broadway show with Danny Kaye, and played every casino in Vegas. He 
continued touring into his early 90s.

                        *Charlie Whittingham    	
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charlie Whittingham, one of the greatest  
trainers in thoroughbred racing and twice a winner of the Kentucky 
Derby, died Tuesday of leukemia. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham, a trainer for 62-years, prepared more than 2,500  
winners. The two biggest winners were Ferdinand (1986) and Sunday 
Silence (1989). Ferdinand made him, at 73, the oldest trainer to 
win the Derby. He was oldest again at 76 when Sunday Silence won 
the 1989 Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	After two of his colts were Kentucky Derby disappointments in  
the 1950s, Whittingham decided to stay away from the race until he 
had a chance to win. That absence lasted 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Churchill Downs with Ferdinand, ridden by Bill  
Shoemaker, jockey for Whittingham on more than 200 stakes 
victories. Riding Ferdinand at 54, he became the Kentucky Derby's 
oldest winning rider. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham's son and fellow trainer, Michael, took over most of  
the direction of the Whittingham barn in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham was inducted into racing's Hall of Fame in 1974. He  
was the leading trainer in career victories at both Santa Anita and 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He won thoroughbred racing Eclipse Awards as top trainer in  
1971, 1982 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He held the national earnings title seven times, from 1970-73,  
1975, and 1981-82. His top earnings year was 1989 -- $11.4 million. 
More than 20 of the horses he trained had career earnings over $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also the leading career trainer at Santa Anita and  
Hollywood Park.

<HEADLINE> Times Mirror Profits Rise 7.8 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Times Mirror reported a 7.8 percent increase  
in first quarter earnings Tuesday as the newspaper and magazine 
publisher benefited from circulation growth and higher profits at 
key East Coast newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which publishes the Los Angeles Times and other  
leading newspapers, earned $48.8 million, or 58 cents per share, 
compared to $45.3 million, or 44 cents per share, during the first 
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 4.5 percent to $746 million from $714 million.  
</P>
<P>
	The improved earnings were supported by double-digit growth in  
operating profit at Newsday and The Baltimore Sun, Times Mirror's 
largest East Coast newspapers in terms of circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The growth offset a slight decline in operating profit at the  
flagship Los Angeles Times, said Mark H. Willes, chairman, 
president and chief executive officer of Times Mirror and publisher 
of the Times. 
</P>
<P>
	``We also showed steady improvement in both average daily and  
Sunday circulation at our largest newspapers,'' Willes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Times executives announced in December they would eliminate 500  
full-time and part-time jobs as part of a reorganization aimed at 
cutting costs and boosting circulation and ad sales. Willes said 
full savings from the restructuring have not been realized. No 
editorial positions were included in the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	First quarter revenues from newspaper publishing rose 5.6  
percent to $573.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Times Mirror closed down 25 cents at $61.87 1/2 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Phillip Morris Profits Rise Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s underlying profit  
barely improved in the first quarter as cigarette shipments skidded 
following last fall's price hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest tobacco maker held up better than the  
industry, however, and extended its commanding share of the U.S. 
cigarette market. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were slightly ahead of Wall Street expectations, and  
Philip Morris shares closed up 3 percent, or by $1.12 1/2, at $34.25 
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Its underlying income, excluding one-time-only charges, was up  
1.4 percent to $2.0 billion, or 80 cents a share, in the three 
months ended March 31, from $1.93 billion, or 79 cents a share, a 
year ago. That was a penny better than the 79 cents a share average 
expected by analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Including one-time factors, the company's net income was $1.79  
billion, or 73 cents a share, up from $1.38 billion, or 57 cents a 
share, a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results were depressed by $287 million in pretax charges  
for early retirement programs in its food and tobacco businesses 
this year and $901 million in pretax charges a year ago for tobacco 
litigation settlements and employee reductions in the tobacco 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 6.1 percent to $19.5 billion from $18.38 billion a  
year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic tobacco profits fell 7.3 percent to $1 billion as its  
cigarette shipments fell 9.6 percent and promotional spending 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected cigarette shipments would tumble in the  
wake of the 45 cent-a-pack price increase that Philip Morris and 
other leading cigarette makers imposed in November to help pay for 
a legal settlement with the states. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco makers agreed to pay $206 billion over 25 years to  
settle claims by 46 states over health costs related to treating 
sick smokers. The industry had settled earlier for $40 billion with 
the other four states. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris said the 9.6 percent decline in its cigarette  
shipments to wholesalers and distributors was slightly smaller than 
the industry's 9.7 percent decline. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, its share of the U.S. shipment market rose 0.1  
percentage point to 50.4 percent. Its share of retail cigarette 
sales, as measured by A.C. Nielsen, climbed 1.6 points to 53.7 
percent, Philip Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts said the price hikes didn't account directly for  
the entire decline in shipments. Part was because wholesalers and 
distributors had stocked up in advance of the price hikes and were 
selling from inventory rather than ordering more from the cigarette 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Feldman, analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, said the  
shipment figures were being compared with an especially strong 
first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman said he was impressed with Philip Morris' ability to  
shield its best-selling Marlboro brand from the full brunt of the 
price fallout. Philip Morris and others have been offering 
discounts on some brands to cushion the impact of the price hike, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marlboro shipments fell only 4.6 percent and the brand's share  
of the retail market rose 2.2 points to 38.8 percent, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Emanuel Goldman, tobacco analyst for Merrill Lynch, said Philip  
Morris may have been worried people would buy cheaper brands due to 
the price hike. ``That clearly didn't seem to happen. If anything, 
people traded up to Marlboro,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	International tobacco profits rose 0.9 percent even as cigarette  
shipments fell 11.2 percent. Strong results in Western Europe and 
Japan were offset in Eastern Europe and parts of Asia and Latin 
America, 
</P>
<P>
	Profits at Kraft Foods North America rose 5 percent, mainly due  
to lower commodity and manufacturing costs, while international 
food profits rose 5.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Its Miller Brewing Co. posted a 6.3 percent increase in  
operating income due to lower costs and higher income from brewing 
done for rivals like Pabst. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic shipments were up 0.5 percent despite a 1.2 percent  
decline for the flagship Miller Lite brand. 
</P>
<P>
	A new advertising campaign was launched recently for Miller  
Lite, evoking the ``Tastes Great, Less Filling'' approach of the 
brand's heyday. New leaders were installed at Miller several weeks 
ago.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Promises To Rebuild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Just days after Compaq Computer Corp. ousted its  
chief executive, the company purchased a full-page advertisement 
published Tuesday in two newspapers promising customers and 
shareholders it is committed to rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Compaq became a leader through intense dedication to  
anticipating and exceeding the needs of its market. We are 
committed to re-energizing that dedication ...,'' according to the 
ad in the Houston Chronicle and The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The advertisement included a letter distributed Sunday to Compaq  
employees announcing the departure of chief executive Eckhard 
Pfeiffer, who had struggled to maintain profits amid plummeting 
personal computer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine days before Pfeiffer was asked to resign, Compaq announced  
it anticipated earnings of 15 cents per share in the first quarter 
on revenue of $9.4 billion -- $600 million lower than expected. 
First-quarter results are due out Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The employee letter, signed by Compaq chairman Ben Rosen, vows  
to increase efficiency, ``delivering quick responses to business 
demands, promptly meeting the needs of every customer and keeping 
us well ahead of the market at all times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen is acting as chief executive officer until a replacement  
for Pfeiffer is found. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfeiffer, meanwhile, says he was asked to leave to mollify Wall  
Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to appease the financial community, you create a  
shakeup,'' he told the Houston Chronicle in Tuesday editions. 
``That, at least, seems to wipe the page clean and you start from 
there.''

<HEADLINE> Honeywell Earnings Rise 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Honeywell Inc. reported Tuesday its  
first-quarter earnings rose 9 percent on a 3 percent increase in 
sales and continued cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell earned $105.4 million, or 83 cents a share, in the  
quarter ended April 4, compared with $96.3 million, or 75 cents a 
share, a year earlier. The results surpassed the 80 cents a share 
expected by Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the Minneapolis-based maker of controls for the home,  
industrial, aviation and space markets rose to $1.99 billion, from 
$1.92 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Home and building controls sales were up 3 percent to $805.7  
million. Sales of space and aviation controls rose 6 percent to 
$581 million. Sales of industrial controls were flat at $583.9 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell introduced several new products during the quarter,  
including a pulp and paper quality control system, and continued to 
cut costs and make its businesses more efficient. Honeywell said it 
was able to reduce costs significantly by paying other companies to 
make 70,000 circuit card assemblies per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Honeywell has said it expected worldwide economic  
conditions to limit core growth this year, the company expects 
continued strong earnings growth into 2000, said Michael 
Bonsignore, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Honeywell also announced it has signed a $250 million, 10-year  
contract with Chevron Products Co. to install and maintain all 
automation solutions at Chevron's refinery in Richmond, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Honeywell fell $1 to $89.37 1/2 in trading on the New  
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> GOP Lawmakers Want More College Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON -- House Republicans, setting the stage for this  
year's financing battle over education, called for at least a $1 
billion increase in federal grants to low-income college students. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, chairman of the Education and Workforce  
Committee, said Tuesday he would ask Congress to increase the 
grants when it considers spending bills later this year. Members of 
the GOP leadership support the plan, which they insist would not 
exceed the caps put on spending this year, Goodling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, the Republicans and several higher education  
groups want to add $400 to the maximum amount -- now $3,125 -- that a 
low-income student can get under the Pell Grant, annual federal 
scholarships that are awarded to needy students. The GOP wants to 
increase spending in other federal student aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration's plan for fiscal year 2000 would add  
$125 to the grant maximum. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president once again has listened to the pollsters,'' said  
Goodling, who contends Clinton favors his newer proposed programs 
over ``tried and true'' programs like the Pell Grants. ``He is 
meeting his political needs, not the real needs of students and 
educators.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton plan's significant increases, of 50 percent or more,  
were mostly for teacher-training, aid to Hispanic-serving colleges 
and GEAR UP, a college preparation program. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has accused the GOP of pitting higher  
education against programs for children. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan ``ignores the importance of preparing students for  
college,'' said Education Secretary Richard W. Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Diskey, GOP spokesman for the Education Committee, said the  
Republicans' higher education plan doesn't ask for any cuts in 
other programs, including Clinton priorities such as new teachers 
for class-size reduction, school construction and after-school 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Crafting the spending bill, which includes a wide range of  
programs and must fall within the budget, will not be easy, said 
David Kohn, spokesman for Rep. John Porter, R-Ill., who oversees 
the panel on education, health and labor spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``In general terms, Mr. Porter would agree with Mr. Goodling  
that support for higher education is the major priority for that 
bill,'' Kohn said.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Shooting Reopens Old Wounds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sabrina Steger was already crying when she picked up the phone.  
</P>
<P>
	She had been in tears all afternoon since she first heard about  
Tuesday's shooting at a suburban Colorado high school. A place 
filled with children -- like her 15-year-old daughter, Kayce, who 
was gunned down in December 1997 when another student opened fire 
on a group of students praying in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	Sobbing to a reporter, the Paducah, Ky., woman said she relives  
the terrifying scene of her daughter's death every time a new 
shooting happens at another school. Tuesday's attack was at least 
the sixth in the less than 18 months since then. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Dec. 1, 1997, all over again. How many more times does  
this have to happen?'' sobbed Steger. ``It doesn't get any 
easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others in communities across the country that have been  
devastated by school shootings said the latest violence just brings 
to the surface nightmares they have never entirely put behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter said a week ago, 'I wonder when it's going to  
happen again,''' said James Strand, who owns the dance hall where 
Andrew Wurst, 15, gunned down middle school teacher John Gillette 
at a graduation dance in Edinboro, Pa., last April 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``She said, 'I think it's just a matter of when and where,'''  
Strand said. ``And she was right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strand, whose wife and four children were at the dance, chased  
Wurst down and held him until police came. The survivors of the 
Columbine High School shooting have hard days ahead, he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has taken any innocence. It has stripped it from me and it  
has stripped it from my wife and my children,'' he said. ``Now we 
watch everything we do and everywhere we go, and that's the biggest 
loss for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edinboro residents had been planning a prayer vigil Saturday to  
mark the painful anniversary of the Gillette shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a very hard week for me. And this is not  
helping,'' Debbie Gillette, the teacher's widow, said of the 
Colorado shooting. ``It makes me sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell Wright, whose wife, teacher Shannon Wright, was killed  
in March 1998 in Jonesboro, Ark., said he heard about the Colorado 
shootings on his car radio as he was driving on nearly the same 
stretch of road that he was on when he learned his wife had been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just instantly think back to what happened in your own  
life last year and you feel for the families and what they're about 
to go through,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suzann Wilson, whose 11-year-old daughter, Britthney Varner, was  
killed in Jonesboro, was in Chicago on Tuesday with a safe schools 
advocacy program with which she now works. She said she was 
outraged by the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shocking that in this country, guns are portrayed as  
sacred and as something we can't put legislation on,'' she said. 
``Somehow, our Second Amendment rights are more important that any 
of the other rights that are guaranteed to us.''

<HEADLINE> Nazareth Mosque Compromise Gets OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Christian leaders in Nazareth accepted an  
Israeli compromise today on a dispute over a planned mosque that 
prompted religious tensions in Jesus' hometown. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal calls for a section of the ground outside the  
Church of the Annunciation to be designated for a mosque on 
condition that Muslims agree to remove a protest tent they have 
pitched on the site. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Nazareth's Christian mayor said he accepted the  
proposal. Muslim leaders, however, have rejected the Israeli plan 
and have sued to have the entire area dedicated for a mosque. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Islamic Movement in Nazareth, Salman Abu Ahmad,  
said the government offer, though well-intentioned, does not even 
begin to meet the Muslims' demands. ``How can they give us only 13 
percent of what is Wakf (Islamic Trust) property? It's a 
disgrace,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli authorities -- backed by some churches -- plan to build a  
plaza on the site to accommodate an anticipated flood of pilgrims 
during the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions over the plan led to an outbreak of violence over  
Easter weekend. Cars were stoned and shops were set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christians, despite their tentative approval, remain  
skeptical about the Israeli government's motivations. 
</P>
<P>
	Israel goes to the polls in national elections on May 17 and the  
Christians say the Israelis have drawn out the dispute in order 
play the two sides against each other and gain votes from both 
camps in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to use the incident for political purposes,  
specifically for the elections,'' said Ramzi Hakim, an aide to 
Mayor Ramez Jeraisi. 
</P>
<P>
	He questioned the need for a compromise, saying that Israel --  
which controls the disputed land -- does not need to consult with 
Muslim authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic tradition holds that the church is where the  
Angel Gabriel told Mary that she would give birth to Jesus. Muslims 
believe that a leading anti-Crusader is buried at the site. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that Bethlehem, the city where tradition has it that Jesus  
was born, has come under Palestinian control, Israel has been eager 
to promote Nazareth as one of its main attractions for pilgrims 
during the millennium year.

<HEADLINE>  NFL Eyes Coliseum for LA Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The NFL wants to put its 32nd franchise in  
the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	That does not guarantee, however, that pro football will return  
to Los Angeles. Still to be determined is an ownership group for 
the new team, which must satisfy other NFL owners with its stadium 
and financing plans. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced the league's  
intentions today at a news conference in front of the Coliseum. 
Eleven team owners, members of the league's expansion committee, 
were on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has not had a pro football team since the  
Rams, who played at the Coliseum before moving to Anaheim, left for 
St. Louis and the Raiders returned to Oakland, both after the 1994 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Some NFL owners who have opposed putting a team back in the Los  
Angeles Coliseum apparently have unpleasant memories of their teams 
playing the Raiders there. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there were owners who had their teams play against the  
Raiders here a few years ago who felt that there was a safety 
issue, a rowdiness issue,'' Mayor Richard Riordan said after he and 
other civic and business leaders met Monday with the expansion 
committee. ``Those are the ones who have changed their minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Raiders played at the Coliseum before moving back to  
Oakland, their crowds tended to be rougher than those at most other 
NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
	``The owners were very, very positive about Los Angeles,''  
Riordan said. ``A couple of them mentioned that they were negative 
until they visited our city recently. I feel very confident we'll 
get a team, and I feel very confident we'll get a team at the 
Coliseum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum, which would be gutted inside and rebuilt, became  
the only viable choice in Los Angeles after Michael Ovitz bowed out 
of the Carson proposal last week to endorse the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Riordan said that, among other subjects discussed at Monday's  
meeting, were parking -- ``They require 20,000 parking spaces'' -- 
and TV blackouts -- ``It's very, very important to the league that 
there are no blackouts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who will own the new team remains a large question.  
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, chairman of the  
expansion committee, spoke glowingly of Ovitz, although Richardson 
did not rule out Ed Roski, who headed the drive to get an NFL team 
for the Coliseum, and partner Eli Broad as team owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Roski, a developer, holds exclusive rights to any NFL deal with  
the Coliseum, but said he won't stand in the way if the league 
wants to hold an auction for the new team. 
</P>
<P>
	His exclusive rights would be relinquished if he were reimbursed  
for his expenses -- capped at $5 million -- incurred while seeking 
the league's franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've told them (the NFL) all along that we're not going to  
stand in the way of football in LA,'' Roski said. ``We would 
suggest a couple of things, local ownership, and reimburse us. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole purpose was to bring NFL football back to LA, and  
the Coliseum and we would like to be a bidder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roski spearheaded the building of the new Staples Center  
downtown, and also gave the New Coliseum proposal life. Broad, who 
could provide solid financial backing for an NFL team, joined the 
Coliseum efforts later. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners have seemed interested in having Ovitz involved in  
any deal with the Coliseum. Tagliabue called the Hollywood 
deal-maker a ``visionary,'' and implied the league could benefit 
from Ovitz's experience in the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no guarantee that Los Angeles will even get a team. The  
owners, well aware that the area represents the nation's 
second-largest TV market, voted 29-2 last month to spurn Robert 
McNair's Houston bid and award the franchise to the Los Angeles 
area on a conditional basis. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, suburban Carson also was in the running.  
</P>
<P>
	The NFL gave Los Angeles until Sept. 15 to put together an  
ownership and stadium package. If a deal can't be reached, the new 
team, which would begin play in 2002, probably will go to Houston.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Rise Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures rose sharply Tuesday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade amid forecasts for rains that could delay spring 
plantings. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, copper futures fell for the first time in four  
sessions, while energy futures also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans moved higher on continuing rains in the  
Midwest, which have increasingly stalled fieldwork and could lead 
to smaller acreage planted and lower yields if the wet weather 
pattern holds. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were boosted after Russia announced it would  
buy 250,000 metric tons of U.S. corn, a purchase many linked to 
Clinton administration donations to that financially troubled 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans also were supported by a lack of farmer selling out of  
Brazil and the United States, which boosted cash market prices. 
Russia also tendered for 100,000 metric tons of soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures rose after the U.S. Agriculture Department  
reported Monday that winter wheat crop conditions had declined, 
although most of the gains came largely on the strength of the corn 
and soybean markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 5 3/4 cents to $2.69 a bushel; May  
corn rose 3 1/2 cents to $2.24 a bushel; May oats rose 3 1/4 cents to 
$1.24 a bushel; May soybeans rose 7 1/2 cents to $4.95 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper futures fell sharply on the New York Mercantile Exchange,  
retreating for the first time in four sessions, amid profit-taking 
and fears a worldwide surplus will continue to build. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices in recent weeks have been supported by expectations for  
sharp production cutbacks in North America, which could have an 
effect on warehouse supplies monitored by the London Metal Exchange 
that have soared this year. 
</P>
<P>
	William O'Neill, director of futures research at Merrill Lynch,  
said prices likely have reached their bottom amid expectations for 
renewed demand in Asia and Europe for economic weakness in key 
consuming countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Copper is used mainly in construction, plumbing and electronics,  
making its fortunes heavily dependent on industrial demand. 
</P>
<P>
	But some market skeptic believe the Asian recovery will be slow  
and see few signs of better European long-term demand. 
</P>
<P>
	May high-grade copper fell 1.75 cents, or 2.5 percent, to 68.65  
cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures retreated on the New York Mercantile Exchange  
amid expectations industry figures this week will show increased 
inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers were anticipating the American Petroleum Institute would  
report crude inventories rose as much as 1 million barrels as 
higher U.S. prices attracted more imports. That, in turn, could 
boost refining into gasoline and heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
	The expiring May crude contract finished down 2 cents at $17.78  
a barrel, while June crude fell 15 cents to $17.48 a barrel. May 
heating oil fell 1.01 cents to 42.69 cents a gallon; May unleaded 
gasoline fell 1.03 cents to 52.41 cents a gallon; May natural gas 
fell 2.5 cents to $2.144 for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Polygamy Goes on Trial in Utah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOGAN, Utah (AP) -- A man accused of beating his daughter after  
she ran away from an arranged marriage to his brother goes on trial 
Wednesday in a case that has many calling for a crackdown on Utah 
polygamy. 
</P>
<P>
	John Daniel Kingston, 43, is charged with felony child abuse for  
allegedly beating his 16-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl, now living in foster care, says her father drove her  
to a family owned farm near the Idaho line in May and whipped her 
for disobeying Daniel Ortell Kingston, who had made her his 15th 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
	But to many, the real defendant in the case is not the father,  
but a way of life in Utah that has survived in the shadows for more 
than a century. 
</P>
<P>
	Though polygamy is banned by the state constitution and  
denounced by the Mormon church, the attorney general's office 
estimates there are 25,000 practitioners in Utah alone. 
</P>
<P>
	And though lawyers for both sides say the trial is not about  
polygamy, the Kingston clan is one of the most prominent polygamous 
groups in Utah, and the issues have become inseparable. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Polygamy) is the very reason this whole thing is coming  
down,'' said Owen Allred, the leader of a separate polygamous clan 
based in Bluffdale. 
</P>
<P>
	``Generally speaking, our people are very peaceful,  
mind-your-own-business people,'' Allred said in a telephone 
interview. But right now, he said, he feels like his way of life is 
on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	No large-scale bigamy cases have been prosecuted since the  
1950s, when agents raided the town of Short Creek on the 
Utah-Arizona line. The incident backfired when the public, enraged 
by images of families being torn apart, protested and the state 
backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-polygamy groups say prosecutors should attack once more.  
They say the brothers should face bigamy as well the other charges 
-- child abuse against John Kingston and incest charges against 
Daniel Kingston, who is to be tried in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're really missing the boat on this one,'' said Carmen  
Thompson, executive director of the advocacy group Tapestry of 
Polygamy, comprised of former polygamous wives. ``When you see 
crimes stemming directly from the polygamy issue, the polygamy 
should be prosecuted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clan led by patriarch Merlin Kingston goes by the name of  
the ``Latter-day Church of Christ'' and has about 1,000 members. 
The brothers are the sons of the clan's leader, who died in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Though not the largest polygamous group, the Kingstons are the  
most affluent, with assets estimated around $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When the issue exploded with charges filed against the Kingston  
last year, Gov. Mike Leavitt -- the great-grandson of polygamists -- 
said he thought the practice might be protected by the First 
Amendment. He soon backed away from that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say it is difficult to prosecute bigamy, the only  
charge associated with plural marriage. Marriages are often 
performed in secret ceremonies, evidence can be skimpy or 
nonexistent, and they don't want to gamble time and resources while 
more pressing crimes demand attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have concentrated and focused on the abuses,'' said Palmer  
DePaulis, chief of staff for Utah Attorney General Janet Graham. 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, the office is trying to educate members of  
polygamous groups, including the children, how to recognize child 
abuse, date rape and domestic violence. There is also a hotline for 
wives of polygamists. 
</P>
<P>
	But others say that approach treats the symptoms, not the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the underlying problem is the polygamous relationship  
that exists and they ought to be prosecuting that relationship, not 
just the child abuse,'' said Dexter Anderson, a Millard County 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Kingston case ``opened the floodgates,'' Thompson said  
her office has fielded hundreds of calls from plural wives looking 
for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can tell you that even if the prosecutor doesn't see this as  
a polygamy case, the public does see it as a polygamy case,'' she 
said. ``How long is the abuse going to continue?''

<HEADLINE> Man Sentenced in Restaurant Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An aspiring country singer accused of  
killing seven people in three robberies was sentenced to death 
Tuesday for the murders of two restaurant workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury took three hours to sentence Paul Reid in the deaths of  
Captain D's manager Steve Hampton, 25, and worker Sarah Jackson, 
16. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was convicted last week for the February 1997 slayings in  
which he stole $7,500. He still faces two trials on charges he 
killed five workers at two other restaurants in Nashville and 
Clarksville. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers claimed Reid, 41, deserved to live because he is  
mentally ill and brain-damaged. Prosecutors described him as a 
calculated, cold-blooded murderer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Show him the same mercy he showed Steve and Sarah. Absolutely  
none,'' prosecutor Roger Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Reid was paroled in 1990 after serving about eight years of a  
20-year sentence in Texas for robbing a steak house in suburban 
Houston. He hoped to be a country singer, and drifted between 
Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee.

<HEADLINE> Officials Mull School Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Metal detectors and surveillance cameras went  
up in the hallways. Idle threats went past the principal's office 
to the police station. Special events like proms and graduations 
were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year since a spate of school shootings, many principals  
and superintendents -- worried their students would copycat 
nationally reported incidents -- have cracked down on security. 
Congress and states have backed their efforts with money. 
</P>
<P>
	But as another violent school tragedy unfolded Tuesday,  
officials asked whether any school can protect against deadly 
shootings like those Tuesday in a Denver suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the great mysteries -- how do you identify a  
student who is going to act out?'' asked Barbara Wheeler, school 
board member in Downers Grove, Ill., and former president of the 
National School Boards Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools nationwide have taken steps such as installing metal  
detectors and surveillance cameras, tracking idle threats and 
profiling students with a potential for violence. At the slightest 
sign of trouble, principals and superintendents have responded: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A high school student in Starkville, Miss., was arrested in  
February and faces criminal charges for having a gun on school 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An eighth-grader in Clarion County, Pa.,, who had a gun and  
repeated a threat to kill teachers was arrested at Union High 
School after a fellow student told his mother of threats. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A ninth-grade girl in Virginia was suspended when she wrote a  
note to a fellow student expressing anger about her teacher giving 
her a D, and the teacher took it as a physical threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials must walk a fine line between youthful boasting and  
joking and serious intentions, said June Arnette, associate 
director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, 
Calif. But such talk shouldn't be ignored, said Arnette, whose 
private group now trains 100 schools a year to set up security 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are being more proactive,'' said Arnette.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the most widely used safety measures, she said, is an  
anonymous tip service. Students can phone in or drop in a secured 
box any tip, such as a student with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear what policies were followed at Columbine High  
School in the middle-class suburb of Littleton, Colo., where gunmen 
-- believed to be fellow students -- opened fire Tuesday. Deborah 
Fallon, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Education Association, said 
the state's 176 districts set their own policies. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 1997-98 year showed, violence can even erupt at schools  
that seem safe to teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In March of last year, two boys in Jonesboro, Ark., opened fire  
on a crowd of students at their middle school, killing four 
classmates and a teacher. Students also were accused of fatal 
shootings in Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., and Pearl, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a high school sophomore in Notus, Idaho, was  
accused of firing a shotgun in a school hallway, but no one was 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Most school districts haven't faced legal action for not  
preventing crimes, but they have been held liable for violating 
students' rights when imposing penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet schools have not backed off developing policies because of  
the threat of lawsuits, said William Modzeleski, the Education 
Department's safe schools chief. They have been working with 
attorneys to develop fair policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long-run, educators argue that schools must address  
mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	Movies and television programs that glorify violence teach  
children to resort to violence, said Kevin P. Dwyer, of the 
National Association for School Psychologists in Bethesda, Md. He 
also blamed access to guns. Colorado requires handgun permits, and 
bans the possession or use of a gun by minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something you can do with a metal detector,'' Dwyer  
said. ``We as a community have to teach kids to stop and think and 
respect one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials still say schools are safe. In 1996, theft  
accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the perception that schools are terribly  
crime-ridden. The perception is unfounded,'' Modzeleski said.

	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men wearing masks and dressed  
in long, black trench coats opened fire in a suburban high school 
today, scattering students as gunshots ricocheted off lockers, 
witnesses said. At least five people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	There were also reports of explosions in Columbine High School,  
which was ringed by ambulances and about 100 police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	More than an hour after the midday shooting, the whereabouts of  
the gunmen were not clear. Television images, broadcast nationwide, 
showed police cars and ambulances at a staging area near the 
school, and helmeted officers in camouflage gear. At least one 
person was seen being carried to an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Davis, a spokesman for the Jefferson County Sheriff's  
Department, said ``we do have injuries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now all I've got is there have been several shots fired,  
some explosions heard and some fire in the school,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some witnesses said there were two gunmen and the shootings took  
place around the school, including the cafeteria and library. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard the gunshots and we were running,'' said Kaley Boyle,  
a junior at Columbine. 
</P>
<P>
	``They walked down the stairs and they started shooting  
people,'' said a student who gave her name as Janine. ``We didn't 
think it was real and then we saw blood.'' Her voice broke with 
anguish as she spoke. 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was two young men, wearing black trench coats.  
</P>
<P>
	``They were shooting people and throwing grenades and stuff. ...  
Me and my friends got to my car and drove off. ... We saw three 
people get shot. They were just shooting. Then something blew up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Sapin, another student, also said the gunmen were all in  
black, in trench coats and masks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hid behind the school in the bushes and I saw them. When  
they started walking down the hallway, I ran and I ran and I hid in 
the bushes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Swedish Medical Center was treating three people for injuries, a  
spokeswoman said. At Denver Health Medical Center, a boy and a girl 
were being treated for gunshot wounds, said spokeswoman Stephanie 
Denning. 
</P>
<P>
	The conditions of the injured were not known.  
</P>
<P>
	Denver and Littleton police, and Jefferson County and Arapahoe  
sheriff's deputies were helping on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbine High is in the middle-class suburb of Littleton,  
population 35,000, southwest of Denver. It opened in 1973 and has 
an enrollment of about 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
	A series of school shootings since 1997 shocked the nation and  
led to calls for tighter security and closer monitoring of troubled 
students. Two were killed at a school in Pearl, Miss., three at 
West Paducah, Ky., five at Jonesboro, Ark., and two at a school in 
Springfield, Ore.

<HEADLINE> NFL Picks Los Angeles Coliseum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In what could be the NFL's first $1 billion  
deal for a stadium and franchise, the league wants to put a team 
back in the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue made it official Tuesday that  
the 76-year-old stadium is the league's choice for its 32nd 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet to be determined is who will own the team -- developer Ed  
Roski and his New Coliseum Partners, or Hollywood deal-maker 
Michael Ovitz, who endorsed the Coliseum last week after abandoning 
his proposal for a new stadium in suburban Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue did not rule out other potential ownership groups  
emerging. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Coliseum news conference, the commissioner also said the  
league's team owners decided against holding an auction for the 
expansion franchise, and instead will set a price. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying the aim was to make the New Coliseum a reality, Tagliabue  
added, ``If we succeed in doing that, we will be talking about a 
project that will involve, in round numbers, $1 billion of 
investment, in terms of the stadium, the Exposition Park area (site 
of the stadium) and the ownership of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league owners voted 29-2 last month to award the expansion  
team to the Los Angeles area, the nation's second-biggest TV 
market, on a conditional basis. They set a Sept. 15 deadline for 
reaching agreement with whatever site and group they chose for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Houston is waiting if a deal can't be reached in Los  
Angeles, Tuesday's comments by NFL officials and civic leaders at 
the Coliseum appeared to solidify prospects LA actually will get 
the team, expected to begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are looking for business plans, including stadium designs  
and site development plans, within the next 30-45 days, which puts 
us before our league meetings on May 25-26,'' Tagliabue said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Roski, who has spearheaded the drive to bring a team back  
to the Coliseum, and Ovitz seemed pleased with the commissioner's 
comments and the guidelines their groups received. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've picked LA, they've picked the Coliseum, they're not  
going to have an auction, and they've given us some guidelines,'' 
Roski said. 
</P>
<P>
	He had thought the new franchise was going to go to the highest  
bidder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of all the things said today, I think that (a set price) was  
one of the best things we could hear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there has been speculation Roski and his backers would  
unite with Ovitz and his group to get a franchise, Ovitz said, ``I 
don't know anything about putting the groups together. I know what 
we've been charged with individually. We both had separate meetings 
this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``You clearly heard what the commissioner said, which is that he  
wants to focus on a business plan and a public-private partnership. 
They made the decision that they want to try to develop the 
Coliseum, and as far as I'm concerned, that's fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue seemed to think other groups joining the pursuit of a  
franchise was remote, and noted Roski and Ovitz have a significant 
head start because of the work they've already done. 
</P>
<P>
	``If other people with similar qualifications were to knock on  
my door or the mayor's or Mark's door, I think they ought to at 
least be heard,'' the commissioner said, referring to Mayor Richard 
Riordan and councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, head of the league's  
expansion committee and a strong supporter of having a team in Los 
Angeles, said of the separate plans from the Roski and Ovitz 
groups, ``We're not trying to create competition. We're trying to 
get a team back in Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the price tag will be steep to bring a team back to the  
Coliseum, abandoned first by the Rams and then by the Raiders, 
taxpayers apparently won't be stuck with much of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all understand the reality of taxes in California since  
someone named Jarvis came on the national scene,'' Tagliabue said, 
referring to Howard Jarvis, who began a successful grass-roots 
movement to cut taxes in California years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``But by the same token,'' the commissioner continued, ``this  
has to be a public-private partnership in order to succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The historic Coliseum would be completely gutted inside and  
rebuilt under Roski's initial proposal, which might be modified 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz approached the NFL years ago about returning a team to the  
Coliseum and was rebuked. This time he proposed a shopping mall and 
stadium complex to be constructed on a former landfill in Carson, 
some 12 miles south of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL owners, however, favored the Coliseum because of its  
proximity to downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coliseum was the centerpiece of the 1932 and 1984 Olympics,  
and also was the site of the NFL's first Super Bowl. The Rams 
played there before moving first to Anaheim, then to St. Louis, and 
the Raiders played there until returning to Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles area has been without a pro football team since  
the Rams and Raiders both left following the 1994 season. UCLA also 
was a Coliseum tenant before moving to the Rose Bowl, and the USC 
Trojans are the only team remaining at the stadium.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Rates Drop, Mostly for Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans are stricken with cancer every  
year, thanks largely to drops in smoking, scientists announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The news is better for men: Although they still suffer more  
cancer than women do, the rate of new cancer cases is dropping 
eight times faster for men than for women, says an annual report on 
cancer by the American Cancer Society and government scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, cancer incidence has dropped 2.2 percent a year since  
1992, says the new report, published in this week's Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute, which analyzed cancer trends through 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists warned on Tuesday that tobacco use could reverse the  
progress: Lung cancer remains the nation's top cancer killer, and 
recent declines in lung cancer among men who quit smoking in the 
1970s and '80s helped fuel the overall declines in cancer incidence 
and mortality. But high teen smoking and new popularity for cigars 
have experts fearing a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we invest now in anti-tobacco efforts aimed at our  
youngest citizens, we will waste the progress we have achieved so 
far,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, cigarette smoking by high school students rose a  
disturbing 32 percent during the 1990s, report said. And cigar 
smoking -- which a second study published in the cancer journal 
Tuesday concluded is as cancer-causing as cigarettes -- has reversed 
a 20-year decline, rising by 50 percent in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to turn that around or we'll have another lung cancer  
epidemic,'' said Phyllis Wingo of the American Cancer Society, who 
led Tuesday's study. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingo used death certificates and huge government health  
databases to determine the rates of new cancer cases and cancer 
deaths through 1996, the latest data available. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer incidence increased slowly from the 1970s through 1992 --  
but since then has steadily dropped, about 2.2 percent a year 
through 1996, the report said. It's falling faster for men, 4.1 
percent a year, compared with less than half a percent drop each 
year for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer death rates also are dropping more for men, 1 percent a  
year, compared with 0.4 percent a year for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the gender gap? It's partly due to lung cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have known for several years that lung cancer  
incidence was slowly decreasing among men, by about 2.6 percent a 
year. At the same time, however, lung cancer was becoming a 
steadily bigger problem for women, who began to quit smoking later 
than men did. During the 1990s, lung cancer deaths rose 1.4 percent 
a year among women. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's report shows a glimmer of hope that women might be  
about to turn that tide: When scientists looked just at women ages 
40 to 59 -- the age group that first began kicking the habit -- they 
found a slight decrease in lung cancer. That's the same age group 
in which the male lung cancer decline first appeared. So a similar 
finding in women is a clue that maybe women's fate is about to 
improve, too, Wingo explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Lung cancer aside, the study found improvement in fighting most  
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But two forms of cancer are increasing: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma  
and melanoma. New cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are rising by a 
little over half a percent per year and deaths are rising by 1.8 
percent a year. No one knows why. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidence rate of melanoma, caused by too much time in the  
sun, increased 2.7 percent a year during the 1990s, although death 
rates have remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Although the death rate from breast cancer is dropping 2  
percent a year, there has been little change in breast cancer 
incidence, which strikes about 180,000 women a year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Uterine cancer levels stayed steady.  
</P>
<P>
	--When the report analyzed lung cancer by state, Kentucky had the  
highest male death rate -- 103.4 lung cancer deaths per 100,000 men 
-- and also the most teen smokers and adult male smokers. The most 
adult women smoked in Nevada, and most died of lung cancer there: 
45.8 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah had the lowest rates of smoking, and lung cancer death  
rates of just 31.5 for men and 13.9 for women.

	Greg Norman walked up the 18th fairway with the Masters champion  
for the second time in four years. If Davis Love III had birdied 
the two reachable par-5s on the back nine of Augusta National, 
perhaps he could have worn the green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later in the MCI Classic, Payne Stewart was in a familiar  
role -- complimenting someone else's final round and offering 
congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players, two weeks, one common denominator.  
</P>
<P>
	Winning is the best way to measure success, and all three have  
had their share. Together, they have won 42 tour events and five 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	But as golf has become deeper in talent and multiple wins have  
become a rarity, there is rarely enough appreciation for 
consistently being in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Of active players with at least 10 years' experience on the PGA  
Tour, no one has done that as well as these three. 
</P>
<P>
	For Stewart, who lost the MCI Classic in a playoff to Glen Day,  
it was the 25th time in his career that he has finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman finished third at Augusta, but he's no stranger to second  
place. Among active players, only Tom Watson has as many runner-up 
finishes (31) on the PGA Tour. Eight of Norman's seconds have come 
in the majors, and he's the only player to lose all four majors in 
a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was the Masters runner-up for the second time in five  
years. He has finished second 14 times in his career, three of them 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed I didn't win,'' Love said. ``But I'm pleased  
to have played another Masters and to have a chance to get nervous 
on the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no substitute for winning. Day made that clear when he  
choked back tears after his first PGA Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, anything less is too often perceived as failure.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Tiger Woods won once, was second twice and third  
twice. He had more top 10s than anyone (13), but was hounded by 
questions about his ``slump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval can appreciate the feeling. He was the ultimate PGA  
Tour bridesmaid for nearly three years -- seven times a runner-up 
from 1995 until he finished the 1997 season with three straight 
victories. He took a lead into the final round five times without 
winning during those ``lean'' years, and never once considered 
himself a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was being criticized for not having won,'' Duval said at the  
beginning of the year, before his 59 or the four wins that pushed 
his count to 11. ``It's kind of like if you don't win, you're a 
bum. What about kids who are coming up who don't have as much 
talent as some other people? They gave their heart, busted their 
tail, finished third, had a great golf tournament. That's not 
failing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval then pointed to the year-by-year listing in the PGA Tour  
media guide that shows number of victories, second- and third-place 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next stat they show is top 10s,'' he said. ``Why is that?  
Because top 10 is a good week out here. It's good playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How good?  
</P>
<P>
	Consider the following statistical review, in which 10 points  
were awarded for a victory, five points for second, three points 
for third and one point for a top 10. An additional 10 points were 
given for each major. 
</P>
<P>
	The total points were then divided by the number of years on  
tour, and yielded the following results: 
</P>
<P>
	--Watson, who turns 50 in September, averaged 31.4 points per  
season and was the highest ranked among active players on the 
strength of his 34 victories, eight majors and 31 second-place 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Norman, who joined the tour in 1983, was second at 29.9 points.  
While Norman has won 18 times and has only two majors, he has 
matched Watson's total of runner-up finishes in only 17 years on 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stewart was third at 24.1 points per year. Along with 10  
victories (two majors) and 25 seconds, Stewart has finished third 
20 times. Only Watson and Tom Kite have more seconds and thirds 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	--Love has been so good for so long that it's hard to believe he  
just turned 35. With 13 wins and 14 seconds, he was fourth at 23.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Woods were both around 40, although neither has been  
on tour longer than five years. Ernie Els was at 24.5 points in his 
sixth year on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus clocked in at 42.1, which accounts for every year  
through 1998. While his record of 18 professional majors might 
never be broken, it should be noted that Nicklaus finished second 
19 times in the majors alone.

<HEADLINE> Schott Agrees To Sell Share of Reds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Marge Schott's tumultuous 15-year run as the  
Cincinnati Reds owner is coming to a close. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with a lawsuit by the team's limited partners and pressure  
from baseball to sell, Schott agreed Tuesday to let Cincinnati 
financier Carl Lindner and two others buy most of her shares for 
$67 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott will retain one share and a few perks -- provided baseball  
goes along -- but won't have any say over how the club is run or any 
platform for her views. 
</P>
<P>
	After one full-fledged suspension for inflammatory remarks and  
two other disciplinary actions by baseball, the 70-year-old auto 
dealer with a fondness for dogs will no longer be synonymous with 
Cincinnati baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants the people of Cincinnati and baseball fans  
everywhere to know that she's grateful and loves them one and 
all,'' said her attorney, Frank Kelley. ``She hopes to still have 
time to encourage youngsters to appreciate baseball. She will 
always be a fan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It usually takes baseball's owners six to 15 months to approve a  
team sale, but the Reds' deal is expected to move quickly, perhaps 
with a vote as soon as June. Baseball's approval is the final step 
in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner and current limited partners George Strike and William  
Reik would buy 5 1/2 of Schott's 6 1/2 shares, including the two 
controlling shares. There are 15 shares under the current 
partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carl Lindner, George Strike and Bill Reik have been excellent  
limited partners in the current partnership,'' NL president Len 
Coleman said. ``I think with their leadership, once the background 
work is done, the fans in Cincinnati will be blessed with a bright 
future for baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schott's sale agreement allows her to keep an office in the  
stadium, a luxury suite and a group of lower-level seats at games, 
according to a source familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, baseball can negate the perks and is likely to at least  
deny her an office at the stadium. Baseball owners want to keep her 
in the background when the team changes hands. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball suspended her for one year in February 1993 and fined  
her $25,000 for language deemed ``racially and ethnically 
offensive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She returned early the following April, but made more  
inflammatory remarks and agreed in June 1996 to give up control of 
the team's day-to-day operations through 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, she agreed to extend the arrangement while she  
tries to sell the team rather than face another suspension for 
allegedly using the names of Reds employees on falsified sales 
records at one of her car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
	Managing executive John Allen, who has been running the team in  
place of Schott, will remain in charge and Jim Bowden will continue 
as the general manager under the new regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Although players hope that Lindner will pump more money into the  
franchise as it rebuilds towards the opening of a new stadium in 
2003, baseball's approval must come first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the change of control is approved by major league  
baseball, I expect we'll operate under the same plan as we have for 
the last three years,'' Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be a major difference in ownership style. Lindner,  
who owns the Great American Insurance Co., rarely gives interviews 
and prefers to stay in the background, a sharp contrast to Schott's 
love for the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindner is expected to remain a behind-the-scenes owner, much  
like the Reds owners who preceded Schott. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's been his style,'' Bowden said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lindner didn't attend the Reds' 3-2 loss to the New York Mets on  
Tuesday night. Neither did Schott, who usually attends home games 
and sits right behind the Reds' dugout for the last few innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a difficult time for Mrs. Schott,'' her lawyer  
said. ``To own a major league team and not be able to run it has 
been heart-rending. She did not want to sell her interest, which 
has been such an important part of her life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She bought control of the team on Dec. 21, 1984, and became  
chief executive officer the following July. The Reds won the World 
Series in 1990 with a team developed through the farm system, but 
her cutbacks in scouting and the minor leagues began taking a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Forced to spend on free agents, the Reds' payroll ballooned to  
the second-highest in the National League in 1995, the last time 
they reached the playoffs. The club has failed to contend the last 
three years with reduced payrolls and an unproductive farm system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great if the people who take over the team are interested  
in restoring what once was here, such as getting some good players 
in here,'' team captain Barry Larkin said. ``What's important is 
what happens on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was inevitable that Schott would sell. The team's partnership  
agreement expired at the end of 2000 and the limited partners -- who 
often fought Schott and challenged her in court -- were ready to 
oust her at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	She agreed in February to sell for $65 million to a group headed  
by Larry Dolan, the brother of Cablevision Systems Corp.'s 
chairman. Lindner and the two limited partners then exercised their 
right under the ownership agreement to match the offer and take 
control of the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Schott had one last controversy left. She rejected the matching  
offer and tried to sell to her cousin, Steve Schott, for $67 
million. The three limited partners sued Schott and got a court 
order last Friday blocking her deal with her cousin. 
</P>
<P>
	Four days later, she gave up the fight and sold.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Mr. Lindner and the limited partners have  
first-class character and run first-class organizations,'' Bowden 
said. ``I think it's a great day for Cincinnati Reds baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Cigarette Billboards Are Coming Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- In the Marlboro Man's hometown and across  
the nation, cigarette billboards that were once a celebrated part 
of the American landscape are coming down this week as part of the 
national settlement with the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In many places, the rugged cowboy with the cigarette dangling  
from the corner of his mouth will yield to images of young children 
delivering anti-smoking messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the $206 billion agreement between the tobacco industry  
and 46 states to settle state claims for smoking-related health 
costs, all cigarette billboards must be removed by Friday. The 
agreement allows states to take over billboard leases that had been 
held by tobacco companies and put anti-smoking ads on them at the 
companies' expense until the leases expire. 
</P>
<P>
	In Richmond -- where Philip Morris makes Marlboros and other  
brands at the world's largest cigarette plant -- one new billboard 
shows a young girl and a younger boy and reads: ``My sister never 
told me not to smoke. She showed me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billboards in other states feature children declaring, ``It's  
time we made smoking history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New signs in Washington state show a sinking Titanic with the  
slogan ``Tobacco Kills a Titanic Full of Washingtonians. Every 10 
Weeks.'' More than 1,500 people died when the Titanic sank in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the changes, tobacco images like the Marlboro Man and  
R.J. Reynolds' Joe Camel will remain ingrained in the public's 
consciousness, historians say. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who saw them as part of American visual folklore will  
continue to refer to them,'' said James Fraser, library director at 
Fairleigh Dickinson University in Madison, N.J., and author of 
``The American Billboard: 100 Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheila Hayes, spokeswoman for the Outdoor Advertising  
Association of America in Washington, D.C., agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're definitely part of the American landscape,'' she said.  
``People will continue to have an appreciation for them as a part 
of Americana, a part of history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the best-known signs: a Camel billboard that for 25 years  
blew smoke rings into New York's Times Square before a Winston 
billboard displaced it in 1966. In West Hollywood, Calif., a 
64-foot-tall Marlboro Man overlooked the Sunset Strip before he was 
recently retired. 
</P>
<P>
	Health activists welcome the removal of such attention-grabbing  
gimmicks, which they have long claimed were designed to appeal to 
children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, they say more needs to be done.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to get rid of this pervasive, highly visible form of  
tobacco advertising,'' said Eric Lindblom of the Campaign for 
Tobacco-Free Kids in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	But he noted that the settlement still allows ads no larger than  
14 square feet to be displayed at businesses that sell or 
manufacture tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rather large loophole,'' he said. ``That means they can  
put those signs anywhere that sells cigarettes even if it were 
right next to a school or playground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Banzhaf III, executive director of Action on Smoking and  
Health, a Washington-based anti-smoking group, said the demise of 
tobacco billboards is a mostly symbolic victory. Increasing 
cigarette taxes and imposing more restrictions on public smoking 
would have greater practical effect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this tricks people into thinking we're making real  
progress, it's more harmful than helpful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	From a business standpoint, neither the tobacco companies nor  
the outdoor advertising industry see the loss of cigarette 
billboards a major blow. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry spends about $505 million a year on ads,  
about 30 percent of it on outdoor advertising, said the research 
firm Competitive Media Reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Crosslin, spokeswoman for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. in  
Winston-Salem, N.C., said her company will rely more on ``print, 
direct-mail to age-verified smokers, and special events in 
age-restricted venues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry voluntarily gave up broadcast advertising  
in the early 1970s to avoid a government ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hayes estimated the tobacco industry accounted for about 9  
percent of the $2.3 billion spent on billboards in 1998, but the 
figure had been steadily dropping since the mid-1980s. She said she 
expects ads from luxury car makers and Internet providers to make 
up for the lost tobacco ads.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Crisis Strikes Europeans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- No one likes to say it for fear of seeming  
insensitive, but the feeling is clear among many outsiders here who 
have come to help: The horror is even greater because the victims 
are European. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not racial prejudice, but rather a strong sense of  
identity. Any one of those suffering Kosovar Albanian kids could be 
a daughter in Berlin or Barcelona or Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Terrified families crammed into trains or herded onto the road  
in the name of ethnic purity stir frightening old ghosts of Nazi 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet this is Europe in the last months of an enlightened  
millennium, more than 50 years after horrified civilizations looked 
at mass ethnic murder and swore, ``Never again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike McDonough of the aid group Irish Concern has seen it all.  
He lived through the worst of crises from Angola to West Africa, 
with Rwanda and Somalia in between. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my 17th country, and I've never been affected like  
this,'' he said. ``I'm from west Ireland, and these people look 
like me. It's different, man. It's different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Humanitarian workers are surprised by the level of interest back  
home. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talked to my friends and family about places like Goma  
(in Congo) or Somalia, they expressed polite interest and then got 
the usual glaze in their eyes,'' said Connell Foley, a consultant 
for Concern. 
</P>
<P>
	``But with this,'' he continued, ``they can't hear enough.''  
</P>
<P>
	Mary Njoroge, a Kenyan working with United Nations relief  
efforts, says that although there is less death and disease than 
has been seen in Africa, human suffering is not a matter for 
comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	She calls it understandable that Europeans and Americans react  
strongly to a situation to which they can identify. In fact, she 
added, ``I'm surprised that Europeans are not doing more for these 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although emergency food rations are arriving for the 600,000  
refugees in Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro, many are still 
desperately short of shelter and other basic necessities. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency rivalries, bureaucracy and coordination problems that  
often plague large-scale relief operations have not been absent 
from this crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But people far away, for whom this catastrophe strikes close to  
home, are paying close attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Smolian, an artist in Los Angeles, messaged a friend in  
Kukes that the familiarity of the victims overwhelmed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not proud of caring more this time,'' she wrote. ``In  
fact, it makes me ashamed of not caring enough the times before, 
when it (the refugee crisis) did not have a white face on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is hardly alone.  
</P>
<P>
	On April 6, AP photographer Jerome Delay photographed 2-year-old  
Albenite Baraliu, an orphan with blue eyes and sandy blond 
pigtails, after she fell from a tractor while fleeing into Albania 
from Kosovo. Bild Zeitung newspaper in Germany put the photo of 
Albenite, tearful but uninjured, on its front page. 
</P>
<P>
	Within an hour after the paper hit the streets, the switchboard  
received 10,000 calls. Within days, contributions to a fund for 
Albenite totaled hundreds of thousands of dollars, and on April 9 
she was flown with her grandmother and sister to Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	It is too early to assess how many ethnic Albanians the Serbs  
put to death since the fall offensive last year. The toll is likely 
in the thousands, monstrously high but well short of African 
comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rwanda, the total number of Tutsis hacked to death was higher  
than the more than 600,000 who so far have fled Kosovo. 
Cholera-haunted camps in eastern Zaire sheltered more than a 
million emaciated Rwandan refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Not many fewer Somalis -- mostly children -- have starved to  
death, trapped between warring clans and plagued by bandits 
stealing supplies sent to feed them. 
</P>
<P>
	For McDonough, though, the impact is not only the death of  
individuals but also the attempted assassination of a society and a 
culture by the leader of a country next door. 
</P>
<P>
	Others agree. Serbs have not only murdered fathers and brothers,  
burned homes and stolen ancestral land. From the meager loads on 
fleeing tractors, it is plain that they have also, in effect, 
killed the dolls and teddy bears. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough emerged shaken by a visit to a room full of  
well-educated, middle-class, urban Kosovars who with only a few 
minutes notice, were forced to flee for their lives to live in 
uncertain, miserable squalor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw 43 refugees crammed into someone's house,'' he said.  
``They were so cultivated. The father was a teacher for 36 years. 
His wife was an economist-accountant. They had a kid named Elvis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family had walked from Prizren to Albania, days on the road.  
``When I saw the shape they were in, with an 86-year-old 
grandmother, I just wept.''

<HEADLINE> Colo. Parents Search for Their Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Some jumped into the bushes. Some hid in  
classrooms. Others risked a run and made it to a park nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	In the chaotic aftermath of the nation's latest deadly school  
shooting Tuesday, students scrambled for safety and their parents 
endured an agonizing wait for news. 
</P>
<P>
	Crying and shaking, rescued students were taken by bus to an  
elementary school, where parents stood on fences and jumped up and 
down, straining to try to see their children. Cries of ``There she 
is!'' or ``I don't see her!'' went up as the buses rolled to a 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Smith, whose son David is a sophomore, waited for him at  
the elementary school. She said she and her husband split up to try 
to find him, but they had no luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't stand it,'' she said. ``It's so frustrating. He could  
be at the hospital, and I'm waiting here for three hours.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear late Tuesday whether David was found.  
</P>
<P>
	The students were brought to the side of the building and then  
paraded across a stage as their parents sat in the gym. The parents 
were unable to approach or touch their children until they were 
questioned by police, so they only smiled and waved. And because 
their children were untouchable, the parents hugged each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Lists of all students known to be safe were plastered over  
posters announcing PTA events. 
</P>
<P>
	When the students finally were allowed to leave the gym, they  
were met with hugs from friends and relatives who cried out their 
names and laughed. Some people held onto each other and broke down 
when a new wave of children didn't include the ones they were 
looking for. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bill Owens and counselors came to the school to try to  
comfort parents. Owens and his wife, Frances, walked through the 
gymnasium, talking to parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously the parents who found their children are happy. The  
other ones ...'' Owens said, his voice trailing off. 
</P>
<P>
	Wes Lammers, 17, was looking for his 14-year-old sister, Sarah.  
</P>
<P>
	``I hope she's OK,'' he said. ``She was right by me.''  
</P>
<P>
	Erik Mikelson, 17, was waiting for his brother at the elementary  
school. Mikelson said he had been in the weight room when he heard 
an alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just walked out like it was no big deal, but then teachers  
were running and yelling. But it was still unclear what was 
happening,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Sapin was in math class when he ``heard sounds in the  
hallway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He and his classmates bolted out of the room. He hid in the  
bushes outside school. ``I was very frightened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He eventually made it to Clement Park, where students and  
parents looked for each other and reporters gathered. Helicopters 
whirled overhead and dozens of police officers patrolled.

but returned to China at the end of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	They returned to the United States in 1950, settling in  
Manhattan in 1955. She wrote ``The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- James Copp, a cabaret singer and society  
columnist who also wrote children's songs, died April 7 of 
respiratory problems, the Los Angeles Times reported. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Copp collaborated with Ed Brown, a University of Southern  
California graduate, linguist and designer and wrote scripts for 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
	The zany songs described quirky characters such as the Glup  
family who traveled in a broken-down car with their pet cow. The 
duo made nine albums, and they are considered classics among 
children's recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	His act, called James Copp III and His Thing, caught the eye of  
a Columbia Records talent scout and Copp soon headlined with 
performers such as Billie Holiday, Art Tatum and Lena Horne in New 
York cabarets. 
</P>
<P>
	After serving in the Army during World War II, he returned to  
Los Angeles and wrote the column ``Skylarking with James Copp,'' 
for the Los Angeles Times, beginning in 1950.

Communist Party there would be no new China,'' died Friday at age 
75, the state-run Xinhua News Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cao began composing at age 16 and wrote more than 1,500 songs.  
</P>
<P>
	His most famous song became a standard of party propaganda. It  
was composed in the autumn of 1943, before the Communists won a

	TOKYO (AP) -- Shijaku Katsura, a popular performer of traditional  
``rakugo'' comic monologues, died Monday at a hospital in western 
Japan. He was 59. 
</P>
<P>
	Katsura had been in a coma since last month, when he tried to  
hang himself in his home in Suita, 250 miles west of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Toru Maeda in Kobe, Katsura gained popularity with his  
lively and innovative performances in a western Japan dialect, 
though he also performed in English. He also was known for his 
humorous looks, characterized by his bald pate and broad smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Laughing is a way to release stress,'' he once said.  
</P>
<P>
	After dropping out of the literature department at Kobe  
University, Katsura made his debut in 1962 under his previous stage 
name, Koyone. Using his English skills, Katsura developed his 
trademark ``rakugo,'' entertaining audiences in Europe, the United 
States and Australia since 1987.

	BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- Al Rawley, a radio and television  
personality who was the star of ``Popeye Theatre'' and co-starred 
in the ``Al and Aileen Show'' with his wife, died Friday. He was 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	Rawley's 60-year career included work in vaudeville as well as  
radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his career as a vaudevillian and radio star at age 13  
and worked with the Sons of the Pioneers, Liberace, Basil Rathbone 
and Gabby Hayes. His also worked on MGM records and the CBS shows 
for Armed Forces Radio at the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rawleys spent 10 years at Channel 2 -- now WLBZ -- in Bangor  
before moving in 1967 to WEMT-TV Channel 7, now WVII. Rawley hosted 
a popular oldies program on Ellsworth's WDEA radio station in the 
1980s. Mrs. Rawley died in 1997.

</P>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Former East German Premier Willi Stoph, who was  
dropped as a defendant in a manslaughter trial for killings at the 
Berlin Wall because of illness, died April 13 of a long illness. He 
was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoph joined a Communist youth group in 1928. He served in  
Hitler's army as a private in the artillery from 1940-42 and was 
released after being wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	He became East Germany's first defense minister in 1956 and was  
known as the architect of the East German People's Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoph moved up in East Germany's Politburo hierarchy to become  
premier in 1970, succeeding Otto Grotewohl. 
</P>
<P>
	As East Germany's communist rulers faced growing pressure for  
reform from a peaceful, popular uprising, Stoph was ousted Nov. 7, 
1989, along with East German leader Erich Honecker. Two days later, 
the Berlin Wall was opened. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Honecker and four other defendants, Stoph went on  
trial in Berlin on Nov. 13, 1992, charged with 13 counts of 
manslaughter in the killings of people trying to escape East 
Germany. He was dropped from the case in August 1993 after the 
court decided he was too sick to continue because of heart 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Honecker was also dropped from the trial due to illness. He died  
in exile in Chile in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Brit Retailer, Grocery Chain Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP)-- British retailer Kingfisher PLC and grocery chain  
ASDA Group PLC are merging in a deal that values ASDA at about 5.85 
billion pounds, or $9.44 billion, and would create one of Europe's 
leading retailing groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company would have sales of more than 17 billion  
pounds, or $27.4 billion, and interests ranging from supermarkets 
to electrical goods shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies rejected speculation that the merger was a  
defensive measure against possible European expansion by the 
world's biggest retailer, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that this is a way of keeping out Wal-Mart has never  
cropped up,'' ASDA boss Allan Leighton said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger would involve an exchange of 4.42 Kingfisher shares  
for each share of ASDA. Kingfisher would hold 66.3 percent of the 
combined group, with ASDA holding the remaining 33.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal would give ASDA shareholders a premium of 12.2 percent  
for ASDA shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies expect the merger would eventually create annual  
savings of at least 100 million pounds, or $161 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The merged companies would also be better positioned to  
accelerate expansion in European and other overseas locations, the 
companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingfisher owns the Woolworth and Superdrug chains and a  
do-it-yourself hardware business called B&AMP;Q. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingfisher Chief Executive Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy will hold the  
same role in the merged group. Leighton will be deputy group chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts have suggested that the merger may be a way of  
defending the market shares of both companies ahead of a possible 
expansion in Europe by Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, 
Ark.

<HEADLINE> Littleton Described As Anytown, USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A somber President Clinton reminded  
America that if a murderous school rampage could occur in this 
suburb, it could happen anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Littleton is Anytown, USA.  
</P>
<P>
	It is a quintessential suburb of 35,000, where rolling farmland  
in the shadow of the Continental Divide is rapidly yielding to 
suburban sprawl and soccer fields. A Republican stronghold, it was 
the site where Clinton opened the Summit of the Eight in 1997 with 
a campaign-style stop at the National Digital Television Center, a 
research arm of the telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of Littleton's adult residents have college or  
advanced degrees. As high tech and investment companies fuel 
metropolitan Denver's booming growth, dozens of new homes are 
sprouting 10 miles southwest of downtown on land that just last 
year was devoted to grazing and growing vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Leawood Elementary School, where horrified parents  
gathered to wait for word on their missing children, a horse 
pasture begins just beyond the swing sets. 
</P>
<P>
	The 475-mile Colorado Trail, which traces the state's most  
spectacular and remote mountain scenery, begins its uphill trek 
just beyond backyard fences and manicured lawns. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, Littleton can make the argument that it is among the  
oldest communities in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Just a few miles south of the school rampage, archeologists are  
struggling to save from bulldozers one of the continent's earliest 
sites of human occupation, Lamb Spring. Generations of prehistoric 
Indians used the site for hunting and game processing beginning in 
9,500 B.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Littleton's recorded history began with the ``Pikes Peak or  
Bust'' gold rush of 1859. A young engineer from New Hampshire named 
Richard Sullivan Little established a series of ditches to divert 
water from the South Platte River to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	In the late 1950s, the Pentagon ordered construction of the  
nation's intercontinental missile factory in a secluded canyon 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	At the factory, owned by Lockheed Martin, more than 10,000  
employees now build unmanned rockets and satellites for 
telecommunications and space exploration, as well as classified 
military projects.

<HEADLINE> Direct Pay Plan Can Simplify Things </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Q: Just about every monthly bill that comes in the mail offers  
an option for direct payment. Is it risky to let my phone company 
or credit card issuer take money directly from my bank account? 

</P>
<P>
	A: Merchants that offer direct payment -- aka automatic bill  
payment, direct debit and autopayment -- don't actually have direct 
access to your account. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments are handled in the same way as direct deposit for  
paychecks and Social Security checks, using an electronic network 
operated by the Federal Reserve and three private payment 
processors, including Visa USA. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, which is called the Automated Clearing House,  
currently handles electronic transactions among 20,000 financial 
institutions and 500,000 companies. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a 1998 Fed survey, 37 percent of American  
households use direct payment options for their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, there were 1.2 billion direct payment transactions  
worth $678 billion, an 18 percent increase from the previous year, 
according to the National Automated Clearing House Association, a 
not-for-profit industry group that sets rules for the ACH network. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong growth, less that 5 percent of all bills are  
paid through the network, says Louis Fuertes, a product manager for 
Chase Manhattan. He notes that 64 billion checks are written 
annually in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Europe, (direct) payment is the norm,'' says Fuertes. ``The  
thought of writing a check in a number of European countries is 
seen as a quaint concept.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the process is called direct payment, that doesn't mean  
your cable television company or mortgage company has direct access 
to your account and your finances. For each transaction, the vendor 
sends billing information to its own bank, which sends it to your 
bank through the ACH network. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vendor has your authority to debit your account, but it's  
not like an electronic hand that goes into your account,'' says 
NACHA spokesman Michael Herd. ``We don't know of a single case of a 
direct payment or direct deposit being lost or stolen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed survey found that 87 percent of those using direct  
payment said they were extremely satisfied or very satisfied with 
the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Direct payment may not be the best choice for people who live on  
a very tight budget and don't keep a close eye on their account 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
	But direct payment plans can simplify life. There's no  
check-writing, no cost for stamps, no payments lost or delayed in 
the mail, no risk of forgery or theft, and no late-payment fees. 
</P>
<P>
	And for those worried about privacy, direct payment actually may  
be superior to checks, which according to Herd, pass through as 
many as 12 hands from the time they leave your home. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, if there is a discrepancy, direct payments leave a  
clear electronic trail that's easy to trace. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is a dispute, consumers need not be left holding the  
bag while it's being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	When a complaint is registered within 60 days of the debit, Fed  
regulations require the consumer's money be returned while any 
investigation is conducted, says Mary O'Toole, a product manager 
for Chase.

<HEADLINE> O'Neal Ejected After 2nd Technical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers center Shaquille  
O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer, was ejected after drawing his 
second technical foul late in the second quarter of Tuesday night's 
game against Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal's second technical followed a shoving match on the court  
with 3:09 left in the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Golden State guard Bimbo Coles and Lakers forward Robert Horry  
were jawing with each other at midcourt when Coles suddenly pushed 
Horry. O'Neal came up from behind and shoved Coles. Teammates from 
both sides rushed in to restrain O'Neal and Coles, preventing an 
escalation. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal was then led off the court into the locker room.  
</P>
<P>
	Coles also was hit with a technical, his first of the game.  
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal was called for his first technical earlier in the second  
for arguing with officials in the aftermatch of a collision between 
Kobe Bryant and Golden State center Felton Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his departure, O'Neal had 10 points and four  
rebounds.

<HEADLINE>  Everglades Blaze Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES (AP) -- Curtains of brown and gray  
smoke rose from the burning Everglades today as fire officials said 
they were close to blocking the blaze that had charred more than 
130,000 acres of dry sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, the biggest one blackening pockets of the Florida  
landscape, was pushing toward the south and west and could cover an 
additional 40,000 acres before it is declared contained, possibly 
this afternoon, state forestry officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a chance that improving visibility late today also  
could allow the state to reopen a 60-mile stretch of South 
Florida's main east-west highway, Interstate 75 or the Alligator 
Alley, which had been closed since the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the fire -- about 25 miles northwest of Miami -- was not  
threatening any homes and will help the Everglades ecosystem that 
is home to egrets, bass, alligators and other wildlife, said John 
Fish, a spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is actually like a rebirth process,'' Fish said today.  
``Three months from now you probably won't even be able to tell 
this burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the wake of the flames, new sawgrass will sprout quickly and  
wildlife, most of which will have survived the fire by fleeing or 
submerging in pockets of water, will flourish, Fish said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Everglades are the way they are because of the fires.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dry, windy weather was expected to continue for several coming  
days, making new fires quick to start and difficult to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Fire crews have used controlled burns in an effort to block the  
Everglades fire's progress. They had hoped the Miami Canal, which 
runs about 70 miles from Lake Okeechobee to Miami, would keep the 
fire from advancing farther west, but flames jumped that barrier 
Monday, said David Stull, an operations specialist with the 
Division of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the flames reached the edge of the mostly  
undeveloped Miccosukee Indian Reservation, located about 60 miles 
west of Fort Lauderdale. And just to the north of the Miccosukee, 
sawgrass was burning east of the Big Cypress Seminole Indian 
Reservation, which is mostly cypress trees and swampland, police 
chief Tom Hernan said. 
</P>
<P>
	In communities immediately east of the fire, people with asthma,  
bronchitis and emphysema were urged to stay indoors. During the 
weekend, motorists in Miami had to switch on their headlights 
during the daytime because of the dense smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week,  
possibly ignited by a vehicle's catalytic converter. Fanned by 
swirling wind, it quickly became the largest of at least 2,515 
fires that have burned in Florida this year.

<HEADLINE> FCC Eyes Licenses for Radio Pirates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- To some they are the swashbuckling heroes of  
the airwaves who broadcast an untamed brand of radio from illegal 
transmitters. To broadcasters, they are brigands who interfere with 
legitimate commercial stations and sometimes even endanger air 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	They are radio pirates.  
</P>
<P>
	Until government regulators stopped him, Stephen Dunifer was a  
radio pirate for five years, airing political documentaries, 
programs by homeless people and music from his 50-watt FM station 
in Berkeley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Free Radio Berkeley'' was shut down because it didn't have a  
license from the Federal Communications Commission and thus was 
operating illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunifer and other pirates contend they offer listeners  
viewpoints they don't get from commercial FM stations. ``We wanted 
to fill that void,'' Dunifer said. Consolidation in the commercial 
radio industry, pirates say, is threatening diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Commercial broadcasters disagree.  
</P>
<P>
	``Let me debunk the myth of bigness is badness,'' said National  
Association of Broadcasters president Edward Firths. ``We have been 
able to provide more diversity than ever before.'' Economic and 
financial efficiencies gained through radio mergers have ``allowed 
some formats to continue to exist or to be invented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of pirate radio -- and an FCC proposal to open the  
airwaves to new voices -- are on the front burner as the National 
Association of Broadcasters meets this week in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the FCC obtained a federal court that forced  
Dunifer's commercial-free, 24-hour station at 104.1 FM off the air. 
He's appealing. On a good day, the station, which sometimes 
operated from different locations, could reach listeners within a 
five-mile radius. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the station -- without his involvement, Dunifer says --  
has been on and off the air since, with the help of unidentified 
sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, the FCC has tracked down 430 radio pirate stations,  
ranging in power from 1 watt to 800 watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of them are just the average citizen wanting to serve  
their community,'' said the FCC's top point person on pirates, 
Richard Lee. ``I was totally surprised. I expected -- I won't say 
militants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 75 percent of those 430 stations shut down voluntarily  
after the commission requested it. But for the remaining 25 
percent, the FCC had to obtain court orders that either prohibited 
the station from broadcasting or allowed officials to confiscate 
equipment, forcing it off the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Of that 25 percent, the FCC found about six stations operating  
with equipment interfering with air traffic control communications 
at nearby airports. Those stations were shut down within hours of 
detection. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are trying to land a plane at an airport and the radio  
tower has interference from the pirated station, you are not going 
to be real happy about it,'' said FCC Commissioner Susan Nests. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC does not have historical data to conclude whether the  
number of pirate stations is growing. But it's clear that new 
technology has made building a radio transmitter -- the key 
component -- very easy. 
</P>
<P>
	Those with little technical skill can even buy inexpensive radio  
kits. ``You're up within hours,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, the FCC -- in part responding to the pirate radio  
movement -- proposed starting a new, local radio service that 
churches, students and community groups could use to get on the 
air. It would create thousands of licensed low-tech FM radio 
stations from 1 watt to 1,000 watts, after a roughly 20-year ban 
against such licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	But the NAB and key congressional Republicans don't like the  
proposal, fearing it will create interference to FM radio stations. 
Others fear that white supremacists or other controversial groups 
could get low-power licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very concerned that the FCC proposal may have the effect  
of legitimizing pirates,'' said Firths. The FCC has not decided 
whether pirates who have refused to shut down would be eligible for 
the new licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency, however, does want any new low-power stations to  
meet the same standards as higher-power commercial FM broadcasters. 
To get a license, such companies generally must show they want to 
serve a particular area and provide information about any past 
criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunifer believes that still would be too burdensome and  
expensive for the average radio enthusiast. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way, we are better off being illegal,'' he said.

	``Wander This World'' (A&AMP;M) -- Jonny Lang  

</P>
<P>
	This teen-ager's exceptional first album, the 1996 ``Lie to  
Me,'' like any such startling debut, raised more questions than it 
answered. 
</P>
<P>
	This, his second release, answers them profoundly. Jonny is for  
real and this disc is a must. His ability, at age 18, is 
intimidating. As a singer, Jonny is settling down. As a guitarist, 
his play and sophisticated variety are astonishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Already a darling of teen fanzines, he has powerful friends like  
Mick Jagger, B.B. King and Buddy Guy. The sharpest track of this 
disc, ``Still Rainin','' has been getting rock radio exposure. Lang 
could emerge as Stevie Ray Vaughan once did in attracting a 
pop-weary audience to the blues. 
</P>
<P>
	But he is truest on his own, with some nicely written songs,  
refreshing variety and soulful vocals that remind us of Steve 
Marriot, a gravelly young Stevie Winwood, perhaps even Lang's own 
idol, Otis Redding. 
</P>
<P>
	Lang's covers of Luther Allison's ``Cherry Red Wine'' and  
Prince's ``I Am'' show a range that would be the envy of many pros 
who have been at it since before this kid was born.

	``Give Yourself a Hand'' (Arista) -- Crash Test Dummies  

</P>
<P>
	If artsy, pretentious lyrics laid over rhythm and blues riffs  
are your thing, you might want to consider buying ``Give Yourself a 
Hand,'' the latest from Crash Test Dummies. 
</P>
<P>
	After whispering their way through the funk-laced first track,  
``Keep a Lid on Things,'' this Canadian quintet spends the rest of 
the album imitating various voices that appear not to be their own. 
Whether it's the growling psycho-killer voice on ``A Cigarette Is 
All You Get'' or the blissed-out freak on ``I Want to Par-tay!'', 
the Dummies go through one musical identity crisis after another. 
Only keyboardist and part-time vocalist Ellen Reid fronts solidly 
and with true passion on three songs. 
</P>
<P>
	The album is more frustrating because the poor vocals (aside  
from Reid) obscure some of the smoothest multilayered bass lines 
and beats of recent memory. Too bad that musical high ground isn't 
enough to weather the storm of complacent songwriting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dummies should move Reid to full-time lead singer or start  
working on instrumental albums.

	``The Living End'' (Reprise) -- The Living End  

</P>
<P>
	This is a very strong self-titled debut album from The Living  
End, a power-punk trio from Melbourne, Australia. The lads gained a 
following after supporting Green Day on the Australian leg of a 
1996 tour and haven't looked back since. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-hitting band forges bravely ahead through the punk  
renaissance, laying down track after track with verve and authority 
behind the vocals of Chris Cheney. ``Prisoner of Society'' and 
``Bloody Mary'' are two of the strongest, but all 14 tracks are 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheney's full-speed and twangy guitar work is exceptional as The  
Living End sings about the ills of society, not with the quite the 
edge of The Clash or The Sex Pistols, but punky and infectious just 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be easy to write them off as Green Day Jr., three guys  
with a similar look and sound, but don't let this album slide by. 
The Living End is a solid group on its own and should quickly find 
a receptive U.S. audience.

	``The Best of Rockline'' (Priority Records LLC) -- Various  
Artists 

</P>
<P>
	``Rockline,'' the weekly live radio interview/music show that  
airs nationally Monday nights, unplugged its guests long before MTV 
cornered the concept. But instead of focusing on the long and 
varied past of the program, this compilation focuses on newer stars 
-- with mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the guests, who include alternative rock staples like  
the Wallflowers, Brother Cane, and 7 Mary 3, tend to play it 
straight with their versions of their best-known singles. But there 
are some bright spots, notably a keyed-down Lenny Kravitz with just 
two accompanying guitars on the touching ``Circus.'' And Matthew 
Sweet's incisive guitar style on ``Into Your Drug'' cuts through 
the live-in-studio format better than anything else on the record. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone else plays it by the numbers, which is too bad, given  
the alternative slant of the roster.

	``Homesick for the Road'' (Telarc) -- Kenny Neal, Debbie Davies,  
Tab Benoit 

</P>
<P>
	Cross the smooth approach of B.B. King, the gruff vocals of  
Bonnie Raitt, and the grittiness of John Lee Hooker and you come 
close to the composite style of this trio of talented blues 
guitarists. All three are good enough to front an entire record on 
their own -- and they all have -- but this arrangement works better, 
with each trading off vocals and lead duties and riffing on each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
	The record's best cuts include the Davies-led ``So Cold,'' an  
acoustic-tinged slow rocker, and the organ-driven ``Luberta.'' The 
rest of the record is equally excellent traditional electric blues, 
but isn't a rip-off of the aforementioned legends. Instead, Neal, 
Davies and Benoit stay true to their own styles while taking the 
genre another step.

	``Garage Inc.'' (Elektra Records) -- Metallica  

</P>
<P>
	If you think that if you've heard one heavy metal record, you've  
heard them all, then hear this. ``Garage Inc.,'' Metallica's 
collection of covers and tributes to its predecessors incorporates 
almost the entire history of the genre into two CDs -- one filled 
with new tracks and another with previous covers. And while the 
results are spotty, the highlights make the project worth a listen, 
especially since one of heavy metal's biggest acts digs deep into 
its past. 
</P>
<P>
	Metallica is usually at its best when it doesn't take itself too  
seriously, and that applies here. The four-piece band's rapid-fire 
cover of Budgie's ``Crash Course in Brain Surgery'' stays just on 
the right side of camp. And on Diamondhead's ``It's Electric,'' 
Metallica shows its knack for finding the hook among all the power 
chords. 
</P>
<P>
	Those looking for the crossover appeal will cuddle up to the  
band's edgy take on the Bob Seger road-blues classic ``Turn the 
Page,'' but the musical highlight of the collection is the 
melancholy ``Loverman,'' originally produced by Nick Cave And The 
Bad Seeds. The track shows how Metallica can tone it down while 
staying true to their heavy metal roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``Garage Inc.'' shows Metallica also has a sense of history, but  
more importantly, fun.

	``Valence Street'' (Columbia Records) -- The Neville Brothers  

</P>
<P>
	Art Neville began turning out versions of what he was listening  
to on his street in the 1950s. Brother Aaron hit it big in 1967 
with ``Tell It Like It Is.'' And yet the four brothers, including 
saxophonist Charles and percussionist Cyril, still manage to keep 
their sound fresh, as evidenced on their 14th record, ``Valence 
Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The record is named for the New Orleans street where the  
brothers grew up, and like that city, the band is a melting pot of 
styles. The record swings from the soaring soul of ``A Little Piece 
of Heaven'' to a funked-up version of the folk standard ``If I Had 
a Hammer'' to the smooth jazz of the instrumental title track. The 
highlight is something that doesn't sound good on paper -- a 
collaboration with rapper Wyclef Jean. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Nevilles' classic sound only complements the toned-down  
hip hop on ``Mona Lisa.'' Maybe the reason for the Neville 
Brothers' longevity is their timeless music. Or, as shown on 
``Valence Street,'' maybe it's because they have made it timeless, 
and uniquely their own.

<HEADLINE>  Everglades Blaze Being Contained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IN THE FLORIDA EVERGLADES (AP) -- The flames that have roared  
through the Everglades, cutting off the state's main east-west 
highway and casting smoke over Miami, are part of a natural cycle 
that forestry officials say will actually help renourish the 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is actually like a rebirth process,'' said John Fish, a  
spokesman for the state Division of Forestry. ``Three months from 
now you probably won't even be able to tell this burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columns of brown and gray smoke rose from the Everglades as the  
wildfire, which has consumed 155,000 acres, charred the dry 
sawgrass that is home to the alligator, the egret and the whitetail 
deer. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire is burning accumulated dry brush and excess plant  
growth, making room for new growth, forestry officials said. Such 
fires have swept the Everglades even before the arrival of humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters had the blaze contained within a perimeter of wet  
areas, levees and Interstate 75, the main east-west highway known 
as Alligator Alley. The highway was ordered closed over the 
weekend, but the smoke thinned enough Tuesday to allow authorities 
to reopen it to traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Alligators lay on blackened patches of sawgrass, basking in the  
sun, while herons pecked through the dark ash for bits of food and 
anhingas dove into the murky wetland in search of fish. 
</P>
<P>
	Some wildlife undoubtedly died, but most animals survived by  
fleeing the flames or submerging themselves in pockets of water, 
Fish said. New sawgrass will sprout quickly, and wildlife will 
flourish in the area that is burning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the fire will help the ecosystem, forestry officials  
said, containing it is important because in such dry weather, 
flames could quickly get out of control and threaten new areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The flames were burning in a section of the Everglades' roughly  
2 million acres that is outside Everglades National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A new blaze started just east of the fire's containment area  
Tuesday, and officials blamed arson after a Ford Explorer was 
spotted in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week  
and may have been ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic 
converter. Aided by swirling winds, it quickly became the largest 
of at least 2,542 fires that have burned more than 230,000 acres in 
Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Division of Forestry counted 27 new fires across  
Florida on Monday alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Forestry officials expect erratic winds and dry weather to  
continue in the coming days, making new fires quick to start and 
difficult to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	With rainfall far below normal during Florida's  
December-through-April dry season, officials fear a repeat of last 
summer, when fires scorched nearly 500,000 acres and forced 100,000 
people from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	State lawmakers on Tuesday allocated $5.6 million for  
firefighting equipment, and Gov. Jeb Bush said the state will rent 
a helicopter equipped with a 2,200-gallon water tank to fight fires 
threatening homes and will buy four 660-gallon water buckets for 
other choppers. 
</P>
<P>
	The state offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to  
the arrest and conviction of any wildfire arsonist.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Release Sonny Bono's DNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIO, Calif. (AP) -- Ex-wife Cher and a struggling actor who  
says he is a son of the late Sonny Bono are both seeking a share of 
the singer turned congressman's estate. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge in Indio, Calif., ruled Monday that the Washoe County,  
Nev., coroner must turn over a blood sample containing Bono's DNA 
so that Sean Machu, 35, of Marina Del Rey can prove whether he is 
Bono's son. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers filed in the Riverside County courthouse show that  
Cher filed a claim against Bono's $1.66 million estate last fall, 
alleging that her ex-husband owed her back alimony payments, the 
New York Daily News reported today. No amount was stipulated in the 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	Cher's spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg didn't return a call today  
seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bono was 62 when he hit a tree and was killed while skiing in  
South Lake Tahoe on Jan. 5, 1998. At the time of his death, Bono 
represented California's 44th Congressional District. 
</P>
<P>
	Bono's widow and political successor, Republican Rep. Mary Bono,  
said in court documents that she wouldn't contest Machu's claim if 
he is Bono's son, The Press-Enterprise of Riverside reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Machu, who already has had blood drawn for the test, said he  
would give up his claim if the DNA didn't match. 
</P>
<P>
	Machu's birth certificate of April 10, 1964, lists Mimi  
Georgette Machu as his mother and Salvatore Bono, a 29-year-old 
self-employed record producer, as his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Bono admitted having an affair with a woman named ``Mimi'' in  
his autobiography, ``The Beat Goes On.'' Bono wrote in his book 
that he didn't argue against the claim by ``Mimi'' that he fathered 
her son and paid a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Washoe County coroner's office had said  
authorities didn't contest turning over the blood sample but said 
they needed a court order before they released it. Ms. Bono and 
Machu have agreed in court documents to keep the results of the 
paternity test confidential, the Press-Enterprise reported. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't determined how the estate should be divided among  
Bono's heirs, who also include his two young children with Ms. 
Bono, and his grown daughters, Chastity Bono and Christy Bono 
Fasce.

<HEADLINE> IMF: Global Economy Will Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The global economy, badly shaken by a  
20-month-old currency crisis that has pushed one-third of the world 
into recession, should stabilize this year and enjoy a solid 
rebound by 2000, the International Monetary Fund predicted Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the financial crisis hit in July 1997,  
the IMF said it was able to revise its previous outlook upward a 
bit instead of being forced to admit it had been too optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the IMF's ``World Economic Outlook'' projected global  
growth of 2.3 percent. While that would be lower than last year's 
2.5 percent, it represented a slight 0.1 percent increase from the 
last IMF forecast issued in December. 
</P>
<P>
	For 2000, the IMF was even more optimistic, predicting a solid  
recovery, with world output increasing by 3.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF's 1999 outlook was bolstered by a sizable upward  
revision in expectations for the United States. In December, the 
outlook predicted U.S. growth would slow to 1.8 percent. But it now 
believes the U.S. economy will grow 3.3 percent this year, slowing 
to 2.2 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	That was offset somewhat by worse-than-expected performance in  
Japan and Latin America, which became the latest victim of the 
global currency crisis in January when Brazil was forced to devalue 
its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	But Michael Mussa, the IMF's chief economist, said the agency  
was fairly confident that the currency crisis was bottoming out and 
the foundation laid for a solid recovery next year. 
</P>
<P>
	For that recovery to be fully realized, the IMF said, the United  
States must achieve a ``soft landing'' with growth slowing to a 
more sustainable pace to keep inflation pressures at bay. Japan, 
the second-largest economy, will have to finally exhibit signs of 
emerging from its worst recession in a half-century, and Europe 
must find a way to bolster growth, which in recent months has been 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
	The 182-nation IMF released its new assessment of the global  
economy in advance of the lending institution's spring meeting at 
which time finance ministers are expected to resume efforts to put 
in place a new global financial architecture to make the world less 
vulnerable to Asian-style currency crises. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF forecasters saw little concern that the NATO bombing  
campaign in Yugoslavia will trigger serious economic turmoil beyond 
neighboring countries in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy was projected to shrink again this year, with  
output falling 1.4 percent -- double last year's plunge. The IMF 
said, however, there are hopeful signs Japan is finally emerging 
from its decade-long period of weakness. It predicted an end to the 
Japanese recession and slight growth of 0.3 percent in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF was even more optimistic about other Asian countries,  
where plunging currencies and stock markets in 1997 marked the 
start of the financial turmoil that spread to Russia and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Activity has recently turned around in Korea and seems to have  
bottomed out in Malaysia and Thailand,'' the IMF said. ``Investor 
sentiment toward many emerging market economies has rallied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This represented a much more positive view than just six months  
ago. After Russia defaulted on billions of dollars in debt, 
financial markets around the world were thrown into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve responded with a series of U.S. interest  
rate cuts that restored confidence and sent U.S. markets headed to 
new highs.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Jumps Into 2000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Bauer is betting that his hardscrabble  
background, bottom-up tax cuts and morality-bound foreign policies 
will set him apart from the crowded presidential field he enters 
today. ``Virtue is in free fall,'' the conservative activists says, 
and cannot be reclaimed for America without a family-friendly 
national agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reverence and respect are disappearing, and the question  
before us is: Will the family, as well?'' the Republican said, 
opening his long-shot campaign in a speech prepared for delivery to 
residents of Newport, Ky., his hometown. ``We clobber it with 
taxes; we marginalize it with judicial decrees; we undermine it 
with hostile policies and redefine it with trendy ideas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of a janitor, Bauer, 52, returns to the blue-collar  
river town across the Ohio from Cincinnati to underscore empathy 
for Americans of all classes and races. ``God's light shines for 
all,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Little-known outside Washington, the former Reagan White House  
adviser made his name in the nation's capital by running 
conservative political organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	He has a wide fund-raising base and deep roots in the social  
conservative community, but is still considered a long-odds 
candidate for the 2000 GOP nomination. He raised an impressive $1.4 
million in the first quarter of 1999, though the campaign has 
already spent much of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Gary is given half a chance to get his message across to  
the nation, he will be a formidable candidate,'' said longtime ally 
James Dobson, an influential conservative broadcaster who stopped 
short of endorsing Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer must outpace several other candidates competing for the  
same votes and convince increasingly pragmatic social conservatives 
that he could win a general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to see a candidate that not only communicates their  
issues, but also a candidate who can win,'' Christian Coalition 
executive director Randy Tate said. As never before, ``they are 
looking at electability this year,'' Tate said. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle, political commentator Pat  
Buchanan, radio broadcaster Alan Keyes, New Hampshire Sen. Bob 
Smith, millionaire businessman Steve Forbes and Bauer are competing 
for the same base. 
</P>
<P>
	While this is Bauer's first campaign, Quayle won the vice  
presidency in 1988 and Buchanan won the 1996 New Hampshire primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer's strength is his knack for communicating the values of  
grassroots conservatives, particularly on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand, without apology, for the right of the voiceless and  
defenseless to take their first breath, and be welcomed into the 
world,'' he said. He pledged to introduce legislation making unborn 
children protected by the 14th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Quayle, who declared his candidacy a week ago, Bauer made  
values a centerpiece of his announcement speech. ``We can build a 
powerful economy ... yet virtue is in free fall. If nights are 
filled with drive-by shootings and mornings bring new stories of 
babies tossed in the garbage like Styrofoam cups, can America be 
truly richer or poorer?'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised to eliminate a tax code that ``poisons the river of  
good will and betrays the American dream.'' He would replace it 
with a 16 percent flat tax that aides said would include tax 
credits of $1,500 per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes supports a 17 percent flat tax, with individual  
exemptions. Senior adviser Jeff Bell said Bauer's plan is designed 
to offer more middle- and lower-class relief than the Forbes plan. 
</P>
<P>
	In another departure from establishment Republicans, Bauer  
denounced trade with China. He said relations should be conditioned 
on the country making progress on human rights and democratic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``It cannot be business as usual when we are aiming consumer  
products at a foreign power and they are aiming nuclear missiles at 
us,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Such positions might get him attention but will hurt Bauer in  
GOP primaries, said strategist Grover Norquist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bauer and Buchanan are both pro-protectionist,  
anti-businessmen, which is 40 percent of the party -- maybe more,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bauer was growing up, his hometown on the banks of the Ohio  
River was mob-controlled -- rife with gambling and prostitution. He 
says he was a volunteer on a reform campaign that cleaned up the 
town in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer says he was raised on the poor side of town by a father  
who bounced between low-paying jobs and by a mother who helped 
pinch pennies.

<HEADLINE> Gore Tours Ohio Tornado Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ohio (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore commiserated with  
those who lost their homes and businesses when a killer tornado 
tore through suburban Cincinnati earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was truly inspired by the way everybody pulled together,  
neighbors helping neighbors,'' Gore said Monday. ``I was not fully 
prepared for how much damage there was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president visited the areas worst hit when a pre-dawn  
twister with 200-mph winds carved a narrow path through affluent 
subdivisions in Montgomery, Blue Ash and other communities on April 
9. Four people died. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry for what you all have been through,'' Gore told  
Laurie Arshonsky, whose home in Montgomery was destroyed. ``You 
people have really suffered through a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Arshonsky showed Gore a handful of jewelry and trinkets  
that she had recovered from the rubble of her home. ``What I'd like 
to do with my garden, I'd like to make it a tornado victory 
garden,'' she told him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last several years, I have had the occasion to go to  
several different parts of our country to see the aftermath of 
disasters, and every one is unique and different,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But one comparison I would like to make is this: I don't know  
when I've heard more compliments in the aftermath for the response, 
the organization, the hard work, the long hours the way everybody 
has pulled together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those of you who lost family members and loved ones will be in  
our hearts and in our prayers,'' Gore said. ``Those who have 
suffered such devastating property losses -- the business owners, 
the homeowners, apartment dwellers and others -- you are in our 
prayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Insured damage has been put at $66 million by the Ohio Insurance  
Institute; the total uninsured damage has not been calculated. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bob Taft last week asked President Clinton to approve  
assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for 
families, businesses and local governments in the tornado-damaged 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is under intensive review right now at FEMA. There should  
be some kind of word on that early this week,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, the vice president ate lunch with contributors to his  
2000 presidential campaign and moderated a public forum on 
long-term health care. 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 people attended the fund-raiser for Gore, where a  
spokesman for his presidential campaign said the campaign expected 
to net about $150,000 from the visit.

<HEADLINE> Health Benefits of Vitamin C Touted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Government researchers say the recommended daily  
allowance for vitamin C should be doubled or tripled because of 
increasing evidence over the past two decades of its 
cancer-fighting ability. 
</P>
<P>
	The current recommended daily allowances were established by the  
National Academy of Sciences in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	In a paper in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical  
Association, researchers from the National Institutes of Health 
said the RDA for vitamin C should be raised from 60 milligrams to 
between 100 mg and 200 mg. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mark Levine, an NIH researcher, said the recommendation  
reflects a growing body of research showing that five servings of 
fruit and vegetables a day can help prevent cancer. By raising the 
recommended amount of vitamin C, people are encouraged to eat more 
fruits and vegetables, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hower, the NIH researchers cautioned that there's such a thing  
as too much vitamin C. They said 200 mg is the maximum the body can 
absorb before it starts expelling the vitamin. Larger amounts can 
inrease the risk of kidney stones, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levine said the recommendations are based on an ``explosion'' of  
research conducted since 1980. Levine said the current 
recommendation is based on decades-old studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Vitamin C, which is not produced naturally in the body, is one  
of 13 vitamins and minerals people need to stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences' Food and Nutrition Board is  
reviewing the recommended dietary allowance of several vitamins, 
including vitamin C. The board is expected to release its findings 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The board will review the NIH paper and other research in making  
its decision, said board member Sandy Schlicker. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert on vitamin C and other antioxidants agreed it is time  
to raise the recommended dietary allowance of vitamin C. 
</P>
<P>
	``The old recommendation was based on very primitive data,''  
said Dr. Kenny Jialal of the University of Texas's Southwestern 
Medical Center, who did not participate in the study. ``The data we 
have today is more plausible and more biologically relevant.''

	Trivial Pursuit, this is not.  
</P>
<P>
	The creator of Loaded Questions says there are no wrong answers  
to the questions he poses. No wrong answer? 
</P>
<P>
	``If you were forced to kill one person living today, at your  
discretion, who would it be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where Trivial Pursuit comes up with brain teasers -- What country  
calls its organized crime the Yakuza? What mile-wide break in the 
Zambezi River has been dubbed ``smoke that thunders''? -- Loaded 
Questions often has no brainers. 
</P>
<P>
	Like this probing question: What is the longest you've gone  
without taking a shower? 
</P>
<P>
	Loaded Questions encourages players to give personal answers to  
more than 500 questions posed in a Trivial Pursuit-type setup. (The 
Yakuza are found in Japan; Victoria Falls is the smoke that 
thunders.) 
</P>
<P>
	In less than two years, more than 50,000 copies of Loaded  
Questions have been sold nationwide, and its creator, Eric Poses, 
has just finished production on another game. 
</P>
<P>
	Poses never planned on creating board games for a living. Until  
a few years ago, he didn't really know what he wanted to do. ``I've 
had a lot of wacky ideas that never materialized into anything,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in 1996, while waiting for a girlfriend at Miami  
International Airport, Poses said he was thinking about what they 
would talk about. A question popped into his mind: ``If you became 
president of the United States, what would be the first measure you 
would enact while in office?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relationship didn't last, but the question did. And it  
inspired the now 25-year-old Emory University graduate to create 
Loaded Questions. 
</P>
<P>
	A person rolls the die, then reads a card corresponding to the  
topic that they land on. Players secretly write down answers to the 
question, and the roller must guess who wrote which answer, 
advancing through the board with each correct guess. The player who 
advances to the end wins. 
</P>
<P>
	The questions are divided into four color-coded categories --  
hypothetical, anything goes, no brainers and personals. They range 
from ``If you were invisible, where would you go?'' to ``If you 
could change one thing about the way you look, what would it be?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think most people like to talk about themselves, and the  
game allows that,'' Poses said. ``People don't feel stupid playing 
the game. You definitely know the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poses said he didn't include any questions about sex or drugs  
because he wanted it to be a game that families could play 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheryl Stern, president of The Game Keeper, a nationwide chain  
of game stores, said she played Loaded Questions with nine other 
people before deciding to put it in her stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We loved it,'' she said. ``We decided immediately that it  
should go in our stores. The questions are interesting and you can 
learn about people really quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,150 stores across the country, including Toys R Us,  
carry copies of the game, which has a suggested retail of $25, 
although some sell it for less. After production costs, Poses 
clears about $5 a game. 
</P>
<P>
	The game industry is tough to break into because of the hundreds  
of new games developed every year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would consider him a great success,'' said Rick Loomis,  
president of the Game Manufacturer's Association based in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. ``He's one in 100, maybe one in 1,000'' to sell 
so many games in such a short time. 
</P>
<P>
	Poses formed his own company, All Things Equal, Inc., and  
initially printed 5,000 games at a cost of about $45,000 -- his 
parents helped with about two-thirds of that amount. His company 
has had sales of about $600,000 so far, and he has since paid them 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Poses had a good idea for a game, he backed it up with  
hard work. He researched his game by studying other question-based 
board games. He also referred to a color harmony book that helped 
him decide on a blue board with orange, purple, yellow and blue 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1997, he took to the road in his Honda Accord for a  
13,000-mile, four-month, 32-city tour. In each town, he went 
door-to-door to small toy stores to peddle his game, and contacted 
the local media hoping for some free press. He sat down with 
reporters in 12 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, Poses was calling Toys R Us representatives. He  
finally was able to sit down with a board member, and the chain 
picked up his game in December 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always confident of the product,'' Poses said. ``It was  
just the matter of getting a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Poses has already come up with 300 more questions for a second  
edition of the game, which he expects to release in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he is promoting his newest game, Group Photo, a  
children's card game that is part gin rummy, part Concentration. 
About 10,000 copies were printed on the first run of that game, of 
which he sold about 1,500 copies and donated 6,500 to 30 chapters 
of Make A Wish Foundation and to children's hospitals throughout 
the country. He recently finished a second production run on Group 
Photo. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with his continued success in the gaming industry, Poses is  
still a one-man operation working out of his apartment on South 
Beach in Miami Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love to sell 100,000 games,'' he said. ``At the pace I'm  
going now, I think it's possible.''

<HEADLINE>  Red Wings Begin Quest for Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There's a reason Detroit is known as ``Hockeytown'' -- an  
illustrious history that includes nine Stanley Cups and such 
players as Gordie Howe and Terry Sawchuk. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the Red Wings have yet to accomplish: winning three  
straight championships. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll begin that mission when they open the playoffs on  
Wednesday night against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks in one of four 
first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're deeper than we ever have been in past years in every  
position,'' goaltender Chris Osgood said. ``(But) if you don't play 
well, you're going to get knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round games on Wednesday, it's Edmonton at  
Dallas, San Jose at Colorado and Buffalo at Ottawa. The playoffs 
continue on Thursday with Pittsburgh at New Jersey, Philadelphia at 
Toronto, Boston at Carolina and St. Louis at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings won't have an easy time getting back to the  
finals. Two of the best teams in the NHL are in the Western 
Conference -- the league-leading Dallas Stars and Colorado 
Avalanche, who had a great second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at every (team) out there in the West, it's going  
to be a battle,'' defenseman Larry Murphy said. ``You can't take 
anything for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings' first-round opponents present a major obstacle.  
The Mighty Ducks feature two 100-point scorers on their top line, 
league-leading scorer Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to slow them down,'' center Kris Draper said. ``Our  
job is to go out and play as physical on those guys as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are the Stars taking the Oilers for granted -- particularly  
after what happened two years ago when Edmonton knocked them out of 
the playoffs in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned a lot from that thing that happened two years  
ago,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We know not to overlook 
anybody. We learned our lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, finishing with the best record in the NHL guarantees  
nothing. Ask the Red Wings, who won a record 62 games in the 
1995-96 season, yet were knocked out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 30 years since expansion, less than half the teams that  
had the highest point total in the regular season managed to win 
the Cup. The last was the New York Rangers in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the No. 1 seed is a burden you have to accept,''  
Hitchcock said. ``You know that going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Dominik Hasek playing for Buffalo and Ron Tugnutt for  
Ottawa, goals figure to be rare in the Sabres-Senators series. 
Hasek is generally considered to be the best goalie in the league, 
and Tugnutt had the best goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played a lot against Dominik Hasek,'' Senators forward  
Shawn McEachern said. ``We aren't expecting any high-scoring 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams played five times this season, resulting in four ties  
and a 3-2 overtime victory for Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche took the season series over San Jose 3-1, and have  
been on a tear in the second half after starting slowly. They 
finished the season with a 9-2-1 record, while the Sharks won only 
one of their last five games (1-3-1).

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Rebounding From Poor Day / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed today, with technology stocks  
showing signs of recovery from Monday's rout but blue chips losing 
more ground. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 34.93 at 10,405.60 after having fallen 53 points on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was up 32.02 at 2,377.63 after  
plunging 5.6 percent Monday amid a sharp selloff in 
Internet-related shares. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile technology stocks that took big hits Monday were  
mostly higher. Microsoft led the Nasdaq trading in volume and was 
up 1 33/64 at 82 33/64. Dell, Intel and Cisco were all higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet shares, which were pounded sharply lower on Monday,  
were recovering too, with Amazon.com up 9 1/16 at 168. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the tech group will stay down. This is just a  
normal pause to refresh,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market 
strategist, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc., St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;  
Co., in Kansas City, Mo., said he was encouraged at signs of gentle 
recovery in tech stocks after Monday's debacle. Investors embarked 
on the day expecting a recovery in tech shares, so they placed some 
bets in that stock sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``When tech stocks cratered yesterday, investors in general had  
someplace else to go,'' Belski said. ``While the vim and vigor is 
not present on this upside bounce that was there in other 
recoveries in the tech sector, it's good that people have 
alternatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While technology stocks recovered, industrial shares, which have  
been popular purchases for more than a week, were lower today. One 
of the biggest decliners was United Technologies, which fell 4 1/4 to 
140 3/4 despite reporting better-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Harrington, a technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in  
Charlotte, N.C., said attributed some of the blue-chip decline to 
profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is also a little bit of apprehension out there,'' he  
said. ``The fall in technology stocks over the last few sessions 
has created caution elsewhere in the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in a transition period and no one is sure what is  
coming next,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 4-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 477 million shares, 
down from 462 million shares on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.94 at 1,300.42, the  
NYSE composite index was up 3.55 at 619.43, and the Amex composite 
index was unchanged at 735.11.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Details Kid's Online Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government described plans Tuesday for  
enforcing a new law that bans companies from collecting personal 
information from children on the Internet without a parent's 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Trade Commission's proposed rules would require  
operators of commercial Web sites to make ``reasonable efforts'' in 
most cases to obtain consent from parents before asking children 
under 13 for their names, addresses, telephone numbers or other 
identifying details. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also would prohibit a company from enticing children  
with online games or prizes into disclosing ``more personal 
information than is reasonably necessary.'' They will be adopted 
after a 45-day public comment period and will take effect next 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	But the agency didn't suggest in its rules how companies should  
contact parents for permission -- such as by e-mail or fax -- saying 
only that it ``must be reasonably calculated, in light of available 
technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky said the agency sought to give  
control to parents over information about their kids, while also 
offering flexibility to different businesses on the Internet and to 
new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FTC, quite properly, left that open,'' said Ronald  
Plesser, an attorney who worked with the Direct Marketing 
Association and other groups. ``I think there will be a range of 
mechanisms. The beauty of technology is that today's problem is 
maybe an easy solution tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problems facing regulators involve the faceless nature of  
the Internet, where children often know more about the technology 
than their parents and can easily impersonate an adult with a few 
mouse clicks. 
</P>
<P>
	The government wants to protect children's privacy, but not  
through regulations so onerous they might discourage children from 
using the Internet or hinder the extraordinary potential for 
electronic commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parental consent is the key provision,'' said Katharina Kopp,  
a policy expert at the Washington-based Center for Media Education, 
which lobbied for the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 
passed by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without that, the whole legislation is really quite  
meaningless,'' Kopp said. ``We want the FTC to implement effective 
rules that don't create huge loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law doesn't require companies to obtain a parent's  
permission to collect a child's e-mail address to send him 
information on a one-time basis, such as a digital coupon for a 
video game. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proposed rules don't suggest ways companies might  
contact parents, the FTC said separately in a news release that 
possibilities include use of a credit card by a parent, a toll-free 
telephone number, a form signed by a parent or e-mail with new 
digital signature technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seemed to anticipate this was going to be a hot potato,''  
said Jason Catlett of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey-based privacy 
group. ``Rather than put up something that would be shot down from 
all sides, they'll let the commentators fight it out and take what 
they see as a satisfactory compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also require companies to give parents the choice of  
whether to disclose information about their children to other 
businesses, and to review whatever details were collected from 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy law was prompted by an FTC study last year of 1,400  
Web sites, including one where children were asked to give their 
names, addresses, e-mail addresses and ages and say whether they 
ever received gifts of stocks, cash, savings bonds or certificates 
of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Vice President Al Gore hastily stripped from  
his Web site questions asking children for their names, e-mail 
addresses and zip codes after The Associated Press raised questions 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials maintained the questions would not have  
violated the new privacy law, which isn't yet in effect and covers 
only commercial Web sites, but they decided to remove them anyway.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Are Wary of Underdog Oilers / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Two years ago the Edmonton Oilers delivered a  
shock to the Dallas Stars they'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>
	They knocked the Stars out of the Stanley Cup playoffs in the  
first round on a goal by Todd Marchant in overtime of Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned a lot from that thing that happened two years  
ago,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We know not to overlook 
anybody. We learned our lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, who have the home ice advantage throughout the  
playoffs because of their NHL-best regular season mark, meet a No. 
8 seeded Oiler team Wednesday night they beat three times and tied 
once in four meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the No. 1 seed is a burden you have to accept,''  
Hitchcock said. ``You know that going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonton has no problem playing up the underdog role.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being a complete underdog is a huge blessing,'' said Edmonton  
coach Ron Low. ``There's absolutely no pressure on us. The pressure 
is squarely on Dallas' shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas isn't the only team the Oilers have ruined in the  
playoffs. Colorado was ousted by Edmonton last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Curtis Joseph dominated Dallas in 1997, but he is in  
Toronto now and the Oilers have Tommy Salo in net. Edmonton won six 
consecutive games late in the season just to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wing Bill Guerin, the Oilers top goal-scorer, and center Josef  
Berenak are both recovering from knee injuries and their status 
remains questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Dallas will be without their captain, defenseman  
Derian Hatcher, who has been suspended for five playoff games 
because of the jaw-shattering hit on Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas wing Pat Verbeek is out with a knee injury and defenseman  
Richard Matvichuk will probably play, although he has a groin 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Edmonton is a dangerous team,'' Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk said.  
``They are notorious for picking up their game in the playoffs. 
We're going to have to pick up our game with Hatcher (suspended). 
We'll definitely miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull said there is no way Dallas will overlook the Oilers  
this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident but we know the other teams can beat us if we  
play like a bunch of arrogant dogs,'' Hull said. ``If anybody 
thinks we're going to walk over a lower seeded team they are sadly 
mistaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the way Low wants everyone to see it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't stand a chance,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The second game of the series is set for Dallas on Friday night.  
The two teams will meet in Edmonton on Sunday and next Tuesday.

	Wing Bill Guerin, the Oilers top goal-scorer, and center Josef  
Berenak are both recovering from knee injuries and their status 
remains questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Dallas will be without their captain, defenseman  
Derian Hatcher, who has been suspended for five playoff games 
because of the jaw-shattering hit on Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas wing Pat Verbeek is out with a knee injury and defenseman  
Richard Matvichuk will probably play, although he has a groin 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Edmonton is a dangerous team,'' Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk said.  
``They are notorious for picking up their game in the playoffs. 
We're going to have to pick up our game with Hatcher (suspended). 
We'll definitely miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull said there is no way Dallas will overlook the Oilers  
this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident but we know the other teams can beat us if we  
play like a bunch of arrogant dogs,'' Hull said. ``If anybody 
thinks we're going to walk over a lower seeded team they are sadly 
mistaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the way Low wants everyone to see it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't stand a chance,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The second game of the series is set for Dallas on Friday night.  
The two teams will meet in Edmonton on Sunday and next Tuesday.

	Shots Fired at Colorado High School  
</P>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two young men dressed in long, black  
trench coats opened fire in a suburban Denver high school today, 
scattering students as gunshots ricocheted off lockers, witnesses 
said. At least three students were injured. There were also reports 
of explosions in the school, which was ringed by ambulances and 
police officers at lunchtime. The location of the gunmen was not 
immediately known. ``We found out that our physics teacher was shot 
in the cafeteria,'' said Kaley Boyle, a junior at Columbine. ``One 
kid got shot in the library. We heard the gunshots and we were 
running.''

	Allies Urged on Economic War  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration officials said today  
they will use this week's NATO summit to push for allied agreement 
on economic sanctions including an oil embargo to deny Yugoslavia 
the ability to wage war in Kosovo. NATO allies remain ``rock 
solid'' behind the goal of the month-old airstrikes to continue the 
campaign until the Serb military halts attacks on ethnic Albanians 
in the Serbian province, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright 
declared at a White House news conference with President Clinton's 
foreign policy team.

	NATO Notes 'Disturbing Developments'

<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO is reporting ``disturbing  
developments'' -- reports ``too numerous'' to ignore -- of Serb 
soldiers raping ethnic Albanian women and using tear gas to move 
ethnic Albanians out of their homes in Pristina. NATO spokesman 
Jamie Shea said Serb military and paramilitary forces were staging 
``safari-style'' operations, shelling hills where ethnic Albanians 
fled to flush them out, marching the refugees on roads, putting 
them on trains to the border and then closing the border to them. 
Shea told reporters at NATO headquarters that the alliance was 
investigating reports of ethnic Albanians used as ``human shields 
in front of tanks,'' mass executions, and ethnic cleansing 
operations spreading from Kosovo into border villages of 
Montenegro, Yugoslavia's smaller republic.

	IMF Hopeful About Economic Crisis

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund reported today  
that ``significant positive developments'' in the world economy 
this year raise hopes that the worst may be over for a financial 
crisis that pushed one-third of the globe into recession. In its 
latest ``World Economic Outlook,'' the IMF insisted there are still 
plenty of threats around. But for the first time since the crisis 
erupted, it was able to revise its previous growth forecast 
slightly upward. The IMF said it believes the global economy will 
expand by 2.3 percent this year, just 0.1 percentage point higher 
than a forecast it made four months ago.

	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- A former waitress who was given a Florida

with four Waffle House co-workers, a jury said today. Circuit Judge 
Robert Kendall adopted the jury's advisory verdict and gave 
attorneys several days to tell him how they would divide the money 
among the five people. There was no immediate word on any appeal. 
Tonda Dickerson, who will have to share the $10 million, rushed out 
of the courtroom without comment. Mrs. Dickerson's Waffle House 
co-workers had testified that there was a share-the-wealth plan and 
that in conversations around the hot grill they often discussed how

<HEADLINE> Trainer Charlie Whittingham Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Hall of Fame horse trainer Charlie  
Whittingham, who sent Ferdinand and Sunday Silence to their 
Kentucky Derby victories, died today. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Eclipse Award winner, who had leukemia, was taken  
from his home to St. Luke's Hospital about 6 a.m., and died about 
8:30 a.m., said his wife, Peggy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferdinand won the Kentucky Derby in 1986, with jockey Bill  
Shoemaker, and the Breeders' Cup Classic in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Sunday Silence won the Kentucky Derby in 1989 when Whittingham  
was 76, and went on to win the Preakness and Breeders' Cup Classic 
that same year. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham trained 11 national champions starting with Ack Ack  
in 1971 and followed by Porterhouse, Turkish Trousers, Cougar II, 
Perrault, Estrapade, Ferdinand, Sunday Silence, Miss Alleged and 
Flawlessly, which won twice, in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham, born April 13, 1913, in San Diego, was inducted  
into racing's Hall of Fame in 1974. He was the leading trainer in 
career victories at Santa Anita with 868, including 204 stakes 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham first was taken ill last October when he missed a  
few days at Santa Anita near his home for what was described as 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a birthday party for him last week. And he was able to  
go to the races on Sunday, when he had two horses running,'' Mrs. 
Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor told me that sometimes when you get an infection  
like leukemia, the system just can't fight it. He was having 
trouble breathing this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham's son and fellow trainer, Michael, had taken over  
most of the work of the Whittingham barn at Santa Anita in recent 
months. When word of his death reached the Santa Anita stables this 
morning, a moment of silence was observed for Whittingham, a 
trainer at California tracks for 62 years. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 200 of Wittingham's stakes victories came with  
Shoemaker riding. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittingham's career was marked by constant achievements,  
including Eclipse Awards in 1971, 1982 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	He held the national earnings title seven times, from 1970-73,  
1975, and 1981-82. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986 he had a career-high 95 victories. His top earnings year  
was 1989 -- $11.4 million. More than 20 of the horses he trained had 
career earnings over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Wittingham was also the all-time leading trainer at both Santa  
Anita and Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 9, 1987, he became one of only five trainers to win four  
races in a single day at Santa Anita.

<HEADLINE> Trainer Charlie Whittingham Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charlie Whittingham, one of the greatest  
trainers in thoroughbred racing and twice a winner of the Kentucky 
Derby, died Tuesday of leukemia. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time Eclipse Award winner was taken from his home in  
Sierra Madre by ambulance to Saint Luke Medical Center in Pasadena 
at 6:30 a.m. He died about 8:30 a.m., said his wife, Peggy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a birthday party for him last week. And he was able to  
go to the races on Sunday, when he had two horses running,'' Mrs. 
Whittingham said. ``The doctor told me that sometimes when you get 
an infection like leukemia, the system just can't fight it. He was 
having trouble breathing this morning and I called the Sierra Madre 
ambulance people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A crusty ex-Marine with a quick wit and sharp tongue,  
Whittingham had a 62-year career as a trainer. He prepared more 
than 2,500 winners, with two of the biggest being Derby winners 
Ferdinand (1986) and Sunday Silence (1989). Ferdinand made him, at 
73, the oldest trainer to win the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	He was oldest again at 76 when Patrick Valenzuela rode Sunday  
Silence, who also won the 1989 Preakness. Sunday Silence was a 
distant second to Easy Goer in the Belmont Stakes, bidding for 
racing's Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	After two of his colts were Kentucky Derby disappointments in  
the 1950s, Whittingham decided to stay away from the race until he 
had a chance to win. That absence lasted 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He returned to Churchill Downs with Ferdinand, ridden by Bill  
Shoemaker, jockey for Whittingham on more than 200 stakes 
victories. Riding Ferdinand at 54, he became the Kentucky Derby's 
oldest winning rider. 
</P>
<P>
	``He liked the way I handled the horses and got the run out of  
them, didn't abuse them or override them. And I liked the way he 
trained 'em,'' Shoemaker said Tuesday. ``We had a good chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shoemaker recalled that Whittingham brought him to see Ferdinand  
as a 2-year-old, before the horse had been raced. 
</P>
<P>
	``He took me around to his stall and there was a big chestnut  
beautiful colt in the stall and he said, `We're going to have some 
fun with this horse. I think that we'll probably win the Derby with 
him.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham seemed to get the most out of horses, said  
Shoemaker, who became a trainer himself after retiring as the 
jockey with the most career victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham's son and fellow trainer, Michael, took over most of  
the direction of the Whittingham barn in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this week, Whittingham was out working with horses every  
morning, and for decades he was at the track by about 4 a.m. daily, 
Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess he'd been around horses all his life and through trial  
and error you learn how to deal with them and get through to them 
and think like they do and get the most out of them,'' Shoemaker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Born April 13, 1913, in San Diego, Whittingham was inducted into  
racing's Hall of Fame in 1974. He was the leading trainer in career 
victories at both Santa Anita and Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	He won thoroughbred racing Eclipse Awards as top trainer in  
1971, 1982 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Other champions trained by Whittingham included: Porterhouse,  
champion 2-year-old, 1953; sprinter Ack Ack, Horse of the Year, 
1971; filly Turkish Trousers, champion 3-year-old, 1971; Cougar, 
turf champion, 1972; Perrault, turf champion, 1982; Estrapade, 
female turf champion, 1986; Miss Alleged, female turf champion, 
1991, and Flawlessly, female turf champion, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He held the national earnings title seven times, from 1970-73,  
1975, and 1981-82. His top earnings year was 1989 -- $11.4 million. 
More than 20 of the horses he trained had career earnings over $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also the leading career trainer at Santa Anita and  
Hollywood Park. On Feb. 9, 1987, he became one of only five 
trainers to win four races in a day at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	His training career began in the 1930s but was interrupted by  
World War II. He saw action with the Marine Corps at Guadalcanal, 
and contracted malaria, 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946, Whittingham went to work as an assistant to trainer  
Horatio Luro in New York. Two years later, he split with Luro and 
went on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the owners whose horses were trained by Whittingham is  
Burt Bacharach, the composer-singer of numerous hit songs. 
</P>
<P>
	One day Bacharach didn't like the way one of his horses ran, and  
he asked Whittingham if the animal needed to be wormed. 
</P>
<P>
	Whittingham's reply, Jay Hovdey wrote in the 1993 book,  
``Whittingham: The Story of Thoroughbred Racing Legend,'' was 
itself legendary: 
</P>
<P>
	``Burt, I haven't heard too many hit songs coming out of your  
piano lately. Maybe you need to get that piano wormed.''

<HEADLINE> Experts Theorize About Ramsey Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The evidence amassed in the slaying of  
JonBenet Ramsey seems to point in two distinct directions: toward a 
family member and toward an intruder. 
</P>
<P>
	As a grand jury wraps up its investigation, prosecutors have  
identified only two people as being under suspicion: JonBenet's 
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
	But evidence pointing to an outsider has turned up, such as  
unidentified DNA material in the little girl's underwear, and a 
palm print and a shoe print found near the body that police have 
yet to identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The two theories, each with its supporting evidence, could  
create enough reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors to make a 
successful prosecution unlikely, legal analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is enough evidence that one of three people did it to  
make it impossible for the criteria of reasonable doubt to be 
satisfied,'' said Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, referring 
to JonBenet's parents and a possible intruder. ``It's what the 
Constitution set out. Whenever there is reasonable doubt, you have 
to acquit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dershowitz, who uses the Ramsey slaying investigation during  
class discussions on reasonable doubt, predicted that the grand 
jury will return an indictment in the slaying of the 6-year-old 
beauty queen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes no talent to indict,'' he said. ``Conviction is very,  
very different. It's a case where it sounds like it will be 
impossible to satisfy the legal standard of proof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Andrew Cohen of Denver, a frequent analyst for the news  
media, called the case ``a defense attorney's dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a defense attorney, you're going to be much more  
comfortable in this case, despite the fact that it is a horrific 
murder, than in one where there is a confession,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was early on the day after Christmas in 1996 when Mrs. Ramsey  
called police and told them she had found a ransom note demanding 
$118,000 for her daughter. Eight hours later, Ramsey said he found 
his daughter's body in the basement of their home. She had been 
beaten and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys, who since have moved to suburban Atlanta,  
repeatedly have denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have been criticized for allowing family friends to  
wander about the home and for asking Ramsey to conduct the search 
that led to the body. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, police and prosecutors were at odds for months  
following the slaying. The lead police investigator resigned, 
accusing District Attorney Alex Hunter of mishandling the case and 
trying to protect the Ramseys. Then, homicide investigator Lou Smit 
resigned, insisting that there was credible evidence of an intruder 
and that the Ramseys were innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury has been examining the slaying since  
mid-September, and those close to the case believe that its work 
will be complete by mid- to late May. The grand jurors could issue 
an indictment, choose not to indict anyone or write a report 
outlining their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the proceedings are secret under Colorado law, legal  
analysts believe prosecutors have presented evidence of both 
theories to jurors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without question, the grand jury looked at the possibility of  
an intruder because that's at the heart of any analysis of the 
JonBenet Ramsey case,'' said Denver attorney Craig Silverman. 
</P>
<P>
	Here is a look at some of the key findings in the slaying, based  
on information from published reports, and author Lawrence 
Schiller's book ``Perfect Murder, Perfect Town'': 
</P>
<P>
	-- Police have yet to identify a palm print found on the wine  
cellar door leading to the room where the body was found and have 
not found who made a shoe print found in dust near the body. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Unidentified DNA material was found in JonBenet's underwear  
and unidentified skin was found under her fingernails. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lab tests have confirmed a pen and legal pad found inside the  
Ramsey home were used to write the ransom note. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The voice of JonBenet's older brother, Burke, reportedly can  
be heard on an enhanced tape of Mrs. Ramsey's 911 call. The Ramseys 
initially told police Burke was asleep when they called. Silverman 
called this ``one of the greatest contradictions in the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- There was no forced entry to the home, but an apparent pry  
mark was found on a kitchen door jamb. In addition, several keys to 
the home were missing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A piece of broken glass was found on top of a suitcase under a  
broken basement window. An intact spider web was found on a grate 
that covered the window well, but entomologists believe a spider 
could have created the web on a warm winter day. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Police have never recovered the roll of duct tape or cord used  
in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case has been a defense attorney's dream since the  
Boulder police made the mistake of thinking it was just a 
kidnapping and not a murder,'' Cohen said. ``The only question is 
whether police work since then, or DA work since then, can overcome 
those monumental mistakes early on.''

<HEADLINE> N.J. Report Admits Racial Profiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Attorney General's office  
acknowledged Tuesday that some state troopers have engaged in 
``racial profiling'' in pulling over motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	Complaints that the State Police target blacks and Hispanics  
along the heavily traveled New Jersey Turnpike are ``real, not 
imagined,'' according to a report issued by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Attorney General Peter Verniero said the state  
is dropping its appeal of a 1996 court ruling that troopers 
demonstrated racial bias in making arrests along the turnpike. The 
court decision could affect dozens of pending criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't agree with everything that was said in that case, but  
in view of the report and our statistical analysis, the appeal is 
no longer appropriate,'' Verniero said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came one day after two troopers were indicted on  
charges they falsified reports to make it appear that some of the 
black motorists they pulled over were white. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Justice Department also has been investigating racial  
profiling allegations against New Jersey's state police. Similar 
accusations have been made in Florida, Maryland, Connecticut and 
elsewhere along the Interstate 95 corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	The state report concludes that, while six out of 10 motorists  
stopped are white, troopers are far more likely to subject 
minorities to searches and aggressive treatment. The statistics 
show 77.2 percent of motorist searches were of black or Hispanics, 
while only 21.4 percent involved white motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey overall is 74 percent white, nearly 13 percent black  
and more than 9 percent Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	The report suggests a clear policy saying State Police may not  
consider race, ethnicity or national origin in deciding who is 
stopped. It also recommends that the department monitor traffic 
stops more closely. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police leaders have consistently argued that the agency  
does not engage in racial profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Gov. Christie Whitman fired State Police  
Superintendent Col. Carl Williams after he said minorities were 
responsible for most of the state's cocaine and marijuana traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	The racial controversy could hurt Whitman among black voters as  
she positions herself for a U.S. Senate run in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, state officials announced misconduct indictments  
against two troopers involved in last year's wounding of three 
young minority men along the turnpike. The troopers fired 11 shots 
at their van, claiming the vehicle had suddenly backed up toward 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments were not directly related to the shooting but  
involved other traffic stops in the first four months of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Troopers John Hogan and James Kenna were accused of making false  
statements on the race of minority motorists they pulled over. The 
data was being gathered for a State Police survey prompted by the 
1996 court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Hogan and Kenna have said the two are being used as  
scapegoats in the broader debate over racial profiling.

<HEADLINE> Senator Seeks IOC Reform Updates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Saying that Olympic leaders had shown ``tepid support for  
reform,'' a powerful senator asked Tuesday for monthly updates on 
changes the International Olympic Committee was making in the wake 
of its worst scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Republican John McCain told IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch that ``significant skepticism'' remained in Congress and 
among the U.S. public that the Olympic committee would enact 
``comprehensive and meaningful reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who chaired a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on the  
Salt Lake Olympic bribery scandal last week, repeated that he was 
dismayed that the IOC had failed to embrace the recommendations of 
a special ethics panel headed by former Senate Majority Leader 
George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also was concerned that the IOC was dragging its feet  
on restructuring and other internal changes, and that the whole 
process still answered to Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tepid support for reform is further exemplified by the  
apparent lack of independence of the IOC reform process, and the 
slow pace at which the IOC effort is proceeding,'' McCain wrote to 
Samaranch. ``As a result, I request that you, as the individual 
responsible for the IOC, provide the committee with a monthly 
update of the progress of the IOC reform effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the scandal,  
which involved a million-dollar scheme to buy votes in Salt Lake's 
successful quest for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC established an ethics commission with a  
majority of outside members and a task force, IOC 2000, to revamp 
its membership, voting practices and public accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ethics commission is not scheduled to meet until next  
month, and only a quarter of the 24 members of the reform panel 
have been announced, one month after the IOC general assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000 is scheduled to make a preliminary report in June and  
have its final recommendations ready by December. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Samaranch, McCain asked IOC vice president Anita  
DeFrantz and U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl, both 
members of the reform commission, to provide their own monthly 
reform updates. 
</P>
<P>
	``In doing so, you will be performing a service to the Congress  
and, more important, to the athletes and supporters who are 
critical to the ongoing success of the Olympic movement,'' he told 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz and Hybl both testified at the Commerce Committee  
hearing, but Samaranch declined McCain's invitation, citing 
schedule conflicts. The senator's letter made it clear he remained 
upset by the snub. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me begin by expressing my disappointment at your inability  
to testify before the committee,'' McCain told Samaranch. ``As you 
have so often pointed out, it is you who is ultimately responsible 
for the IOC.''

<HEADLINE> China Firm To Clean Up Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China took its first serious step toward cleaning  
up its ailing state-run banks Tuesday by opening a special company 
to help one of those banks write off bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Xinda Asset Management Co. will buy $36 billion in defaulted  
or problem loans from the China Construction Bank, or about a 
quarter of the bank's entire loan portfolio, banking officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modeled on the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp., which rescued  
bankrupt savings and loans associations in the early 1990s, Xinda 
will try to recover as much of those loans as possible by such 
measures as selling off borrowers' assets. 
</P>
<P>
	If Xinda is successful, China's three other state-run banks --  
Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the 
Agricultural Bank of China -- are all expected to follow suit by 
opening similar asset management companies, bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
	All four state-run banks racked up enormous losses on lending to  
state enterprises and real estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Xinda will be started with $1.2 billion in seed money from the  
Ministry of Finance. It will also be able to raise funds by selling 
bonds guaranteed by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Its president and vice president will be appointed directly by  
the State Council, China's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	International concern over China's banking industry has  
intensified since the bankruptcy in January of Guangdong 
International Trust and Investment Corp., the investment arm of one 
of China's wealthiest provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	China's central bank has tried to reassure investors by saying  
bad loans total less than 10 percent of all bank loans. But 
analysts put that figure closer to 25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Games Postponed After Colo. Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Like several of his Colorado Rockies teammates,  
Chuck McElroy could only watch in silence as details emerged about 
a deadly shooting at a Denver-area high school. 
</P>
<P>
	McElroy was no longer a major league relief pitcher. He was  
simply an emotional father of two. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had tears in my eyes,'' McElroy said before the Rockies  
postponed Tuesday night's game between Colorado and the Montreal 
Expos. ``I told the bullpen, `You think you're pitching bad, just 
turn on the TV.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting at Columbine High School in suburban Littleton also  
prompted the Denver Nuggets to postpone their game against the 
Portland Trail Blazers. General manager Dan Issel said the game 
likely will be rescheduled, probably on either April 27 or May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal-Colorado game will be made up as part of a split  
doubleheader when the Expos return to Colorado for a three-games 
series Aug. 13-15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't have played,'' Expos third baseman Shane Andrews  
said. ``I had a hard time just being on the field. Thinking about 
it makes me sick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rockies owner Jerry McMorris talked to baseball commissioner Bud  
Selig before deciding to postpone the game as horrifying details 
emerged about the shooting. Authorities said as many as 25 people 
were dead, including two young gunmen dressed in fatigues and black 
trench coats. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start thinking about life,'' Rockies first baseman Todd  
Helton said. ``Players in here are sort of in our own little world, 
and this sort of opens your eyes a little bit to how important life 
is and how important kids are. That's the thing -- those are just 
kids in there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris, clearly troubled by the shooting, said he did not know  
if any Rockies employees had children who were killed or injured 
when the gunmen started opening fire at about 11:30 a.m. MDT. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not right for us to play,'' McMorris said. ``Our players  
don't want to play, and nobody in the organization wants to play. 
Our hearts and prayers go out to the families in that community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montreal manager Felipe Alou, who managed the Triple-A Denver  
Bears in 1981, supported the decision to postpone the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't play,'' he said. ``We can't even play cards  
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Bohanon (2-0), Tuesday's scheduled starter for Colorado  
will pitch Wednesday. Montreal will skip Mike Thurman (0-1) in the 
rotation and stick with Wednesday's scheduled starter, Dustin 
Hermanson. (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
	Bohanon, who has five children, had no problem waiting another  
day to take the mound as he watched a scene that has become all too 
familiar at American schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1997, 12 students have been killed in shootings at schools  
in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and 
Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can happen to anyone,'' Bohanon said. ``The way things are  
going nowadays, it's popping up all over the country. It's a 
tragedy. They're just kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked when he made the decision to seek league approval to call  
off the basketball game, Issel said: ``It was pretty easy once we 
heard the extent of the tragedy. I mean, athletic contests hold 
little meaning after that. We decided to cancel it as soon as we 
heard how bad it was. It took us a little while because we had to 
get an OK from the league office and it took some time to run down 
people in New York who were high enough up to OK it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Issel said he has a friend ``who has two children attending  
Columbine High School, and at 3:30 he had heard from one of them 
but hadn't heard from the other. I don't know what you can even 
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nuggets forward Eric Williams was stunned.  
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty-some people were murdered,'' Williams said. ``Where can  
your kids be safe? On the streets? 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a son who is 4 years old back in New Jersey. I'm  
thinking that while he's in preschool, that's the least of my 
worries, that something like this might happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel for those families. You send your kids away to school  
this morning on a peaceful note and come home to something tragic 
like this.''

<HEADLINE> NHL May Back Lemieux Ownership Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The NHL is expected to back Mario Lemieux's  
ownership bid for the bankrupt Pittsburgh Penguins and hinted it 
could revoke the team's franchise if he does not gain control. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL plans to file legal documents Friday supporting the  
Lemieux group and offering to work with him to get the Penguins out 
of bankruptcy, league and legal sources close to the proceedings 
told The Associated Press. The NHL wants the matter settled by June 
at the latest, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league is eager for a new owner -- Lemieux -- and a  
reorganization plan to be in place by then so budgets for the 
1999-2000 season can be made, players can be signed and season 
tickets can be sold. 
</P>
<P>
	For that reason, the league is discouraging Florida investment  
banker Chip Gesner from submitting a bid, one that might further 
slow the process, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people could buy the Penguins, but one person can  
save them: Mario Lemieux,'' Penguins spokesman Tom McMillan said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Bernard Markovitz has scheduled a  
hearing on Lemieux's takeover bid for April 30. Markovitz has no 
obligation to follow the NHL's advice and choose the Lemieux group, 
but the league does have some leverage. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NHL does not agree with the choice of owners, it could  
reject the judge's recommendation and revoke the franchise, 
essentially making it worthless. 
</P>
<P>
	William Daly, the NHL's vice president for legal affairs, said  
the revocation of the franchise is an unwanted but valid way for 
the league to settle the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NHL constitution, the Penguins' players then could be  
distributed throughout the league or the franchise could be awarded 
to a new city. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL has not set a firm date to resolve the Penguins'  
situation, but the next step could be to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything that sets a deadline ... is positive to keeping the  
Penguins in Pittsburgh,'' McMillan said. ``We've been in bankruptcy 
since October and time is of the essence. In the NHL, next season 
begins in June. We have to make decisions about payroll and the 
budget and about signing players. And we've got to sell tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since Lemieux retired after the 1996-97 season and the Penguins'  
financial situation worsened, the team's season-ticket base has 
dropped from 12,000 to 8,300. By contrast, expansion franchises 
must guarantee season-ticket sales of 12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't have another disastrous season ticket-selling  
season,'' McMillan said. ``If Mario's group gets in there, there 
are a lot of things that could be done right away to sell 
tickets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest hangup to reorganizing the Penguins' finances is the  
lack of a new lease with Spectacor Management Group, which operates 
the Civic Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing in the NHL's oldest arena, the Penguins' pay the  
steepest annual rent, an estimated $6 million to $7 million that is 
blamed for much of the team's financial problems. The lease was 
renegotiated several times under co-owner Howard Baldwin to supply 
cash needed to keep the team going. 
</P>
<P>
	Privately, the Lemieux group is hopeful that the threat of the  
Penguins folding or being relocated will be enough to spur city and 
county officials into pressuring SMG to renegotiate. However, 
lawyers for Lemieux and co-owner Roger Marino said the lease talks 
have gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless, Lemieux remains optimistic he will become the first  
former player in the history of modern major pro sports in the 
United States to buy his former team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that Wayne (Gretzky) might want to someday,''  
Lemieux said. ``Maybe we could go at it someday as owners the way 
we did as players.''

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Begin Quest for Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	There's a reason Detroit is known as ``Hockeytown'' -- an  
illustrious history that includes nine Stanley Cups and such 
players as Gordie Howe and Terry Sawchuk. 
</P>
<P>
	One thing the Red Wings have yet to accomplish: winning three  
straight championships. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll begin that mission when they open the playoffs on  
Wednesday night against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks in one of four 
first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're deeper than we ever have been in past years in every  
position,'' goaltender Chris Osgood said. ``(But) if you don't play 
well, you're going to get knocked out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other first-round games on Wednesday, it's Edmonton at  
Dallas, San Jose at Colorado and Buffalo at Ottawa. The playoffs 
continue on Thursday with Pittsburgh at New Jersey, Philadelphia at 
Toronto, Boston at Carolina and St. Louis at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings won't have an easy time getting back to the  
finals. Two of the best teams in the NHL are in the Western 
Conference -- the league-leading Dallas Stars and Colorado 
Avalanche, who had a great second half. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at every (team) out there in the West, it's going  
to be a battle,'' defenseman Larry Murphy said. ``You can't take 
anything for granted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings' first-round opponents present a major obstacle.  
The Mighty Ducks feature two 100-point scorers on their top line, 
league-leading scorer Teemu Selanne and Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to slow them down,'' center Kris Draper said. ``Our  
job is to go out and play as physical on those guys as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor are the Stars taking the Oilers for granted -- particularly  
after what happened two years ago when Edmonton knocked them out of 
the playoffs in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned a lot from that thing that happened two years  
ago,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We know not to overlook 
anybody. We learned our lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, finishing with the best record in the NHL guarantees  
nothing. Ask the Red Wings, who won a record 62 games in the 
1995-96 season, yet were knocked out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 30 years since expansion, less than half the teams that  
had the highest point total in the regular season managed to win 
the Cup. The last was the New York Rangers in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the No. 1 seed is a burden you have to accept,''  
Hitchcock said. ``You know that going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Dominik Hasek playing for Buffalo and Ron Tugnutt for  
Ottawa, goals figure to be rare in the Sabres-Senators series. 
Hasek is generally considered to be the best goalie in the league, 
and Tugnutt had the best goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've played a lot against Dominik Hasek,'' Senators forward  
Shawn McEachern said. ``We aren't expecting any high-scoring 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The teams played five times this season, resulting in four ties  
and a 3-2 overtime victory for Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche took the season series over San Jose 3-1, and have  
been on a tear in the second half after starting slowly. They 
finished the season with a 9-2-1 record, while the Sharks won only 
one of their last five games (1-3-1).

<HEADLINE> Apple Unveils New QuickTime Version </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc., seeking to  
strengthen its position in the delivery of audio and video files 
over the Internet, has introduced a new version of its QuickTime 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	QuickTime 4 software, unlike its predecessor QuickTime 3, allows  
for the ``streaming'' of live video and audio events over the 
Internet. Streaming is a technology that allows users to begin 
playing multimedia files as they are downloaded, rather than 
waiting for the entire file to be stored on a computer hard-drive 
before playback. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's upgrade of QuickTime is seen as a challenge to rivals  
Microsoft Corp. and RealNetworks Inc. Microsoft last week announced 
the release MS Audio 4.0. RealNetworks, which announced last week a 
partnership with IBM Corp. to deliver music over the Internet, 
holds a commanding lead in the streaming media arena. 
</P>
<P>
	QuickTime 4, available as a free ``public beta'' version, also  
includes support for the MP3 digital-music format. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., also announced Monday that it  
was giving away parts of the underlying source code for its 
QuickTime server software, which distributes streamed media over 
the Internet. Apple will only develop server software for Macintosh 
hardware, but will freely license the source code for other 
machines and operating systems.

<HEADLINE> Star Watch: John Cusack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Black, it would seem, is the operative word in  
John Cusack's life. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the color of the 32-year-old actor's typical wardrobe, the  
way he prefers his coffee and the style of filmmaking he champions: 
dark, murky and vaguely dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet black isn't exactly Cusack's personality.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's like this great big Labrador puppy that comes up at you  
slobbering all over the place,'' says Mike Newell, the director of 
Cusack's new offbeat comedy, ``Pushing Tin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He thinks that it's pure affection and love, that everything  
is going fine. What's happening to you is that you're being whipped 
to death by his tail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That earnest, unintentional quality is hard to miss when Cusack  
strides into the Four Seasons hotel lobby, ostensibly for an 
interview, but more intent on a nicotine fix. 
</P>
<P>
	He's decked out in black, of course, from the dark sunglasses  
poised like a tiara on his head to his jet-black high tops. Like 
his films, it's a mix of art-school chic and frat-boy comfort. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Pushing Tin,'' Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton play two  
macho, messianic air-traffic controllers who become involved in a 
high-stakes contest of wits and wills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like characters on the fringes,'' Cusack says, exhaling a  
mouthful of filterless American Spirit smoke. ``Maybe it's their 
conflicts or what they go through. They're more human in some ways. 
Maybe it's because I've always felt like an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, even though I'm an actor and they pay me a lot of  
money and all that, I've never really felt like a part of the 
Establishment. You know, I can go to cocktail parties and do their 
stuff, but I never feel like I want to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Cusack's quirky film career can be traced to this  
profound unease -- he's just not the Hollywood schmoozing, 
air-kissing type: The one-time prince of the 1980s teen flick 
refuses to knuckle under. 
</P>
<P>
	``I play by the rules -- sometimes,'' he says, with a sly smile.  
``I think I participate in the system more than when I was younger. 
But they've definitely stopped sending me traditional scripts -- 
they figure I won't do them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack says he gravitates toward characters ``who have conflict  
and transformation'' and says he wants ``entertainment that has 
ideas.'' If having both leads to really twisted roles, that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the character is firmly happy, then he's in the  
Establishment and there's no growth potential. I'd rather have him 
in the mainstream and fall out. Or you can have him try to slip in 
the back door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his career, though, Cusack toed the line. At age 17, he  
landed his first semi-major part, in the teen sex romp, ``Class.'' 
That was followed by a string of teen romance comedies, including 
``Sixteen Candles,'' ``The Sure Thing,'' and ``Better Off Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All that seemed to change once he raised a boom box over his  
head outside Ione Skye's window in 1989's ``Say Anything.'' His 
Lloyd Dobler, a sweet teen-age misfit, was portrayed with such 
naked yearning that the film transcended its teenybopper audience. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be Cusack's last dance with the genre. He switched  
gears to play a hustler in ``The Grifters,'' which led him to the 
attention of Woody Allen, who cast him in ``Shadows and Fog'' and 
``Bullets Over Broadway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the mid-'90s, the experimental theater group he had  
bankrolled in Chicago had morphed into New Crime Productions, a 
film company Cusack hoped would nurture his own vision. The name 
itself gives a clue where. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen, Cusack had been impressed by some high-tech pirates  
who repeatedly broke into network TV in Chicago. During one stunt, 
a Max Headroom impersonator began babbling unintelligibly and 
spanking his bare behind with a fly swatter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it and I thought it was so funny,'' Cusack recalls.  
``And then I read that authorities were having trouble prosecuting 
these guys because there wasn't any law against what they'd done. 
Technology had gone so far, so fast, that they had indeed invented 
a new crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what I wanted the role of theater and film to become.  
Hopefully, it will be to offer different voice or a different 
perspective outside the straight-ahead, corporate world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack's declaration of identity came in 1997 with New Crime's  
first film, the pitch-dark ``Grosse Pointe Blank,'' which he 
co-wrote and starred in. It was about a hit man with a pet cat and 
a therapist, and an invitation to his class reunion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was pure social satire. Some people got that and  
some people just thought it was a romantic date movie. That's fine. 
I said, 'OK.' I mean, it was absolutely absurdist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cusack is the kind of guy who'd rather hear nervous laughter in  
a theater than the fiery explosions of a summer blockbuster. With 
the exception of ``Con Air,'' he has declined such mainstream fare 
as ``White Men Can't Jump,'' ``Sleeping With the Enemy'' and 
``Indecent Proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, I've turned down some things that have made a whole lot  
of money,'' he says. ``I just didn't want to do it. And when I saw 
the movie, I still didn't want to do it -- even though it made $110 
million!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gobs of cash simply aren't Cusack's style. He is a devotee of  
Noam Chomsky and The Clash, and a self-described champion of art 
over commerce. So he's as noir as his arching black eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most great plays or films are about questioning, trying to  
debunk illusions, from the personal to the societal level, from the 
micro to the macro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not saying every film has to be political but the level of  
hypocrisy in people and in institutions...,'' he says, trailing 
off. ``The noise is deafening.''

<HEADLINE> Barbour Lobbies for Medicare Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Republicans wanted to squeeze savings out  
of Medicare in 1995, party chairman Haley Barbour was a leading 
planner and pitchman. Now a lobbyist for the nursing home industry, 
Barbour wants to boost Medicare spending, saying it is perilously 
low. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour says he still thinks the $200 billion-a-year health-care  
program for the elderly and disabled must be buttressed for the 
retirement of baby boomers. He says he is merely helping companies 
hurt by lower Medicare reimbursements than envisioned in the 1997 
balanced-budget deal between President Clinton and Congress, which 
sought five-year Medicare savings of $115 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't find anything inconsistent with that,'' he said in an  
interview recently. Had the budget deal proposed the savings that 
have materialized, ``It would never have passed Congress,'' he 
said. ``Nobody would have voted for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some, however, contrast Barbour's insistence that nursing homes  
are getting $1.5 billion a year less than expected with his earlier 
claims that Medicare spending must be reined to keep it afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour was a vocal defender of the original GOP plan that  
Congress approved in 1995 and Clinton vetoed, which exceeded the 
budget deal's savings. It would have extracted $270 billion in 
savings from Medicare over seven years to help finance tax cuts and 
balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's sad to say it's relatively common where you find people  
in public life reverse a position. Coin is king,'' said Bill Hogan, 
director of investigative projects for the Center for Public 
Integrity, a private group often critical of lobbying practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing undisputed figures that Medicare spending has temporarily  
slowed, Barbour and executives of the skilled nursing facility 
companies he represents say patient care is threatened. The 
industry, which cares for 1.5 million of the sickest nursing home 
residents, recently has endured layoffs, operating losses and 
plummeting stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``The survival of our business is at stake,'' said Kirill  
Goncharenko, spokesman for Mariner Post-Acute Network, one of the 
biggest nursing home companies. He says Barbour ``knows how to 
handle difficult and complex issues in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour says the culprit is federal Health Care Financing  
Administration rules that have squeezed more savings from the 
system than lawmakers intended. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're underspending what the balanced-budget agreement called  
for by big dollars, and that is more than the system can stand,'' 
Barbour says. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the problem is less dire and has other causes, too.  
These include reduced medical inflation, a natural slowdown after 
unusually fast nursing home growth and a federal crackdown on 
Medicare fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awfully premature to say a giveback is necessary,'' said  
Marilyn Moon, an analyst for the liberal-leaning Urban Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Hash, deputy HCFA director, said the agency will  
``continue to monitor'' its regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour's effort seems like a long-shot. With lawmakers eager to  
cut taxes or increase domestic spending, GOP aides say there 
probably won't be anything for nursing-home operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership has shown no interest in reopening the balanced  
budget agreement of 1997,'' said John Czwartacki, spokesman for 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbour is trying anyway, using contacts from his four years as  
Republican National Committee chief and before that as political 
adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., also now a lobbyist, is working  
the Democrats. Fazio, who was one of the House Democrats' leaders, 
voted for the 1997 budget deal but says things have gone too far. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medicare needs to be reformed but adequately funded, and I  
find that totally consistent with what I'm doing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As party chairman, Barbour was a fixture at Republican strategy  
sessions as the plan moved through Congress and a frequent guest on 
television shows. Republicans say he helped devise their strategy 
of describing their goal as saving Medicare from insolvency, then 
projected for 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after leaving the RNC, the 51-year-old Mississippian  
is a partner in Barbour, Griffith and Rogers, one of the capital's 
top lobbying shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm reported earning $7.3 million last year, according to  
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks 
political spending. Its list of 35 clients from 1998 includes 
BellSouth Corp., Philip Morris and the Swiss government.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Pushes Racial Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Digging into his own past, Democrat Bill Bradley  
on Tuesday recalled wincing at racist remarks uttered by a beloved 
aunt and feeling uncomfortable about the special attention he 
received as a white basketball star. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my story,'' Bradley told an audience of college  
students. ``What's yours?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, so far the only Democrat to challenge Vice President Al  
Gore for the party's presidential nomination, made clear that 
racial harmony will be a central theme of his campaign and would be 
a central goal of a Bradley administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Ronald Reagan was president, everyone knew that if you  
wanted to please the boss, you cut taxes, increased military 
spending and fought communism,'' he told an audience of 200 at The 
Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm president, I want one thing to be known: If you want to  
please the boss, one of the things you'd better show is how your 
department or agency has furthered tolerance and racial 
understanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was speaking in a city where the shooting death of an  
unarmed African immigrant by four white police officers has ignited 
a storm of protests and caused a major political headache for Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley did not join the chorus of criticism of the officers. He  
called the shooting ``a grievous error by those charged with 
protecting the very person that they shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that on a broader level, the case shed light on  
twin phenomena -- ``white indifference and black suspicion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley recited a litany of prejudices and injustices: church  
bombings, incidents of people beaten or killed because they were of 
Chinese descent or gay, the police practice of pulling drivers over 
because they are members of racial minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me the quest for racial unity remains the defining moral  
issue of our time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the issue can take many forms, he said. ``Among black  
children, 40 percent are destitute. There is no reason why a 
multiracial coalition cannot be built to lift up our poorest 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley did not mention Gore or President Clinton but did refer  
at one point to ``the pain on the faces of Asian-Americans 
stigmatized by the false suspicions in the 1996 presidential 
fund-raising scandals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also talked about race from personal experience during a  
series of town hall meetings. He is working on a book on race, 
stemming in part from the findings of an advisory council he 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard University professor Cornel West, author of the 1993  
bestseller ``Race Matters,'' introduced Bradley as ``my brother and 
friend'' and endorsed him as ``the worthy next president of the 
United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	West praised Clinton for holding town meetings on race but said  
Bradley ties the topic to concrete issues like child poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton tends to be more like cotton candy -- bite down, tastes  
good, but nothing there,'' West said. 
</P>
<P>
	Race relations have been a lifelong interest for Bradley, whose  
choice of basketball as a passion and occupation led him to the 
intersection of black and white America. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to do commercial endorsements as a New York Knick in  
part because of discomfort about being hailed as basketball's 
``great white hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, when white Los Angeles police officers were acquitted  
of state charges in the beating of black motorist Rodney King, 
Bradley walked to the floor of the Senate, denounced the verdict 
and slapped a pencil against the podium 56 times to dramatize how 
many times King had been hit.

<HEADLINE>  Stars Are Wary of Underdog Oilers / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Two years ago the Edmonton Oilers delivered a  
shock to the Dallas Stars they'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>
	They knocked the Stars out of the Stanley Cup playoffs in the  
first round on a goal by Todd Marchant in overtime of Game 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned a lot from that thing that happened two years  
ago,'' Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We know not to overlook 
anybody. We learned our lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, who have the home ice advantage throughout the  
playoffs because of their NHL-best regular season mark, meet a No. 
8 seeded Oiler team Wednesday night they beat three times and tied 
once in four meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being the No. 1 seed is a burden you have to accept,''  
Hitchcock said. ``You know that going in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonton has no problem playing up the underdog role.  
</P>
<P>
	``Being a complete underdog is a huge blessing,'' said Edmonton  
coach Ron Low. ``There's absolutely no pressure on us. The pressure 
is squarely on Dallas' shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas isn't the only team the Oilers have ruined in the  
playoffs. Colorado was ousted by Edmonton last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalkeeper Curtis Joseph dominated Dallas in 1997, but he is in  
Toronto now and the Oilers have Tommy Salo in net. Edmonton won six 
consecutive games late in the season just to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wing Bill Guerin, the Oilers top goal-scorer, and center Josef  
Berenak are both recovering from knee injuries and their status 
remains questionable. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Dallas will be without their captain, defenseman  
Derian Hatcher, who has been suspended for five playoff games 
because of the jaw-shattering hit on Phoenix's Jeremy Roenick. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas wing Pat Verbeek is out with a knee injury and defenseman  
Richard Matvichuk will probably play, although he has a groin 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``Edmonton is a dangerous team,'' Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk said.  
``They are notorious for picking up their game in the playoffs. 
We're going to have to pick up our game with Hatcher (suspended). 
We'll definitely miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett Hull said there is no way Dallas will overlook the Oilers  
this time around. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're confident but we know the other teams can beat us if we  
play like a bunch of arrogant dogs,'' Hull said. ``If anybody 
thinks we're going to walk over a lower seeded team they are sadly 
mistaken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the way Low wants everyone to see it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We don't stand a chance,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The second game of the series is set for Dallas on Friday night.  
The two teams will meet in Edmonton on Sunday and next Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Going Without Pacific Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military, stretched thin following a  
post-Cold War downsizing, is feeling the pinch. Because of dual 
defense needs in Kosovo and Iraq, no aircraft carrier is plying the 
Pacific. Instead, Air Force planes there have gone on alert for any 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The gap in carrier coverage for the Pacific could last until the  
fall, when the USS Constellation is to arrive, defense officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Kitty Hawk that was in the Pacific was ordered to the  
Persian Gulf on April 3 to free up the USS Theodore Roosevelt to 
join the NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia. The Roosevelt arrived in 
the Adriatic Sea on April 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Pentagon again is scrambling U.S. military assets  
around the globe to meet a NATO request for 300 more U.S. warplanes 
for Kosovo. That could mean adding a second carrier, sending the 
USS Enterprise and its 75 aircraft -- which just completed a 
six-month Gulf deployment -- to the Aegean Sea instead of home, U.S. 
defense officials said. The Enterprise reached the Mediterranean on 
Tuesday. More warplanes could come from forces around Iraq and 
Korea, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also is considering basing new planes in Turkey and  
Hungary, both NATO members, which could eliminate the need for a 
second carrier. Bulgaria and Romania on Tuesday gave NATO 
permission to use their air space. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior defense official, describing the search for resources,  
said the U.S. military's ``elasticity'' is reduced since the Cold 
War when the Navy had 600 ships, for example, compared with 324 
today. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1991, the Navy had 15 aircraft carriers plus one reserve,  
which is just enough to keep one each in the three places the 
Pentagon would like to protect 365 days a year -- the Gulf, the 
Mediterranean and the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Navy has had just 12 aircraft carriers since 1994, which  
means there are always gaps of weeks and sometimes months when the 
Pacific, Mediterranean or the Gulf goes without. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a strategic planner for the Joint Chiefs  
of Staff, acknowledged that as NATO's Kosovo air campaign 
continues, ``Over time, it will take a little bit of a toll.'' But 
he said the shifting of carriers and aircraft demonstrates the 
flexibility of today's leaner military. 
</P>
<P>
	``We adjust our forces as necessary,'' Wald said. ``If an  
aircraft carrier moves, we can backfill that with aircraft, and 
vice versa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the U.S. military standoff with Iraq, which last flared  
with four days of airstrikes in December, the Navy kept one or two 
aircraft carriers in the Gulf for 555 days in a row. That meant a 
gap in the Mediterranean and higher alert status for Air Force 
planes at Aviano air base in Italy -- a major takeoff point for 
airstrikes now. 
</P>
<P>
	As Congress considers a $6 billion White House request to pay  
for NATO military and humanitarian actions, House Speaker Dennis 
Hastert, R-Ill., said the Kosovo crisis has shown, ``Our troops are 
stretched too thin and our defense capabilities are now grossly 
inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving the Pacific unguarded by a carrier for long could send  
the wrong signal to North Korea, China or Indonesia, now 
experiencing violence ahead of elections, the first defense 
official acknowledged. A visible U.S. military presence helps 
maintain stability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military doctrine calls for the Pentagon to be prepared to  
fight two regional wars at the same time. Defense officials insist 
that's still possible, even with the U.S. armed forces trimmed to 
2.4 million active duty and reserves compared with 3.8 million in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
	In times of conflict, presidents today rely more than they used  
to on the National Guard and reserves. President Clinton is 
expected as early as this week to call up as many as 33,000 of 
those troops who would primarily support the expected 300 
additional U.S. warplanes, including refueling tankers flown mostly 
by reservists. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen hasn't yet given final approval  
for the new aircraft nor recommended the call-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Since NATO airstrikes began March 24, the Pentagon has diverted  
planes from the Pacific command and from Iraq operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 300 additional U.S. aircraft would bring the NATO force to  
about 1,000 planes, nearly 800 of them American. More than 20,000 
U.S. troops on ships and European bases are involved in the 
airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO deployment is still relatively small compared with the  
six-week 1991 Gulf War, when the U.S. military used more than 3,400 
combat aircraft, six aircraft carriers and 700,000 troops, 
including some who took part in a 100-hour ground war to kick Iraq 
out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	If a crisis erupted in the Pacific now, the Navy could deploy  
the USS Constellation within two to three weeks, defense officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force planes also could be in action within 24 hours from  
bases in Japan and Alaska, although that would require using 
increasingly scarce refueling tankers. Planes based in the United 
States -- such as B-52 bombers -- could help in two regions, said an 
Air Force official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier, scheduled to deploy in  
the fall from Florida to the Mediterranean, could be called up 
faster and sent anywhere, defense officials said.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Rates Drop, Mostly for Men </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans are stricken with cancer every  
year, thanks largely to drops in smoking, scientists announced 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The news is better for men: Although they still suffer more  
cancer than women do, the rate of new cancer cases is dropping 
eight times faster for men than for women, says the American Cancer 
Society's annual report on cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, cancer incidence has dropped 2.2 percent a year since  
1992, says the new report, published in this week's Journal of the 
National Cancer Institute, which analyzed cancer trends through 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists warned on Tuesday that tobacco use could reverse the  
progress: Lung cancer remains the nation's top cancer killer, and 
recent declines in lung cancer among men who quit smoking in the 
1970s and '80s helped fuel the overall declines in cancer incidence 
and mortality. But high teen smoking and new popularity for cigars 
have experts fearing a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless we invest now in anti-tobacco efforts aimed at our  
youngest citizens, we will waste the progress we have achieved so 
far,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, cigarette smoking by high school students rose a  
disturbing 32 percent during the 1990s, report said. And cigar 
smoking -- which a second study published in the cancer journal 
Tuesday concluded is as cancer-causing as cigarettes -- has reversed 
a 20-year decline, rising by 50 percent in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to turn that around or we'll have another lung cancer  
epidemic,'' said Phyllis Wingo of the American Cancer Society, who 
led Tuesday's study. 
</P>
<P>
	Wingo used death certificates and huge government health  
databases to determine the rates of new cancer cases and cancer 
deaths through 1996, the latest data available. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer incidence increased slowly from the 1970s through 1992 --  
but since then has steadily dropped, about 2.2 percent a year 
through 1996, the report said. It's falling faster for men, 4.1 
percent a year, compared with less than half a percent drop each 
year for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer death rates also are dropping more for men, 1 percent a  
year, compared with 0.4 percent a year for women. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the gender gap? It's partly due to lung cancer.  
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have known for several years that lung cancer  
incidence was slowly decreasing among men, by about 2.6 percent a 
year. At the same time, however, lung cancer was becoming a 
steadily bigger problem for women, who began to quit smoking later 
than men did. During the 1990s, lung cancer deaths rose 1.4 percent 
a year among women. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's report shows a glimmer of hope that women might be  
about to turn that tide: When scientists looked just at women ages 
40 to 59 -- the age group that first began kicking the habit -- they 
found a slight decrease in lung cancer. That's the same age group 
in which the male lung cancer decline first appeared. So a similar 
finding in women is a clue that maybe women's fate is about to 
improve, too, Wingo explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Lung cancer aside, the study found improvement in fighting most  
forms of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But two forms of cancer are increasing: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma  
and melanoma. New cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are rising by a 
little over half a percent per year and deaths are rising by 1.8 
percent a year. No one knows why. 
</P>
<P>
	The incidence rate of melanoma, caused by too much time in the  
sun, increased 2.7 percent a year during the 1990s, although death 
rates have remained unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Other findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Although the death rate from breast cancer is dropping 2  
percent a year, there has been little change in breast cancer 
incidence, which strikes about 180,000 women a year. 
</P>
<P>
	--Uterine cancer levels stayed steady.  
</P>
<P>
	--When the report analyzed lung cancer by state, Kentucky had the  
highest male death rate -- 103.4 lung cancer deaths per 100,000 men 
-- and also the most teen smokers and adult male smokers. The most 
adult women smoked in Nevada, and most died of lung cancer there: 
45.8 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah had the lowest rates of smoking, and lung cancer death  
rates of just 31.5 for men and 13.9 for women.

<HEADLINE> Fires May Burn 40,000 More Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An erratic 130,000-acre wildfire that has roared  
through the Everglades could devour another 40,000 acres before it 
is contained, officials warned. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters were monitoring the blaze early today while hoping  
that barriers created with controlled burns would stop its 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Monday, the flames reached the Miccosukee Indian  
Reservation, threatening several hunting camps and shacks, said 
John Fish of the state Division of Forestry. No injuries were 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Just to the north, the blaze was about two miles east of the Big  
Cypress Seminole Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, smoke from the fire blanketed Interstate 75 -- south  
Florida's main east-west highway -- and forced authorities to keep 
about 60 miles of it closed. The road, known as Alligator Alley, 
could be closed for days, said Florida Highway Patrol Lt. Greg 
Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	In communities immediately east of the fire -- about 25 miles  
northwest of Miami -- people with asthma, bronchitis and emphysema 
were urged to stay indoors if possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials expected erratic winds and dry weather to remain in  
the coming days, making new fires quick to start and difficult to 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire began in the eastern Everglades late last week,  
possibly ignited by heat from a vehicle's catalytic converter. 
Aided by swirling winds, it quickly became the largest of at least 
2,515 fires that have burned in Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced Monday that it  
was adding the Everglades fire and another blaze in the Panhandle 
to a list of fires chosen for fire suppression assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement brought to six the number of Florida fires  
recently approved for this type of federal aid.

<HEADLINE> Telecom Italia Supports Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Telecom Italia SpA's board of directors on Tuesday  
agreed in principle to a merger with Germany's Deutsche Telekom AG, 
but several major issues still must be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a seven-hour board meeting, Telecom Italia released a  
statement saying it supports a ``business combination agreement'' 
under which a new company would be set up to combine the two 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia did not disclose any financial details of the  
deal it favored. The company has been negotiating with Deutsche 
Telekom in an effort to thwart a hostile takeover bid from its 
smaller Italian rival, Olivetti SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	A combined Telecom Italia and Deutsche Telekom would dwarf its  
competitors in Europe and could become the largest merger in 
history, topping the pending deal between Exxon Corp. and Mobil 
Corp., which was valued Tuesday at about $85 billion, based on the 
price of Exxon stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia stipulated that the agreement would have to be  
``substantially a merger of equals,'' and it did not specify what 
weight each company would have in the new holding company. Analysts 
have speculated that Deutsche Telekom would account for between 56 
percent and 60 percent of the holding company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian prime minister's office has said that any accord  
must be on an equal footing, underlining fears in Italy of foreign 
ownership of the strategic telecommunications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia said its board would give final approval to the  
agreement only when terms are clarified on how the German 
government could limit its voting rights in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, the German state has a direct and indirect combined  
72 percent stake in Deutsche Telekom, scheduled to diminish to 66 
percent once the German company completes a capital increase some 
time in midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
	Telecom Italia also said an industrial plan for the merged  
entity needed to be worked out before its board could approve the 
deal.

<HEADLINE> Giants' Bonds To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds will undergo surgery on Tuesday  
to repair a bone spur in his left elbow and a damaged triceps 
tendon, San Francisco Giants manager Dusty Baker said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star left fielder was placed on the 15-day disabled  
list. There was no indication of how long Bonds would be out of the 
lineup, and the length of his recovery would depend on what the 
surgeons found, general manager Brian Sabean said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we know yet how long he's going to be out,''  
Sabean said. ``Fortunately it's early in the season. Fortunately 
he's in great shape and has tremendous healing power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker said he learned of the surgery after the victory. Bonds  
was out of the lineup for the second straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just pray that it's not too severe and that he makes a  
quick recovery,'' Baker said after a 5-4 win over Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, batting .366 with four home runs and 12 RBIs, had an MRI  
on Monday that revealed the bone spur. He decided to get a second 
opinion later in the day from San Jose Sharks physician Dr. Art 
Ting. 
</P>
<P>
	The surgery will be performed by Ting at the Recovery Inn in  
Menlo Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Javier took Bonds' place in left field, and Ellis Burks  
assumed Bonds' No. 3 spot in the batting order. Burks hit a 
three-run homer in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose a superstar, sure it's going to be different,''  
Baker said. ``But you've got to do what you've got to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonds, an eight-time All-Star, has been on the disabled list  
just once in his 14-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough but we have to go on,'' Javier said. ``We're going  
to miss him. He creates a lot of things for the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Right-handed rookie pitcher Joe Nathan was called up from  
Double-A Shreveport to fill Bonds' spot on the roster. Nathan was 
scheduled to make his major league debut on Wednesday, starting 
against Marlins right-hander Dennis Springer. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been speculation Bonds might have been injured after  
Friday's brawl with the Diamondbacks, during which Giants third 
baseman Charlie Hayes and Arizona pitcher Todd Stottlemyre got into 
a bench-clearing melee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me clear that up right now: Barry told me it was bothering  
him on Friday during batting practice,'' Baker said before Monday's 
game. ``That wasn't it at all, that's 20 years of throwing.''

<HEADLINE> Congress Party Seeks India Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The long-dominant Congress Party was  
confident Tuesday of staging its comeback to power, most likely as 
a minority government with little hope of a long life. 
</P>
<P>
	Party officials said Italian-born Sonia Gandhi would head the  
new administration. But key backers were voicing reservations about 
her, and it was not clear whether she would become prime minister 
or ask a party colleague to take the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi, heir to India's foremost political dynasty, is the  
widow of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and daughter-in-law of Prime 
Minister Indira Gandhi, both of whom were assassinated. Indira's 
father was India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bharatiya Janata Party, which led the government ousted  
Saturday in a vote of confidence, claimed it had enough support to 
block Congress. In that event, a new election would be almost 
certain. 
</P>
<P>
	Activity on forming a government was expected to be suspended  
until after parliament enacts the national budget early Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Arjun Singh, a senior Congress official, said the new  
administration would most likely be a minority government led by 
Sonia Gandhi because it ``would be easier to manage'' than an 
unwieldy coalition of divergent parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Party spokesman Ajit Jogi told The Associated Press on Tuesday  
that Congress would have letters of support from a majority of 
parliament to prove to President K.R. Narayanan it will be able to 
govern. The president must decide which party can form the next 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the president calls us tomorrow evening, we will  
immediately respond with all the letters,'' Jogi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Congress legislators admitted the government was not likely  
to last the four years until the next scheduled election. Congress, 
which has governed India for 45 of its 51 years as an independent 
nation, can at best hope to garner support from 272 legislators, 
but that razor-edge majority would be difficult to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still talking with all the leaders to evolve a  
consensus,'' Mrs. Gandhi said as she left a meeting with veteran 
communist leader Jyoti Basu. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry and business officials were awaiting the passage of the  
budget that pledged to step up the pace of free-market reforms, 
downsize government and raise taxes. The budget was seen as 
investor friendly, and there had been fears it could fall victim to 
politics after Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was ousted. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets tumbled more than 250 points Saturday but revived  
after all political parties agreed to pass the budget unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gandhi has met almost every opposition leader, but most  
were reluctant to commit their support before she had enough 
backers to form a government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am assuring you that there is no difficulty, no problem in  
forming an alternative government,'' said Arjun Singh. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the  
United States hopes the next Indian government will take concrete 
steps on a nuclear arms nonproliferation agreement and improvement 
of relations with neighboring Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin said Washington had expressed regret at both India's and  
Pakistan's tests earlier this month of long-range nuclear capable 
missiles.

<HEADLINE> Congress Wants To Honor Rosa Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rosa Parks, who stoked the civil rights  
movement by refusing to give up her seat on a segregated bus, would 
receive Congress' most prestigious civilian honor under legislation 
sent to the White House on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The House voted 424-1 to award the 86-year-old Alabama native  
the Congressional Gold Medal. The Senate passed the measure Monday 
on an 86-0 vote. President Clinton is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans and Democrats lauded her as an American heroine.  
</P>
<P>
	``She is an ordinary citizen with extraordinary courage,'' Rep.  
Spencer Bachus, R-Ala., said. ``She had the fortitude to claim for 
herself the most ordinary, the most basic of civil rights -- to be 
treated fairly and equally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said that ``one, simple, defining act''  
by Parks began a nonviolent revolution in the South that led to the 
end of segregation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rosa Parks taught me and an entire generation the power that  
one individual can have in standing up for what is right and for 
what is just,'' added Lewis, a civil rights veteran who was beaten 
bloody during protest marches in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks watched the debate on television while traveling in  
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Parks is very excited to have this honor,'' said Anita  
Peek, executive director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute 
for Self-Development. Mrs. Parks co-founded the nonprofit in 1987 
in Detroit, where she now lives, to benefit young people. 
</P>
<P>
	A seamstress in Montgomery, Ala., Mrs. Parks was arrested in  
December 1955 for refusing to give her seat on a segregated city 
bus to a white man. The arrest led to a yearlong bus boycott by 
blacks that endured until the Supreme Court ruled the city's bus 
segregation law was unconstitutional, and it was changed. The Rev. 
Martin Luther King Jr., then a local minister, led the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks moved to Detroit in 1957 after she lost the sewing  
job, couldn't find work and her family was harassed and threatened. 
She joined the staff of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in 1965 and 
worked there until retiring in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	She now travels the country lecturing on civil rights.  
</P>
<P>
	A guest at Clinton's State of the Union address in January, Mrs.  
Parks has received numerous awards, including the Presidential 
Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, and the 
Spingarn Award, the NAACP's top civil rights honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers initially used the Congressional Gold Medal to honor  
military leaders but began bestowing it in the 20th century to 
recognize excellence in a range of fields, the arts, athletics, 
politics, science, entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The first such medal was approved in March 1776 for George  
Washington for ``wise and spirited conduct'' in the Revolutionary 
War. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 320 medals have been awarded.  
</P>
<P>
	Recent honorees include Frank Sinatra, Mother Teresa, South  
African President Nelson Mandela and the ``Little Rock Nine,'' the 
group who braved threats and jeers from white mobs to integrate 
Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, voted against the bill, which authorizes  
up to $30,000 to pay for the medal and the sale of bronze 
reproductions to recover the costs. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 573.

<HEADLINE> Multiple Golf Titles Hard To Win  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Greg Norman walked up the 18th fairway with the Masters champion  
for the second time in four years. If Davis Love III had birdied 
the two reachable par-5s on the back nine of Augusta National, 
perhaps he could have worn the green jacket. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later in the MCI Classic, Payne Stewart was in a familiar  
role -- complimenting someone else's final round and offering 
congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Three players, two weeks, one common denominator.  
</P>
<P>
	Winning is the best way to measure success, and all three have  
had their share. Together, they have won 42 tour events and five 
majors. 
</P>
<P>
	But as golf has become deeper in talent and multiple wins have  
become a rarity, there is rarely enough appreciation for 
consistently being in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Of active players with at least 10 years' experience on the PGA  
Tour, no one has done that as well as these three. 
</P>
<P>
	For Stewart, who lost the MCI Classic in a playoff to Glen Day,  
it was the 25th time in his career that he has finished second. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman finished third at Augusta, but he's no stranger to second  
place. Among active players, only Tom Watson has as many runner-up 
finishes (31) on the PGA Tour. Eight of Norman's seconds have come 
in the majors, and he's the only player to lose all four majors in 
a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Love was the Masters runner-up for the second time in five  
years. He has finished second 14 times in his career, three of them 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed I didn't win,'' Love said. ``But I'm pleased  
to have played another Masters and to have a chance to get nervous 
on the weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is no substitute for winning. Day made that clear when he  
choked back tears after his first PGA Tour victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, anything less is too often perceived as failure.  
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Tiger Woods won once, was second twice and third  
twice. He had more top 10s than anyone (13), but was hounded by 
questions about his ``slump.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Duval can appreciate the feeling. He was the ultimate PGA  
Tour bridesmaid for nearly three years -- seven times a runner-up 
from 1995 until he finished the 1997 season with three straight 
victories. He took a lead into the final round five times without 
winning during those ``lean'' years, and never once considered 
himself a failure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was being criticized for not having won,'' Duval said at the  
beginning of the year, before his 59 or the four wins that pushed 
his count to 11. ``It's kind of like if you don't win, you're a 
bum. What about kids who are coming up who don't have as much 
talent as some other people? They gave their heart, busted their 
tail, finished third, had a great golf tournament. That's not 
failing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval then pointed to the year-by-year listing in the PGA Tour  
media guide that shows number of victories, second- and third-place 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next stat they show is top 10s,'' he said. ``Why is that?  
Because top 10 is a good week out here. It's good playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How good?  
</P>
<P>
	Consider the following statistical review, in which 10 points  
were awarded for a victory, five points for second, three points 
for third and one point for a top 10. An additional 10 points were 
given for each major. 
</P>
<P>
	The total points were then divided by the number of years on  
tour, and yielded the following results: 
</P>
<P>
	--Watson, who turns 50 in September, averaged 31.4 points per  
season and was the highest ranked among active players on the 
strength of his 34 victories, eight majors and 31 second-place 
finishes. 
</P>
<P>
	--Norman, who joined the tour in 1983, was second at 29.9 points.  
While Norman has won 18 times and has only two majors, he has 
matched Watson's total of runner-up finishes in only 17 years on 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stewart was third at 24.1 points per year. Along with 10  
victories (two majors) and 25 seconds, Stewart has finished third 
20 times. Only Watson and Tom Kite have more seconds and thirds 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	--Love has been so good for so long that it's hard to believe he  
just turned 35. With 13 wins and 14 seconds, he was fourth at 23.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval and Woods were both around 40, although neither has been  
on tour longer than five years. Ernie Els was at 24.5 points in his 
sixth year on tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Nicklaus clocked in at 42.1, which accounts for every year  
through 1998. While his record of 18 professional majors might 
never be broken, it should be noted that Nicklaus finished second 
19 times in the majors alone.

<HEADLINE> Russia Defaults on $1.3 Billion Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia defaulted Tuesday on $1.3 billion in bonds,  
the latest debt on which the country has reneged and a setback that 
could further erode confidence in Russia's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was owed on dollar-denominated bonds known as MinFins,  
short for Ministry of Finance. MinFins, held by both Russians and 
foreigners, were issued to compensate companies and individuals 
whose hard-currency accounts were frozen in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The third installment is due on May 14. But Russian First Deputy  
Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov announced Tuesday in London that 
the government didn't have the $1.3 billion it was supposed to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is in one of the deepest depressions ever suffered by an  
industrialized nation, and the government has already defaulted on 
domestic and foreign debts. However, it wanted to stay current on 
the MinFins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, as hard as we tried to accumulate money and  
stabilize the situation, we can't do this,'' Kasyanov said at the 
annual meeting of the European Bank for Reconstruction and 
Development, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two MinFin installments matured and were paid off. But  
that was long before Russia's economic crisis hit last August. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came while an International Monetary Fund team  
is in Russia assessing the country's suitability for a new loan. 
The IMF has agreed in principle to give Russia the loan, but the 
size and the terms have not been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any failure by the country to meet payments on its obligations  
undoubtedly damages creditors' attitude to Russia,'' the head of 
parliament's budget committee, Alexander Zhukov, told Echo of 
Moscow radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia defaulted on $40 billion in Treasury debt in August,  
missed a $362 million Principal Note payment to the London Club in 
December, and has more than $2 billion in arrears to the Paris 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
	After the default on the MinFins, Russia will have only one  
class of debt on which it has stayed current, the Eurobonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's total foreign debts have reached $150 billion,  
two-thirds of which are from the Soviet-era. In addition, the 
country has sizable domestic debts, including the MinFins. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia struggled to meet its debt payments in the first four  
months of the year, when $4 billion was due, according to financial 
experts. But May sees a dramatic spike in payments, with $2.5 
billion due in less than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $1.3 billion MinFins payment, the Russian  
government has to meet an additional $300 million in coupon 
payments on later MinFin installments. Kasyanov didn't say whether 
the government was prepared to make the coupon payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent economist and former Finance Minister Alexander  
Livshits suggested the government may dip into the Central Bank's 
already slim gold and currency reserves to make the coupon 
payments. The reserves are down to less than $11 billion, a small 
sum for a country of Russia's size and population.

<HEADLINE> Officials Mull School Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Metal detectors and surveillance cameras went  
up in the hallways. Idle threats went past the principal's office 
to the police station. Special events like proms and graduations 
were postponed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the year since a spate of school shootings, many principals  
and superintendents -- worried their students would copycat 
nationally reported incidents -- have cracked down on security. 
Congress and states have backed their efforts with money. 
</P>
<P>
	But as another violent school tragedy unfolded Tuesday,  
officials asked whether any school can protect against deadly 
shootings like those Tuesday in a Denver suburb. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one of the great mysteries -- how do you identify a  
student who is going to act out?'' asked Barbara Wheeler, school 
board member in Downers Grove, Ill., and former president of the 
National School Boards Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools nationwide have taken steps such as installing metal  
detectors and surveillance cameras, tracking idle threats and 
profiling students with a potential for violence. At the slightest 
sign of trouble, principals and superintendents have responded: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A high school student in Starkville, Miss., was arrested in  
February and faces criminal charges for having a gun on school 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	-- An eighth-grader in Clarion County, Pa.,, who had a gun and  
repeated a threat to kill teachers was arrested at Union High 
School after a fellow student told his mother of threats. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A ninth-grade girl in Virginia was suspended when she wrote a  
note to a fellow student expressing anger about her teacher giving 
her a D, and the teacher took it as a physical threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials must walk a fine line between youthful boasting and  
joking and serious intentions, said June Arnette, associate 
director of the National School Safety Center in Westlake Village, 
Calif. But such talk shouldn't be ignored, said Arnette, whose 
private group now trains 100 schools a year to set up security 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Schools are being more proactive,'' said Arnette.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the most widely used safety measures, she said, is an  
anonymous tip service. Students can phone in or drop in a secured 
box any tip, such as a student with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear what policies were followed at Columbine High  
School in the middle-class suburb of Littleton, Colo., where gunmen 
-- believed to be fellow students -- opened fire Tuesday. Deborah 
Fallon, a spokeswoman for the Colorado Education Association, said 
the state's 176 districts set their own policies. 
</P>
<P>
	As the 1997-98 year showed, violence can even erupt at schools  
that seem safe to teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
	In March of last year, two boys in Jonesboro, Ark., opened fire  
on a crowd of students at their middle school, killing four 
classmates and a teacher. Students also were accused of fatal 
shootings in Springfield, Ore., West Paducah, Ky., and Pearl, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, a high school sophomore in Notus, Idaho, was  
accused of firing a shotgun in a school hallway, but no one was 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Most school districts haven't faced legal action for not  
preventing crimes, but they have been held liable for violating 
students' rights when imposing penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet schools have not backed off developing policies because of  
the threat of lawsuits, said William Modzeleski, the Education 
Department's safe schools chief. They have been working with 
attorneys to develop fair policies. 
</P>
<P>
	In the long-run, educators argue that schools must address  
mental health. 
</P>
<P>
	Movies and television programs that glorify violence teach  
children to resort to violence, said Kevin P. Dwyer, of the 
National Association for School Psychologists in Bethesda, Md. He 
also blamed access to guns. Colorado requires handgun permits, and 
bans the possession or use of a gun by minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something you can do with a metal detector,'' Dwyer  
said. ``We as a community have to teach kids to stop and think and 
respect one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials still say schools are safe. In 1996, theft  
accounted for 62 percent of crimes against students at school. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is the perception that schools are terribly  
crime-ridden. The perception is unfounded,'' Modzeleski said.

<HEADLINE> FCC Wants Boost for Broadcasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- The nation's top airwaves regulator wants to  
give broadcasters greater flexibility to own more TV and radio 
stations, ensuring that the public continues to have diverse 
sources for news and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``My challenge this year is for you to join with me in crafting  
commonsense ownership rule relief,'' Bill Kennard, chairman of the 
Federal Communications Commission, told broadcasters Tuesday at the 
industry's annual convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The broadcast industry has been at odds with the FCC over how to  
ease rules that limit the number of local TV and radio stations 
that a single company can control. 
</P>
<P>
	Broadcasters say they need regulatory relief to better compete  
against cable TV, satellite TV, the Internet and other media and 
entertainment providers, which aren't subject to the same ownership 
restrictions. Owning more local TV and radio stations in the same 
market would produce business efficiencies that would allow 
broadcasters to offer new programs and services, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
	But deregulation opponents say allowing companies to own more  
local stations would threaten editorial diversity. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennard acknowledged that in today's marketplace broadcast  
owners need ``flexibility'' to seize on opportunities and ``be a 
player in the information age,'' 
</P>
<P>
	While FCC officials have said they want to produce a final plan  
on new ownership rules in a couple of months, Kennard didn't 
specify what such a plan would do or whether it would resemble a 
proposal offered by commission staff last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The staff proposal would make it easier for some broadcasters to  
own more media properties, but also would require others to divest 
some stations. Many broadcasters and key Republican lawmakers in 
Congress opposed the plan, saying it doesn't give broadcasters 
enough regulatory relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce  
Committee and presidential contender, said he plans to hold 
hearings next month on broadcast ownership and on ways to increase 
minority ownership of the airwaves. McCain, who supports giving 
broadcasters freedom from ownership rules, made his remarks in a 
taped speech Tuesday beamed into the convention by satellite. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also said he intends to offer legislation to bolster  
airwaves ownership by revising the now-defunct ``tax certificate,'' 
which gave a tax break to broadcasters who sold stations to 
minorities. Congress repealed that provision several years ago, 
citing abuses. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1996 telecommunications law eased some ownership restrictions  
but required the commission to consider changing, or even 
eliminating, other limits because of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rules prohibit a single company from owning more than one  
local TV station in a given market or from owning a TV station and 
a radio station in the same market unless the FCC grants a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	The major broadcast networks, meanwhile, want the FCC to  
eliminate or loosen a rule limiting them to owning stations that 
reach no more than 35 percent of all TV viewers in an area-- 
something their affiliates oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some say we should just eliminate all of these rules, just  
sweep them away, get rid of everything,'' Kennard said. ``I don't 
think that's the right answer, frankly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another crucial matter for broadcasters is whether the FCC will  
continue to let companies enter into local marketing agreements 
that allows one TV station to operate another TV station in the 
same market, but not own it.
