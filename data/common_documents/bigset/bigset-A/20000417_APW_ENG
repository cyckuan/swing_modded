Asian Markets Plummet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets plummeted at the end of the morning session
Monday, reacting to the record losses on Wall Street last week that left many
investors wondering if its bull market was over. In the world's second largest
economy, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell a staggering 1,793.62 points, or 8.8
percent, to 18,641.06 in about the first 90 minutes of trading. By the end of
the morning session, the Nikkei had recovered slightly, rising to 18,683.89
points. Elsewhere, Australia's All Ordinaries Index fell 5.6 percent at one
point, and the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down 89.35 points, or 11
percent, to 711.54. The Korea Stock Exchange said it was a record fall, in both
points and percentage, on the index.

Some Gov't Workers Told To Stay Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of traffic-snarling protests aimed at
disrupting world financial meetings Monday has prompted federal authorities to
tell government workers whose offices are in a restricted area around the bank's
headquarters to stay home. The officials said they could not estimate how many
employees that would involve, but such major departments as Commerce, Treasury
and Agriculture -- not to mention the White House -- are headquartered within
the restricted area. Thousands of marchers failed to stop world finance leaders
from meeting today, but paraded through the capital in a show of celebration and
anger that provoked one ugly episode -- a surging crowd met by a stinging cloud
of irritants fired by police.

Report Issues Environmental Warning
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A United Nations-sponsored report said Sunday despite
greater environmental awareness, growing demand for resources is threatening the
world's environmental health more than ever. In the long term, it said, humans
will pay the price. The broad decline of the world's ecosystems -- the
interaction of organisms with their physical environment -- must be reversed or
there ''could be devastating implications'' for human development, the study
said. The study was sponsored by the U.N. Development Programme, the U.N.
Environmental Programme and the World Bank. It assessed the current health of
agriculture, coastal areas, forests, fresh water environments and grasslands.

Elian's Dad Lashes Out at Miami Kin
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father lashed out at his Miami relatives on
Sunday, accusing them of ''child abuse'' for turning his son against him and
insisting that the 6-year-old boy wants to return to Cuba. With the boy's fate
still before federal judges, Juan Miguel Gonzalez said on CBS' ''60 Minutes''
that he didn't believe a video taped at the relatives' home in which his son
said he didn't want to go. Family members did not make themselves available
after the show. Protesters, however, dismissed Juan Miguel's comments as either
selfish or the manipulations of Fidel Castro.

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- The White House said Sunday President Clinton will
announce a plan Monday to provide basic telephone service for $1 a month on
reservations in an effort to speed computer access and improve
telecommunications for American Indians. High tech companies will join Clinton's
effort to spread the benefits of computers and the Internet, announcing pledges
of money, training and equipment. The commitments will include $25 million from
Qualcomm, $20 million in software from Novell and $15 million from
Hewlett-Packard.

Israel Cites Lebanon Withdrawal Concerns
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Attacks on Israel after it withdraws from Lebanon could
lead to war between Israel and Syria, a senior Israeli defense official warned
Sunday. If Syria permits or encourages Lebanese guerrillas to continue their
attacks on Israeli troops along the border after the pullout, promised by July,
Israel will have to ''apply levers to put pressure on the Syrians themselves,
not just on their indirect interests in Lebanon,'' Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said. The result ''could be a military confrontation in Lebanon,''
Sneh told a gathering of his Labor party in a Tel Aviv suburb. Sneh spokesman
Hillel Fartouk released Sneh's statements to The Associated Press.

Flyers Defeat Sabres, Lead Playoffs 3-0
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- John LeClair, the center of Friday's controversial
phantom goal, scored the game-winner and rookie goalie Brian Boucher stopped 17
shots as the Philadelphia Flyers grabbed a 3-0 series lead over the Buffalo
Sabres Sunday. Mark Recchi sealed the win scoring into an empty net with 37.9
seconds left. Only two teams -- the 1975 New York Islanders and the 1942 Toronto
Maple Leafs -- have rallied from a 3-0 deficit in NHL playoff history. Game 4
will be played at Buffalo on Tuesday. The Sabres, who've managed just three
goals in the series, had trouble generating any offense, outshot 27-17.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Has Eye on Aegis Destroyers  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When U.S. and Taiwanese officials gather
behind closed doors Monday to discuss which weapons the United
States is willing to sell, the $4.4 billion question will be
whether Taiwan gets the go-ahead to buy the Aegis destroyers it
says it needs to counter a buildup of Chinese missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The talks Monday and Tuesday in Washington are especially
sensitive because of their profound political implications.
</P>
<P>
   China has said it would be compelled to react harshly if Taiwan
acquires Aegis warships. Taiwan views its request as a test of U.S.
support in the face of China's continuing buildup of offensive
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   China regards Taiwan as Chinese territory, separated by civil
war. The United States has a ''one China'' policy, but under the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 it is obligated to ensure a
''sufficient'' defense for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is divided over the weapons sales.
The Pentagon believes they are justified for Taiwan's self-defense
but the White House and State Department worry more about provoking
China. Virtually all international arms sales have political
implications, but this one is especially political because of the
growing belief in Congress that China is bent on regaining control
of Taiwan at any cost.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Friday he could not
discuss the substance of the U.S.-Taiwan talks.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post, citing anonymous sources, reported in
Monday's editions that the Pentagon will recommend against selling
the Aegis destroyers to Taiwan for the time being, but will call
for further assessment of Taiwan's needs and, in the meantime,
recommend selling the island long-range radar systems.
</P>
<P>
   In strictly military terms, there is little question that Taiwan
can justify its desire for warships equipped with the highly
advanced Aegis weapons system, which is designed to defend against
aircraft and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan wants to buy four of the warships, which go for $1.1
billion apiece, plus a variety of other advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. Dennis Blair, commander in chief of U.S. Pacific Command,
with responsibility for U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region, has
made clear that he believes Taiwan faces a serious missile threat
from China.
</P>
<P>
   ''Currently, China has deployed about 200 ballistic missiles
against Taiwan and is adding about 50 missiles per year,'' Blair
said in a speech in Washington on March 16. ''Though these missiles
are terror weapons -- too inaccurate to hit military targets with
any confidence -- as the numbers increase and their accuracy
improves, they will pose a military threat to Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair has not said publicly whether he favors selling Taiwan the
four Arleigh Burke-class destroyers with Aegis radar.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Paal, president of the Asia Pacific Policy Center, said
Friday he expects the Clinton administration to approve a sale of
destroyers to Taiwan but without the Aegis weapons system included.
This would give Taiwan an improved capability to defend against
anti-ship missiles and aircraft but not against the ballistic
missiles that China has deployed in Fujian province, just across
the 100-mile Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a very strong feeling about this,'' Paal said. He
called it a ''straddle'' by the White House between provoking China
on the one hand and leaving Taiwan vulnerable to potential attack
on the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many other weapons on Taiwan's wish list, Paal
believes the Clinton administration is likely to approve the sale
of longer-range radars but not Harm anti-radiation missiles or
Amraam air-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan reportedly also is seeking the Patriot PAC-3 anti-missile
system, which is being developed to replace the older-generation
Patriot missiles that it already owns and which the United States
plans to phase out.
</P>
<P>
   The Aegis weapons system would give Taiwan a technological leap
ahead, although some question whether Taiwan's navy has the
technical sophistication to operate it properly. An internal
Pentagon report recently raised questions about Taiwan's ability to
keep enough technical expertise in its military.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the Aegis system is an advanced radar, the SPY-1,
able to search for, track and engage more than 100 targets
simultaneously at ranges of up to 288 miles. The Arleigh
Burke-class destroyers also are equipped with Tomahawk cruise
missiles of the kind the U.S. Navy used in the Kosovo conflict last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The destroyers are built by Bath Iron Works in Maine, the home
state of Defense Secretary William Cohen, and by Ingalls
Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott's home state.

<HEADLINE> Oakland Drafts Kicker and Punter  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Oakland Raiders might not have much else.
But they should have the NFL's best kicking game next season.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly the youngest.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling the biggest surprise of the first round by
choosing kicker Sebastian Janikowski with the 17th overall pick,
the Raiders went for a punter in the fifth round Sunday when they
took Shane Lechler of Texas A&AMP;M, who averaged nearly 47 yards per
kick last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something we needed to improve on,'' coach Jon Gruden
said of his team's kicking game.
</P>
<P>
   So he went out and took two kickers with his first four picks.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, the Raiders aren't the first team to spend
relatively high picks on kickers. In 1976, its first year in the
NFL, Seattle spent two third-round picks on kickers -- punter Rick
Engles and place kicker Don Bitterlich.
</P>
<P>
   The other 30 teams spent the second day of this draft improving
in more conventional ways.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the sure things went on the first day, a lot of
big-time players went on the second day.
</P>
<P>
   Tee Martin, the Tennessee quarterback, went to Pittsburgh late
in the fifth round, the 160th player chosen and the fourth
quarterback. Two picks later, Minnesota chose Stanford's Troy
Walters, who won the Biletnikoff Award as the nation's best wide
receiver but who is only 5-foot-6{ and 171 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Joe Hamilton of Georgia Tech, runner-up for the
Heisman Trophy, wasn't taken until the seventh and last round, with
the 234th overall pick. Hamilton, who is just 5-10, joins Shaun
King, the 6-footer who was taken in the second round by the Bucs
last year and got them to the NFC title game as a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   The likes of UCLA wide receiver Danny Farmer (to the Steelers);
Penn State linebacker Brandon Short (Giants); and Minnesota safety
Tyrone Carter (Vikings) went in the fourth round; and Virginia Tech
safety Anthony Midget (Falcons); Nebraska cornerback Ralph Brown;
Miami guard Richard Mercier (Baltimore); Ohio State running back
Michael Wiley (Dallas, where he will be tried at wide receiver),
and Kentucky tight end James Whalen (Tampa Bay) were chosen in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Frank Murphy of Kansas State went to Chicago in the
sixth round, and Philadelphia used the next pick on Minnesota
running back Thomas Hamner. Murphy, who has fumbling problems, also
has a record of minor crimes going back seven years, when he was
arrested for carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   There was a milestone of sorts in the fourth round when
linebacker Isiah Kacyvenski was chosen by Seattle, the highest any
player from Harvard had ever been chosen.
</P>
<P>
   One pick of interest came in the sixth round, when Denver chose
Utah running back Mike Anderson, a former Marine who will turn 27
in September. But he has history in his favor. Terrell Davis, the
league and Super Bowl MVP two years ago was a sixth-round pick in
1995 and Olandis Gary, who replaced Davis last year when he was
injured and ran for more than 1,000 yards, was a fourth-rounder a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the sixth, New England took Michigan quarterback Tom
Brady and Washington took Stanford QB Todd Husak late in that
round. San Francisco, which took quarterback Giovanni Carmazzi of
Hofstra in the third round, took another QB, Louisiana Tech's Tim
Rattay in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Then Denver took Notre Dame quarterback Jarious Jackson, the
first member of the Fighting Irish selected.
</P>
<P>
   The last pick, by Chicago, was Michael Green of Northwestern
State. He will be honored at the 25th Irrelevant week in June in
Newport Beach, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals, Rockies Split Day  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jeff Manto hit a go-ahead double during an
eight-run sixth inning that propelled the Colorado Rockies to a
14-13 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in the second game of a
split doubleheader Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, who lost the afternoon opener 9-3, came back from
deficits of 3-0, 7-3 and 9-5 by sending 14 men to the plate against
four St. Louis pitchers in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst came three days after Colorado scored 10 runs in
the second inning against former Rockies pitcher Darryl Kile. The
team record for runs in an inning is 11 against Seattle in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Drew had a three-run double and Pat Hentgen kept his record
with St. Louis perfect as the Cardinals won Game 1. St. Louis had
to settle for a split despite hitting four homers on the day.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth inning of Game 2 lasted an hour as the Cardinals took
a 9-5 lead on a run-scoring groundout by Fernando Tatis and an RBI
single by Eric Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo started the Colorado comeback with a two-run double
off ex-Rockies reliever David Wainhouse. Mike Mohler (0-1)
relieved, two batters later, but promptly walked Larry Walker to
load the bases. Todd Helton tied it at 9 with a two-run single to
right.
</P>
<P>
   Manto, 4-for-5 this season, followed with a pinch double that
gave the Rockies their first lead of the day. After a fly out and
the fifth walk of the inning, Scott Servais hit a sinking line
drive that scored two more and chased Mohler. Brian Hunter added an
RBI infield single off Mike James to cap the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Jimenez (3-0), who threw a no-hitter for the Cardinals last
year, retired both hitters he faced in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals scored four times in the ninth, but fell just
short. Edgar Renteria had an RBI double, Jim Edmonds drove in
Fernando Vina with a sacrifice fly and Mike Matheny drew a
bases-loaded walk.
</P>
<P>
   But Gabe White, who entered with the bases loaded and Colorado
leading 14-10, ended the game by getting Placido Polanco to line
out to Larry Walker in right field. White retired two batters for
his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's comeback spoiled a big day by Vina, the St. Louis
leadoff man. Although he is the only Cardinals position player
without a homer, Vina went 6-for-9 -- including 5-for-5 in the
second game -- and scored six runs. The five hits matched a career
high.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, Hentgen (3-0) gave up three runs and seven hits
in 5 2-3 innings. The St. Louis offense gave him plenty of room for
error in his first Coors Field appearance by roughing up Rolando
Arrojo (1-1), who surrendered a career-high eight earned runs in
four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Polanco and Thomas Howard each homered off Arrojo in the first.
Drew put the Cardinals ahead 7-1 when he capped a five-run third
with a two-out, bases-loaded double into the right-center field
gap.
</P>
<P>
   Drew, who had mixed results in his rookie year, is 8-for-16 with
four homers and 12 RBIs in the season's first two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He was hit in the left wrist in the fifth inning of the opener
and did not play in the nightcap. Drew planned to have X-rays taken
Monday but did not expect the injury to be serious.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds and Eli Marrero each homered in the second game as the
Cardinals showed no signs of a power shortage without ailing Mark
McGwire. St. Louis has homered in nine straight games -- five
without the single-season home run king.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McGwire will be re-evaluated Monday after receiving
treatment over the weekend for inflammation in his lower back. ...
Colorado traded for Arrojo during the winter, in part because of
his control. He walked three hitters Sunday, and they all scored.
Arrojo also hit a batter with the bases loaded. ... Edmonds went
1-for-12 after a string of nine straight hits. ... St. Louis
scrapped plans to recall RHP Gene Stechschulte for Sunday's
doubleheader. Instead, Alan Benes remained on the active roster.
... The Rockies missed a chance for their first four-game home

<HEADLINE> Gingrich: Bush Campaign Not Ready  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- George W. Bush's staff is too inexperienced
to handle his presidential campaign, according to fellow Republican
and former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a sold-out audience Saturday night, Gingrich said
''there's too much Austin'' in the Texas governor's campaign and
said Bush needs to add more experienced advisers if he wants to win
the election.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich drew a gasp when he said first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton would easily beat New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in
the New York Senate race, then be the Democratic Party's
presidential nominee in 2004 if Vice President Al Gore loses this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore are all but certain to be the presidential
nominees this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich made his comments at an event staged by the Richmond
Forum, a group that puts on several public forums on a variety of
subjects throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's topic was politics. Besides Gingrich, another speaker
was James Carville, the Democratic consultant who masterminded
President Clinton's 1992 campaign and has remained a staunch
Clinton defender. Carville described Bush as an inexperienced
candidate who can't say no.
</P>
<P>
   His program to spend billions of dollars on politically popular
programs while cutting taxes and preserving Social Security would
lead the country down another path of massive budget deficits and
stifle the economy, Carville said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich coutered that tax cuts would keep the economy growing
and added that if the taxpayers' money is left in Washington, ''the
politicians will spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men agreed that the presidential election will be won in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's coming to Virginia other than to raise money,''
Carville said.

<HEADLINE> Military Drama Tops Box Office  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Marines in the courtroom won a narrow victory
over a party girl in rehab at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rules of Engagement,'' a military court drama, remained the
top movie for the second straight weekend, taking in $10.9 million,
according to studio estimates Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Final figures were to be released today.
</P>
<P>
   Debuting in second place with $10.4 million was ''28 Days,''
starring Sandra Bullock as an alcoholic ordered into a clinic after
crashing a limousine at her sister's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Another new film, ''Keeping the Faith,'' was third with $8.2
million. The Edward Norton-Ben Stiller comedy focuses on a rabbi
and priest whose lifelong friendship is jeopardized when they fall
for the same woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Erin Brockovich,'' the No. 1 movie for three straight weekends
before last week, was in fourth place with $7 million and has
grossed $99.3 million. It should pass $100 million by Tuesday, the
first movie released this year to cross that mark.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's most-talked-about debut, the adaptation of Bret
Easton Ellis' ultra-violent novel ''American Psycho,'' opened at
No. 7 with $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Psycho'' posted a respectable per-theater average of
$3,964, playing at 1,236 cinemas. Among the top 10 movies, that was
second only to ''28 Days,'' which averaged $4,122 at 2,523
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Newman's latest, ''Where the Money Is,'' had a weak opening
of $2.7 million, coming in at No. 11 and averaging $1,778 in 1,538
theaters. Newman plays an imprisoned bank robber who feigns a
stroke to get sent to a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rules of Engagement'' stars Tommy Lee Jones as a Marine
attorney defending an old friend (Samuel L. Jackson) in a
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess the guys still rule,'' said Ed Russell, executive vice
president for publicity at Sony, which distributed ''28 Days.''
''We were a predominantly female audience.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's tough sell was ''American Psycho,'' about a yuppie
serial killer who preys mainly on women. Ellis' 1991 novel drew
outrage from women's groups and others who criticized it as
pornographically violent.
</P>
<P>
   While ''American Psycho'' is bloody, director Mary Harron kept
most of the actual violence off-camera and turned the story into a
satire of 1980s materialism.
</P>
<P>
   Distributor Lions Gate worked to ''prepare people for the fact
that it was far less violent than the novel and much more sharply
satiric,'' said Mark Urman, co-president of Lions Gate. ''We really
wanted to make it clear that people won't see anything that would
turn the stomach or in anyway promote violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions Gate, which successfully marketed the religious satire
''Dogma'' last year, tried creative ways to pitch ''American
Psycho,'' including a plan to share a small percentage of revenue
with Internet users if the movie grosses more than $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not your mainstream film,'' said Paul Dergarabedian,
president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks movie ticket sales.
''For them to even be in the top 10 says they did something
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Rules of Engagement,'' $10.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''28 Days,'' $10.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''Keeping the Faith,'' $8.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''Erin Brockovich,'' $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''The Road to El Dorado,'' $6.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''Return to Me,'' $5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''American Psycho,'' $4.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''The Skulls,'' $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. ''Final Destination,'' $2.83 million.
</P>
<P>
   10. ''High Fidelity,'' $2.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Sharply Lower  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS WAGNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets plummeted Monday, reacting to
the record losses on Wall Street last week that left many investors
wondering if its bull market was over.
</P>
<P>
   In the world's second largest economy, Japan's benchmark Nikkei
Stock Average fell a staggering 1,793.62 points, or 8.8 percent, to
18,641.06. Dropping far below the key 20,000-point mark, the Nikkei
stood at its lowest level since Jan. 12, with high-technology
stocks being hit the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the morning session, the Nikkei had recovered
slightly, rising to 18,683.89 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going straight down in line with the movement in New
York,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, a general manager at Chuo Securities
in Tokyo. ''I expected the market to fall, but I didn't think it
would fall quite this much.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, however, said he was
not worried by the Nikkei's woes and signs of Japan's economic
recovery remain clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not too concerned,'' Miyazawa said, adding that the
losses ''were in line with expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to stop the market free-fall, the Tokyo Stock
Exchange temporarily suspended trading in Osaka of stocks that
investors buy at a set price for the month of June.
</P>
<P>
   ''The market has fallen too far,'' said Teruhisa Ishikawa, a
deputy general manager at Izumi Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   In two other closely watched bourses in Asia -- Hong Kong and
Singapore -- the situation also was grim.
</P>
<P>
   Prices plunged from the outset in Hong Kong, with the Hang Seng
Index off by 1,185.96 points, or 7.35 percent, at 14,956.80 after
several hours of trading.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, the Straits Times Index had fallen 176.68 points,
or 8.07 percent, to 2,013.08 by midday.
</P>
<P>
   Other stock markets in the region also dropped sharply, with
Australia's All Ordinaries Index falling 178.10 points, or 5.75
percent, to 2,915.90, before improving slightly.
</P>
<P>
   The Korea Composite Stock Price Index did even worse, down 89.35
points, or 11 percent, to 711.54. The Korea Stock Exchange said it
was a record fall, in both points and percentage. The Korean index
recovered slightly later in the day, but analysts said the bearish
trend was expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tumble was in sync with the crash of Wall Street, and the
trend is likely to persist for the time being,'' said Kim Sung-won,
an analyst at Dongwon Securities Co. in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian markets were reacting to Friday's big losses on the
U.S. markets in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 617.78 points, or 5.7
percent, to 10,305.77, in its biggest single-day point loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index, home to technology stocks whose
popularity has evaporated, tumbled 355.49, or 9.7 percent, to
3,321.29. The point drop was its worst ever, surpassing a fall of
349.15 on March 3, and it was the second worst in percentage.

Asian Markets Plummet

<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets plummeted at the end of the morning session
Monday, reacting to the record losses on Wall Street last week that left many
investors wondering if its bull market was over. In the world's second largest
economy, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average fell a staggering 1,793.62 points, or 8.8

the morning session, the Nikkei had recovered slightly, rising to 18,683.89
points. Elsewhere, Australia's All Ordinaries Index fell 5.6 percent at one
point, and the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down 89.35 points, or 11
percent, to 711.54. The Korea Stock Exchange said it was a record fall, in both
points and percentage, on the index.

Taiwan Has Eye on Aegis Destroyers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When U.S. and Taiwanese officials gather behind closed
doors Monday to discuss which weapons the United States is willing to sell, the
$4.4 billion question will be whether Taiwan gets the go-ahead to buy the Aegis
destroyers it says it needs to counter a buildup of Chinese missiles. The talks
Monday and Tuesday in Washington are especially sensitive because of their
profound political implications. China has said it would be compelled to react
harshly if Taiwan acquires Aegis warships. Taiwan views its request as a test of
U.S. support in the face of China's continuing buildup of offensive missiles.

Some Gov't Workers Told To Stay Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of traffic-snarling protests aimed at
disrupting world financial meetings Monday has prompted federal authorities to
tell government workers whose offices are in a restricted area around the bank's
headquarters to stay home. The officials said they could not estimate how many
employees that would involve, but such major departments as Commerce, Treasury
and Agriculture -- not to mention the White House -- are headquartered within
the restricted area. Thousands of marchers failed to stop world finance leaders
from meeting today, but paraded through the capital in a show of celebration and
anger that provoked one ugly episode -- a surging crowd met by a stinging cloud
of irritants fired by police.

Report Issues Environmental Warning
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A United Nations-sponsored report said Sunday despite
greater environmental awareness, growing demand for resources is threatening the
world's environmental health more than ever. In the long term, it said, humans
will pay the price. The broad decline of the world's ecosystems -- the
interaction of organisms with their physical environment -- must be reversed or
there ''could be devastating implications'' for human development, the study
said. The study was sponsored by the U.N. Development Programme, the U.N.
Environmental Programme and the World Bank. It assessed the current health of
agriculture, coastal areas, forests, fresh water environments and grasslands.

Elian's Dad Lashes Out at Miami Kin
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father lashed out at his Miami relatives on
Sunday, accusing them of ''child abuse'' for turning his son against him and
insisting that the 6-year-old boy wants to return to Cuba. With the boy's fate
still before federal judges, Juan Miguel Gonzalez said on CBS' ''60 Minutes''
that he didn't believe a video taped at the relatives' home in which his son
said he didn't want to go. Family members did not make themselves available
after the show. Protesters, however, dismissed Juan Miguel's comments as either
selfish or the manipulations of Fidel Castro.

Cardinals, Rockies Split Doubleheader
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jeff Manto hit a go-ahead double during an eight-run sixth
inning that propelled the Colorado Rockies to a 14-13 victory over the St. Louis
Cardinals in the second game of a split doubleheader Sunday night. The Rockies,
who lost the afternoon opener 9-3, came back from deficits of 3-0, 7-3 and 9-5
by sending 14 men to the plate against four St. Louis pitchers in the sixth.
J.D. Drew had a three-run double and Pat Hentgen kept his record with St. Louis
perfect as the Cardinals won Game 1.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Reaches Out to Americans  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Video clips of congressmen, high-powered attorneys
and television news personalities from the long-demonized United
States are suddenly staples on communist Cuba's state television.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showing a majority of Americans think 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez should be returned to Cuba, as well as like-minded
editorials from leading U.S. newspapers, are reprinted in the
Communist Party newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since the custody battle over Elian began, Fidel Castro's
government has found itself in rare agreement with a majority of
Americans and even President Clinton -- and it has gone out of its
way to make sure Cubans understand that not everyone in the United
States holds the anti-Castro views of many Cuban exiles in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no controversy between the governments of Cuba and
the United States,'' Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly, said earlier this year. Washington officials ''very
clearly have recognized that this child should be returned to his
father as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Havana's real fight has been with leaders in Miami's
Cuban-American community, who are battling to keep Elian in the
United States and have used the case to attack Castro, their
political nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   While using the case to lash out at them, the Cuban government
also has reached out to other Americans who in this post Cold
War-era no longer view communist Cuba strictly through an
ideological prism.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is showing the potential for compromise between the
U.S. and Cuba,'' said Susan Eckstein, a Cuba specialist from Boston
University. ''It would be terrific if this could be used as a basis
to negotiate other points.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Newsweek poll released Saturday, 53 percent of
Americans believe Elian should be returned to his father in Cuba.
The poll, conducted among 752 adults on April 13-14, had a margin
of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans who think the boy should be returned to Cuba do
not necessarily agree with the country's system of government.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuba is a repressive society, a society governed by a dictator
from whom thousands have fled,'' U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno
recently said in a speech arguing for the boy's return to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   But a decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the case
highlights that the strong anti-Cuba feelings that once were common
in the United States may be fading.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the sign over the past two years as President
Clinton has moved to increase ''people to people'' contacts by
relaxing travel restrictions for Americans who want to visit Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The first direct charter flights from New York and Los Angeles
to Cuba have been announced in recent months, in addition to
charter service from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   More than 160,000 U.S. citizens visited the island last year,
Cuban Tourism Minister Ibrahim Ferradaz said this week. The U.S.
citizens were a small but notable portion of the more than 1.6
million tourists that Cuba says it drew in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   American visitors over the past year have included U.S.
senators, Illinois Gov. George Ryan, the Baltimore Orioles,
American literary giants Arthur Miller and William Styron, a high
school debating team from Oregon, the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra,
high school and college sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been steady moves in Congress to at least
partially lift the four-decade-old U.S. embargo against the
communist island.
</P>
<P>
   A number of members of Congress who support an easing of the
embargo also have sided with Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
who is currently in Washington in hopes of being reunited with his
boy and returning with him to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past week, U.S. Representatives Maxine Waters,
D-Calif., and Sheila Jackson-Lee, D-Texas, have been interviewed
live during a daily evening television program bringing Cuban
citizens up to date on the Elian case.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, former head of the National
Council of Churches, and Gonzalez's American attorney, Gregory
Craig, have also been featured on state television.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the battle in early December -- just days
after Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida -- Cuban officials
here have emphasized that they had no real beef with Washington
over its handling of the case, aside from its slowness to move.
</P>
<P>
   In early January, U.S. Immigration Commissioner Doris Meissner
ruled that Elian should be returned to his father and Cuba, and
said that only Gonzalez had the right to speak for his son. Both
Reno and Clinton backed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban authorities have grumbled about Reno's failure to move
more rapidly to reunite father and son, but expressed gratitude for
what they consider her fair-handed handling of the case -- something
they say would have been impossible at the height of the Cold War.

<HEADLINE> A New York business landmark goes residential  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking for a primo Manhattan pad to go with
your high-flying Internet startup?
</P>
<P>
   Stuffy Park Avenue and pretentious SoHo just don't fit the bill?
</P>
<P>
   How about a luxury apartment at the top of the Woolworth
Building, the wondrously overwrought, 60-story neo-Gothic landmark
once dubbed the Cathedral of Commerce?
</P>
<P>
   One of the Old Economy's most famous addresses is converting its
top 30 floors to residential space and hoping (stock market tumbles
notwithstanding) to attract the New Economy's highest rollers as
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be tremendous ego gratification to saying that you
live on top of the Woolworth Building,'' said Pam Liebman, CEO of
the upmarket real estate firm the Corcoran Group, who recently
toured the building. ''There's nothing else in the city like it,
... because of the name, the history, the location, the beauty of
the building. It's pretty spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   The Woolworth Building, erected by five-and-dime store magnate
Frank W. Woolworth in 1913, boasts a white marble lobby with
Tiffany stained-glass panels and colored-glass mosaics embedded in
its vaulted ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the city's signature skyscrapers, with an ornately
detailed terra cotta exterior designed by architect Cass Gilbert.
Across the street from City Hall and blocks from the financial
district, it served for 85 years as headquarters of Woolworth's
national chain and was the world's tallest building until 1929,
when the Chrysler Building surpassed it.
</P>
<P>
   Converting the building's upper tower to apartments ''is going
to create within an old structure a new vitality,'' said architect
Costas Kondylis, who is designing the residential space.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a serious building,'' he said. ''It's not just trendy,
fashionable architecture which two years from now might be
completely disregarded.''
</P>
<P>
   As few as one or two high-ceilinged luxury apartments may occupy
each floor of the building, whose length runs a full block.
</P>
<P>
   Crowning the redesign will be a three-story penthouse in the
building's spire. The lucky -- read extremely wealthy -- occupants
will have access via a private glass elevator to Frank Woolworth's
own wraparound terrace and its breathtaking views.
</P>
<P>
   The vistas from lower down aren't bad either. The Brooklyn
Bridge, New York Harbor, the World Trade Center, midtown Manhattan
and the Hudson River are all visible from the tower.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of a 'Wow' factor when you walk in there,'' Liebman
said. ''It's like being in a helicopter.''
</P>
<P>
   An ocean of amenities are planned for those ready to pay prices
that have not been announced but will certainly be eye-popping. The
New York Observer guessed residents may have to ante up $6 million,
and as much as $12 million for the penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   A wine cellar, media room, cigar lounge, business center and a
private dining room were all being considered for a basement
concourse, Kondylis said. Woolworth's private pool will become part
of a health club.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul comes about two years after the Witkoff Group,
headed by developer Steven Witkoff, bought the building from the
Venator Group, formerly known as the Woolworth Corp., for a
reported $122 million.
</P>
<P>
   The office space vacated when Venator moved out has been
outfitted with Internet connections and filled with new companies,
many of them high-tech ventures, said Brad Gerla, managing director
of Insignia-ESG, which handles commercial leasing for the building.
</P>
<P>
   But some longtime occupants are unhappy with Witkoff's
management style -- he's raised rents and pushed out many
upper-floor business tenants to make way for the superrich. Even
the venerable Harry's restaurant on the ground floor had to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''The sad thing is, they're not interested in people,''
complained Tom Oliva, whose small barber shop has been a fixture in
the building for 33 years but recently lost its lease. ''They're
just interested in money. The human factor is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Woolworth Building is to join a slew of other Lower
Manhattan office and factory spaces that have gone residential
recently, adding a new dimension to a part of town that was once
deserted after dark.
</P>
<P>
   Liebman said the apartments were likely to attract Wall
Streeters eager to walk to work, dot-com entrepreneurs and
out-of-towners looking for a New York pied-a-terre.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has broad-based appeal,'' she said. ''The one thing they'll
have to have in common is they'll have to have money.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Begins Visit to Britain  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin begins his first
official visit to the West eager to forge closer ties with Europe
while presenting his credentials as a reformist leader who can
bring stability to the world's largest nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the newly elected leader faces protests and criticism over
Chechnya and allegations that Russian troops have used excessive
force and executed civilians in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who arrived Sunday night with his wife, Lyudmila, was
scheduled to hold a roundtable meeting today with foreign investors
in a bid to lure their badly needed capital back to his country.
The seminar was to be followed by a working lunch with Prime
Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister sees the election of a new generation to
power in Moscow as a potential turning point in relations with
Russia,'' said Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell. ''He will use
the visit as an important opportunity for Britain to build a new
strategic relationship with the new Russian leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a longtime KGB agent who never held elected office until
last month's presidential vote, has made it clear that Russia's
future lies with Europe, and he seems to have singled out Britain --
with its unique role as a bridge between the United States and the
European Union -- as a key partner to cultivate.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's first meeting with a Western leader was with Blair, who
accepted the Russian's invitation in March to visit St. Petersburg.
Blair, who at 46 is one year younger than Putin, left impressed
with the new Russian leader's energy and ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also said he was pleased with Blair's willingness to work
with Moscow, which he cited as the reason for choosing London for
his first Western trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly hope that this will not be simply a visit of
courtesy, but it will help advance the solution of a number of key
problems of cooperation,'' Putin told reporters in the Kremlin
before leaving, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
   But while topics such as fighting drugs, international crime and
terrorism and how the two nuclear powers can cooperate were to be
high on the agenda during the 24-hour visit, Blair promised not to
shy away from criticism of Putin's military assault on Chechen
separatists.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union submitted a resolution to the United Nations'
top human rights body last week condemning alleged human rights
abuses and urging Russia to take a more restrained approach. The
Council of Europe has lifted Russia's voting rights and asked for a
full suspension unless peace talks begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's up to Prime Minister Tony Blair to keep up the
pressure,'' said Holly Cartner of the New York-based Human Rights
Watch. ''Blair has to make clear that Britain will take the lead in
bringing Russia to account.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader's international credentials, however, were
boosted Friday when the Duma ratified the START II treaty. Putin's
predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, had repeatedly failed to win approval
for the nuclear arms reduction agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ends his London visit at Windsor Castle, where he has a
private audience with the queen, a distant relative of Russia's
last monarch, Czar Nicholas II.

<HEADLINE> Quotes From Mets' Valentine Printed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ignoring New York Mets manager Bobby
Valentine's e-mail request, the University of Pennsylvania
newspaper published portions of an audio tape of his speech to a
group of business students.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Pennsylvanian is the first to quote Valentine
directly. About 30 minutes of his speech was taped, and portions of
the transcript were provided to The Associated Press on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Valentine sent an e-mail to the newspaper's
reporter asking her to call him. She returned the call and
Valentine requested that the tape not be released to the public.
The reporter told him that her editor would make the decision about
the tape.
</P>
<P>
   There was no further contact.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, speaking Wednesday to students at Penn's Wharton
School of Business, addressed the team's failure to sign Japanese
reliever Kazuhiro Sasaki and criticized former Mets player Bobby
Bonilla and outfielder Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a proponent during the offseason to say, 'Let's boost
our bullpen,''' Valentine said of Sasaki. ''I thought that if we
can sign this kid Sasaki, who's a free agent, it would have cost us
no talent, just a little money, and we would have one heck of a
baseball team right now. But the group who makes the decisions
decides that wasn't a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki signed with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bonilla, Valentine said, ''He found his stroke and lost
45 pounds. That makes a big difference. ... There seems to be
commitment this year, interestingly enough, because he's without a
contract this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is batting .273 while playing regularly for the Atlanta
Braves this season.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were posted on the Mets' Web site by a Penn student
late Wednesday or early Thursday. Valentine said his comments were
misrepresented. Several newspapers reported conflicting versions of
his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips flew from New York to
Pittsburgh on Friday to talk to Valentine. Phillips said he was
satisfied with Valentine's explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In comments about Henderson, Valentine related a story in which
Henderson asked for the sports section of The Wall Street Journal,
which does not have a sports section.
</P>
<P>
   ''Worldly, he's worldly,'' he said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   He also joked about dealing with Henderson, who is often
disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just ignore him as much as I can,'' he laughed. ''Seriously,
the personality of Rickey ... it's the same personality that we all
have, probably that he's always had.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine also endorsed building one stadium for the Mets and
the World Champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's any way the city of New York and the
public is going to co-venture two buildings in excess of a billion
dollars each for these rich kids that run around with baseballs and
rich owners that make a lot of money,'' Valentine said.

<HEADLINE> March From Phnom Penh Recalled  </HEADLINE>
By KER MUNTHIT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- I remember being puzzled by the
black-clad soldiers, many as young as me, who celebrated wildly in
the streets of Phnom Penh on April 17, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Running barefoot with traditional red-checkered scarves wrapped
around their heads, they shouted slogans -- ''Long live the
revolution!'' and ''Down with American imperialism!'' -- and fired
their rifles into the air, scattering frightened onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Khmer Rouge,'' someone whispered to me, clearing up the
confusion in my 12-year-old mind.
</P>
<P>
   I understood that the communist guerrillas' arrival marked the
end of Gen. Lon Nol's foundering Khmer Republic, but neither I nor
anyone else realized the horror that Cambodia's new masters had in
store for us.
</P>
<P>
   My four siblings and I watched the Khmer Rouge victory unfold
from inside the gates of a Buddhist pagoda packed with refugees
from the three-month siege of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   We had lived there with my grandmother for about a week while my
parents guarded our house on the outskirts of the capital, dodging
intense mortar and rocket fire.
</P>
<P>
   Two Khmer Rouge units engaged in a brief standoff outside the
temple as the leadership carved Phnom Penh into military-controlled
districts. After the argument was settled, the order came to
evacuate us from the city.
</P>
<P>
   It was imperative that we leave because the United States
planned to bomb the city, the Khmer Rouge told us. We would be
allowed to return in three days, the soldiers said.
</P>
<P>
   My father remembers the citywide panic as people tried to gather
their families for the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   We were lucky. The Khmer Rouge commander in charge of the
district was the brother of our neighbor. He was in high spirits
after being reunited with his sister, so he agreed to help my
father collect his own family.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it were not for that woman,'' my father, Ker Sa Ut, now 63,
says of our old neighbor, ''we would certainly not have seen each
other ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   The commander and two subordinates, chugging Pepsi seized from a
nearby bottling plant, escorted my uncle as he drove across town to
the pagoda to pick us up.
</P>
<P>
   We were happily reunited, but the moment proved to be the
beginning of a tragic, four-year journey. The Khmer Rouge's plan to
turn what they would call Democratic Kampuchea into a communist
agrarian utopia had begun. Everyone was to live -- or die -- in an
equal society.
</P>
<P>
   As we left the city, we came upon a group of ethnic Chinese
carrying small backpacks. They were pleading with a Khmer Rouge
soldier to let them stay in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
   The annoyed soldier asked, ''OK, who wants to go back to Phnom
Penh?''
</P>
<P>
   One of them raised his hand and stepped forward. The soldier
shot him in the head at point-blank range, killing him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was terribly shocking,'' my father says. ''They terrified
people into remaining obedient to their orders. The crowd kept
moving. I still believed that after three days they would let us
return home.''
</P>
<P>
   The execution was just one of many horrible sights on the road
from capital. The cries of children mixed with calls of people
frantically searching for relatives lost in the crowd. The sick and
wounded lay on stretchers in agony by the roadside, abandoned by
their desperate kin.
</P>
<P>
   Under a makeshift tent, a woman had just given birth to a baby.
Khmer Rouge troops denied her any rest and forced her to rejoin the
exodus. Her husband loaded them into a cart and pushed them forward
under the burning sun. The baby, barely cleaned of birth blood and
swaddled in cloth, slept by its mother's side.
</P>
<P>
   Swollen corpses of government soldiers were scattered around the
highway. Some had been crushed flat under the treads of Khmer Rouge
tanks.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a woman separated from her family tried to force
her way into our car when we stopped in traffic. She revealed a
handbag brimming with diamonds and gold -- the only possessions she
brought with her -- and begged that we take some in exchange for a
ride.
</P>
<P>
   We refused; there were already 11 of us crammed in the vehicle.
A few days later, we learned she was found dead by a riverbank.
</P>
<P>
   Most people made sure to carry enough food to eat for at least
three days. But some wealthy families simply brought cash packed
into pillows or rice sacks. When they learned the Khmer Rouge had
abolished money and their savings were worthless, their despondency
drove many insane.
</P>
<P>
   After four days without hearing the sounds of American bombs, my
father realized we had been tricked into evacuating. We had left
behind a house built just two years earlier. In a few more days,
the Khmer Rouge confiscated our car.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that was it. I began to try to forget about everything
we left behind,'' my father says. ''Everybody was facing the same
fate, not just us. Ahead of us stood the question of death and
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight days we arrived at a village 37 miles northeast of
Phnom Penh. Branded as ''new people'' or ''April 17 people,'' we
struggled as members of the lowest caste of a supposedly classless
society.
</P>
<P>
   Living conditions steadily deteriorated. After living in a
modern concrete house, we had to adjust to a 16-by-24-foot thatched
hut with a leaky roof.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy was taken from my family as surely as our old home. We
were constantly watched. Any time our family exhibited ''bourgeois
habits,'' my parents were summoned for ''self-criticism'' sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Urban families lived in constant fear. When my father was
stricken with diarrhea so severe he could not stand, the village
leaders warned my mother that he would be ''crushed'' if he was
caught lying about his ailment.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge were more kind to children, whom they considered
empty vessels easy to fill with the doctrine of Khmer Rouge leader
Pol Pot.
</P>
<P>
   Children belonging to families of ''old people'' -- rural
peasants who had lived under the Khmer Rouge for several years --
were given the status of police officers, an upending of village
society that quickly went to their heads.
</P>
<P>
   I remember how one teen-age boy beat his mother senseless for
stealing a potato from the farming collective. Steeped in Khmer
Rouge teachings against traditional family life, the boy stated
proudly, ''I'm beating a thief, not my mother.''
</P>
<P>
   My father, a French-trained accountant who had worked at the
Industry Ministry, was sent to a re-education camp. All but my
youngest brother, a mere 4 years old, were put to hard labor. He
would catch small frogs in the evenings to fill his empty stomach.
Many other children died of malnutrition and starvation. My mother
was often brought to tears.
</P>
<P>
   Work hard but eat less -- that was the formula that killed most
of the estimated 1.7 million victims of Pol Pot's regime.
</P>
<P>
   ''People became real slaves,'' my father says. ''We had to work
as told by (the leaders). Nobody had any right to think about
anything except working for watery rice porridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the nearly 200 urban families who were settled in the
village, only about 50 were left when the Khmer Rouge were driven
from power by a Vietnamese invasion on Jan. 7, 1979.
</P>
<P>
   No family survived intact. I lost my grandparents, a relatively
small price compared to others. Even my father survived, one of a
handful released from re-education camps around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, he says, patience and hard work were our best
survival tools. With everyone in the family joining the work force
without complaint, we probably convinced the Khmer Rouge that we
had been successfully integrated into the revolution.
</P>
<P>
   We had effectively given our lives to the collectivization
policies of the regime. Our bodies were owned by the Khmer Rouge,
while we quietly clung to our souls.

<HEADLINE> Student newspaper releases quotes from Valentine's speech  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- New York Mets manager Bobby Valentine
prefaced his remarks to a crowd of about 100 business students by
asking for a guarantee that they wouldn't ''be seen on 20/20.''
Then he proceeded to criticize the front-office as well as current
and former players.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pennsylvania newspaper ignored Valentine's
plea to a reporter shortly after the speech and today published
portions of an audio tape of his comments.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Pennsylvanian is the first to quote Valentine
directly. About 30 minutes of his speech was taped, and portions of
the transcript were provided to The Associated Press on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Valentine sent an e-mail to the newspaper's
reporter, Laura Spadanuta. She called him back on Friday, and he
asked her not to release an audio tape of the comments. Spadanuta,
a student, said her editor would have the final decision. There was
no further contact.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, speaking Wednesday to students at Penn's Wharton
School of Business, addressed the team's failure to sign Japanese
reliever Kazuhiro Sasaki and criticized former Mets player Bobby
Bonilla and outfielder Rickey Henderson. He also questioned the
league's handling of Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a proponent during the offseason to say, 'Let's boost
our bullpen,''' Valentine said of Sasaki. ''I thought that if we
can sign this kid Sasaki, who's a free agent, it would have cost us
no talent, just a little money, and we would have one heck of a
baseball team right now. But the group who makes the decisions
decides that wasn't a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki signed with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bonilla, Valentine said, ''He found his stroke and lost
45 pounds. That makes a big difference. ... There seems to be
commitment this year, interestingly enough, because he's without a
contract this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is batting .273 while playing regularly for the Atlanta
Braves this season.
</P>
<P>
   The comments were posted on the Mets' Web site by a Penn student
late Wednesday or early Thursday. Valentine said his comments were
misrepresented. Several newspapers reported conflicting versions of
his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Mets general manager Steve Phillips flew from New York to
Pittsburgh on Friday to talk to Valentine. Phillips said he was
satisfied with Valentine's explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In comments about Henderson, Valentine related a story in which
Henderson asked for the sports section of The Wall Street Journal,
which does not have a sports section.
</P>
<P>
   ''Worldly, he's worldly,'' he said dryly.

disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just ignore him as much as I can,'' he laughed. ''Seriously,
the personality of Rickey ... it's the same personality that we all
have, probably that he's always had.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was originally suspended for one month for racist
comments he made about New York fans in a magazine interview. His
suspension was later reduced to two weeks. Valentine said he was
''disappointed in the way the league handled'' the matter and ''in
the way the players association got involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I personally am totally in favor of free speech in our
country, whether you're in a baseball uniform or whether you're in
a postman's uniform,'' he said. ''I thought John Rocker's situation
should have been handled by his team and his teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine called Rocker's remarks ''appalling,'' but said he
doesn't think ''there's any disciplinary act from the supreme ruler
of our game that should have been handed down. I don't particularly
like the thought that ... something I say here might be held
against me by the commissioner of baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   The university's television station said it taped Valentine's
speech, but it was unclear if the station still has it. The
newspaper reported Valentine contacted the group that organized the
event -- Wharton Wide World of Sports -- and asked that all copies be
given to him.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, Valentine also endorsed building one stadium
for the Mets and the World Champion Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's any way the city of New York and the
public is going to co-venture two buildings in excess of a billion
dollars each for these rich kids that run around with baseballs and
rich owners that make a lot of money,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Swarm at Finance Summit  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demonstrators set out to snarl workaday
Washington today with protests aimed at world finance conferences
that went on despite them over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After two raucous days of marches, street theater and
confrontations with police, the federal government closed its
agencies in the potential protest zone, an 11 by 8 block swath east
and west of the White House. Both the federal and local governments
encouraged all but essential workers to stay home on leave.
</P>
<P>
   Police warned the protests on a busy weekday could create fierce
traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people can just bank on having traffic congestion like
they have not seen around here,'' Police Chief Charles Ramsey said
after Sunday's protests, looking toward a nightmare morning rush
hour.
</P>
<P>
   He advised people not to drive near the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund buildings in the center of town, both
on streets partially or fully shut down in the weekend
demonstrations. ''If they don't avoid it and choose to drive, they
need to be prepared for long delays,'' Ramsey said. ''In other
words, bring a sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of marchers failed to stop world finance leaders from
meeting Sunday. But they paraded through the capital in a show of
celebration and anger, punctuated by occasional confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Festive street theater with giant puppets coexisted with
confrontations between police trying to keep the streets open and
the finance meetings safe and protesters agitating about the plight
of the poor and ''decadence'' of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, police in riot gear and on motorcycles charged
into a crowd that had surged toward the police line. Police used
pepper spray and what they said were smoke bombs to drive back the
protesters, who were convinced they'd been tear gassed.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the protests that overwhelmed police and smashed
windows in rainy Seattle to disrupt and block trade meetings late
last year, the weekend demonstrations were largely nonviolent on a
hot, sunny Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've seen a whole lot less property damage than after a Bulls
game in Chicago,'' said Han Shan, a protest organizer from the San
Francisco-based group Ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   Police sent buses under the early morning darkness Sunday to
pick up world finance ministers at their hotels, then used
circuitous routes and U-turns to get them to work.
</P>
<P>
   But some VIPs were stranded: The finance ministers of France,
Brazil, Portugal and Thailand were thwarted by the crowds and sat
at the Watergate Hotel six hours after the meetings started,
wondering what to do. They eventually made it to the spring meeting
of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Police, who estimated as many as 10,000 protesters were on the
streets, blocked off a downtown area as large as 90 square blocks
and let demonstrators largely have their way outside the security
zone. Protest leaders estimated their crowds at more than 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Shan credited police with being relatively restrained, if
suffocating in the size of their force. ''Overall, they maintained
their composure quite a bit,'' he said. ''They have brutalized a
few people without provocation.''
</P>
<P>
   The streets scenes were not so tense as on Saturday, when police
raided and closed the protest headquarters during the day and
arrested more than 600 people in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 people were arrested Sunday, police said. One police
officer was hospitalized for back pain and another for heat
exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters accused the World Bank and IMF of burdening poor
countries with crushing debt payments, unsafe food, environmental
destruction and sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Michael Moore, director general of the World Trade
Organization: ''Blaming the World Bank for poverty is a bit like
blaming the Red Cross for starting World Wars I and II.''
</P>
<P>
   A teacher arrested Saturday during a march protesting the
''prison industrial complex'' showed off her booking number
scribbled with a magic marker on her wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are violating our constitutional liberties at every
step,'' she said. ''They arrested people preemptively when they had
done nothing wrong. I am furious about it. You can hardly call this
a democracy at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mayor Anthony Williams said: ''Whenever you're
dealing with a situation like this, you're going to be up on the
boundary line in terms of constitutional rights.''

<HEADLINE> Finance Protesters a Diverse Bunch  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Teen-ager Kim Cook doesn't know that much yet
about the complexities of world financial politics. Economics
professor Robin Hahnel knows the system, and doesn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of others protesting the meetings of global
finance groups here Sunday and today, they worry that international
capitalism is overshadowing people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm completely opposed to corporate-sponsored globalism,''
said Hahnel, a 54-year-old professor at American University. ''For
the past 15 years or so, large corporations have had a free hand in
rewriting the rules of international economics.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been exciting to see this many people pulling together on
one issue,'' said Cook, 18, of Chicago, as she locked arms in a
street blockade. ''People need to have a say in decisions that
affect their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The two were among the thousands of students, activists, college
professors, laborers, anarchists, high school teachers, retirees --
and especially young people who came to voice their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one commonality is a feeling of anti-corporate control,''
said one of them, Bill Carey, a 46-year-old member of United
Steelworkers from Gary, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands roamed the streets through the weekend to protest
world financial policies, many talking of a growing awareness of
financial concepts like ''structural adjustment'' and
''transnational corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   They said global capitalism has run amok in far-off places like
Bolivia, Indonesia and Lesotho, with the privatization of water
resources, building of dams, speculative investment or harsh
debt-repayment schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Dolling, a 55-year-old retired teacher from the Toronto
area, said she's been upset about ''structural adjustment'' ever
since she learned about changes the international financial
institutions require of countries to obtain loans. She spent
several years as a teacher in Lesotho, a poor, Belgium-sized
country of 2.1 million people that is surrounded by South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to pay their debts, countries have to cut funding for
things like education, the environment and health care,'' she said,
adding that many people in poor countries are hurt by the levels of
debt from IMF and World Bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Lemisch, 63, a history professor from New York City, said
this is why he came to the rally: ''I really oppose the horrors of
international capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemisch was active in civil rights protests and other causes in
the 1960s, and he's involved again because he wants to notify the
World Bank, the IMF and President Clinton ''that they cannot get
away with this monstrous behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the younger protesters were people wearing masks who
sprinted from one street corner to the next looking for mischief.
Others were professionals with a growing interest in the movement,
people like Alan Bushnell, 23, a computer specialist at Brown
University in Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's silly to deny the reality of globalism,'' Bushnell said.
''But I want to learn more about what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Other protesters were social activists, like Erick Brownstein,
29, a San Francisco environmental organizer. He had close-cropped
brown hair and a conservative appearance, except for a red, round
clown nose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to inject a little humor into the event,'' Brownstein
said with a straight face. ''And I wanted to communicate the
message 'Who are these clowns running the world? Who put these
clowns in charge?'''

<HEADLINE> IMF Pledges Relief for Poor Nations  </HEADLINE>
By TRACI CARL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buffeted from rowdy demonstrators outside,
finance officials pledged to reduce debt and poverty worldwide
while trying to calm global markets with pledges of closer
cooperation among the largest economic powers.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters were able to disrupt the opening of the annual spring
meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank by
delaying or preventing some delegates and staff from attending. But
unlike in Seattle, they did not prevent the meetings from being
held -- something they had promised to do.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expectations of more demonstrations today, the
meetings were to continue with a session of the Development
Committee, the policy-setting group for the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Besides demonstrations calling for the abolition of the IMF and
World Bank, the United States and other countries had to contend
with turbulent markets following last week's $2 trillion meltdown
in U.S. stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at a news conference following a weekend
meeting of the world's seven wealthiest countries, Italian Treasury
Minister Guiliano Amato said U.S. monetary officials refused to
predict what may happen to markets Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing discussed that could be considered a
forecast of what may happen Monday,'' Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told reporters
late Sunday that officials needed to focus on improving the IMF's
surveillance of international economies, especially in light of the
drop in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's been recognized in every meeting that we've had:
the need for continued vigilance, the need to be absolutely sure
that the macroeconomic foundation, the stability of the economies
is assured,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated pledges to seek greater debt relief for the
poorest countries and reform the IMF so it can better prevent
financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our message to those people who have been demonstrating is
this: that the way forward for those people who want to reduce
poverty and want to see greater stability in the world ... is not
to advocate turning our back on the global economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a World Bank proposal aims to help poor countries
increase exports to the industrialized world. Under the plan,
countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia would sell their goods
to the United States and other Western nations without facing
tariff or import quotas -- something that would give them a
substantial economic advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has opposed the measure, fearing it could
increase protectionist measures in the United States at a time when
America's trade deficit has soared to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius said it made ''little
sense to provide debt relief on one hand without providing
countries that receive this assistance with access to our
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabius and several other finance ministers were delayed Sunday
by protesters who formed a human chain and blocked entrances as the
meetings got under way. After six hours of trying, Fabius made it
through the blockade. He said the thousands of demonstrators had an
''enormous misunderstanding'' about the poverty-reduction missions
of the IMF and World Bank, but conceded that ''some improvements''
could be made.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Amgott, spokesman for Oxfam, an international aid agency,
called the IMF a ''flawed institution.'' But he added that ''the
U.S. Congress is the biggest obstacle to funding debt relief.''
Congress has yet to approve the administration's full request for
the money it will need to pay the United States' share of the
debt-reduction program.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any of the protest slogans had caught his eye, Fabius
said in French: ''There were two slogans, 'Death to capitalism'
which is a large subject all by itself and 'Down with Red Meat.' Of
course, there is no connection in my mind between the two.''

<HEADLINE> RV Owners Avoid Home-State Taxes  </HEADLINE>
By TOM LACEKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Montana, with its starkly beautiful
landscape, may be the perfect place to buy and drive a recreational
vehicle -- even just on paper.
</P>
<P>
   The state has become a nationwide haven for some RV owners
trying to avoid thousands of dollars in taxes and fees, sometimes
with the encouragement of dealers and lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Montana has no sales tax on RV purchases, and charges relatively
low registration fees for often expensive motor homes. Residency is
required to register, but some lawyers are happy to set up dummy
Montana corporations as ''owners,'' meeting the legal requirement.
</P>
<P>
   But some may be setting themselves up for big trouble back home.
While the process is perfectly legal in Montana, for both dealers
and buyers, it generally is not legal in the buyer's home state.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ads on the Internet and in national RV magazines are
luring RV registrations from New York to California regardless of
whether the rigs have ever left a tire track in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there's probably 500 to 600 a year,'' said Dean
Roberts, head of Montana's Division of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Each dummy corporation means thousands of dollars in tax losses
to the true home state of the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts cited the example of a Texas man who bought a motor home
for $511,975 in Oklahoma, then registered it to his newly created
Montana limited liability corporation (LLC) for $7,679. The owner
saved $24,471, but the loss to Texas on the registration fee and
tax totaled $32,150.
</P>
<P>
   Some states are getting downright testy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I catch you in California, you're going to hurt,'' warned
Garand Gruber, chief of investigations for California's Department
of Motor Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The registrations are no problem to Montana, and even generate a
little revenue for the state. Missoula attorneys John Bennett and
Jared Heggen advertise Montana's low licensing fees in two national
RV magazines. Records show that, in January and February, the two
lawyers filed 193 LLCs for out-of-state clients.
</P>
<P>
   Both say they check their clients' home-state statutes and
advise them to consult a lawyer or tax specialist about registering
in that state as well, but they have no way of knowing if the
clients do so.
</P>
<P>
   Some don't qualify, Heggen said. He recently turned away a
California man who said he takes his RV out of California only a
couple of times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just said, 'That's not going to work for you. The vehicle
cannot be used primarily in California.'''

<HEADLINE> '60s Protester Compares Eras  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A veteran of the civil rights movement watched
this weekend's protests against the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund with a measure of contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a demonstration,'' said Vladimr Budney, who was a
one-man counter-demonstration Sunday. ''This is a rock concert held
at the expense of the local population.''
</P>
<P>
   Budney, who had a long, white beard and gave his age as ''over
50,'' carried a sign that said ''Stop A16 Anarchy,'' which someone
tried to burn. A16 is the name of the umbrella effort to close down
Sunday's IMF meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm asking them to go back to Berkeley and Seattle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lecturing a protester outside a police barricade near George
Washington University, Budney said, ''A political demonstration is
when you get a bunch of people together, and you influence a member
of Congress, and you get a bill introduced.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's liberalism!'' objected the protester, Richard Degen,
36.
</P>
<P>
   Budney, who protested against Spanish fascism and for civil
rights in the '60s, said he agrees with the goals of the
protesters. But he said their tactics are dated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The revolution is over,'' he said. ''(Former Soviet leader)
Mikhail Gorbachev abandoned it.''
</P>
<P>
   Budney said he joined the A16 effort in January but was booted
out two months later for calling for negotiations with the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   He called the effort a rock concert because ''it has a bunch of
kids like this walking around, having fun with each other,
shouting, screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Frost, a 26-year-old medical student at Case Western
University, disagreed, saying many people felt deeply about the
issues. ''Oh, give us a little more credit,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Guatamala Students Hold Tradition  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- In some parts of the world people paint
Easter eggs. In Guatemala, thousands of hooded students mark the
coming of Easter by stripping down suspected criminals and beating
them publicly.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lavish public processions traditional in the Holy
Week leading up to Easter in this devout Roman Catholic nation is
Huelga de Dolores, a parade organized by students at the University
of San Carlos.
</P>
<P>
   In a tradition as old as the 103-year-old parade itself, about
15,000 mostly male students hit the streets in red and black
executioner's hoods, asking for spare change to help finance their
procession.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the march took a bloody turn, with students cornering
hundreds of men they claimed were guilty of crimes, stripping them
to their underwear and parading them through crowded streets to the
delight of onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   The beatings started even before Holy Week this year. Mobs of
students have been seen parading men through the streets. Countless
other incidents, where time hasn't permitted such extravagant
displays, have ended with students simply pummeling suspected
criminals bloody.
</P>
<P>
   Though police insist they are not looking the other way, not one
of the vigilante incidents in Guatemala City has ever been
prosecuted. Many people are happy to see the attacks beginning
anew.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people are getting what they deserve,'' said Margarita
Pinto, a hot dog and steak vendor who sets up her stand outside the
bustling Central Market in downtown Guatemala City. She said she
witnessed five vigilante beatings last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They steal your purse, they rob you -- then they get beaten
until they bleed,'' she said excitedly.
</P>
<P>
   Vigilante acts are nothing unusual in Guatemala. Last year
alone, the United Nations documented 108 lynching attempts in
Guatemala, 40 of which ended in the deaths of suspected criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of lynchings and other vigilante acts
take place in rural areas where the inhabitants of tiny villages --
which often do not have police stations -- rid their communities of
outsiders thought to be involved in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this year appears to be quieter, with less than 20
lynching attempts and no deaths reported so far.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent student procession in the capital, one
participant collected money in a red hood on a downtown bus. He
said he and other students beat up a man they saw snatch a woman's
necklace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The community is frustrated. So are we,'' he said, giving only
his first name, Jorge, for fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Students began to administer public beatings for the first time
several years ago when they discovered non-students in similar
masks panhandling under the guise of the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the violence spread to include other suspected
criminals, said Carlos Perez Brito, a spokesman for the university,
whose campus of 100,000 students sprawls on the southern outskirts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a terrible tragedy as far as the university is
concerned,'' Brito said. ''It creates a bad image in the court of
public opinion, not just for the university but for the wonderful
tradition of the Huelga.''
</P>
<P>
   The university, where students pay a token fee of just 40
quetzales ($5) a semester, maintains that its hands are tied by a
desire not to interfere with the Huelga parade and its traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us are asking, how is it possible that the police
can't capture these criminals but our students can,'' Brito said.
''But we need to make our students understand that a couple of acts
of violence aren't going to solve problems with crime or make the
frustration here disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerson Lopez, a spokesman for Guatemala's National Civil Police,
said the authorities face the same problems as the university in
trying to stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult for the police to intervene because you have
thousands of students participating in a tradition of collecting
money that has been going on for hundreds of years. We don't want
to take that away from them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the only ones documenting the violence are the
photographers for Guatemala City's tabloid newspapers, who camp
downtown for hours on ''beating watch,'' waiting for the graphic
shots of hooded students attacking half-stripped suspects.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets plummeted Monday, reacting to the record
losses on Wall Street last week that left many investors wondering if its bull
market was over. In the world's second largest economy, Japan's benchmark Nikkei
Stock Average fell a staggering 1,793.62 points, or 8.8 percent, to 18,641.06.
Dropping far below the key 20,000-point mark, the Nikkei stood at its lowest
level since Jan. 12, with high-technology stocks being hit the hardest. By the
end of the morning session, the Nikkei had recovered slightly, rising to
18,683.89 points.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demonstrators set out to snarl workaday Washington Sunday
with protests aimed at world finance conferences that went on despite them over

confrontations with police, the federal government closed its agencies in the
potential protest zone, an 11 by 8 block swath east and west of the White House.
Both the federal and local governments encouraged all but essential workers to

Taiwan Has Eye on Aegis Destroyers

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When U.S. and Taiwanese officials gather behind closed
doors Monday to discuss which weapons the United States is willing to sell, the
$4.4 billion question will be whether Taiwan gets the go-ahead to buy the Aegis
destroyers it says it needs to counter a buildup of Chinese missiles. The talks
Monday and Tuesday in Washington are especially sensitive because of their
profound political implications. China has said it would be compelled to react
harshly if Taiwan acquires Aegis warships. Taiwan views its request as a test of
U.S. support in the face of China's continuing buildup of offensive missiles.

interaction of organisms with their physical environment -- must be reversed or
there ''could be devastating implications'' for human development, the study
said. The study was sponsored by the U.N. Development Programme, the U.N.

<HEADLINE> EPA To Propose Tap Water Rules  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- To reduce health risks, the Environmental
Protection Agency is proposing tougher requirements for tap water
in communities whose public water supply comes from wells,
according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Under the EPA regulation being proposed today, water supply
authorities in thousands of communities would have to increase
monitoring for bacterial contamination and use disinfectants if
there are health risks, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations, which are expected to be final later this
year, could apply to as many as 157,000 water systems in the
country -- mostly smaller systems that rely on underground aquifers.
The rules do not apply to private wells that serve single
households.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is another significant step ... to ensure that Americans
enjoy the safest drinking water possible,'' said Vice President Al
Gore, who was expected to announce the new initiative. ''The new
proposal will bring us even closer to the day when every community
in America has clean, safe drinking water.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA estimates the additional monitoring and water quality
controls will affect 109 million people and prevent 115,000
illnesses from bacteria and parasites including E.coli and
cryptosporidium. The agency estimates in most cases the additional
safeguards will add $5 a year to an average household water bill.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Americans receive tap water that meets
federal health standards. But there has been growing concern in
recent years about illnesses -- and even deaths among the elderly
and people with low immune systems -- from drinking water that
contains viruses and bacteria such as E.coli and cryptosporidium.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA already has stepped up efforts at detecting and
preventing such contamination in drinking water from surface
sources such as lakes and rivers, but has not previously pursued
similar efforts in systems that rely on underground sources.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, President Clinton announced new drinking water
standards affecting about 140 million people that are served by
large water systems that get their supplies from surface sources.
Last month, the EPA began work on similar standards for small water
systems that rely on surface water.

<HEADLINE> America's Library Reaches 200  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As an idea goes, this one was small caliber,
just one of many administrative details that Congress had before it
in the spring of 1800 as it prepared to move to a new capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The seed of the idea that would become the Library of Congress
lay in the fact that while there were sufficient libraries in
Philadelphia, where the U.S. government had resided for a decade,
there were none in Washington, where the government would soon be.
</P>
<P>
   That the library would grow into a pre-eminent world institution
was beyond imagination.
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, 1800, President John Adams approved an
appropriation of $5,000 to purchase ''such books as may be
necessary for the use of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Books, mostly on history, economics and law, were ordered from
London. They arrived in 1801 and were shelved in the new U.S.
Capitol. The collection consisted of just 740 volumes and three
maps.
</P>
<P>
   Next Monday, millions of books and much history later, the
Library of Congress celebrates its 200th anniversary as an
institution that grew, in the words of one of its biographers, into
''a symbol of American democracy and faith in the power of
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration includes a major exhibition, ''Thomas
Jefferson,'' featuring the first-ever reassembly of Jefferson's
1815 library in one place, arranged by the system he devised. A
commemorative stamp and two coins will be issued. A new Web site
for families, ''America's Library,'' will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   When it still amounted to little more than a few books on a few
shelves the library had the good fortune to capture the interest of
the one American with perhaps more interest in books than any
other.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot live without books ...,'' Thomas Jefferson wrote in
1815.
</P>
<P>
   As president in 1802, Jefferson approved the first law setting
out the role and functions of the new library. While the law gave
Congress the authority to set the library's budget, it awarded the
appointment of the Librarian of Congress to the president. That
gave the new institution a government-wide reach.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1814, an invading British army intervened. It seized
Washington and burned the White House and the Capitol. The Library
of Congress, which by then had about 3,000 volumes, was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   With one act, Jefferson became the founder of the Library of
Congress as it now exists.
</P>
<P>
   ''I learn from the newspapers that the vandalism of our enemy
has triumphed at Washington over science as well as the arts, by
the destruction of the public library with the noble edifice in
which it was deposited,'' Jefferson wrote in a letter that
September.
</P>
<P>
   By then retired to his home at Monticello, Jefferson offered
Congress the opportunity to buy his private library which then
totaled nearly 6,500 volumes. The purchase was approved. The price
was almost $24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson called it the ''choicest collection of books in the
U.S.'' He voiced hope it would have a permanent influence ''on the
literature of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring Jefferson's books was a step in that direction. It
offered the Library of Congress the chance of establishing a
comprehensive, universal collection.
</P>
<P>
   When delivered in a caravan of horse-pulled wagons, Jefferson's
library expanded the breadth of the collection dramatically. It
added books on architecture, the arts, science, literature and
geography.
</P>
<P>
   ''He believed that the American legislature needed ideas and
information on all subjects and in many languages in order to
govern a democracy,'' writes library historian John Y. Cole in
''Jefferson's Legacy, A Brief History of the Library of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating the argument that his collection might be too
comprehensive, Jefferson argued that there was ''no subject to
which a member of Congress may not have occasion to refer.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting editorially on July 15, 1815, ''The National
Intelligencer,'' Washington's first newspaper, said: ''In all
civilized nations of Europe there are national libraries ... In a
country of such general intelligence as this, the congressional or
national Library of the United States (should) become the great
repository of the literature of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   At Monticello, his hilltop home in Virginia, Jefferson quickly
began to restock his own empty shelves, telling John Adams that now
he was retired from public life he was reading more for amusement
and pleasure than for practical use.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he died in 1826, he had more than 1,000 volumes.
</P>
<P>
   The institution he rescued also never stopped collecting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jefferson gave us the rationale for today's library,'' says
Cole who is also director of the Library's Center for the Book.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today the library is a world library,'' he said. ''We serve
the world and we collect the world.''

mates, and by meeting with Republican homosexuals, the Texas
governor and presumed GOP presidential nominee is telling the party
not to stand on the principle that family is all-important,
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's raising the white flag and stacking arms (surrendering)
in the cultural war for the soul of this country,'' Buchanan said
on ''Fox News Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan bolted the party in October after a series of opinion
polls had him trailing badly for the 2000 GOP presidential
nomination. He told supporters then that, like the Democrats, the
Republicans had stopped fighting ''with conviction and courage to
rescue God's country from the cultural and moral pit into which she
has fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the leading contender for the Reform Party nomination,
Buchanan said Bush's apparent list of possible running mates gives
Republicans reason for dismay because it includes Govs. Tom Ridge
of Pennsylvania and Christie Whitman of New Jersey. Neither
supports banning abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''What he's saying basically is, 'I'm pro-life,' and Governor
Ridge is pro-choice, and Christie Todd Whitman is pro-partial-birth
abortion, but that's really not a matter that really should divide
us as a party,''' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   On Bush's meeting last week with a dozen gay Republicans,
Buchanan said: ''He's sending a signal that this really is not a
matter that we ought to let trouble us. But you know, what he's
doing is he's walking away from the pro-family Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Look, Republicans believe -- or used to believe -- the idea of
preserving the family is critical, and any assault upon the family
was really one of the reasons why this country is in such profound
trouble,'' he said. ''Mr. Bush is saying that this point of view
(homosexuality) is thoroughly acceptable.''

<HEADLINE> FAA To Recommend Boeing 737 Changes  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Changes in the design of the rudder of the
Boeing 737, the most widely used passenger jet in the world, are
being recommended by a special engineering panel convened by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member Federal Aviation Administration board is also
preparing recommendations calling for improved crew training in
dealing with rudder problems and increased rudder inspections, top
FAA officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But while the changes are included in preliminary
recommendations scheduled to be made final in June, FAA assistant
administrator Thomas McSweeny stressed that the board considers the
chance of problems with the 737 rudder so small that it is not
calling for any immediate corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   The 737 rudder system, which controls left-right movement of the
plane, came under close suspicion after the crash of USAir flight
427 near Pittsburgh, Pa., in 1994 that killed all 132 people
aboard. A similar disaster had occurred in 1991, when United flight
585 crashed in Colorado Springs, Colo., killing 25.
</P>
<P>
   After those accidents, the FAA issued airworthiness directives
requiring changes in the rudder controls of 737s, and those changes
have been made, said Elizabeth Erickson, the FAA's director of
aircraft certification.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the FAA formed the panel of aviation experts who
were not involved previously with the 737 design and asked them to
study the rudder design and report on possible ways it could fail,
Erickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The important finding is that ''we have not found any safety
issues requiring immediate action,'' said McSweeny, who is in
charge of aircraft regulation and certification.
</P>
<P>
   He said the group did uncover ways that a jam in control
linkages could cause the rudder to jam to one side in a
''hardover'' -- a sudden jerk of the rudder that can steal control
from the pilot.
</P>
<P>
   And they found that spraying water onto the controls inside the
tail in extreme cold could cause ice to form and cause problems, he
said. But, McSweeny said, it is not clear if that could happen in
flight conditions, so more tests are being done.
</P>
<P>
   He said the committee recommendations will be final in June, and
engineers then will consider how to correct problem areas they
found. In the meantime, he said, Boeing is also looking into
possible rudder design changes.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's preliminary recommendations, he said, are:
</P>
<P>
   --''In the long term, they do believe that the failures that can
result in hardovers need to be addressed by design changes.''
</P>
<P>
   --''In the short term, they believe operations and maintenance
procedures should be enhanced.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the second recommendation means changing inspections to
detect latent rudder problems and finding ways for air crews to
respond to rudder problems better if they occur.
</P>
<P>
   He would not speculate on what changes might be made in crew
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson stressed that the 737 ''maintains an excellent safety
record. It has half the accident rate of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more than 3,600 737s in service takes off every five
to seven seconds somewhere in the world, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials added that they are cooperating with the FAA
and have supplied a plane for testing.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Jim Hall issued a
statement Sunday saying he was pleased that the engineering board,
which was formed last year in response to safety board
recommendations following its investigation of the crash of USAir
flight 427, is nearing completion of its assignments.
</P>
<P>
   ''The safety board has been monitoring the progress of the
board,'' Hall said. ''We look forward to publication of its full
report.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Sides With Striking Janitors  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore, looking to protect his lead in
vote-rich California, spent just two hours campaigning here, but
his appearances were surgically tailored to bolster support from
key voter blocs, including Hispanics, Roman Catholics and labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   After spending most of Sunday in his hotel room, the vice
president ventured out at about 1:30 p.m., declaring his solidarity
with striking janitors at a rally, then meeting with the
influential Cardinal Roger Mahony. By 3:30 p.m. he was flying home
to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The events marked the end of a weekend California swing that was
low-key but often high-profile. Gore made two quick appearances in
Los Angeles Saturday morning, then went into private meetings for
more than five hours.
</P>
<P>
   That evening he re-emerged for the political event of the
season, a fund-raiser in Beverly Hills with President Clinton and a
small army of Hollywood stars that raised $2.8 million for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he landed in San Jose on Friday until the time he
left Los Angeles, Gore helped raise more than $5 million for his
campaign and for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, however, the focus was on the working class.
</P>
<P>
   ''The position of president is the only one filled by someone
who has the responsibility to fight for all of the people, not just
the wealthy and the powerful, the connected, the influential, but
all of the people, including the janitors!'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your cause is just, and you are gaining the ears and hearts of
the people in the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee spoke in English
and in Spanish from atop a flatbed truck at a rally of more than
1,000 people, nearly all of them Hispanics, and received a
boisterous show of support.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd thundered a warm greeting in Spanish as Gore took the
makeshift stage.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,500 janitors have been striking across the Los Angeles
area since April 3. They generally earn between $6.80 and $7.90,
and are seeking wage increases of $1 a year for each of the next
three years. Contractors have offered more modest raises, and talks
broke down again on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the striking janitors are Hispanic -- a group that makes
up 15 percent of the electorate in California, and one that
presumptive Republican nominee George W. Bush is aggressively
pursuing.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest California Field Poll on the presidential race,
Gore led Bush, 51 percent to 41 percent in late February. The
Republicans say it is now a bit closer.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, a Southern Baptist, chose Palm Sunday for his first
meeting with Mahony, the archbishop of the Los Angeles Diocese.
Mahony has spoken out in support of the striking janitors.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, his wife, Tipper, and high-ranking Gore campaign officials
discussed a variety of topics with Mahony, lingering on the issue
of schools, said campaign chairman Tony Coelho. The meeting was
closed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of Californians, and an overwhelming number of
Hispanics, are Roman Catholic. And Gore is counting on labor
support for donations and to get out the vote on Election Day.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Lashes Out at Miami Kin  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- After a weekend of bitter accusations lobbed by
both sides of the Elian Gonzalez custody battle, attention returned
today to the federal judges deciding a key point in the
international case.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta has been asked
by the U.S. government to suspend a ruling by one of its judges
that prevents the removal of Elian from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Such a decision would allow the U.S. government to push for the
6-year-old boy's swift reunion in Washington with his waiting
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who wants to return to Cuba. He has
said he will wait out appeals by the Miami relatives seeking an
asylum hearing for Elian before the same court -- but only if he has
custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   There was growing apprehension outside the Little Havana home
where the boy has lived with his great-uncle for nearly five
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feeling is the Clinton administration might send federal
agents to pull him out of here,'' said Sergio Navarro, a
39-year-old Miami businessman who spent part of Sunday night with
chanting protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives have cared for him since November, when he was
found clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits. His mother
and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has pushed for the boy's return to
his father, ruling only he can speak for his son on immigration
matters. The boy's Miami relatives say he will have a better life
here and have attempted to portray Juan Miguel Gonzalez as a pawn
of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department wants the appeals court to suspend the
temporary injunction issued Thursday and also order Elian's
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to release the boy. The relatives
want the court to let them meet with Elian's father without being
required to surrender the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The court watch comes after one of the most bitter charges yet
in the custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez lashed out at his Miami relatives Sunday
night, accusing them of ''child abuse'' for turning his son against
him. He said they have manipulated his son to believe that his
mother still may show up someday -- in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is child abuse and mistreatment, what they're doing to
this boy,'' Gonzalez said on CBS's ''60 Minutes.'' ''The way
they're abusing him, turning him against his father ... he's
suffering more here amongst them than he suffered in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he didn't believe a much-publicized video taped at
the relatives' home in which his son said he didn't want to go. He
has spoken with Elian at least three times since he arrived in the
United States on April 6, and he insisted his son wants to return
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's told me so,'' Gonzalez said. The Miami relatives are
''putting a bunch of toys in front of a 6-year-old. He cannot
decide for himself. The one that decides for him is me, his
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian's Miami relatives have filed affidavits alleging Gonzalez
abused his former wife and his 6-year-old son, a charge Gonzalez
denied. During the time of the broadcast on Sunday, family members
and Elian were outside the home of Lazaro Gonzalez and did not
publicly comment after the show.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, however, dismissed Juan Miguel's comments as either
selfish or the words of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fidel Castro is claiming the son, not him,'' said Olga Coto,
56, of Miami. ''He's being manipulated totally by Fidel Castro.
He's not telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Many worried their efforts to keep the boy in Miami would fail
today, the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, an aborted
invasion of Cuba by CIA-trained exiles that left much bitterness
among the Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were betrayed by the government, by (President) Kennedy,
and if they turned the child back over, it will be a second
betrayal,'' said Josefa Gonzalez, who left Cuba in 1962 when she
was 4.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, protesters prayed for divine help as Easter week
began, waving palm fronds and posters of the Cuban boy and Jesus.
Priests joined the crowd to offer a religious service.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many people who tell us that we should give up this
fight,'' said Martin Anorga, an evangelical pastor. ''But we will
follow in the path that the Lord has shown us, despite those who
want to get in our way.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors Examine Suharto  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Four cars and an ambulance pulled up
outside the home of former dictator Suharto in yet another effort
to pursue a landmark investigation into high-level corruption
during his 32-year rule.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors waited patiently in the heavily guarded street
while government-appointed physicians examined the ailing and
reclusive 78-year-old inside.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers want to question Suharto over allegations that he
siphoned off billions of dollars for himself, his family and
cronies while head of the world's fourth most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the medical team emerged to say no: The old man's blood
pressure was too high for interrogation. Come back another day.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto has denied any wrongdoing but for months has kept
prosecutors at bay by refusing to give evidence. With the stalling
tactics of his highly paid lawyers beginning to wear thin, however,
claims of failing health appear to be his last line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   He has suffered two strokes in recent years and claims to be too
sick to face interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   But Indonesia's new reformist government is under pressure from
international lenders and investors to clean up the endemic
corruption that was the hallmark of Suharto's rule and a trigger of
the nation's deepest economic crisis in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Students and activists, whose bloody protests pushed Suharto out
of office two years ago, also demand that he be prosecuted as the
first step toward real democratic change.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Marzuki Darusman, a human rights campaigner who
struggled under Suharto's authoritarian rule, slapped a travel ban
on the old leader Wednesday amid rumors he was about to skip the
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid, a moderate Muslim cleric elected
last June, has threatened to put Suharto under house arrest if he
doesn't answer prosecutors' questions soon. That's a tactic Suharto
used himself on another former president, Sukarno, the founding
father of independent Indonesia who died in isolation in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the government's tough talk, many Indonesians think it
unlikely Suharto will have a day in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to imagine that Suharto will ever be put on trial,''
said Benny Subianto, a political analyst. ''I think he is really
sick, and if he doesn't get healthier then he won't be
questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past two weeks, doctors have twice prevented
prosecutors from quizzing Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Juan Felix Tampubolon suggested last Monday that
his client's condition was likely to deteriorate. He has lost the
ability to speak properly and regularly wears an oxygen mask, the
lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is getting worse every day,'' Tampubolon said.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's six super-rich children, some of whom are also being
investigated for graft, scoff at skeptics who question whether
their father is feigning ill health to evade justice.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has pledged not to let Suharto off the
hook. ''We will call him again and again until he is stated to be
fit to face questioning,'' Darusman said.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the screws a little tighter, officials at Darusman's
office said they plan to interrogate Suharto's eldest daughter and
his second son on Tuesday about their father's affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Chairul Imam, who heads the investigation into the corruption
scandal, said today that prosecutors may freeze Suharto's bank
accounts and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have so far had limited success in nailing down
Suharto-era corruption. They forced but lost a graft case against
Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Last month they arrested a former Cabinet minister and one of
Suharto's closest friends, Mohammad ''Bob'' Hasan, over an alleged
scam in Indonesia's lucrative lumber industry. He made a fortune
cutting down swaths of rare rain forest and jungle over many years.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan's arrest has been the hardest blow dealt to the old
regime, but it does not pose any direct threat to Suharto himself.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-president spends most of his time at his home in central
Jakarta, but occasionally is seen in public.
</P>
<P>
   Last month he attended his granddaughter's wedding, where he
looked relatively fit and chatted with guests, an appearance that
fueled suspicions he is healthy enough to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   However, even if he does go before a court, it might be only a
symbolic gesture.
</P>
<P>
   While Wahid has ordered that Suharto's prosecution go ahead, the
president has also promised to pardon him as long as he returns any
ill-gotten gains. This has enraged student activists, who accuse
Suharto of decades of human rights abuses and who have resumed a
campaign of noisy and sometimes violent protests a few blocks from
Suharto's home.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe President Backs Takeovers  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Fearing for their safety, about 80 white
farmers and their families were refusing to return to their fields
today after black squatters killed a white farmer over the weekend
and badly beat five others.
</P>
<P>
   With violence occurring throughout the Macheke district, 75
miles east of Harare, farmers said Sunday they would stay out of
the area until police and military officials could guarantee
security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence, President Robert Mugabe, returning from an
economic summit in Cuba, reaffirmed his support Sunday for the
forced occupations of more than 900 white-owned farms, reputedly
led by veterans of Zimbabwe's independence war that ended 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe says the occupations were a justified protest against the
unequal distribution of land in a country where 4,000 white farmers
own one-third of the productive farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ''We warned the white farmers: We cannot protect you if you
provoke the war veterans. You must accept the consequences,''
Mugabe said. ''There is an expectation I will say to the war
veterans they must get off the land. I will not do that until we
start redistributing the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's comments contradicted his government's appeal Thursday
for the squatters to abandon the plots peacefully. The appeal
followed a High Court ruling that police must evict the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they lack the resources and manpower to carry out the
High Court's order and have appealed the ruling to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say Mugabe has orchestrated the takeovers as a ploy to
gain support in national elections, expected to be held in May.
</P>
<P>
   Two officials of the main opposition party, the Movement for
Democratic Change, were killed in a firebomb attack Saturday in
Buhera, 150 miles south of Harare, party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents hurled a blazing bottle of gasoline into a car being
driven by Tichaona Chimenya, party leader Morgan Tsvangirai's
official driver, said Nomore Sibanda, Tsvangirai's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The attack killed Chimenya and the car's other occupant, whose
name was not released.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe said Tsvangirai, who is visiting Britain to raise money
and support for his party, ''is running around like a real
traitor.'' The president told his supporters to defend themselves
against violence he said was perpetrated by the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't kill, but hit back wildly,'' Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
   The farm violence Saturday marked a sharp escalation in a crisis
that has convulsed this former British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Armed squatters in Macheke abducted David Stevens from his farm.
Five other white farmers who came to his aid were shot at and took
refuge in the police station in Murewa, a nearby provincial center.
</P>
<P>
   But the squatters walked into the station and abducted the
farmers as the police watched, according to three of the kidnapped
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The squatters shot and killed Stevens and beat the other farmers
throughout the night with iron bars, rocks and fan belts, before
releasing them, the injured farmers said from a hospital in
Marondera, 40 miles east of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was the first farmer killed since the farm takeovers
began in February.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer John Osborne said the attackers never mentioned the farms
during the beatings, but instead harangued the men for not
supporting Mugabe's ruling party, which faces a strong opposition
challenge in a parliamentary election. In the past, some squatters
have admitted being paid by ruling party activists.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about land. It's about politics,'' Osborne said.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Foreign Office Minister Peter Hain told Zimbabwe's
ambassador, High Commissioner Simbarashe Mumbengegwi, that Mugabe's
government must work ''to prevent further lawlessness and
violence.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Fall Sharply  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS WAGNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Rattled by last week's record losses on Wall
Street, Asia's top three stock markets fell sharply today, leaving
some investors worried that the bubble might have finally burst on
New York's exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, the main indexes in Tokyo, Singapore and Hong Kong
were all down more than 7 percent -- declines in range with Friday's
5.7 percent drop of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and 9.7
percent tumble on the Nasdaq Composite Index.
</P>
<P>
   In the world's second largest economy, Japan's benchmark Nikkei
225 Stock Average opened 8.8 percent lower to 18,641.06. Dropping
far below the key 20,000-point mark, the Nikkei stood at its lowest
level since Jan. 12, with technology stocks hit the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon, the Nikkei had recovered slightly to 18,875.02
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going straight down in line with the movement in New
York,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, a general manager at Chuo Securities
in Tokyo. ''I expected the market to fall, but I didn't think it
would fall quite this much.''
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the losses ''were in line
with expectations'' and signs of Japan's economic recovery remain
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not too concerned,'' Miyazawa said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors clearly were. They gathered on sidewalks in central
Tokyo outside Shinko Securities to watch the stock prices flash on
the large electronic board overhead. Some worried that if U.S.
markets collapse it could be a real setback for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am scared. I am afraid this could happen all over the
world,'' said Yukio Nagano, 71, who retired last year. ''Japan's
economy is surviving only because of public spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said Wall Street's correction was long overdue and that
Japan's markets would probably quickly recover.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong and Singapore, the situation also was grim.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was off 8.5 percent to
14,771.28 by midday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Bombing Victims Wince  </HEADLINE>
By TIM TALLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Marsha Kight wants the pain to stop. But
the prospect of a state trial for convicted Oklahoma City bombing
conspirator Terry Nichols only reminds her that it will never go
away.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like it never ends,'' said Kight, whose daughter,
Frankie Merrell, was killed in the April 19, 1995, attack. ''The
trial will open up a lot of wounds and cost a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols was already convicted and sentenced to life in prison on
federal bombing charges in a trial in Denver. In January, he was
brought to Oklahoma to face 160 state counts of first-degree
murder. Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy is seeking the
death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims' advocates say putting Nichols on trial for his
life could just dredge up old emotions and overshadow the opening
of a memorial to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will still be dealing with the legal process for Terry
Nichols, appeals and all of that, at the 10th anniversary,'' said
Bud Welch, whose daughter, Julie, was among the 168 people killed
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Nichols will be in a jail cell a few blocks from
where President Clinton will help dedicate a $24.1 million memorial
to victims and survivors of the blast -- the worst act of terrorism
on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a state bombing trial that could cost millions of
dollars and force survivors to relive the event has drawn
opposition from some of those most affected by the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a society, I really find it hard to believe that we're not
satisfied with life in prison,'' said Jim Denny, whose young son
and daughter were severely injured in the bombing. He said Nichols
is being forced to face trial in Oklahoma ''just to stick a needle
in his arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols, 45, was convicted in federal court of eight counts of
involuntary manslaughter for the deaths of eight federal law
enforcement officers. He also was found guilty of one count of
conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In Oklahoma, Nichols is accused of the deaths of bombing victims
who were not part of his federal trial. A preliminary hearing was
scheduled for Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols also faces one count of first-degree manslaughter for
the death of an unborn child whose mother was killed, one count of
conspiracy to commit murder and one count of aiding and counseling
in the placing of a substance or bomb near a public building.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols' co-defendant, Timothy McVeigh, was convicted on federal
murder charges and sentenced to death. State charges have not been
filed against McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
   Each of their federal convictions are on appeal, and both
bombing conspirators are seeking new federal trials. It is the
possibility that Nichols' federal conviction could be overturned
that most worries those who want him tried on state bombing
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could conceivably walk out of a federal prison, get on a
plane and fly away,'' said Paul Heath, who was injured in the
bombing and serves as vice president of the Oklahoma City Murrah
Building Survivors Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand why any one of those family members whose loved
ones were taken away in those violent acts would want to see those
individuals prosecuted,'' Heath said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said any conviction on state charges will be
futile and cannot withstand the appellate process because of issues
already raised by Nichols' state defense attorneys, including his
constitutionally guaranteed right to a presumption of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not attorneys, but we know that one of the most
important parts of our justice system is the presumption of
innocence. And Terry Nichols has no presumption of innocence,''
Denny said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols has alleged that he cannot receive a fair trial in
Oklahoma because of extensive publicity about the case and his
federal conviction.
</P>
<P>
   He has also alleged that it is unconstitutional to try him again
in Oklahoma because it would violate his constitutional guarantee
against being tried twice for the same crime.	   Welch said any state conviction
will likely be tossed out on
federal appeal because a fair and impartial jury can't be found to
try Nichols in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   But Heath said the search for justice requires that Nichols be
tried by a jury of Oklahomans.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'm the only citizen in Oklahoma County at either a hearing
or a trial, it's because I feel it's my civic responsibility to
keep my promise to those that we would never forget,'' Heath said.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Stampede at Portugal Club  </HEADLINE>
By CRISTIANA PEREIRA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- As gas billowed across the darkened
dance floor, Joaquim Dias felt his eyes watering and his throat
burning. He dipped his sweater in his drink and covered his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The gas had come from two canisters thought to have contained
pepper gas set off inside a crowded nightclub early Sunday just as
the lights were cut. Seven people died in the panicked stampede.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were running everywhere,'' said Dias, 25. ''The dance
floor suddenly emptied. There were people on the floor, others were
being carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy results on the seven bodies were expected today or
Tuesday, but it appeared they were crushed, according to state
television RTP. Sixty people were treated for breathing
difficulties and minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said at least 500 people, mostly Africans, were inside
the Luanda club, which is named after the capital of the African
nation of Angola.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for what appeared to be a planned
attack.
</P>
<P>
   An employee at the club who asked that his name not be used told
The Associated Press the canisters were set off inside the club,
not thrown in from outside.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not specify what sort of gas was used, but
police sources speaking on condition of anonymity said it appeared
to be pepper gas. Authorities thought the power was deliberately
cut.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were a 20-year-old Spanish woman, Ester Ramos Lopez of
Madrid, and six Angolans between 20 and 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbon city councilor Vasco Franco said the club abided by all
legal safety measures and was inspected three months ago. Carmo
Paiva, a witness, said the club had four emergency exits but
everyone bolted for the narrow front entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some fell and were trampled on by the others,'' Paiva said.
</P>
<P>
   The nightclub is on a cobblestone street in the busy riverside
area of Alcantara, where dozens of clubs are located. Police have
searched the building and studied security camera tape. They said
they have identified a number of suspects, but no arrests have been
made.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbon has a large African population, mostly immigrants from
the country's five former African colonies, including Angola;
however, racist attacks are infrequent.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, 13 people were killed when hooded gunmen burst
into a discotheque in the northern Portuguese town of Amarante and
set it on fire. Four men were convicted in the attack, which was
prompted by rivalry with another club in the rural town.

<HEADLINE> Report: State Dep't. Laptop Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal law enforcers are investigating
whether a laptop computer loaded with highly secret information and
missing from the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence was
stolen, The Washington Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Officials not identified by the newspaper said the laptop
disappeared from a supposedly secure conference room more than a
week ago. The FBI has launched an intensive search for the computer
and agents are questioning construction workers who have been
renovating the area.
</P>
<P>
   A senior State Department official said it was unclear if the
computer was mislaid or stolen. If it was stolen, the official
said, the thief may have made off with it for the hardware without
realizing the sensitivity of the data it contained.
</P>
<P>
   A person familiar with the incident told the Post the missing
laptop contains ''code word'' information -- which is higher than
top secret -- and it includes sensitive intelligence information and
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the missing laptop is the latest in a series of
serious security embarrassments at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after a Russian spy was found lurking outside the
building, investigators turned up an eavesdropping device planted
in a conference room.
</P>
<P>
   The year before that, a man simply walked into an executive
office and departed with a sheaf of classified material. That thief
hasn't been identified and the pilfered material was never
recovered.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Phones for Indians  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton, who played golf and
hobnobbed with the dot-com wealthy during a weekend in Silicon
Valley, is getting a look today at places and people who have been
left out of the digital revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was beginning his day in East Palo Alto, a hard-luck
neighborhood in the shadow of the high-tech giants and startups
that have made this part of California rich.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in East Palo Alto, Calif., have just one computer for
every 28 students, and more than 24 percent of elementary- and
middle-school students live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The president and high technology executives will announce new
grants and training programs to improve telecommunication services
in poor and minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton was headed to the Navajo Reservation in New
Mexico to announce a plan to speed computer access and improve
telecommunications for American Indians. The federal plan would
provide basic telephone service for $1 a month on reservations, the
White House said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   High tech companies will join Clinton's effort to spread the
benefits of computers and the Internet, announcing pledges of
money, training and equipment. The commitments will include $25
million from Qualcomm, $20 million in software from Novell and $15
million from Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway will offer technology literacy training for 75,000
teachers nationwide -- including all teachers in East Palo Alto. The
Waitt Family Foundation will promise 50,000 Gateway computers for
technology centers helping underprivileged children and America
Online will offer 100,000 Internet accounts. The pledges will be
announced today when Clinton speaks in East Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard,
scheduled to join the president to make the telephone service
announcement in Shiprock, N.M., said he expects the plan to benefit
300,000 Indian households.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is disgraceful that we have a telephone system that is the
envy of the world, but basic telecommunications services are not
widely enjoyed by our land's oldest people,'' Kennard said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the program, Kennard said he will propose adding $17
million to an existing program that underwrites phone service costs
for low-income people. That amounts to a 3.5 percent increase in
funding for the program. Long-distance phone companies, which pay
varied subsidies to states to assist low-income people, would
ultimately pay the additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   Poor American Indian households already qualify for a discount,
but Clinton administration officials said the cost is still too
high for many. Nearly one-third of all Indians live in poverty,
compared with 13 percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp. announced Sunday it is donating more
than $2.7 million in software and cash to help bridge the ''digital
divide'' and economic disparity between Indian tribes and wealthier
segments of society.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the gift, all but $200,000 it in software, will
be divided among eight tribal colleges, including Dine College in
Shiprock.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 percent of Navajo Reservation households have a phone
according to the 1990 census. Nationwide, the figure is an
estimated 56 percent for Indian reservation households but 94
percent for the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, spent Sunday with his daughter Chelsea and
some friends from Stanford University. On Saturday, Clinton played
golf with the chief executive of an Internet search engine firm and
a high-tech venture capitalist.

	   TOKYO (AP) -- Rattled by last week's record losses on Wall Street, Asia's
top three stock markets fell sharply Monday, leaving some investors worried that
the bubble might have finally burst on New York's exchanges. By midday, the main

declines in range with Friday's 5.7 percent drop of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average and 9.7 percent tumble on the Nasdaq Composite Index. Japan's benchmark

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When U.S. and Taiwanese officials gather behind closed

$4.4 billion question will be whether Taiwan gets the go-ahead to buy the Aegis
destroyers it says it needs to counter a buildup of Chinese missiles. The talks
Monday and Tuesday in Washington are especially sensitive because of their
profound political implications. China has said it would be compelled to react
harshly if Taiwan acquires Aegis warships. Taiwan views its request as a test of
U.S. support in the face of China's continuing buildup of offensive missiles.

will pay the price. The broad decline of the world's ecosystems -- the
interaction of organisms with their physical environment -- must be reversed or
there "could be devastating implications" for human development, the study said.
The study was sponsored by the U.N. Development Programme, the U.N.
Environmental Programme and the World Bank. It assessed the current health of
agriculture, coastal areas, forests, fresh water environments and grasslands.

<HEADLINE> World's largest dump to close -- but what then?  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A pair of sparrow hawks hovers overhead,
searching the wild rose bushes and crab apple trees for small prey.
Nearby a songbird remains hidden in a fledgling hackberry tree,
softly chirping a spring song.
</P>
<P>
   But now come ruder noises -- grrrrrrr, brummmmm, whirrrr,
vrooommmm and an insistent beep, beep, beep. The serene Wild
Kingdom moment vanishes as a garbage truck backs up and dumps yet
another load of rotting garbage onto an already behemoth mound.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world's largest garbage dump: the 3,000-acre
Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. It's three times the size of
Central Park and at its highest point, about as tall as a 20-story
building.
</P>
<P>
   But now -- though many remain skeptical -- the quadruple towering
mounds of trash may stop growing. A closing date of Dec. 31, 2001,
was set long ago for the dump, and some politicians say it could be
shut before summer of that year since plans for exporting the last
5,100 tons of daily city trash are ahead of schedule. Three of the
four once-active dumping sites have already been closed.
</P>
<P>
   City planners have formed a commission to determine Fresh Kills'
future and after 52 long and smelly years, local politicians are
conjuring up closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Once the last mound is covered, the question remains: Will the
memory of the dump, and its pervasive stench, ever fade?
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a thicket of wild rose bushes where Rutgers
University professor Steven Handel has worked since 1993, it isn't
hard to believe that something so ugly could be transformed from
trash to treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ''The potential for ecological restoration is enormous,'' says
Handel, who was hired by the city Sanitation Department and is
working with a grant from the National Science Foundation
introducing native plants to the landfill.
</P>
<P>
   On a small patch of land where Handel has planted 70 different
species, delicate white flowers are about to bloom on a small but
sturdy crab apple tree. Red-tail hawks, egrets and herons already
call the landfill home after migrating a short distance from a
nearby wildlife refuge, which is part of the island's protected
Greenbelt forest and wetlands area.
</P>
<P>
   Looking around, Handel doesn't see garbage. He sees hope.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got to look ahead and have vision,'' he said, pointing
to seed traps that prove birds are bringing native plants back to
the area, and to a fistful of sticks duct-taped to a fledgling tree
used to attract wild bees.
</P>
<P>
   If city planners get their way, one day in the distant future --
anywhere from 10 to 50 years -- the area will be filled with natural
forests, wildflower meadows, baseball and soccer fields, hiking and
jogging trails, and even a marina.
</P>
<P>
   There are disagreements over how real -- and inviting -- this
future will be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care what they put there. You won't find me there,''
said Staten Islander Madelyn Anastasakos, who is relieved the dump
is closing but can't imagine picnicking atop millions of tons of
trash.
</P>
<P>
   But Sanitation experts note that the future beauty of Fresh
Kills -- whose name comes from the Dutch word for water -- can
already be imagined from some 1,000 acres of the area that were
left alone.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are sections near the upper reaches of the Kill Van Kull
that have never even seen a garbage truck,'' said Brendan Sexton, a
former deputy mayor and sanitation commissioner who is on the
city's landfill closure commission.
</P>
<P>
   Handel agreed, referring to some areas as ''virtually
pristine,'' and noting the estuaries that run through the dump are
in good shape and birds are already there.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the ecological fabric is already present,'' he said.
''Our challenge is to maximize it.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a history in taking something so ugly and turning
it into something lovely and green, said Sexton, who knows the dump
intimately, both as a former sanitation commissioner and a Staten
Islander.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote about a ''stinking
mass of burning, rotting trash and the fires of hell he had to pass
on his way back to Long Island from the city.'' That spot is now
Flushing Meadows Park, the site of two World Fairs and the giant
metal Unisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grew up in Flushing Meadows, and no one in my neighborhood
ever thought of it as a dump,'' Sexton said, predicting that
memories of Fresh Kills as a dump also will fade.
</P>
<P>
   Other city parks, including Pelham Bay and Orchard Beach in the
Bronx, were landfills before their current incarnation. Centennial
Park in Liverpool, England, is another landfill conversion success.
</P>
<P>
   But for sheer size, Sexton said, ''There's never been a
reclamation project this large to my knowledge.'' He added, though,
that size could be an advantage: ''The opportunity to make
something grand is almost limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   An international design contest will be held, much like the one
used to find Central Park designers Frederick Law Olmsted and
Calvert Vaux in 1857. The competition, funded by the city and
state, is aimed at finding the best design for what many say is the
city's last great available green space.
</P>
<P>
   ''All suggestions should be considered,'' Sexton said. But he
added that the main thing city planners should realize is ''people
are desperate for open space in this town. ... People want to be
able to walk out their front door and have lunch on the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   The transformation will not occur overnight. Federal
environmental laws dictate that the landfill's most contaminated
parts cannot be used for 30 years. The design competition alone
should take nearly three years, with public hearings in all five
boroughs before several designs are submitted to the City Planning
Department for final approval.
</P>
<P>
   While that is happening, the city will begin the closure
process, which includes capping the last two mounds of trash and
installing pipes to reclaim and recycle methane gas produced by the
rotting trash.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the land can almost immediately be planted with native
oak trees, shrubs and fields of flowers, and Handel believes that
''within 10 years it will be seen as a really lovely part of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials say there will be immediate improvement for residents
living closest to the dump on the day it closes. There will be no
more trucks and barges coming so the noise level will drop and the
rotten egg smell should decrease dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ''The smell is worse of all,'' said Anastasakos, who has lived
on Staten Island for three years. ''It smacks you in the face the
minute you walk out the door.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said that should improve once more methane gas is drawn
out and fresh air is pumped in.
</P>
<P>
   It can't come soon enough for the nearly 400,000 Staten
Islanders who have complained since the dump opened in 1948.
Borough President Guy Molinari said his father, a state
assemblyman, fought against turning Fresh Kills into a dump because
he feared garbage eventually would cover all the vast, once vibrant
salt marshes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has never been an issue more important to Staten
Islanders,'' said Molinari. ''The joke here is that of the 10
biggest issues on Staten Island, numbers 1 through 9 are the
garbage dump.''
</P>
<P>
   As an assemblyman himself and later as a congressman, Molinari
watched in dismay as the city closed landfills in the other
boroughs: first Edgemere in Queens, then Pennsylvania Avenue and
Fountain Avenue in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   By 1987, Fresh Kills was the city's only dump, taking in an
astronomical 27,000 tons of trash a day at its peak. Recycling has
since reduced that figure to about 14,000 tons a day.
</P>
<P>
   Those opposed to the landfill began warning city officials in
1989 that a more comprehensive plan was needed to get rid of the
city's waste. They predicted that if dumping continued at the peak
rate, Fresh Kills' mounds would reach 412 feet by 2005, making it
the highest man-made point on the Eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the tallest mound is 190 feet, and one councilman
suggested (somewhat tongue-in-cheek) that the city could turn Fresh
Kills into a ski slope when it closed.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari finally sued the city under the Federal Clean Air in
1996 and city, and later that year the closing date at the end of
2001 was announced for Fresh Kills.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the city has exported the bulk of its trash to other
states including New Jersey, Virginia and Pennsylvania. A recent
City Council analysis said that closing Fresh Kills and exporting
its trash will cost the city $622 million over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari looks forward to hosting ''a heck of a party,'' the day
the dump closes. And he's convinced Fresh Kills will once again be
home to fish and birds.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be exquisite,'' he said confidently. ''Imagine, taking
something we are all ashamed of and making it something special.''

<HEADLINE> Newspaper Aimed at Gay Seniors  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN MATTHEWS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- In page after page of the gay press, the image
of gay America is often one of youthful vitality.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to get the idea that all gay people -- men at least --
are young, slim and buff.
</P>
<P>
   The Networker, a fledgling newspaper for older lesbians and gay
men, seeks to change that image.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some folks tell us that as they get older they go back in the
closet a little bit, because they're more leery of institutions in
general and they become less comfortable with their sexuality,''
said Stephen Karpiak, the newspaper's editor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Part of the reason for the paper is to start to draw images
about, yes, there are people who are 50, 60, 70 years old, who have
very positive lifestyles, who are maybe even good-looking, God
forbid. And they are part of this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Karpiak also is executive director of the Pride Senior Network,
a nonprofit advocacy group for elderly gays. It publishes The
Networker, which is starting as a quarterly distributed in
restaurants, doctors' offices and other spots where gay people and
seniors congregate. It is also available at the network's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   At age 52, Karpiak is part of the baby boom generation that
experts say will change the face of aging when its members retire.
He believes that as a gay man he has special concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's going to take care of us when we get older?'' he asked.
''Who's going to take care of me, for example? I've lost most of my
friends to HIV/AIDS. ... These are the people that I would have
grown old with. I have to re-establish a whole new network of
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride Senior Network was founded in 1995 by Ellen Ensig-Brodsky.
At 67, Ensig-Brodsky is retired from a career with the federal
government, where her duties included surveying nursing homes for
the Department of Health and Human Services. Her partner when she
founded the group was the director of a Manhattan senior center.
</P>
<P>
   ''So of course we would think, my goodness, how are we going to
feel receiving these services?'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we going to be able to reminisce openly? Her senior center
always has a monthly birthday dance. Would we get up and dance?
Could I tell someone in a nursing home, 'This is my partner?'''
</P>
<P>
   The paper's first issue, published last month, includes a piece
by Karpiak titled ''Peter Pan does grow up!''; an essay chiding the
gay community for not honoring its elders; and an examination of
efforts to assess the caregiving needs of aging lesbians and gay
men.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Remembers Tragedy  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Pastor Billy Epperhart was here for some
of Columbine's darkest moments. Now he expects to see some of its
brightest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm telling you this community will not just be known for
tragedy but for recovery,'' Epperhart said Sunday at Trinity
Christian Center, as Columbine High School began a week-long
commemoration of the first anniversary of the nation's worst school
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Epperhart officiated at the funerals of four Columbine victims
after 12 students, a teacher and two teen gunmen died at the high
school last April 20. Sunday, he and others reflected on holding
onto hope.
</P>
<P>
   Epperhart used the example of Jesus raising Lazarus after he had
been dead four days and placed in a tomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that God can stand at the tomb of this community and
say come forth,'' Epperhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton has endured other tragedies since the Columbine
shooting. Trinity is only a few hundred feet from the sandwich shop
where two Columbine students were killed Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Epperhart acknowledged that the community is still raw, but he
said people should accept what happened and forgive those involved
so that they are not paralyzed by it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect as many as 100,000 people at the school and
adjacent Clement Park on the first anniversary. The estimate is
based on the crowds in Oklahoma City on the first anniversary of
that city's 1995 bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A sheriff's command post has been set up in the park for
paramedics and deputies. As many as 70 deputies on foot, horse and
bicycle will patrol the area this week, with about 30 members of
the sheriff's reserve unit on hand.
</P>
<P>
   At Clement Park, the Columbine Memorial 5-K Run and Walk raised
money for three $5,000 scholarships Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first anniversary event sponsored by the school, and
2,400 people participated.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine juniors Lindsay Hamilton and Dan Arnold felt tired
just standing near the starting line of the run. They came straight
to the race from the prom and the parties that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay was glad to have had the prom to look forward to before
the first anniversary of the shootings, and she enjoyed the run.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's heartwarming. But it's also hard because it's starting
the week.''

<HEADLINE> Realtives of Detroit Suspect Wonder  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Relatives of John Eric Armstrong wonder how a
quiet child who earned decent grades, played Nintendo and enjoyed
fishing and baseball could emerge as a suspected serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Eric we raised could not have done these things,'' his
mother, Linda Pringle, said in Sunday's Detroit News. ''This is
just not the person we know. ... We just did the best we could.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, 26, was charged last week with five murders in the
Detroit area and authorities worldwide are trying to match his
account of at least 11 other slayings while he was serving on the
Navy aircraft carrier USS Nimitz.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a long, tedious process,'' Detroit police Assistant Chief
Marvin Winkler told the News in today's editions. ''Some of these
cases go back 10 years so it's a matter of going to each location
and looking through records.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though authorities suspected Armstrong in one slaying, at
least one woman was killed and three people were attacked before
Wayne County prosecutors authorized an arrest warrant, the Detroit
Free Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February, Dearborn Heights police had found clothing
fibers on Armstrong's car that were similar to those of a slaying
victim, and said they believed his alibi was suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors told police it was impossible to prove the fibers
were an exact match, and couldn't issue a warrant, said Robert
Agacinski, deputy chief of the prosecutor's office repeat-offenders
bureau.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, preliminary lab results confirmed that Armstrong's
DNA matched evidence from one slaying scene. The prosecutor's
office still denied a warrant.
</P>
<P>
   But Agacinski said a final written DNA report would have been
essential to persuading a judge to bind Armstrong over for trial.
He said that if prosecutors had not waited, Armstrong's attorney
may have successfully argued to release Armstrong until it was
available.
</P>
<P>
   Agacinski also defended the prosecutor's office by saying:
''There was no reason to suspect this guy was involved in multiple
murders. He had no prior record. No one knew how goofy he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors waited until April 12 -- two days after investigators
found the bodies of three strangled prostitutes in a railroad yard
in southwest Detroit -- to issue the warrant, the day that the state
lab issued the written DNA report.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has since been charged in the Dearborn Heights killing
and the deaths of the women found in Detroit. In total, he is
charged with five counts of premeditated first-degree murder and
three counts of assault with intent to murder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not saying we did anything wrong,'' Agacinski said.
''We're not second-guessing what we did, and we're not blaming
anyone. But ... we don't want this to happen again.''

<HEADLINE> Officials Turn to Toilet Water  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California officials want to make a splash by
taking recycling to the next step -- turning toilet water into
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insist their ''toilet-to-tap'' program is feasible,
safe and a solution to California's water shortage problem. A few
residents think the idea is revolting.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year pilot program could begin as early as today in
the San Fernando Valley, although the reclaimed water won't
actually reach faucets for five years, The Daily News of Los
Angeles reported Sunday. If successful, the program would mark the
first time in California that toilet water would be used for
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The water would undergo a five-year purification process,
closely monitored to ensure it's safe to drink, officials say. It
then would be combined with normal groundwater so that only 20
percent or less of what reaches the tap will have come from
toilets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the $55 million project makes some people queasy.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is human waste,'' said Lori Dinkin, president of the
Valley Village Homeowners Association. ''I'm very uneasy about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Valley Water Reclamation Project calls for 3.2 billion
gallons of wastewater to be sent each year to the Hansen Dam
spreading grounds. If the system works, it will be expanded to 11.4
billion gallons a year, enough to supply about 70,000 families.
</P>
<P>
   The wastewater would be filtered naturally as it seeps through
the ground. After further preparation, it would be sent to homes in
the North Hollywood area, Studio City, Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks and
Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say the project will make Southern California
less dependent on imported water and lead to less destruction of
wildlife habitats.
</P>
<P>
   ''The water that we drink every day has been around for millions
of years and circulated through who knows what -- dinosaurs, black
bears and panthers,'' said David Czamanske of the Sierra Club.
''The water becomes purified through natural processes or it can be
purified through reclamation processes.''

<HEADLINE> At 96, Earthquake Survivor Recalled  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Bessie Shum doesn't remember the day San
Francisco came crashing down in a roar of dusty death. She was only
2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   For years, San Francisco didn't remember her pain either --
official lists of the earthquake dead list fewer than a dozen
Chinese names, even though hundreds are believed to have perished
in the crowded apartment houses of Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, organizers of the 94th annual memorial of the San
Francisco earthquake of 1906 hope to take a step toward recognizing
the victims time forgot.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time that we find and make people aware that the Chinese
were here,'' says Gladys Hansen, city archivist emeritus and
curator of the Museum of the City of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although she was too little to remember the Great Quake
firsthand, Shum vividly recalls the stories her parents told, how
they dashed out of their one-room flat in Chinatown, her mother in
the arms of her husband, baby Bessie carried by a neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mother had bound feet; she couldn't walk too good,'' Shum
says. She throws up her slender hands to describe the flight from
Chinatown's rickety hazards: ''No time to pack! Just grabbed
diapers!''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly how many Chinese died in the 1906
earthquake. Hansen believes that the overall death toll was vastly
undercounted itself: At the time officials gave totals of between
478 and 498, and for decades after that the figure 700 was used.
But her research puts the toll at no less than 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, who arrived at her figure by going through letters,
newspapers and other sources from the time, blames the low figures
on the confusion, the fact that many died elsewhere after being
evacuated, fierce fires that turned bodies to cinder and a general
apathy toward the poor and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't just the Chinese. There were signs all over, 'No
Irish, no blacks, no Chinese need apply.' They got away with
this,'' Hansen says.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the story of post-earthquake Chinatown is one
of triumph over tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   After it was flattened by the earthquake, civic leaders eager to
move in on the valuable downtown property decided to push the
Chinese to the city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   But the community had other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-American merchant Look Tin Eli hired two architects to
design his destroyed bazaar. They gave traditional Western motifs
an Eastern flair, creating pagoda-style details that laid the
groundwork for modern-day Chinatown, a popular tourist spot nine
decades later.
</P>
<P>
   At 96, Shum still lives in Chinatown, on a street so steep you
have to bend your knees to walk up it.
</P>
<P>
   She is looking forward to getting up before dawn Tuesday to
gather for the 5:13 a.m. ceremony at Lotta's Fountain, a
post-earthquake gathering spot in 1906 and every anniversary since.
There, as always, participants will remember the dead with silence,
a wreath and then the wail of police and fire sirens.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have been looking for a Chinese survivor for a really long
time,'' says event organizer Taren Sapienza. Shum was found after
Sapienza went to Mayor Willie Brown and he called in his liaison to
the Chinese-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bessie sort of is my representative of the Chinese
community,'' says Sapienza, ''to make the wrong right.''

<HEADLINE> 'Wizard of Oz' Slippers for Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- If you want to own a pair of ruby red slippers
from the ''The Wizard of Oz,'' don't bother clicking your heels
together -- just plunk down a lot of cash.
</P>
<P>
   A pristine pair of size 6B ruby slippers made for Judy Garland
in ''The Wizard of Oz'' is set to be auctioned off at a Christie's
East sale of Hollywood and television memorabilia, auction house
officials said. Collectors estimate the pair could sell for
$750,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also included in the May 24 auction are the Cowardly Lion's
''Oz'' costume, a Rolls-Royce from the James Bond classic
''Goldfinger'' and Christopher Reeve's Superman capes and body
stockings.
</P>
<P>
   The Lion getup, worn by Bert Lahr in the 1939 family classic,
could fetch $600,000, collectors said. The Roll-Royce, a
12-cylinder, dual-ignition 1937 Phantom 111, probably could be
driven home for about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Costumes worn by Reeve in 1978's ''Superman'' and the 1980
follow-up, ''Superman II,'' are expected to sell for about $40,000
each.
</P>
<P>
   Television memorabilia up for sale include the black wool
yachting cap worn by Alan Hale, as the Skipper, in ''Gilligan's
Island'' (estimate $10,000) and a cigarette lighter inscribed with
a love note that Lucille Ball gave to Desi Arnaz ($1,000).
</P>
<P>
   Christie's declined to place official sale estimates on the
''Oz'' treasures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Props from that period are very rare,'' Christie's pop art
specialist Sarah Hodgson told the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's sold a pair of the ''Oz'' slippers in 1988 for
$150,000, then a record. They were among seven or eight pairs worn
by Miss Garland while filming the 1939 MGM classic.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Architect Wins Pritzker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rem Koolhaas, a Dutch architect known for
futuristic and unconventional building designs, has been named this
year's recipient of the Pritzker Architecture Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Koolhaas' work features stark designs, open space and generous
of glass. He is the first architect from the Netherlands to receive
his field's most prestigious award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rem Koolhaas is widely respected as one of the most gifted and
original talents in world architecture today,'' said J. Carter
Brown, the prize jury chairman. Brown praised ''his restless mind,
conceptual brilliance and ability to make a building sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Koolhaas, 56, didn't become an architect until his late 20s and
was at first best known for his writing on urban design. He founded
his firm, the Office of Metropolitan Architecture, in 1975. Since
1995, he also has taught at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Koolhaas has several commissions in the United States, including
a student center for Chicago's Illinois Institute of Technology and
a new $156 million central library for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Koolhaas' European projects includes a home for a man who uses a
wheelchair -- a house in three sections, including a central large
platform that functions as an elevator. He also designed the
Educatorium, a multifunctional building for Utrecht University in
the Netherlands and Kunsthal in Rotterdam, Netherlands, which
contains exhibition space, a restaurant and auditoriums.
</P>
<P>
   The Pritzker prize, which includes a bronze medallion and
$100,000 grant was established by the Hyatt Foundation in 1979.
Koolhaas will receive the award May 29.

<HEADLINE> Artist-Author Gorey Dies at 75  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) -- Edward Gorey, whose comically macabre
stories, illustrations and theater set designs were once described
as ''poisonous and poetic,'' has died. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey died Saturday at Cape Cod Hospital after suffering a heart
attack earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote at least 90 books, illustrated 60 others and won a Tony
Award in 1978 for his costume design for the Broadway production of
''Dracula.'' In the 1980s, his characters made the leap to
television in the opening and closing titles of the PBS series
''Mystery!''
</P>
<P>
   Gorey's stories, illustrated by line drawings in pen and ink,
often showed vaguely Edwardian characters in bleak settings,
reacting in prim distress to strange situations, such as the
intrusion of a penguinlike, sneaker-wearing creature. The bizarre
stories and illustrations reflected an elegantly macabre sense of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Hapless Child,'' for instance, is a tale of a little girl
with nice parents who winds up -- through a horrible series of
misfortunes -- being kept in bondage by a drunken brute until she
finally escapes. No happy ending, though: She is run over by a
carriage driven by her own father, and he doesn't recognize her
emaciated body as that of his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey was far from morbid himself, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was this false idea that he was a brooding, melancholic
man,'' said Andreas Brown, owner of the Gotham Book Mart in
Manhattan, an early champion of Gorey's work. ''He was not a
recluse. He was jovial and effervescent, and he loved to laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has called Gorey ''the Edward Lear of the 20th century,''
a reference to the English artist who wrote and illustrated ''The
Owl and the Pussycat'' and other rhymes. Critic Edmund Wilson
described the world created in Gorey's work as ''poisonous and
poetic.''
</P>
<P>
   His early work included a set of illustrations published in 1963
under the title ''The Vinegar Works; Three Volumes of Moral
Instruction.'' They featured a grisly alphabet book, ''The
Gashlycrumb Tinies,'' in which ''A is for Amy who fell down the
stairs, B is for Basil assaulted by bears, C is for Clara who
wasted away, D is for Desmond thrown out of a sleigh. ...''
</P>
<P>
   The book was included in ''Amphigorey,'' an anthology of 15
stories published in 1972 by Putnam, that brought Gorey's work to a
wider audience. It was followed by ''Amphigorey Too'' in 1974 and
''Amphigorey Also'' in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''To take my work seriously would be the height of folly,''
Gorey told The Associated Press in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey initially tried to be a novelist, but eventually to the
smaller books on which he built his career. He also designed sets
and costumes for a number of theater productions, and staged his
own ''Gorey Stories'' in New York in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Gorey moved to Cape Cod, where he led a small
theater troupe that performed his works in plays and puppet shows.

<HEADLINE> Arbiter Backs Customs Inspector  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Customs Service officials trumped up charges
against an inspector who had complained publicly about lax security
and cronyism, an arbitrator has ruled.
</P>
<P>
   Officials showed malice, ignored agency rules, twisted facts and
disregarded the truth when they threatened to fire and then
suspended Croley Forester for missing six pounds of cocaine in a
package at Miami International Airport, arbitrator Mollie H. Bowers
wrote in a binding ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Her ruling, ordering the agency to clear Forester's record,
comes almost one year after Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly
promised Congress that his agency would no longer target
whistleblowers.
</P>
<P>
   Forester said the ruling issued last week shows that Kelly's
statement ''was just another load of empty promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials would not comment, saying their lawyers were
reviewing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Forester, 46, has long been an outspoken critic of Customs
operations in Miami, having complained to Congress and The Miami
Herald about problems he saw at the airport. His revelations helped
lead to changes at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, officials started taking steps to fire Forester,
accusing him of lying about inspecting the package.
</P>
<P>
   After it was determined he actually had inspected the package
but missed the cocaine, Forester was suspended for the maximum 14
days even though he had a spotless record during a 13-year career.
He had won 29 commendations and seized about 15,000 pounds of
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Officials ''went to great lengths to contrive unwarranted,
groundless charges in order to get Forester,'' Bowers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Other inspectors who had missed drugs were not disciplined,
Bowers noted.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Disabilities Act  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping back into a states' right battle over
a key federal anti-bias law, the Supreme Court today agreed to
decide whether state employees are protected by the Americans with
Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they will use the case of two Alabama state
employees to decide whether Congress exceeded its power by giving
state employees the right to sue in federal court under the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision, expected sometime in 2001, could sweep
broadly enough to affect all ADA lawsuits against state
governments, not just those filed by public employees.
</P>
<P>
   Building on a series of decisions legal scholars say comprise a
states' rights revolution, the Supreme Court in January barred
state employees from going into federal court to sue over age bias.
</P>
<P>
   That 5-4 ruling said Congress had exceeded its authority when
allowing state employees to sue their bosses under the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act because the law cannot trump
states' 11th Amendment immunity against being sued in federal
courts.
</P>
<P>
   The justices then agreed to tackle cases from Arkansas and
Florida asking them to decide whether Congress likewise exceeded
its authority when allowing lawsuits against states under the
disabilities law.
</P>
<P>
   Both of those cases were settled thereafter, forcing the court
to drop them from its decision docket.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alabama case, Patricia Garrett sued the state after
allegedly encountering on-the-job bias at the University of Alabama
after being treated for breast cancer. And Milton Ash sued over
alleged bias in his Department of Youth Services job because of his
severe asthma.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge, after combining the two cases, dismissed them
on 11th Amendment grounds. But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals reinstated them, ruling that states have lost their
constitutional immunity from lawsuits that invoke the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appeals courts have split on that issue, however.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's appeal relied heavily on the Supreme Court's ruling in
the age-bias case and contended that Congress similarly had failed
to establish a ''pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct by
the states'' that needed some remedy when it enacted the ADA in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration lawyers urged the justices to grant
Alabama's appeal and uphold Congress' power to strip states of
their immunity against claims of bias based on disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett had been a University of Alabama employee for 17 years
when in 1994 she was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a
lumpectomy, radiation and chemotherapy treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Her lawsuit said her supervisor made negative comments about her
illness and said she would be permanently replaced if she took
leave. After Garrett took four months of unpaid leave, she was
demoted to a job with a lower salary.
</P>
<P>
   Ash's lawsuit said he was the target of on-the-job
discrimination after complaining to a federal agency about his
state employer's failure to accommodate his respiratory disability.
Ash has worked for the Department of Youth services since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Two provisions of the ADA are at stake in the case. The law's
Title I bars discrimination by employers, both private and public.
And Title II outlaws disabilities-based discrimination against
anyone by governmental entities.
</P>
<P>
   The case is University of Alabama vs. Garrett, 99-1240.

<HEADLINE> Court Weighs Term Limits Statements  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether states can require congressional candidates to support term
limits for members of Congress or be labeled an opponent on the
election ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will consider reviving Missouri's
voter-approved measure, thrown out by lower courts on grounds it
unlawfully forced candidates to speak on the subject or be
punished.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' decision is not expected until sometime in 2001,
too late for the congressional elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court dealt the term-limits movement a devastating
blow in 1995 by ruling that only a constitutional amendment can
limit the number of terms people can serve in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   After that decision, Missouri and some other states enacted
''scarlet letter'' measures instructing their members of Congress
to push for a term-limits constitutional amendment or be branded an
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's 1996 state constitutional amendment calls on members
of the state's congressional delegation to try to enact an
amendment limiting service to 12 years in the U.S. Senate and six
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not comply, the next election ballot is to
carry the label ''disregarded voters' instruction on term limits''
next to their names.
</P>
<P>
   Non-incumbent congressional candidates are instructed to pledge
their support for term limits or have the following notation next
to their name on the ballot: ''declined to pledge to support term
limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional candidate Donald Gralike challenged the measure in
federal court, and a judge ruled the measure unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the
amendment violated candidates' free-speech rights by requiring them
to speak in favor of term limits or have a ''derogatory'' label
attached to their name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also said the amendment unlawfully added to
the federal Constitution's list of qualifications for members of
Congress and violated a requirement that all amendment-making
efforts originate in Congress or the state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, Missouri's lawyers said the ballot
label was not punishment but lawful ''public commentary on the
behavior of congressional candidates.'' The measure does not compel
anyone to speak, the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
   Gralike's lawyers noted that every other state measure to be
reviewed by a federal court has been thrown out on constitutional
grounds. In 1997, the Supreme Court refused to revive a similar
measure in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Cook vs. Gralike, 99-929.

<HEADLINE> Court Considers Cigarette Ad Limits  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Restrictions on outdoor cigarette advertising
in New York City and Chicago survived a Supreme Court challenge
today.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, turned away advertisers' arguments
that a federal law pre-empts cities from imposing their own
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's 1997 ordinance bans outdoor cigarette advertising,
with exceptions: Such ads are allowed near highways, in some
commercial areas, at sports facilities and inside stores that sell
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 New York City law bars such ads within 1,000 feet of
any school, playground, day care center or youth center. Also
banned is indoor advertising in those areas that can be seen from
the street.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the legal disputes was lessened when tobacco
companies took down billboards across the country last year as part
of a massive settlement with the states.
</P>
<P>
   But advertising companies said New York City's and Chicago's
ordinances go further by also prohibiting cigarette ads at retail
stores. The companies said many cities have set varying limits on
tobacco ads that are a ''significant burden'' on advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers sued New York City and Chicago, and in each case a
federal judge decided the ordinances were pre-empted by a 1969
federal law that requires health warning labels on cigarette
packages and bars broadcast cigarette advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law says states cannot enact any prohibition ''based
on smoking and health ... with respect to the advertising or
promotion of any cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal appeals courts reversed the trial judges, and said the
1969 federal law lets cities restrict outdoor tobacco ads.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Chicago ordinance
merely restricted the location of advertising and therefore was
within local police power. Otherwise, the appeals court said,
states could not bar tobacco companies from handing out free
cigarettes in schoolyards.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a similar ruling in
the New York City case. Both appeals courts did invalidate one
provision and allowed stores to have a generic sign indicating that
they sell cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals courts ordered the trial judges to consider the
advertisers' argument that the ordinances violated their
constitutional free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeals acted on today, the advertisers' lawyers said the
1969 law is written broadly enough to pre-empt local rules on
outdoor cigarette advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The cities' lawyers said the appeals were premature because
trial judges had not yet considered the free-speech question.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Greater New York Metropolitan Food Council vs.
Giuliani, 99-1171, and Federation of Advertising Industry
Representatives vs. Chicago, 99-1172.

<HEADLINE> Court Lets School Nix Commandments  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today let a Southern
California school district ban the Ten Commandments from a fence at
a high school baseball field.
</P>
<P>
   The court, without comment, left intact the school district's
rejection of an advertisement that included the commandments.
</P>
<P>
   Today's action set no legal precedent because it was a denial of
review, not a decision.
</P>
<P>
   A Downey, Calif., businessman who wanted to post an ad that
included the commandments said the school district's refusal
unlawfully discriminated against religious speech and violated
religious freedom. But a federal appeals court ruled he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The justices have under study, and are expected to decide by
late June, a Texas case asking whether public school districts may
allow students to lead football stadium crowds in prayers before
high school games.
</P>
<P>
   The California dispute began when the Downey High School
baseball booster club sought to raise money in 1995 by selling
advertising space on a 4-foot-high outfield fence.
</P>
<P>
   Edward DiLoreto, chief executive of a local engineering firm,
paid $400 for an ad that listed the Ten Commandments after stating,
''Meditate on these principles to live by.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ad was rejected, DiLoreto sued. But state and federal
courts ruled against him.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a decision last
November, called the baseball field fence ''a forum limited to
certain subjects and not open for indiscriminate use by the general
public.'' Therefore, the appeals court said, DiLoreto's free-speech
rights had not been violated.
</P>
<P>
   The school district was free to exclude subjects ''that would be
disruptive to the educational purpose of the school,'' the appeals
court said, noting that a Planned Parenthood ad also had been
rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court relied in part on a previous ruling in which
it refused to force Phoenix to accept noncommercial ads, such as
religious and political messages, for display on the outside of
city buses. That ruling was denied review by the Supreme Court last
May.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, DiLoreto's lawyers accused school
district officials of ''impermissible viewpoint-based
discrimination'' spurred by ''some misguided ideas about their
responsibilities with respect to the separation of church and
state, ideas that have no legal support whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district's lawyers urged the justices to reject the
appeal, saying officials took reasonable steps in an attempt to
avoid expensive litigation over controversial signs.
</P>
<P>
   The case is DiLoreto vs. Board of Education, 99-1345.

<HEADLINE> Two charged in death of migrant worker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKFIELD, N.Y. (AP) -- Two men were being held without bail today
on charges they murdered a fellow migrant worker who they believed
had stolen some money.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus Chavez Garcia, 33, and his nephew, Heriberto Chavez
Sandoval, 21, both of Albion, were charged Saturday with
second-degree murder in the death of 33-year-old Agustin Omar
Bello-Suarez, sheriff's officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's body was found Friday in a ditch in Genesee County
by a passing motorist.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Garcia and Sandoval had been riding in a pickup
truck with Bello-Suarez, consuming alcohol Thursday evening, when
they stopped along a Town of Oakfield road. Garcia and Sandoval
allegedly struck Bello-Suarez over the head with a beer bottle or a
type of club and left him, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bello-Suarez had allegedly stolen money from Garcia and was
killed in retaliation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, who was Mexican, was a migrant laborer formerly
employed at the Scott Root Farms in Orleans County.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials said a grand jury would begin hearing the
case Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 88; Nasdaq Up 78   </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The stock market steadied this morning after a
jittery start, rebounding modestly as investors nibbled at
potential bargains following last week's carnage.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 88.11 at 10,393.88 after slipping 26
points near the open.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which lost one quarter of its value
last week, was up 78.90 after wiping out an early 94-point drop by
the technology-dominated measure.
</P>
<P>
   The modest recovery came despite a series of sharp declines on
overseas markets, where selling was heavy in reaction to Friday's
brutal slide on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, worried that rising inflation and interest rates will
cut into company profits, investors began dumping stocks. The Dow
was left 12 percent below its record high, while the Nasdaq started
34 percent below the record it reached March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly helping sentiment this morning were some more strong
profit reports on the first three months of the year, this time
from Citigroup and Ford Motor.
</P>
<P>
   While other popular stock barameters also turned higher this
morning, the market's overall bias remained negative with declining
issues outnumbering advancers by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading measures, the Standard and Poor's 500 index
was up 11.89 and the Russell 20000 index of smaller companies was
up 2.12 at 455.84.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 152.50 million million shares, almots even
with Friday's eayly pace.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 6.98 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2.61 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 3.98 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 2.61 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Search Ramifications  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police are conducting a search, and therefore
must comply with constitutional requirements, when they squeeze
someone's luggage to determine if drugs might be inside, the
Supreme Court ruled today.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border Patrol agent
who felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment ban on unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to
contain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physically invasive inspection is simply more intrusive than
purely visual inspection,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
wrote for the court. A bus passenger ''does not expect that other
passengers or bus employees will, as a matter of course, feel the
bag in an exploratory manner.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But this is exactly what the agent did here,'' the chief
justice said. ''We therefore hold that the agent's physical
manipulation of (the passenger's) bag violated the Fourth
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's decision reverses the conspiracy and drug-possession
convictions of Steven Dewayne Bond, who was a passenger on a
Greyhound bus stopped at an immigration checkpoint in Sierra
Blanca, Texas. The bus had traveled from California and was en
route to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   A Border Patrol agent checked the passengers' immigration
status, then felt their luggage, including bags in overhead bins.
</P>
<P>
   The agent squeezed a canvas bag in the bin over Bond's seat, and
the shape of a ''brick-like'' object inside led him to suspect it
contained drugs. When the agent asked Bond if he could open the
bag, Bond said, ''Go ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent found, wrapped inside a pair of pants, a brick-like
object covered in tape. Tests showed it contained methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Bond asked a trial judge in 1997 to rule the drug could not be
used as evidence, contending the officer's squeezing of the bag
amounted to a search that violated the Fourth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment generally prohibits searches unless police have
''probable cause'' to believe they will find evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled against Bond, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed. The appeals court said Bond gave up any reasonable
expectation of privacy when he ''exposed'' the bag to the public by
putting it in the overhead bin.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Supreme Court said the 5th Circuit court was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said today's case was different from two previous
cases in which the nation's highest court held that police
observation of someone's backyard or a greenhouse from a plane or
helicopter did not amount to a search. Those cases involved ''only
visual, as opposed to tactile, observation,'' the chief justice
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Travelers are particularly concerned about their carry-on
luggage; they generally use it to transport personal items that ...
they prefer to keep close at hand,'' Rehnquist wrote.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen G. Breyer dissented. Writing
for the two, Breyer said a police officer's squeezing of a bag was
no different from what other passengers might be expected to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''At worst, this case will deter law enforcement officers
searching for drugs near borders from using even the most
non-intrusive touch to help investigate publicly exposed bags,''
Breyer said. Travelers who want to safeguard the contents of their
luggage ''from public touch should plan to pack those contents in a
suitcase with hard sides.''

<HEADLINE> Northeast Gets Another Day To File  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Because April 15 fell on a Saturday, most Americans
have until
midnight tonight to get their federal income tax returns to a local
post office and postmarked without incurring a late penalty.
<TEXT>
<P>
   People in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire,
Rhode Island, Vermont and most of New York outside of the New York
City area have another day -- until midnight Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service decided to allow all those
Northeast filers an extra day because of the annual Patriot's Day
legal holiday in Maine and Massachusetts. Many of the returns from
the region are handled by the IRS service center at Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   New York taxpayers from New York City and Nassau, Rockland,
Suffolk and Westchester counties have to file their returns by
midnight tonight.

<HEADLINE> Syracuse records eight shootings in three days, one fatal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- An 18-year-old city man was arraigned
today in the shooting death of another man.
</P>
<P>
   Jerrawn Thomas, who voluntarily surrendered to police Sunday
evening, was ordered held without bail at the Onondaga County
Justice Center following his arraignment for second-degree murder
and criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Thomas had not confessed to shooting 22-year-old
Jeffrey S. Connor and had answered no questions.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is not closed,'' Syracuse police Sgt. Joe Sweeny
said, adding that more arrests could be made. ''We have much more
investigating to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeny said the weapon used to shoot Connor, the sixth homicide
victim in the city this year, had not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Connor died Friday night after being shot twice as he walked
down South Salina Street. He was pronounced dead at 10:50 p.m.
after being shot earlier in the day in the upper leg and just below
his heart, according to University Hospital officials.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe Connor exchanged words with as many as 10
teen-agers on the front porch of a home. While they spoke, someone
fired a gun, Sweeny said. The teens then ran in different
directions.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this time, we're not sure whether he went there looking for
someone or was just in the neighborhood,'' Sweeny said. ''We're
still questioning a whole bunch of witnesses in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Officers found numerous shell casings on the ground, as well as
bullet holes in nearby parked cars, Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors who live near the latest shooting understandably were
both concerned and scared.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really getting bad,'' Artina Pagan said. ''I mean, I had
just walked away from the window when I heard the shots. But I
could have been shot. My grandkids could have been shot, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of eight shootings in three days in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were wounded in the shootings. In the most serious
non-fatal incident, police said Tayon Wallace, 23, was shot
point-blank in the face while sitting in a car on the street around
3 a.m. Sunday. Police said someone had fired shots at Wallace's
house early Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Wallace and his brother were waiting for a
friend to come out of a restaurant when the second shooting
occurred. Wallace was hospitalized in serious condition today.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 139; Nasdaq Up 119  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed today, but major indexes
rose sharply after a jittery start as investors began nibbling at
potential bargains from last week's carnage.
</P>
<P>
   By late morning on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 139.30 at 10,445.07 after slipping 26 points near the open.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which lost one quarter of its value
last week, was up 119.90 at 3,441.19 after erasing an early
94-point drop by the technology-dominated measure.
</P>
<P>
   The modest recovery came despite sharp declines on overseas
markets in reaction to Friday's brutal slide on Wall Street, which
sliced a record 617 points off the Dow and a record 355 points off
the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, worried that rising inflation and interest rates will
cut into company profits, investors began dumping stocks in just
about every sector of the market along with the speculative
high-flyers from the Internet boom. The Dow was left 12 percent
below its record high, while the Nasdaq fell to 34 percent below
the record it reached March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly helping sentiment this morning were some more strong
profit reports on the first three months of the year, this time
from Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Eastman Kodak and Ford Motor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while most popular stock barameters rose this morning,
the overall bias remained negative on the broad market, with
declining issues outnumbering advancers by nearly a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading measures, the Standard and Poor's 500 index
was up 20.85 at 1,377.41 and the Russell 20000 index of smaller
companies was up 0.78 at 454.50.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 364.68 million million shares, exceeded
Friday's near-record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 6.98 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2.61 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 3.98 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 2.61 percent.

<HEADLINE> Court To Clarify Inmates' Review  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today agreed to clarify the
deadline for state inmates to seek federal court review of their
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will hear New York prosecutors' argument that
an inmate waited too long to file a federal court appeal arguing
that his conviction violated his rights. The inmate's previous
appeal in state court was not properly filed and therefore it did
not put the federal deadline on hold, prosecutors contend.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Bruce Bennett was convicted of attempted murder and other
charges after a February 1983 incident in which prosecutors said he
fired two shots at a police car chasing the car in which he was
riding.
</P>
<P>
   His conviction was upheld by a New York state appeals court, and
the state's highest court refused to hear his appeal in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he asked a state court to set aside his
conviction but was turned down. In 1995, he filed a new petition in
state court raising additional grounds. The court turned him down
orally but did not issue a written order.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, Bennett went to federal court, alleging that
his conviction violated his constitutional rights. A judge
dismissed his appeal, saying he missed the one-year deadline for
such appeals required by a 1996 federal law, the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated his appeal,
saying the one-year deadline was on hold because his 1995 appeal in
state court was still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 state appeal was properly filed because it met the
state's basic procedural requirements, the court said, declining to
consider whether the state appeal was improper because the issues
he raised may have been barred under state law.
</P>
<P>
   In the appeal acted on today, prosecutors said the 2nd Circuit
court's ruling would allow the federal deadline to be delayed by
''almost any piece of paper'' filed as a state appeal, regardless
of whether it complied with state law.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's lawyer said state courts can head off such appeals by
requiring judicial authorization to file them.
</P>
<P>
   The case is Artuz vs. Bennett, 99-1238.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mostly lower today, but major

potential blue-chip bargains following last week's carnage.
</P>
<P>
   By midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was

</P>
<P>
   Still, it was encouraging to see signs of stability, especially

<HEADLINE> Clinton Helps Poor With Phone Plan  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- In the shadow of prosperous high-tech
businesses, President Clinton today visited a hard-luck
neighborhood that has been left out of the digital revolution and
left behind by the nation's soaring economy.
</P>
<P>
   The president used East Palo Alto, Calif. -- a city where schools
have just one computer for every 28 students and more than 24
percent of elementary- and middle-school students live in poverty --
to announce new grants and training programs to improve
telecommunication services in poor and minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know there are people and places that have not fully
participated in this new economy. I see these places as places of
opportunity,'' Clinton said. ''If we can create new employees, new
businesses, new jobs, new opportunities, we can keep the American
economy going.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton was headed to the Navajo Reservation in New
Mexico to announce a plan to speed computer access and improve
telecommunications for American Indians. The federal plan would
provide basic telephone service for $1 a month on reservations, the
White House said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies will join Clinton's effort to spread the
benefits of computers and the Internet, announcing pledges of
money, training and equipment. The commitments will include $25
million from Qualcomm, $20 million in software from Novell and $15
million from Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway will offer technology literacy training for 75,000
teachers nationwide -- including all teachers in East Palo Alto. The
Waitt Family Foundation will promise 50,000 Gateway computers for
technology centers helping underprivileged children and America
Online will offer 100,000 Internet accounts.
</P>
<P>
   William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, who was joining the president in making the telephone
service announcement in Shiprock, N.M., said he expects the plan to
benefit 300,000 Indian households.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is disgraceful that we have a telephone system that is the
envy of the world, but basic telecommunications services are not
widely enjoyed by our land's oldest people,'' Kennard said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the program, Kennard said, he will propose adding $17
million to an existing program that underwrites phone service costs
for low-income people. That amounts to a 3.5 percent increase in
funding for the program. Long-distance phone companies, which pay
varied subsidies to states to assist low-income people, would
ultimately pay the additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   Poor American Indian households already qualify for a discount,
but Clinton administration officials said the cost is still too
high for many. Nearly one-third of all Indians live in poverty,
compared with 13 percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp. announced Sunday it is donating more
than $2.7 million in software and cash to help bridge the ''digital
divide'' and economic disparity between Indian tribes and wealthier
segments of society.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the gift, all but $200,000 it in software, will
be divided among eight tribal colleges, including Dine College in
Shiprock.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 percent of Navajo Reservation households have a phone
according to the 1990 census. Nationwide, the figure is an
estimated 56 percent for Indian reservation households but 94
percent for the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, meanwhile, spent Sunday with his daughter Chelsea and
some friends from Stanford University. On Saturday, Clinton played
golf with the chief executive of an Internet search engine firm and
a high-tech venture capitalist.

<HEADLINE> 'Franklin': Happy Land for a Turtle  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's hard to make a turtle warm and fuzzy.
Cold-blooded, shell-encased, this is a creature few would certify
as cuddly.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, he's the turtle-tot Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   In two dozen children's books and for the past year in a cartoon
series on Nickelodeon (airing weekdays at 10:30 a.m. and 1 p.m. ET
as part of the Nick Jr. lineup), this little guy is every bit as
lovable as the kids who follow his adventures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the problems Franklin confronts ring true for any
preschooler:
</P>
<P>
   -- With his birthday approaching, he promises his friends a huge
bash. His parents say no. But the scaled-down party they help him
plan turns out to be just as much fun.
</P>
<P>
   -- Franklin faces the first day of school fearful that he'll be
expected to know everything when he walks into the classroom. But,
to his great relief, he finds out that not knowing those things is
exactly why he's there.
</P>
<P>
   -- Being toothless, he feels left out when his mammal pals lose
their baby teeth. But he learns there are other signs of growing up
than a visit by the Tooth Fairy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to help a child believe that he or she is capable of
managing some of childhood's common dilemmas,'' says ''Franklin''
creator Paulette Bourgeois, ''and that they can find a solution,
within their own range. In the stories, adults are guiding
influences, but they never tell a child, 'This is what you should
do next.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wildly popular among the wee set, ''Franklin'' wears well for
Mom and Dad, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what I'm trying to write is great parenting,''
Bourgeois says. ''When I see how Franklin's parents deal with him,
I realize I'm trying to write the parent I would like to be myself
-- and am not.'' She laughs. ''It's an idealized world in those
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto-based Bourgeois had trained to be a psychiatric
occupational therapist, but gravitated toward free-lance writing.
In 1983, with the birth of daughter Natalie, she hit upon the
notion of writing a children's book.
</P>
<P>
   Then, nursing Natalie in the middle of one fateful night, she
happened to be watching a ''M A S H'' rerun as Dr. Hawkeye Pierce
refused to take shelter in a cave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so claustrophobic,'' cracked Hawkeye, ''if I were a turtle
I'd be afraid of my own shell.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois calls it ''a lightbulb moment. I started writing the
next day.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was ''Franklin in the Dark,'' which told of a turtle
lad who, scared of the darkness inside his shell, refused to go in.
He dragged it behind him with a rope. But by the end of the tale,
he conquers his fear, embraces his turtleness, and learns to be
comfortable in his own skin, er, shell.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois had stumbled on a powerful metaphor, then transformed
it into a storybook character. But despite the vast symbolic value,
Franklin's identity as a turtle was never Bourgeois' point.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, always, Franklin was a 5-year-old,'' she says. A
sweet, rambunctious, soccer-loving kid. For her, that much was
clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I had no image of him,'' she confesses. ''I don't think
visually.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when Bourgeois found a publisher to buy her manuscript,
Franklin remained unpictured in her mind. Kids Can Press presented
the text to an up-and-coming illustrator named Brenda Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Clark says she drew Franklin as a hybrid of box turtle and
Galapagos turtle who can walk (and run) upright. She outfitted him
with a baseball cap, neckerchief and backpack-like shell, and
colored him lustrous green.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time, green was not popular in design terms,'' she
notes. ''But I found a green turtle was much more appealing than
brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she placed Franklin and his friends -- Bear, Fox, Goose,
tiny Snail and the rest -- in a verdant countryside befitting any
fairy tale. There, they radiate goodwill and good cheer.
Everybody's usually smiling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to draw the characters the way you'd like your mother,
or your child, to look at you,'' Clark explains. When her son
Robin, now 9, was born, ''I could look at him and see the facial
expressions I'm talking about, and they inspired me.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bourgeois has seldom borrowed from children
Natalie (now 16) and Gordon (14) in writing the stories. She mines
her own childhood, instead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would remember feeling horribly like an outsider,'' she
says, ''and then I would look for a situation where Franklin would
either feel like the outsider, or make some other child feel
excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   In one story, Franklin is disappointed when he is made stage
manager for the school play, rather than assigned an acting role.
Out of sight backstage when his parents come to see the show, he
feels like he's let them down.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, Mom and Dad are extra proud of him for handling such
a big responsibility. They make sure he understands that, even out
of the spotlight, he's a star.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the message of ''Franklin'' -- going out to every kid.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Stay Tenn. Execution  </HEADLINE>
By TOM SHARP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal appeals court Monday refused
to stay the execution of Robert Glen Coe, who could become the
first person put to death in Tennessee in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Coe, 44, is scheduled to die by injection at 1 a.m. Wednesday
for the 1979 kidnapping, rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Coe had asked the full 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Cincinnati to review a decision by a three-judge panel of the court
that found him mentally competent for execution. Monday's ruling
said Coe's concerns did not merit another hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Coe's attorneys also have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review
his mental competence and Tennessee's method for determining it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, Coe has twice come within 16 hours of being
executed. Both times, federal courts stayed his execution so they
could review his competency.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Supreme Court standards prevent the execution of the
insane. The threshold question is whether the inmate understands
the punishment and why he or she is receiving it.
</P>
<P>
   A trial court decision that Coe met the standard has been upheld
by the Tennessee Supreme Court and two tiers of federal appeals
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Don Sundquist has denied Coe's request for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious leaders have condemned the Tennessee Supreme
Court for scheduling the execution during the holiest week on the
Christian calendar and at the beginning of the Jewish Passover.
Wednesday is the first evening of Passover and four days before
Easter.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the state's high court said the justices chose
the date because it was one week from April 11, when a federal
court lifted Coe's last stay of execution.

meant for the witnesses, the Justice Department said.

<P>
   Hilton D. Coleman, 48, a supervisor in the Witness Protection
Program in the District of Columbia Superior Court, embezzled funds
from witnesses' subsistence accounts, the department's Office of
the Inspector General said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation found Coleman forged witnesses' signatures on
voucher receipts and then pocketed the difference between the
amount on the receipts and what he gave the witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, a 14-year veteran with the Marshals Service, resigned
in October while the investigation was under way. He could face a
maximum of 10 years imprisonment when he is sentenced July 12.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's office and the Marshals Service
conducted the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Film sales, digital photography lift Kodak profits 15 percent  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co., buoyed by higher film
sales and narrowing losses in its digital photography business,
posted a 15 percent rise in first-quarter profits Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges, the world's biggest photography
company earned $297 million, or 95 cents a share, compared with
$259 million, or 80 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
Revenues overall were unchanged at $3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of 93 cents
a share, as reported by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   When one-time charges are included, Kodak's net profit totaled
$289 million, or 93 cents a share, up 51 percent from $191 million,
or 59 cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak benefited from continued cost savings during the quarter
but incurred $8 million in after-tax costs associated with closing
its Elmgrove manufacturing hub in Rochester. A year ago, earnings
were reduced $68 million by a variety of restructuring charges.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its revenues from film sales rose 2 percent in
the United States and 3 percent worldwide during the quarter, with
higher volumes offsetting a 3 percent fall in prices and the
negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Losses in digital photography, the recording of images on
computer chips, continued to narrow to $4 million in the quarter
from $12 million a year ago -- helped by Kodak's inclusion in the
category of digital products sold to the graphics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Digital products revenues increased 15 percent to $706 million
from $612 million a year ago, boosted by a 62 percent jump in sales
of consumer digital cameras and robust sales of health-imaging
scanners.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging-market sales accelerated 16 percent in the quarter,
helped by robust performances in China, India, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak has benefited from stronger volumes in the key U.S.
consumer film market, where falling prices have pinched margins.
The market has been softening over the last year since being roiled
by a price war sparked by Japanese nemesis Fuji in 1997. That
battle led to around 20,000 jobs cuts at Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Dan Carp cautioned that sales, expected to grow
between 6 percent and 7 percent this year, could be reduced by 1
percentage point if the dollar remained strong against other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Carp took over Jan. 1 from George Fisher, who stepped down as
CEO after a turbulent, six-year reign. Fisher is staying on as
chairman until Dec. 31.

<HEADLINE> Old flags rotting away; governor wants funds to restore them  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Seventy-three battle flags beneath which
Connecticut troops once fought and died are crumbling due to a lack
of funding.
</P>
<P>
   The flags from the Civil War, Spanish-American War and World
Wars I and II are the last victims of a budget deficit from 10
years ago, when a program to preserve them came to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   That project put 95 other battle banners on display in the
Capitol's dimly lit Hall of the Flags, visited by more than 30,000
schoolchildren each year. Several other flags are framed and hung
in a climate-controlled case in the Capitol's basement.
</P>
<P>
   The 73 remaining flags, including a heavily embroidered Civil
War banner created by Tiffany and Co. for Connecticut's 18th
Regiment, rest in boxes tucked away from public view, in a
fifth-floor office of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the flags' plight, Gov. John G. Rowland said he will try
to secure preservation funding during budget talks before the May 3
legislative deadline of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time to do the right thing,'' Rowland said. ''Now that
economic prosperity has returned, we have the surplus funds to do
the job. We've spent millions of dollars to restore the Capitol. We
need to make the flag preservation a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of beautiful stories about the courage of the
men from Connecticut,'' said Monsignor Joseph A. Devine, pastor of
Waterbury's Our Lady of Loreto Church.
</P>
<P>
   Devine, who is chaplain of the state Senate, also led the
Capitol preservation effort 20 years ago through the Committee on
Legislative Management.
</P>
<P>
   In laws dating back to 1949, state battle flags in public hands
were ordered deposited in the Capitol ''in suitable cases.'' By the
mid-1980s, lawmakers approved $100,000 to preserve and display
flags, with the contract going to the University of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But as the state budget deficit climbed, leading to the
still-controversial income tax vote in 1991, the flag project was
quietly abandoned, leaving Devine with dozens of crumbling flags.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Gerry Caughman, a volunteer Capitol tour guide who helped
stabilize the forgotten flags, researching their history, wrapping
them in muslin, acid-free tissue and bubble wrap, shutting them
away from light in boxes in a locked office five flights up from
the Hall of the Flags.
</P>
<P>
   Now she patrols the cases, writing summaries of the military
units, monitoring fabric deterioration and evidence of insects.
Caughman feels strongly that these remnants of the state's history
should be cherished.
</P>
<P>
   ''Connecticut men died for these flags,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Feelings Range With Start II Treaty  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three former American negotiators said Monday
that an agreement with Russia to cut nuclear arsenals is imperiled
by conservative Senate Republicans who want to jettison a ban on
missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators also questioned whether the Clinton
administration has a strategy to implement the START II treaty and
its cutbacks of about 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's a game plan,'' ex-negotiator Thomas
Graham said at a news conference held by the private Arms Control
Association. ''They are thinking mostly about domestic politics and
electing the vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham also said it would be ''a recipe for rekindling the
nuclear arms race'' for the Clinton administration to go ahead with
a limited defense against missiles without a green light from
Russia, the European allies and China.
</P>
<P>
   Spurgeon Keeny, president of the association, said it would be
the United States' advantage to carry out START II, which the Duma,
the lower house of the Russian Parliament, approved last week. The
upper house began considering the treaty Monday.
</P>
<P>
   START II refers to the second Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty,
signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   While reducing U.S. and Russian stockpiles of long-range nuclear
weapons to fewer than 3,500 from current levels of about 6,000
each, the treaty would ban Russia's SS-18 missiles,
multiple-warhead, land-based weapons that are the most powerful in
the Russian arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Keeny, who held senior posts in the U.S. Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency, and Jack Mendelsohn, a former U.S.
negotiator on START II, said the administration was required to
seek Senate approval of various amendments to the 1993 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But attempting that, they said, would give conservative
Republicans a chance to scuttle the 1972 treaty banning
anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin said last Friday that he would
consider canceling all major arms control agreements with the
United States if it withdrew from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   This week, U.S. and Russian negotiators are due to meet in
Geneva, to consider a treaty designed to make even deeper cuts in
nuclear arsenals and what the Clinton administration hopes will be
Russian approval of a limited missile-defense system.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is a reduction to 2,000 to 2,500 each, but Russia is
expected to push for even deeper cuts, to about 1,500 long-range
nuclear warheads.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Going to Russia in June  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton will travel to
Moscow in early June for a two-day summit with Russia's new
president, Vladimir Putin, the White House announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be in Moscow June 4-5 and then travel on to Kiev,
Ukraine, June 6.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made as Clinton visited East Palo Alto to
encourage investment in poorer communities in America.
</P>
<P>
   The stops in Russia and Ukraine will come at the end of a trip
that will include Portugal and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be in Portugal May 30 through June 1 for a
regularly scheduled summit with European Union leaders and an
official visit to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he will go Berlin for a summit on ''third way''
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Others invited for the June 2-3 summit led by German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder are leaders from Argentina, Brazil, Britain,
Chile, France, Israel, Italy, South Africa, the Netherlands, New
Zealand, Portugal and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will pick up the prestigious Charlemagne prize in
Aachen.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Clinton will meet with Putin and other Russian
leaders. ''The president also hopes to use his visit to speak to a
broad spectrum of Russian leaders who are building new democratic
institutions, civil society and a market economy,'' a White House
statement said.

<HEADLINE> CNBC Film Examines Wall St. History  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- That sinking feeling in the pit of your
stomach, the one that feels exactly like a tumbling stock market,
is an old American malady.
</P>
<P>
   Take a market overheated by new technology mania, mix with a
dash of harsh reality and you've got a recipe for gastric
discomfort, as CNBC's documentary ''The Great Game: The Story of
Wall Street'' makes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Overvalued Internet stocks are merely the wayward stock darlings
of the day, according to historian John Steele Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've see it over and over and over again, starting with the
bank shares in the 1790s, canal shares in the 1820s, railroads in
the 1830s and airline stocks in the 1920s after Lindbergh flew the
Atlantic,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone thought the future of air travel was limitless and
started bidding up the prices of airline stocks,'' he said. ''Most
of the companies had never flown an airplane and no one had the
faintest idea of how to make money conveying passengers by
airplane. But still the stock went up.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology may change, but human nature and the emotions that
drive Wall Street -- fear and greed, as the old saying goes -- remain
the same, Gordon said. Not that there's anything wrong with that,
according to the documentary, which points a rosy view of the
evolution of the stock market and the U.S. economic system.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour film, debuting 8 p.m. EDT Monday (April 24), is a
colorful and revealing look at finance that even the uninitiated
will appreciate. Although a bit of unexplained jargon slips by
(such as buying stocks ''on margin,'' with money borrowed from a
brokerage), host Sue Herera, a CNBC anchor, and experts make the
workings of capitalism easy to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Gordon's book ''The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall
Street as a World Power'' (Scribner), the program begins at the
beginning, with the establishment of New York by business-savvy
Netherlanders.
</P>
<P>
   Besides giving us the words cookie and Brooklyn, the Dutch also
contributed such capitalist advancements as stock markets and
insurance; 17th century Holland was the cradle of modern
capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, named for the wall that the Dutch had built against
invasion, became the city's financial heart.
</P>
<P>
   Among the film's intriguing historical tidbits: The Spanish
pieces of eight commonly used by colonials are why the New York
Stock Exchange quotes prices in eighths, not tenths, of a dollar;
the bank that became Chase Manhattan was founded as part of Aaron
Burr's water company scheme; signal flagmen quickly transmitted
stock prices from New York to Philadelphia in pre-telegraph days.
</P>
<P>
   Boom and bust cycles were common from the start. This ditty,
written in 1857, is virtually timeless: ''Monday, I started my land
operations. Tuesday, owed millions by all calculations. Wednesday,
my brownstone palace began. Thursday, I drove out a spanking new
span (team of horses). Friday, I gave a magnificent ball. Saturday,
smashed -- with just nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The film tracks the regulations that helped bring a measure of
stability and order to the market, such as stricter accounting
practices, the filing of annual reports and the creation of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's first chairman was future presidential dad Joseph P.
Kennedy, who gained a reputation as a sterling and efficient
administrator. Don't count on the usually reliable Kennedy clan for
adding color to this particular story; that comes from other
dashing and eccentric figures.
</P>
<P>
   We meet the ''Witch of Wall Street,'' Hetty Green, who is
counted as the only woman among the 40 richest Americans to have
made rather than inherited her fortune. She was shrewd, tough and
chintzy, an unbeatable combination.
</P>
<P>
   Smooth operators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk, who almost scammed $7
million out of Cornelius Vanderbilt in a fight over the Erie
Railway and brought chaos to the 1869 stock market with a gold
scheme, were ''no more honest than the standards of their day,'' as
Gordon puts it.
</P>
<P>
   How the little guy is affected by such shenanigans is little
explored in the film. But ''The Great Game'' does look at one
unsettling truth: The bleakest of events can bring buoyancy to the
economy. Civil War-era gold speculators profited when battles went
against the Union, causing President Lincoln to rail, ''I wish
every one of them would have his devilish head shot off.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another issue the film skirts but which Gordon says
will become more and more urgent: the lack of international
regulation in an increasingly global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can be sitting in Madascagar with your laptop and trading
on the New York Stock Exchange and there's no real way for the SEC
or the New York Stock Exchange to regulate you,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a global equivalent of the SEC, Gordon contends,
''is going to be the great political problem of the next decade or
so because we really don't have mechanisms to achieve that.''

<HEADLINE> Notable Rulings by 'Miranda' Court  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Some recent significant rulings by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of
Appeals:
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIRANDA:
</P>
<P>
   --In February 1999, the court ruled that an obscure 1968 federal
law effectively overturned the U.S. Supreme Court's 1966 Miranda
ruling, which requires police to inform suspects of their rights.
The appeals court ruled 8-5 that the law, known as Section 3501,
made failing to give Miranda warnings just one of several factors
in deciding whether statements to police were made voluntarily. The
Supreme Court will hear the case on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN:
</P>
<P>
   --In March 1999, the court voted 7-4 to strike down a portion of
a federal law that allows victims of rape or domestic violence to
sue their attackers for damages under civil rights law. The court
said Congress overstepped its bounds when it relied on its power to
regulate interstate commerce to enact the Violence Against Women
Act. Christy Brzonkala was seeking a trial on her claims that her
civil rights were violated by Virginia Tech and two football
players who were accused of raping her while she was a student
there. The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in January. It
has yet to rule.
</P>
<P>
   HANDICAPPED PARKING:
</P>
<P>
   --In a 2-1 ruling in February 1999, a panel of the court ruled
that the Americans with Disabilities Act does not prohibit states
from charging disabled people for such things as handicapped
license plates and handicapped parking placards that are hung from
rearview mirrors. Five disabled people had sued North Carolina,
saying the state broke the law by charging $5 for placards. The
full appeals court refused to rehear the case, and the Supreme
Court has not decided whether to take the case.
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO:
</P>
<P>
   --In August 1998, a panel ruled 2-1 that the Food and Drug
Administration did not have the power to regulate nicotine as a
drug. The ruling was a victory for the tobacco industry, which is
strong in most of the states that are part of the 4th Circuit. The
Supreme Court upheld the ruling 5-4 last month.
</P>
<P>
   DRIVER'S PRIVACY:
</P>
<P>
   --In a 2-1 ruling in September 1998, a panel ruled that a federal
law severely restricting the release of driver's license
information is an unconstitutional infringement on states' rights.
Congress enacted the Driver's Privacy Protection Act of 1994 to
prevent stalkers from using driver's license information to find
people. The appeals court said the law went too far in prohibiting
states from selling lists of registered drivers. In January,
however, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed the 4th Circuit, a
departure from the justices' recent string of decisions reining in
federal power.

<HEADLINE> Court To Rule on Term Limit Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking up a dispute involving term limits and
free speech, the Supreme Court agreed Monday to decide whether
states can require congressional candidates to push for such limits
or be branded as opponents on the election ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The court said it will consider whether Missouri's
voter-approved measure violates candidates' free-speech rights. The
measure was thrown out by a federal appeals court, as have been
similar ''scarlet letter'' laws enacted by several other states.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Benson, the lawyer for a congressional candidate who
challenged the Missouri rule, said he was surprised the Supreme
Court agreed to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I'm confident that when the court looks closely at
Missouri's scarlet letter amendment, it will see it for what it is,
a gross violation of the First Amendment rights of candidates for
federal office,'' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' decision is expected in 2001, too late for the
congressional elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court dealt the term-limits movement a devastating
blow in 1995 by ruling that only a constitutional amendment can
limit the number of terms people can serve in Congress. Missouri
and other states enacted their ''scarlet letter'' laws after that
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's 1996 state constitutional amendment calls on members
of the congressional delegation to try to enact an amendment
limiting service to 12 years in the U.S. Senate and six in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do not comply, the next election ballot is to
carry the label ''disregarded voters' instruction on term limits''
next to their names.
</P>
<P>
   Non-incumbent congressional candidates must pledge their support
for term limits or have the following notation next to their names:
''declined to pledge to support term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Congressional candidate Donald Gralike challenged the measure in
federal court, and a judge ruled the measure unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, saying the
amendment violated candidates' free-speech rights by requiring them
to speak in favor of term limits or have a ''derogatory'' label
attached to their name on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court also said the amendment unlawfully added to
the federal Constitution's list of qualifications for members of
Congress and violated a requirement that all amendment-making
efforts originate in Congress or the state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   In appealing to the Supreme Court, Missouri's lawyers said the
ballot label was lawful ''public commentary'' on congressional
candidates' behavior and did not compel anyone to speak, the appeal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gralike's lawyers said the rule would transform the election
ballot ''to a billboard for political advertising.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Jokes About E-Mail Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton made a joke at his
own expense Monday when a 9-year-old boy asked him how he uses the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied that he has shopped online but doesn't use
electronic mail.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I want to talk to my daughter, I pick up the phone,''
Clinton told the crowd at an event where he announced new grants to
improve telecommunications services in poor and minority
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with a rueful laugh, Clinton made a remark that brought to
mind the Justice Department's investigation into thousands of
incoming White House e-mail messages on campaign fund raising and
other matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you work for the government, you don't use e-mail very much
unless you want it all in the newspapers,'' Clinton said.

<HEADLINE> This Court Is a 'Supreme' Challenge  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY O'DELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Last year, a federal appeals court came to
the startling conclusion that for the past three decades, every
real and imaginary cop from Joe Friday to Andy Sipowicz didn't
really have to give that speech that begins, ''You have the right
to remain silent.''
</P>
<P>
   With rulings like that, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
has gained a reputation as the most boldly conservative appellate
circuit in the nation. It has also issued provocative decisions on
tobacco and federal-state power.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case
involving the so-called Miranda warnings, and will ultimately
decide whether the 4th Circuit went too far.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, the high court issued its landmark Miranda decision
requiring police to inform suspects of their rights. Over the past
34 years, the Miranda warnings have become such a basic part of law
enforcement that just about anyone who watches TV cop shows can
recite them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, however, the 4th Circuit ruled that an obscure 1968
federal law effectively negated the 1966 Miranda decision.
</P>
<P>
   Legal scholars say the ruling is the latest and most startling
example of conservative 4th Circuit decisions that could
significantly reshape constitutional law.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are willing to test the boundaries of present U.S.
Supreme Court doctrine,'' said A.E. Dick Howard, a law professor at
the University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the appeals court's other conservative rulings have been
aimed at reining in federal power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999 it struck down a portion of the Violence Against Women
Act that allows victims of rape to sue their attackers for damages.
The appeals court ruled that Congress overreached when it justified
the law by citing the government's authority to regulate interstate
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   An appeal of that ruling, which stemmed from a Virginia Tech
student's attempt to sue two football players she accused of rape,
is pending before the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit, based in Richmond, hears appeals from Virginia,
Maryland, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, chief judge for the 13-member
court, declined an interview, saying it would be improper to talk
just days before the Supreme Court hears the Miranda case.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the 4th Circuit's Miranda decision was so surprising
was that neither party in the bank robbery case -- neither the U.S.
Justice Department nor the defendant -- focused on the 1968 federal
law, which says the presence or absence of a Miranda warning is
just one of several factors in deciding whether statements to
police were made voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the issue was raised in a friend-of-the-court brief by
the conservative Washington Legal Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some would say that's a bit of a stretch,'' Howard said.
''It's unusual.'' Typically, a court ''will confine itself to
questions argued by the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanna Sherry, a law professor at the University of Minnesota,
said the court's action was more than a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is an extreme case of ignoring the law to reach a
particular result,'' Sherry said. ''It seems to me pretty clear
that Miranda has to be a constitutional doctrine, and Congress
can't overrule it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Smolla, a law professor at the University of Richmond,
said the Miranda ruling is a prime example of how the 4th Circuit
delves deeply into disputes and does not automatically buy into the
legal precedents set by other, more liberal federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was more surprised hearing about it than I was when I
actually read the opinion and saw that it's arguably a very close
case on its merits -- and I'm a strong defender of Miranda,'' Smolla
said.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit's rulings limiting federal power have mostly
come on the heels of 1995 Supreme Court ruling that said Congress
exceeded its authority when it imposed harsher penalties on gun
possession near a school.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a cue from that ruling, the appeals court ruled in
separate cases in 1998 and 1999 that the government overstepped its
bounds in trying to bar states from selling lists of drivers and in
saying states cannot charge a fee for handicapped parking placards.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are part of a historic trend in this country,'' Howard
said. ''Ten or 15 years ago, nobody talked about the Tenth
Amendment,'' which reserves for the states all authority not
specifically given to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In another blow to federal power, the court -- which has seven
members appointed by Republican presidents, six by Democrats --
ruled the Food and Drug Administration lacked authority to regulate
nicotine as a drug. The Supreme Court upheld that decision last
month, as it has many other 4th Circuit rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are not often reversed,'' Howard said. ''I think that's
partly because the 4th Circuit is relatively conservative as the
Supreme Court is coming to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, the 4th Circuit goes too far for the Supreme
Court. In a departure from their recent states' rights rulings, the
justices in January unanimously reversed the appeals court on
driver's license lists.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Circuit's conservatism is also reflected in its record
on capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by Columbia University law professor James S.
Liebman found that federal appeals courts nationwide have granted
hearings for death row inmates in about 40 percent of cases, while
the figure for the 4th Circuit is less than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some who think of it as a hanging court,'' Howard
said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Unmoved by Gun Bills  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since the shooting deaths at Columbine High
School a year ago, members of Congress have introduced dozens of
gun control bills but not one of them has become law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a strong election-year incentive to get something
done and general agreement has been reached on several measures:
trigger locks, bans on high-capacity ammunition clips and a bar
against juveniles with criminal records possessing guns.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest and most elusive prize has been a package of gun
safety measures the Senate attached to a juvenile crime bill last
year. A House-Senate effort to work out a compromise has gone on
for more than six months with accusations of bad faith on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   The level of distrust was clear last week when House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., announced he was moving
toward President Clinton's position on the last big issue: how long
people at a gun show must wait on a background check before they
can buy a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But within hours Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking
Democrat on the committee, emphatically rejected the offer as
''further capitulation by the Republican leadership to the NRA's
political gamesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   For the National Rifle Association and pro-gun lawmakers, the
best legislation would be no legislation. Their argument is that
there are already more than 20,000 federal and state gun laws, and
the answer is better enforcement rather than more laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let us be clear,'' Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the
Judiciary panel's crime subcommittee, told his colleagues. Even if
trigger locks and other gun safety measures in the juvenile crime
bill were adopted, ''we would not really be getting at the problem
unless we are serious about enforcing the laws already on the
books.''
</P>
<P>
   But not even McCollum could resist putting a gun bill of his own
into the hopper.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he won House approval for a bill that would provide
$100 million in grants to states that impose five-year mandatory
minimum sentences, without parole, for anyone using a firearm
during a violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some 149 Democrats voted for it while complaining they weren't
allowed a vote on a bill by Conyers and gun control advocate
Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., to include money for enforcement plus gun
safety and gun show provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Among other bills introduced this month, Rep. Xavier Becerra,
D-Calif., has proposed an income tax credit for turning firearms in
to the police, and Rep. Steve Rothman, D-N.J., has put forth a plan
to help schools improve their security against students bringing
guns to class.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Carbone, director of congressional relations for Handgun
Control, recalled that when she joined the gun control advocacy
group a decade ago, she could put all the gun bill introductions on
one page. Last year the list ran to 11 pages with more than 85
bills. ''That shows how much interest there is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Carbone, bill introductions are useful, even if the bills
never get a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has to be a way to keep the issue out in the fore. Just
because they ignore us we are not going to go away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans other than McCollum have added their own gun
proposals: to allow for the expulsion of children with disabilities
who carry guns to school, to protect people's gun privacy and to
shield manufacturers from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But the great majority of gun bills originate with Democrats.
Other measures this year would: license gun show operators, crack
down on interstate gunrunning, make it illegal to keep a loaded gun
near a child, ban Saturday night specials, authorize lawsuits
against manufacturers and dealers, assist in gun buyback programs
and ban people under 21 from possessing handguns.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavs Battle To Save Wildlife  </HEADLINE>
By JAROSLAV PAP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BECEJ, Yugoslavia (AP) -- His arms cut and bruised, forest ranger
Laslo Kneht recounted Monday how he and others waded waist-deep
through flooded farmlands in northern Serbia, trying to save roe
deer and fawns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't even feel the antlers cutting my arms. All I could
see were the does' terrified eyes, their small bodies trembling
with fear and exhaustion,'' said the ranger, who said he rescued 36
deer on Sunday alone.
</P>
<P>
   The deer had run for miles trying to escape the rising waters of
the Tisza River, which last week engulfed northern Serbia and
flooded thousands of acres. In Becej, a town about 60 miles
northwest of the capital, Belgrade, 12,350 acres were underwater
and damage estimates rose to $740,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kneht said the deer rescue was a spontaneous response by the
community's hunters, gamekeepers and nature lovers. They succeeded
in saving 142 deer and 22 rabbits over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In deeper waters, the rangers set out in boats, trying to pull
out swimming deer and other wildlife. Once aboard the boats, the
animals were taken to nearby dams and sandbags, which were set up
as protection from the flooding. From there, the animals had free
access to dry ground.
</P>
<P>
   Kneht said he didn't know how much of the local wildlife died in
the floods, but two roe deer he plucked from the waters died from
exhaustion in his arms. The deer were completely disoriented by the
random swimming, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and residents of the area say they have been left on
their own to fight the floods, which also have inundated areas of
Hungary and Romania. Members of the opposition point to the fact
that Becej is run by local politicians critical of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic. They say that why no federal aid is
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Approached for help, federal authorities told local governments
to set aside 1 percent of taxes they collect to finance
flood-fighting efforts.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 129; Nasdaq Up 31  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices fluctuated on Wall Street today as a
battered stock market sought a direction after Friday's devastating
selloff. Major indexes alternated between positive and negative
territory, but the broader market was lower.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 129.37 at 10,435.14, having changed direction
several times since the session began.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which lost one quarter of its value
last week, was up 31.77 at 3,353.06. Earlier, the
technology-dominated measure had swung from an early 94-point drop
to a 133-point gain.
</P>
<P>
   But while investors initially showed renewed interest in many of
the big and popular companies that tumbled last week, the overall
bias was negative from the start, with declining issues
outnumbering advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the broad market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was encouraging to see signs of stability, especially
since foreign markets had tumbled overnight in reaction to Friday's
brutal slide on Wall Street, which sliced a record 617 points off
the Dow and a record 355 points off the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, worried that rising inflation and interest rates will
cut into company profits, investors began dumping stocks in just
about every sector of the market along with the speculative
high-flyers from the Internet boom. The Dow was left 12 percent
below its record high, while the Nasdaq fell to 34 percent below
the record it reached March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly helping sentiment today were some more strong profit
reports on the first three months of the year, this time from
Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Eastman Kodak and Ford Motor.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading measures, the Standard and Poor's 500 index
was down 8.90 at 1,347.66, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies was down 11.76 at 441.96.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 770.25 million shares, down slightly from
Friday's near-record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 6.98 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index fell 0.38 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 fell 2.97 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> Israel Won't Block Prisoner Release  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's Supreme Court on Monday upheld the
release of 13 Lebanese prisoners, but Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said he was considering legislation that would overrule the court's
authority and keep some of the prisoners in custody for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   A forum of top security ministers was to convene Tuesday to
discuss the legislation, Barak said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently reacting to Barak's announcement, the army canceled
plans to release the 13 late Tuesday morning. The court ruling
gives the army a Wednesday deadline for their release.
</P>
<P>
   The case has pitted the government against the Supreme Court,
which in recent months has outlawed tactics Israel has long used in
battles against Arab guerrillas and militants.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the court decided that Israel cannot hold detainees
as bargaining chips for Israeli navigator Ron Arad, who was shot
down and captured alive in Lebanon in 1986. That decision followed
a September ruling barring security services from using force while
interrogating Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Monday there was no legal basis to hear the
Lebanese prisoner case again, rejecting a petition from a group
called Terror Victims Association to convene a larger panel of
judges to discuss the case. That petition blocked the planned
release of 13 detainees Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Barak met with legal and parliamentary officials Monday to
discuss a bill that would put Lebanese prisoners held by Israel
under the authority of the defense minister -- a post Barak also
holds.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling does not apply to the two most prominent
prisoners Israel holds, Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid and Mustafa Dirani,
who have ties to Lebanese guerrilla groups. They are not among the
13.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israel television, Barak said that he would
probably not seek to block the release of the eight detainees who
signed the petition to the court. If he went ahead with
legislation, he said, it would apply only to Obeid, Dirani and the
five other detainees. It would be reasonable to keep them ''for a
few months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not explain the distinction, but it appeared aimed at
deflecting criticism -- including from within his own Cabinet -- that
his plan for a quick law designed to circumvent a court ruling was
fundamentally undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Rish, a lawyer for all 15 of the detainees, planned to
petition a Tel Aviv district court Tuesday for the release of Obeid
and Dirani.
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation, Rish said, would be a gross injustice to the
detainees, some of whom were captured 14 years ago as teen-agers
and all of whom are held without trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to believe that they're going to pass legislation
that will actually authorize holding hostages,'' Rish said.
</P>
<P>
   Two prominent ministers with strong human rights records, Police
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, said
they oppose legislation that will allow Israel to retain the 13
prisoners, but that Dirani and Obeid should remain in detention
because they are a threat to Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is under pressure from Arad's family and relatives of
other missing prisoners to find a way to keep the prisoners in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Perchia Heiman, whose brother Yehuda Katz disappeared during
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, said she understood the pain of
the Lebanese detainees' families, but that the prisoners were
Israel's only bargaining tool in negotiations to return the MIA's.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all victims of politics, us and them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was also Palestinian Prisoners Day, and four Palestinian
students were injured in clashes with Israeli soldiers during a
protest in Bethlehem. One was moderately injured and three others
were lightly injured.

<HEADLINE> Daughter in Nigeria tells mother ''you will never find me''  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A New Jersey girl left by her father in
Nigeria more than two years ago has written another letter saying
she wants to stay there, telling her mother ''you will never find
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an appellate panel ruled last week that Longy Anyanwu
is entitled to another court hearing on charges he has refused to
help return his daughter to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Anyanwu, a former computer sciences professor at Montclair State
University, has been jailed since August 1997 on contempt charges
for refusing to reveal the whereabouts of his two children, Uchechi
and Ogechi.
</P>
<P>
   Anyanwu's ex-wife, Edith, learned in 1998 that 11-year-old
Ogechi had died in Nigeria months earlier of malnutrition. Efforts
by the State Department to find Uchechi have been unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   But Anyanwu said Monday from the Morris County jail that Uchechi
has been living with his sister and brother-in-law in Lagos,
Nigeria. He said he has not written a letter requesting that
Nigerian authorities return her because ''it will offend my God
that I should tell lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyanwu, 50, argues that he is bound by a Nigerian court order
that granted custody of his two daughters to him when he and his
wife divorced, and not a New Jersey court order that granted
custody to his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that Superior Court Judge Herbert Friend had ordered
him to tell Nigerian authorities that he was not in jail, and
accused the state courts of ''racial supremacy'' by refusing to
respect his African culture.
</P>
<P>
   He said on Monday that he does not see an end to his
incarceration. ''The only thing that will make it end will be if my
life expires in jail,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Anyanwu, who had lived in Dover, mailed letters to The
Associated Press that he says 14-year-old Uchechi wrote to both him
and her mother.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, dated Jan. 18, Uchechi urged her mother to drop
her custody battle and accept Nigerian law.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daddy behaves like an Igbo man, not an American man,'' the
letter said. ''Nothing you can do can change that.''
</P>
<P>
   The girl said she would like to visit her mother in the future
but wants to finish school in Nigeria and eventually live with her
father.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how much you try to find and kidnap me, you will
never find me.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyanwu produced a letter by Uchechi expressing similar
sentiments in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   An appellate panel of Superior Court on Friday ordered a new
hearing on Anyanwu's case after Edith Anyanwu failed to respond to
Anyanwu's latest appeals. The panel said it wanted to determine
whether Edith Anyanwu still wanted her ex-husband to obey the court
order to locate her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Porro, the attorney for Edith Anyanwu, did not return a
telephone message on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian authorities have never produced the remains of Ogechi
Anyanwu, who had a rare intestinal disorder. Porro has said the
girl likely died because she did not receive adequate medical care
in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Anyanwu said he thinks the girl stopped eating
because she missed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was told that she was asking all the time to see her dad,''
Anyanwu said. ''The doctors said there was nothing they can do.''

<HEADLINE> Court: Baggage Squeeze OK Needed  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE ASSEO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police officers must get travelers' consent or
a court warrant before squeezing their luggage to see if drugs
might be inside, the Supreme Court ruled Monday in an expansion of
public transit passengers' privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border Patrol agent
who felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment ban on unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to
contain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Physically invasive inspection is simply more intrusive than
purely visual inspection,'' Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
wrote for the court. A bus passenger ''does not expect that other
passengers or bus employees will, as a matter of course, feel the
bag in an exploratory manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Police Organizations said it was
disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will directly impact the ability of federal and state law
enforcement officers, especially those near the U.S.-Mexico border,
to enforce effectively the nation's drug laws against those
carrying large amounts of narcotics on public transportation,''
said Robert T. Scully, executive director of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said government
lawyers were reviewing the decision and how it might affect law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The decision reverses the conspiracy and drug-possession
convictions of Steven Dewayne Bond, who was a passenger on a
Greyhound bus stopped at an immigration checkpoint in Sierra
Blanca, Texas. The bus was traveling from California to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   A Border Patrol agent checked the passengers' immigration
status, then felt their luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The agent squeezed a canvas bag in the bin over Bond's seat, and
the shape of a ''brick-like'' object inside led him to suspect it
contained drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The agent then got Bond's permission to open the bag and found,
wrapped inside a pair of pants, a brick-like object covered in
tape. Tests showed it contained methamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Bond asked a trial judge in 1997 to rule the drug could not be
used as evidence, contending the officer's squeezing of the bag was
an unlawful search. The Fourth Amendment generally prohibits
searches unless police have reason to believe they will find
evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled against Bond, and the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals agreed, saying he had given up any reasonable expectation
of privacy when he ''exposed'' the bag to the public by putting it
in the overhead bin.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said that was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist said Bond's case was different from two earlier cases
in which the court held that police observation of someone's
backyard or a greenhouse from a plane or helicopter did not amount
to a search. Those cases involved ''only visual'' observation, the
chief justice said.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Clarence Thomas and
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Antonin Scalia and Stephen G. Breyer dissented. Writing
for the two, Breyer said a police officer's squeezing of a bag was
no different from what other passengers might be expected to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''At worst, this case will deter law enforcement officers
searching for drugs near borders from using even the most
non-intrusive touch to help investigate publicly exposed bags,''
Breyer said. Travelers who want to safeguard the contents of their
luggage ''from public touch should plan to pack those contents in a
suitcase with hard sides.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Instability Warned  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The outgoing commander of NATO-led
troops in Kosovo warned Monday that Serb-Albanian tensions could
result in new fighting, this time outside the province where his
troops have kept a tenuous peace.
</P>
<P>
   Fears expressed by Gen. Klaus Reinhardt that tensions in and
around Kosovo's border with Serbia proper could jeopardize
stability 10 months after the 39,000 peacekeepers arrived in the
province were buttressed by reports of a recent grenade attack on a
Serb police post in a border region.
</P>
<P>
   Further fueling tensions, Yugoslavia accused the United States
of trying to destabilize the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans did not come to the Kosovo mission to help solve
problems, but to prepare Albanian separatists to extend terrorist
activities to the territory of the municipalities in southern
Serbia,'' said Tanjug, the state-run news agency that reflects the
thinking of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The agency claimed that the Americans have brought 250
''Albanian criminals'' and hundreds of additional ''terrorists'' to
the region in southeast Kosovo and were training them for attacks
on Serbs both within the province and in the border region just
southeast of it.
</P>
<P>
   A newly formed rebel group has emerged in the region, calling
itself the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac. The
group, which is named after three predominantly ethnic Albanian
towns just outside Kosovo in southern Serbia, is comprised of
fighters who say they are trying to protect villagers in the region
from attacks by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, 59, issued the warning at his final news
conference as commander of the NATO mission here. He formally hands
over responsibility for providing security in Kosovo to Spanish Lt.
Gen. Juan Ortuno on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ortuno, 60, is the commander of the European military bloc,
Eurocorps, which will run the Kosovo peacekeeping operation during
Ortuno's six-month mandate. It will be the first time a non-NATO
group has been selected for the task, although Eurocorps members
France, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg are also part of
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   One of Reinhardt's main recent worries has been the Presevo
Valley on the border with Serbia proper, the reputed stronghold of
the new ethnic Albanian rebel group modeled after the disbanded
Kosovo Liberation Army. Reinhardt expressed skepticism on Monday
that the group is bent on peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, when we see them training with mortars ... I do not
believe them,'' Reinhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt's concerns were underscored by reports of a grenade
attack on a Serb police checkpoint on the other side of the Kosovo
boundary, in Serbia proper. U.S. military officials declined to
comment on the report, saying it was outside Kosovo and thus
outside the area patrolled by U.S. peacekeepers.

<HEADLINE> 200 IMF Protesters Arrested in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dwindling band of protesters, facing a
steady rain and police reinforcements, failed to shut down
international finance meetings today but played havoc with the
workday life of downtown Washington. There were sporadic clashes
with riot-equipped police and scores of arrests.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, a standoff between police and protesters
along barricades near the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank buildings began to ebb as rains intensified. Police began
arresting the demonstrators peaceably in groups of a dozen or so,
arm in arm, which allowed them to make their point.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please stay calm. We respect your position,'' Terry Gainer,
the assistant chief of police, told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 demonstrators were arrested without incident and
loaded onto school buses. Police said they would be charged with
crossing a police line and unlawful assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters couldn't thwart the IMF and World Bank meetings, in
large part because authorities spirited most conference delegates
to the meeting site before daybreak.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic was disrupted as demonstrators filled several
downtown street intersections. And while there was no massive
traffic jam, the demonstrations did curtail some operations of the
federal government. Federal employees whose offices were in the
vicinity followed the advice of their bosses and stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   But the morning was troublesome for those who came into the
city; District of Columbia police, who brought in some National
Guard troops to assist in handling the crowds of protesters, fired
pepper spray to disperse demonstrators who were trying to storm
barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters donned gas masks and one policeman mistakenly
threw a tear gas canister, thinking it was a smoke device,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a convoy of delegates that got trapped by the crowds
and the officers were trying to get them out,'' said Police Chief
Charles Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Police said at least 90 people were arrested and loaded onto
buses, but the charges against them weren't immediately known.
Several hundred were arrested Saturday and a few dozen on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Others attempted to throw themselves at police vehicles today,
and their mood remained defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sent a message that business as usual will not happen at
these neocolonial, neoliberal institutions any more,'' said
Dorothee Benz, 35, of Brooklyn, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the protests were much smaller than those over the
weekend intended to disrupt the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund meetings.
</P>
<P>
   At midmorning, an organizer with a megaphone asked a gathering
at the Ellipse on the National Mall to separate into two groups --
one willing to be arrested, one not -- and a determined crowd set
out for a march through city streets that initially remained
peaceful. Tourists were seen snapping pictures and filming the
scene with videocameras.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, numbering perhaps 1,000, halted at an intersection
near the IMF, and police sprayed some with pepper spray as the
demonstrators pressed closer to the barricades. After several
hours, the standoff began to wind down as the peaceful arrests
began.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all agree not to rush the barricade,'' one organizer yelled
to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Anthony Williams said officials had anticipated ''some
ratcheting up'' of the confrontations with protesters as the day
wore on.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our intent is to keep this under control, to keep it peaceful
and to get through this,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to keep problems to a minimum, the federal
government closed its agencies in the potential protest zone, an
11-by-8-block swath east and west of the White House. Both the
federal and local governments encouraged all but essential workers
to stay home on leave.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the federal work force was on the job today, however.
Agencies closed included the departments of State, Interior,
Treasury and Commerce; the General Services Administration and the
Office of Personnel Management.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have any way of finding out how many people came
in,'' said Joseph Cowart, an OPM spokesman. ''This is a very rare
and very unusual occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous businesses in the area were closed for the day. A
beauty parlor located a block from the White House, The Andre
Chreky Salon, soldiered through Sunday's protests but finally cried
uncle at noon today, rescheduling afternoon clients for later in
the week before shuttering its doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had it. We're going home,'' a clerk there said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 70 National Guard personnel in camouflage gear took up
positions as reinforcements early today near the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund buildings in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, many more demonstrators paraded through the capital
in a show of celebration and anger, punctuated by occasional
confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Festive street theater with giant puppets coexisted with
confrontations between police trying to keep the streets open and
the finance meetings safe and protesters agitating about the plight
of the poor and ''decadence'' of the rich.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, police in riot gear and on motorcycles charged
into a crowd that had surged toward the police line. Police used
pepper spray and what they said were smoke bombs to drive back the
protesters, who were convinced they'd been tear-gassed.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters accused the World Bank and IMF of burdening poor
countries with crushing debt payments, unsafe food, environmental
destruction and sweatshops.
</P>
<P>
   Responded Michael Moore, director general of the World Trade
Organization: ''Blaming the World Bank for poverty is a bit like
blaming the Red Cross for starting World Wars I and II.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 169; Nasdaq Up 84  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Big-name stocks pushed higher again this
afternoon, but most shares remained lower in nervous trading
following last week's gut-wrenching freefall.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 169.08 at 10,474.85 after twice bouncing back from
negative territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, which lost one quarter of its value
last week, was up 84.39 at 3,405.68.
</P>
<P>
   But while investors were showing renewed interest in many of the
big and popular companies that tumbled last week, the overall bias
was negative, with declining issues outnumbering advancers by
nearly a 2-to-1 margin on the broad market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was encouraging to see signs of stability, especially
since foreign markets had tumbled overnight in reaction to Friday's
brutal slide on Wall Street, which sliced a record 617 points off
the Dow and a record 355 points off the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, worried that rising inflation and interest rates will
cut into company profits, investors began dumping stocks in just
about every sector of the market along with the speculative
high-flyers from the Internet boom. The Dow was left 12 percent
below its record high, while the Nasdaq fell to 34 percent below
the record it reached March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly helping sentiment today were some more strong profit
reports on the first three months of the year, this time from
Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Eastman Kodak and Ford Motor.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading measures, the Standard and Poor's 500 index
was up 22.39 at at 1,378.95, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies was down 6.01 at 447.71.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 915.95 million shares, down slightly from
Friday's near-record pace.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 6.98 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index fell 0.38 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 fell 2.97 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Russia Ready for START III Talks  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Top U.S. and Russian arms negotiators launched a
round of talks Monday for additional strategic arms cuts, made
possible by the Russian parliament's ratification of START II.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the two sides refused to go into detail about their
four hours of discussions beyond confirming that they took place in
Russian diplomatic quarters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But arms-control experts said the outcome could have
far-reaching impact if the two sides are able to break out of the
complex web of interrelated issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot depends on the deal the Americans and Russians can do on
missile defenses,'' said Patricia Lewis, director of the U.N.
Institute for Disarmament Research.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said progress in the talks could revive global disarmament
efforts on a broad front, especially involving other nuclear
countries, including China, India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day session comes after the Russian lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, ratified the START II treaty on Friday.
The upper house began considering the treaty Monday and is expected
to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   But an amendment to that accord is still pending in Washington.
And the two countries remain at odds over U.S. plans for a limited
missile defense system, which would require renegotiating the
landmark Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, three former U.S. negotiators warned Monday that
conservative Senate Republicans who want to jettison the ban on
missile defenses are undermining attempts to agree on START III.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the two sides toward rapid progress are President
Clinton's desire for a diplomatic success before he leaves office
and President Vladimir Putin's need to avoid burdening the Russian
economy with costs for armaments, said Daryl Kimball of a
Washington-based anti-nuclear group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia knows that the Clinton administration wants to reach an
agreement and is probably going to wait them out to the last days
of the Clinton administration to increase its negotiating
leverage,'' said Kimball, director of the Coalition to Reduce
Nuclear Dangers.
</P>
<P>
   START II would halve U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals to
3,000-3,500 warheads each. Under U.S. and Russian proposals a START
III treaty could cut each arsenal to as low as 1,500 strategic
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Geneva meeting, while billed as the formal inauguration of
START III talks, is a continuation of contacts that began last
summer after Clinton got a commitment from then-President Boris
Yeltsin to talk about ABM revision and reviving efforts to cut
strategic arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration maintains that Moscow should consider
deploying its own limited missile defense against attacks from
''rogue'' nations, but Moscow says the system would upset the
strategic balance and launch a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Conducting the two days of talks are Yuri Kapralov, head of the
Russian Foreign Ministry's arms control department, and John Holum,
the Clinton administration's key disarmament specialist. A second
round was planned for the U.S. Mission on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Tax Cuts Help Working Poor  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Flanked by single mothers and working
families, George W. Bush argued Monday that the real winners in his
$438 billion tax-cut package are those ''living on the outskirts of
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive GOP presidential nominee used a high school
appearance to rip into Democratic rival Al Gore on both taxes and
gun control, accusing the vice president of flip flops and a dearth
of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want four more years of Clinton-Gore, I'm not the right
guy,'' Bush declared in President Clinton's home state.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor used the focus on tax-filing deadline day to
argue that fewer issues offer a starker contrast with Gore than
taxes, and to claim that his package focuses on blue-collar
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejected the ''risky'' label Gore applies to his five-year
tax cut plan when he and other Democrats argue it would eat up too
much of the expected budget surplus and plunge the nation back into
deficit spending. He also dismissed critics who say his plan would
help the rich more.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's risky is overtaxing the people who work for a living in
America,'' said Bush, who criticized Gore for not convincing fellow
Democrats in Congress to get rid of the so-called tax marriage
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for Vice President Al Gore to stand up and show some
leadership,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued that troubling news on the stock market and economic
nervousness underscores the need for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you cut the taxes on people who work, it serves as an
insurance policy against economic downturn,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was pitching tax cuts, Bush got his biggest cheers
when he underscored his anti-abortion views during a question
session. He added, however, that ''people should be realistic''
about what can be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said there is insufficient support for a constitutional
amendment outlawing abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and
to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that people disagree,'' said Bush, who said he
backs the Republican Party platform's strict anti-abortion
language.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Thursday's anniversary of a bloody Columbine High
School shooting in Littleton, Colo., Bush also was questioned about
gun control and a Texas law allowing concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''This law has made Texas a safer place,'' Bush argued, noting
that when Tennessee adopted a similar law ''Al Gore was totally
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would sign a bill that mandated the sale of trigger locks
with guns,'' Bush added. ''It's one thing to have a trigger lock
sold with a gun, it's another thing to encourage people to use
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a distinct working class feel to Bush's campaign swing
Monday. He visited a town that's headquarters to the blue-collar
retailing giant Wal-Mart and toured a museum touting the company's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want tax relief to go to everybody ...,'' said Bush. ''Money
will go to people in families who are living on the outskirts of
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   In a high school gymnasium, packed with about 500 students and
adults, Bush was introduced by Kim Jenning, a single mother who
made $20,000 and said she would pay no taxes under Bush's plan,
saving $830.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, however, noted that the
richest 5 percent of Americans would get more than 50 percent of
the Bush tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign set up a Web site, allowing people who have
incomes of $100,000 or less to figure how much they would save with
Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC posted a rival Web site, ''millionairesforbush.com,''
that calculates the tax bill for people making $1 million or more.
''What a boon the Bush tax scheme is for the wealthiest
Americans,'' the DNC said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his tax-cut plan would spend barely a quarter of the
projected budget surplus over 10 years. Experts peg the cost of
Bush's tax plan at up to $1.3 trillion over 10 years, while
estimates of the projected budget surplus range from $900 billion
to $1.9 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   ''Al Gore believes the surplus is the government's money,'' said
Bush. ''I believe the surplus is the people's money.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor argued that big tax cuts of the 1980s -- which led
to record deficits -- are responsible for the current strong
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, back in Washington after a weekend fund-raising swing
through California, took the day off at home. His White House staff
circuitously picked their way through police checkpoints to report
to work on a day when much of the capital was shut down by
protesters outside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Assad Kin: Israel Peace Door Open  </HEADLINE>
By MAAMOUN YOUSSEF, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The door to peace with Israel is still open
and time has not run out for Syria and Israel to reach a
settlement, the son of Syrian President Hafez Assad was quoted
Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
   However, Bashar Assad -- who reportedly is being groomed to
succeed his father -- said Damascus will not give up its demand that
Israel return all of the Golan Heights, including a small patch of
land along the Sea of Galilee, according to Al Wasat, a
London-based weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Syria gained the land in raids in the early 1950s, but the
Israelis regard it as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue of land is an issue of sovereignty and dignity,''
Bashar told the Arabic-language magazine. ''Syria is not ready to
offer gifts of this kind. This is the leadership's stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Bashar's remarks come at a low point in the Mideast peace
process. Talks between Israel and Syria broke down in January over
Israel's refusal to give a prior commitment to withdraw from the
entire Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured in the 1967
Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton met with Assad in Geneva last month in an
unsuccessful effort to revive the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bashar said the pessimism that followed the Geneva summit was
unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The peace process has not stopped, and the door remains open
as long as efforts are continuing,'' Bashar said, according to Al
Wasat. ''Time has not run out.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israeli television on Monday, Barak said:
''We did not close the door, but the opening as I see it is very
narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing that could force Assad or the Syrian
government to make peace. I would only sign on a peace that will
strengthen the security of Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Assad's biographer, Patrick Seale, appealed in an
open letter to Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak to make
peace. His letter was published Monday in Al Wasat's sister daily,
Al Hayat.
</P>
<P>
   Seale, who is close to Assad and is believed to act as a
messenger between Israel and Syria, wrote that the Israelis need
reassurance that making peace with Syria is ''an acceptable
adventure'' and asked Assad to send the Israelis more signals of
his good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ''They do not trust Syria,'' Seale wrote. ''Before surrendering
such a valuable site like the Golan Heights they need to be
convinced of Syria's peaceful intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   Seale also wrote that Barak must remember that he accepted a
pledge made by the late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and later by
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres to withdraw from the entire
Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Assad is ready to meet you half way on other peace elements --
water, security, normalization and the withdrawal schedule -- but
not on land,'' Seale wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed to Barak to ''seize the opportunity offered by
history to renegotiate with Syria on the same basis that was
accepted by two Israeli elected governments.''
</P>
<P>
   Seale has traveled to Israel and Syria recently. He has proposed
in an Al-Hayat article that the Sea of Galilee remain under Israeli
sovereignty, but that the border be drawn along the water line,
giving Syria control of the northeastern shore.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Off on Wet Outlook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Forecasts for more rainy weather in the Midwest
this week sent grain and soybean futures lower Monday on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Soggy conditions are expected again in the central United States
starting later in the week from two more weather systems moving
toward the region, new forecasts showed.
</P>
<P>
   That further dampened enthusiasm for agricultural commodities,
which saw a runup in prices in late winter due to concerns that dry
soil conditions would have a detrimental effect on crops.
</P>
<P>
   Corn dipped lower on the bearish weather news, although the
decline was limited by continuing drier-than-usual conditions in
many growing areas. Only parts of Indiana and Ohio had normal
rainfall totals for the first half of April.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans also fell because of the forecasts, with the rebound in
U.S. stock markets helping to keep the decline minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat was pressured by the slide in corn along with increased
rain prospects for the winter wheat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for July delivery fell 2} cents to $2.65{ a bushel; May
corn fell 2{ cents to $2.32{ a bushel; July oats fell 1 cent to
$1.19{ a bushel; July soybeans fell { cent to $5.44 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures retreated in trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.

   June live cattle fell .38 cent to 68.97 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle fell .33 cent to 84.27 cents a pound; June lean hogs

<HEADLINE> Concerns Raised About Ephedra  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 38-year-old California man gulped his
usual two capsules of the herbal supplement ephedra with a cup of
coffee, then went on his daily jog. Later that morning, he dropped
dead from cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year-old apparently healthy ephedra user collapsed during
aerobics class with a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts say cases like these show a clear risk from the
herbal stimulant -- yet with millions of Americans taking the
supplements but reports of possible side effects in the hundreds,
just who's at risk is a major question.
</P>
<P>
   Do you need a checkup before popping the pills? Is taking
ephedra with caffeine or while vigorously exercising the problem?
Is it the dose?
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration is struggling to figure that
out. Heeding industry protests, the agency just dramatically scaled
back an attempt to regulate ephedra-containing dietary supplements.
Now, armed with 273 new reports of problems like the ones above,
the agency is grappling with whether the supplements at least need
warning labels.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a dilemma for FDA,'' said Dr. Neal Benowitz of the
University of California, San Francisco, who studied the issue for
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra poses ''serious risks to subsets of the population,''
Benowitz added. Until doctors spell that out more specifically,
consumers must ''know these are not totally benign substances.
They've got drugs in them. They've got serious side effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the issue further, a University of Arkansas study
to be published in next month's American Journal of Health-System
Pharmacy tested 20 different ephedra-containing supplements and
found half contained very different ephedra doses than the bottles
promised -- sometimes lots less, sometimes lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra, also known by the Chinese name ma huang, is the herbal
form of ephedrine, an amphetamine-like stimulant. Ephedrine is sold
in a few FDA-regulated over-the-counter asthma medications.
</P>
<P>
   But herbal ephedra is sold in 200 unregulated dietary
supplements, for weight loss, building muscle or boosting energy,
and occasionally in large doses as an ''herbal high.''
</P>
<P>
   Ephedra manufacturers insist that overall, the herb is safe.
After all, millions regularly use it without problem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in some people, ephedra is linked to anxiety, sleeplessness,
migraines, high blood pressure, seizures, irregular heartbeats,
heart attacks and strokes.
</P>
<P>
   It first made headlines when an otherwise healthy 20-year-old
college student died from ephedra in 1996. Ultimately, the FDA
cited 800 reports of side effects, including 44 deaths, and
proposed federal regulations to, among other things, slash the
legal dose.
</P>
<P>
   The dietary supplements industry furiously opposed the rules,
and Congress' General Accounting Office said last year that while
ephedra did seem risky to some people, the FDA's crackdown was
based on sloppy science. So the FDA backed off.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fight's back on: The FDA this month released 273
additional reports of side effects among ephedra users. Agency and
independent physicians combed medical records to determine how many
of the first 140 reports the herb really caused and how many were
coincidence. Resulting numbers vary, but all found some danger. Now
the FDA wants warning labels; it plans a public hearing this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, what should consumers know?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, people with heart disease or high blood pressure are at
risk from stimulants, including ephedra, Benowitz says. Other risk
factors: kidney or thyroid disease, a history of seizures, or
diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Warning labels could help such people, although Benowitz says
the California jogger apparently didn't realize he had seriously
blocked arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Six ephedra manufacturers who just formed the Ephedra Education
Council concede some risk: Unlike most companies, they have begun
using warning labels urging caution if consumers have such
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet council spokesman Theodore Farber contends if ephedra were
really dangerous, FDA-approved ephedrine for asthma would cause
problems, too.
</P>
<P>
   Benowitz responds that asthmatics can indeed suffer side
effects, but that far more people take ephedra supplements, for far
longer, without a doctor's care.
</P>
<P>
   And, he notes, some ephedra users with no obvious medical
problems, like that aerobics-loving stroke victim, suffer
reactions. Why? Nobody knows, but he has two suspicions: Many
ephedra supplements also contain a cup of coffee's worth of
caffeine, another stimulant, so a few capsules a day really rev
people up.
</P>
<P>
   Also, ''I'd be hesitant to have someone take this before a
really intense workout,'' he said, noting a number of serious side
effects occurred among exercising stimulant users.

<HEADLINE> Railroads Shielded From Lawsuits  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court gave railroads greater
protection Monday against being sued over allegedly inadequate
warning devices at rail crossings, the scenes of hundreds of fatal
accidents each year.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, voting 7-2 in a Tennessee case, said railroads are
not financially liable if the equipment installed at a grade-level
crossing was federally funded. The two dissenters said the decision
''defies common sense and sound policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has provided states with more than $3 billion since
1975 to increase safety at most of the nation's 170,000 public
grade-level crossings. During that time, the number of fatal
accidents at crossings has dropped from more than 1,500 per year to
431 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing prevents a state from revisiting the adequacy of
devices installed using federal funds,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote for the court. ''States are free to install more
protective devices at such crossings with their own funds or with
additional (federal) funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''What states cannot do -- once they have installed federally
funded devices at a particular crossing -- is hold the railroad
responsible for the adequacy of those devices,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision wiped out a $430,765 legal victory Dedra Shanklin
had won against Norfolk Southern Railway Co. after the Oct. 3,
1993, death of her husband, Eddie, whose car was struck by a train
at a crossing in Gibson County, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and various rail safety groups had
urged the court to rule otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rail safety has taken a serious blow,'' said Robert Pottroff,
a Manhattan, Kan., lawyer who represents such groups as Angels on
Track, Railwatch and the Coalition for Safer Crossings. ''Lives are
being lost. I can't believe Congress and the Federal Highway
Administration will allow this regulatory scheme to stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk Southern Railway spokesman Frank Brown called the
decision ''a good one'' that ''heads off second-guessing about the
adequacy of warning devices after they've been installed with
federal money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee crossing had a reflectorized sign but no gates or
flashing lights to signal a train's approach. Shanklin was driving
20 mph, and he apparently did not hear the train whistle because
his windows were rolled up and his radio was playing.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shanklin's lawsuit invoked a Tennessee law and accused the
railroad of negligently having failed to install adequate warning
devices. But the railroad's lawyers argued that the warning sign
had been erected under a state project approved and financed by the
Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected the railroad's contention that federal approval and
funding immunized it from negligence claims, but Monday's decision
reversed those rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the FHWA approved the project and the signs were
installed using federal funds, the federal standard for adequacy
displaced Tennessee statutory and common law addressing the same
subject, thereby pre-empting (Mrs. Shanklin's) claim,'' O'Connor
said.
</P>
<P>
   She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and John Paul Stevens dissented.
Writing for the two, Ginsburg said the ruling displaced state
negligence laws ''with no substantive federal standard of conduct
to fill the void. That outcome defies common sense and sound
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shanklin still may pursue other claims against Norfolk
Southern, such as alleging a failure to sound the train's horn soon
enough or failure to remove vegetation from the crossing.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich: Bush Campaign Not Ready  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- George W. Bush's staff of advisers are
''not quite up to speed yet'' in running a presidential campaign,
according to fellow Republican and former Speaker of the House Newt
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a sold-out audience Saturday night, Gingrich said
Bush's team ''still has a little bit of Austin in their style'' and
isn't fully prepared for a national operation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, in contrast, the team advising Vice President Al
Gore is ''a more professional and tougher team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore are all but certain to be the presidential
nominees this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also said first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had ''a
very good chance'' of beating New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
in the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were guessing right now, I would say she probably has the
edge to win,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a gasp from the audience when he further predicted that
she would then run for president in 2004 if Gore loses this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich made his comments at an event staged by the Richmond
Forum, a group that puts on several public forums on a variety of
subjects throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's topic was politics. Besides Gingrich, another speaker
was James Carville, the Democratic consultant who masterminded
President Clinton's 1992 campaign and has remained a staunch
Clinton defender. Carville described Bush as an inexperienced
candidate who can't say no.
</P>
<P>
   His program to spend billions of dollars on politically popular
programs while cutting taxes and preserving Social Security would
lead the country down another path of massive budget deficits and
stifle the economy, Carville said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich countered that tax cuts would keep the economy growing
and added that if the taxpayers' money is left in Washington, ''the
politicians will spend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men agreed that the presidential election will be won in
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody's coming to Virginia other than to raise money,''
Carville said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers: Mugabe Vows Land Crisis End  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe abruptly
summoned white farm leaders to his office Monday and promised to
personally intervene to end the violent crisis over the occupation
of white-owned farms, the farmers said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1{ hour meeting on the eve of Zimbabwe's 20th
anniversary of independence, Mugabe said he would work ''to get
things back to normality,'' said Tim Henwood, head of the
Commercial Farmers Union, which represents white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The official state news agency confirmed Mugabe's first meeting
with farm union officials since the occupations began two months
ago. But government officials declined to comment on the talks, and
it was unclear whether Mugabe's reported promise marked a reversal
of his stance on the thousands of armed black squatters who have
occupied more than 900 white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Mugabe has backed the occupations, arguing they are a
justified protest against unequal distribution of land in a country
where 4,000 white farmers own one-third of the productive farmland.
On Sunday, he insisted he would not order supporters to vacate the
farms and urged them to defend themselves from opponents and ''hit
back wildly.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's speech Sunday came hours after the killing of farmer
David Stevens, a known supporter of the Movement for Democratic
Change, the main opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   The state news agency reported that police were searching for
suspects in Stevens' killing and the beatings of five other white
farmers. The other farmers had been abducted from a police station
near the Macheke farming district, 75 miles east of Harare, on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Henwood said the president expressed regret over Stevens' death.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps the death of David Stevens has been a final catalyst
to get some activity to restore law and order in our country,''
Henwood said. ''There's been a major change. I have every assurance
from the highest voice in the land.''
</P>
<P>
   The violence Saturday, including the killing of two black
opposition party officials in a firebomb attack, escalated the
crisis that has convulsed this former British colony. About 80
farmers and their families evacuated from the Macheke district said
Monday they would not return until their safety was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The land occupations began Feb. 16, the day after the government
suffered a crushing electoral defeat in a constitutional
referendum. Part of the rejected constitution would have let the
government seize white-owned farms without paying compensation, a
law ruling party legislators passed anyway on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders said Mugabe planned the occupations as a
political ploy to rally support for his party ahead of
parliamentary elections expected to be held in May. David Hasluck,
a senior farmers' union official, said the union has evidence that
a top Mugabe aide, Provincial Governor Border Gezi, toured northern
Zimbabwe arranging for supporters to move onto white-owned land
after the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Kay, whose husband, Ian, was one of the farmers bludgeoned
by abductors, said his assailants openly boasted of their
allegiance to the ruling party. Her husband was targeted as an
outspoken opposition supporter, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Henwood, Mugabe said Monday that white farmers'
opposition to the February referendum suggested they were fighting
land reform with new vigor. Mugabe said his supporters ''have taken
umbrage to that. He felt that was part of the reason war veterans
became aggressive,'' Henwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe was scheduled to meet later Monday with Chenjerai Hunzvi,
militant leader of an association of veterans of the war that led
to independence from white rule in 1980. The group claims to have
led the farm occupations to complete the ''unfinished business'' of
the independence war.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rep. Visits Baghdad Hospital  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. Representative Tony Hall stroked the
heads of malnourished Iraqi children and expressed concern at the
lack of medicines in the pharmacy as he toured a pediatric hospital
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''How old is he?'' Hall asked a woman weeping by the side of her
sick son's bed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My boy can hardly breathe and he is so thin he cannot walk,''
said the woman, Amal Abass, 35.
</P>
<P>
   Though 2 years old, Hayder Abdulwahab, cannot stand on his feet.
Doctors said both he and his mother were deprived of vitamins and
nutrients needed for normal growth.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, D-Ohio, arrived Sunday to investigate the plight of Iraqi
people under nearly 10 years of U.N. sanctions. He is one of very
few U.S. Congressmen to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War over
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
Iraq says about 1.2 million people have died, including some
750,000 children under age 5, because of malnutrition, lack of
medicines and other shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to get a feeling ... is the food and medicine not
getting through? What's the end problem? What's the hang-up and
what can I do to make things better,'' Hall told reporters. He
plans to report his findings to the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq blames the shortages on the sanctions but the United States
and Britain are skeptical and say President Saddam Hussein's
government must share the blame by not fulfilling U.N. Security
Council resolutions that would lead to the lifting of the
sanctions. The U.S. government also accuses Saddam of squandering
money on luxuries for himself and his officials and ignoring the
plight of his people.
</P>
<P>
   Hall has said that his four-day visit is purely humanitarian and
not aimed at discussing the disputes between the Iraqi and U.S.
governments. He has refused to comment on the sanctions, describing
them as a ''very complex issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Iraq put its hostility aside Monday as Hall was warmly received
by Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak and other senior Iraqi
health officials.
</P>
<P>
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Mubarak told Hall of the
difficulties Iraq faces in getting medicines and medical supplies.
It did not say how Hall responded.
</P>
<P>
   The two later toured the Saddam Medical Complex in Baghdad, the
best medical facility in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   After touring the hospital pharmacy, Hall said: ''There is no
question that there are hardly any drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one visit to a hospital was not enough to formulate an
opinion. More trips, including a tour of the south, will give him
''an understanding of why so many children are sick, he said.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Block Key Bolivian Road  </HEADLINE>
By PETER McFARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Coca leaf farmers blocked a key road and
scuffled with truckers Monday in a protest against government plans
to destroy illegal coca plantations.
</P>
<P>
   The peasants' blockade follows violent nationwide protests a
week earlier, which led the government to severely curtail
constitutional guarantees and give security forces a freer rein to
crack down. The restrictions are still in effect, although the
original protests have ended.
</P>
<P>
   The government said cocaine traffickers were behind Monday's
protest by coca leaf farmers. Coca leaf is used to make cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of soldiers and police were on hand, but did not
immediately move in to clear the roadblocks on the road linking
Bolivia's highlands with the tropical lowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Some clashes broke out between the coca farmers and truck
drivers trying to bring coffee, lemons, oranges and other produce
into La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   The roadblocks were set up at the Yungas, a lush tropical region
some 130 miles east of La Paz. Large quantities of produce from the
region had rotted as result of the roadblocks set up during last
week's protests.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of coca leaf growers, Jose Montevilla, said the
roadblocks will continue until the government suspends plans to
eradicate coca leaf plants in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia's anti-narcotic law allows for the cultivation of about
30,000 acres of coca plants to supply traditional markets that
include coca tea and chewing. Coca leaf fields beyond that area are
considered illegal and subject to destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The government estimates there are nearly 5,000 acres of illegal
fields in the Yungas and plans to destroy them this year, as part
of its fight against the cocaine industry.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Banzer has vowed Bolivia will no longer produce
illegal coca and cocaine within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Minister Walter Guiteras said cocaine traffickers are
behind the protests in the Yungas and are seeking ''to create
conditions of instability for the government and democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The destruction in recent years of more than two-thirds of coca
leaf production in the Chapare, an area east of Yungas that fed the
cocaine industry, has deprived thousands of peasants of their sole
source of income.
</P>
<P>
   The protests last week by peasants and workers were triggered by
an increase in water rates in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest
city, and by an economic crisis affecting South America's poorest
country. The Cochabamba region was particularly affected by the
eradication of coca plantations.

<HEADLINE> German Cops Arrest Eight Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Eight neo-Nazis have been arrested as
suspects in the arson attack on a home for foreigners and the poor
near Munich, prosecutors said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the group have admitted to the attack in Dorfen and face
possible attempted murder and arson charges, prosecutor Helmut
Kobor said.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the suspects aged 17 to 19 were kicked out
of a youth center in Dorfen on Saturday for singing a Nazi anthem.
The main suspect, a 17-year-old in the group, also beat up another
visitor to the center.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking revenge, authorities said the group first considered
setting fire to the youth center, but didn't because too many
people were gathered outside. Instead, they went to the nearby home
where 19 residents were staying.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old splashed a canister of gasoline on the entrance
of the house and through a window and set it on fire, police
spokesman Chris Maier said.
</P>
<P>
   It was only through luck that the residents quickly noticed and
extinguished the flames, Maier said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in another incident of anti-foreigner violence late
Sunday, a youth with a group of others shouted insults and attacked
a 27-year-old man from Cameroon in the town of Neustadt-Dosse in
eastern Brandenburg state, police said. The African asylum seeker
was treated by a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were investigating but had no suspects.

<HEADLINE> Laptop With Classified Info Missing  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Officials are investigating the disappearance
from the State Department two months ago of a laptop computer that
contained highly sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   The department and the FBI are conducting the investigation
concerning the laptop, which a State official said was shared by
several officials.
</P>
<P>
   After The Washington Post reported on the disappearance Monday,
Chairman Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., of the House International
Relations Committee, said he plans to hold hearings next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The missing laptop is the latest in a long string of security
failures at the State Department,'' Gilman said. ''It is obvious
that the department lacks a professional environment that is
sensitive to security concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Post said the computer vanished from a supposedly secure
conference room in the department's Bureau of Intelligence and
Research.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, quoting a person familiar with the incident, said
the missing computer contained ''code word'' information, a
classification higher than top secret. It also contained
intelligence information and plans, the person was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the protection of
classified materials is a top priority of the department.
</P>
<P>
   ''The safeguarding of sensitive information is the personal
responsibility of every employee in every bureau,'' he said. ''It
is critically important to the U.S. national security that our
employees take this responsibility seriously and take the necessary
steps to protect this information.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilman noted that the Bureau of Intelligence and Research was
found by the State Department's inspector general last year to be
''not in compliance'' with many department security procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, the department expelled a Russian diplomat,
Stanislav Borisovich Gusev, who was accused of gathering
information from the department with an eavesdropping device.
</P>
<P>
   An internal department audit, issued in December, found that the
department let visitors, contractors and maintenance workers roam
the building unescorted.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman also recalled that in 1998, a man walked into the office
of the executive secretary to the secretary of state and removed a
sheaf of papers.
</P>
<P>
   The man and the papers were never found, Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Assistant Secretary of State David Carpenter, who
heads the diplomatic security office, is leading a review of
security issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The review began in March and is expected to be completed
shortly,'' Rubin said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODBRIDGE, N.J. (AP) -- Assembly lines are humming in Michigan.
Slot machines are cranking in Illinois. And business is cooking for
Helen Ventrillo at her Cookie Jar Bakery in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But a booming economy is not enough for a small-town baker or
for millions of Americans deciding whom to back for president. They
want a leader they can trust in trying times.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all want better schools and lower taxes and cheaper health
care. But what we need -- what this country needs -- is a man or
woman with some integrity,'' said Ventrillo, a small, dark-haired
woman covered in doughnut powder. She gazed out her storefront
window, where scraps of paper danced at the feet of passers-by, and
pointed to a school across the bustling street.
</P>
<P>
   ''What our kids really need are better role models,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Evenly matched in their campaign for the 270 electoral votes
needed for victory, Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush
will wage their toughest fights in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan and Illinois -- a slice of America's industrial heartland
that traditionally swings between the two major parties.
</P>
<P>
   The road to 270 leads from a cornbeef-and-beer bar in Joliet,
Ill., where good times seem a temporary condition, to ''The
Flapjack'' diner in gritty Lansing, Mich., where a mother frets
about her child's safety, to a wind-chilled school parking lot
outside Cleveland, where suburban parents bicker about politics, to
a two-pump gas station in rural Pennsylvania, where the owner is
missing his teeth but not his political senses, and to Ventrillo's
bakery, now serving opinions as strong as her coffee.
</P>
<P>
   An Associated Press reporter and photographer logged 1,300 miles
through the battleground states and talked with more than 100
Americans not affiliated with either party -- swing voters who will
help determine whether Bush or Gore claims the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The result: snapshots of an unsettled electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Rita Ganzini Falzone and Toni Gideon are dropping off their
children at St. Louis School, a dirty-yellow brick structure that,
set on a wooded lot in suburban Cleveland, looks more like a
college campus than a Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe a word Gore says,'' says Gideon, a lawyer who
tends to support Republicans more than Democrats. Dressed for work,
she holds her black overcoat closed against a bitter wind.
</P>
<P>
   ''... and I can't stand Bush,'' says Falzone, who works at a
public relations firm. She tends to back Democrats, but has voted
for GOP candidates. Holding two fingers an inch apart, she says,
''I don't trust that Texan this much.''
</P>
<P>
   The mothers are nodding their heads in unison. The tall, slender
Gideon and her smaller friend are opposites in many ways, but alike
in one respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not voting out of love,'' Gideon says. ''We're voting
because we despise one guy a little less than the other.'' Six out
of 10 independent voters tell pollsters they are dissatisfied with
their choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need virtue. Like it was years ago -- or at least how we
remember it years ago,'' Gideon says. ''Bring somebody on with
virtue and we'll flock to him. Democrats. Republicans.
Independents.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Rising out of the Des Plaines River like a white whale, the
''Northern Star'' is a hulking riverboat housing Harrah's Casino in
Joliet, Ill. The gambling industry helped revive the blue-collar
city from its economic stupor in the early 1990s, and employs Norma
Reyna as a data entry clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll probably vote for Gore, but I have to say the president's
impeachment has changed the way I look at things,'' says Reyna, 30,
her black hair pulled into a ponytail as she stands in the boat's
long shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Moral values are a top priority of voters this year, according
to polls. ''I'm looking for the character of the man more than
anything when I choose,'' Reyna says.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   A string of white Christmas lights decorate the bar inside
Central Grill, located a few blocks from the Joliet casino and
across the street from the county courthouse. Clay Johnson, 46, and
Cindy Lohmar, 39, eat lunch here once a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The economy scares me. There's bound to be a change,'' says
Lohmar, toying with one of the empty Pepsi cans on their table.
From her seat, she can see the courthouse, where she works as a
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other shoe is going to drop,'' agrees Johnson, an
electrical contractor with a half-buttoned blue-flannel shirt over
his white T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of Americans are telling pollsters they think
the country is moving in the wrong direction; independent voters
express the greatest concern. Stock market volatility, school
shootings and rising gas prices fuel the anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Gov. John Engler remembers when his constituents only
talked about the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in this era of full employment, voters have broadened their
outlook -- school safety, retirement security and deeper social ills
are the talk of Michigan towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are satisfied with the economy, but they also
understand there is more to life than a check,'' says Engler. From
the window outside his downtown Detroit office, the governor can
see a mist shrouding the Ambassador Bridge leading to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ''Americans now have time to worry about the culture. There is a
belief that there are a set of standards for communities and a
nation that have been debased,'' the Republican says.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The ''Hearty Breakfast'' special at The Flapjack is $5.85, tax
and tip not included. Steven Sylvertooth, 40, and Robin Thompson,
35, are finishing off their eggs and talking politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The unemployment rate and the economy is doing well around
here,'' says Sylvertooth, a physical therapist's assistant who
drove past a booming auto parts plant and two crowded strip malls
on his way to the pancake house in Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The subject is abruptly dropped when Thompson's daughter,
14-year-old Tanish, is asked about school. Somebody brought a bomb
the other day, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I don't feel in danger at school. I don't worry about any
of that,'' Tanish tells her mother, a nursing assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all I worry about,'' the mother replies, turning to the
reporter and wagging her finger. ''Write that down in your book and
bring it back to Washington.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A knit hat pulled down over his ears, James Walker sits alone at
a crowded bus stop in suburban Detroit. He's hard to miss, the only
black man in sight.
</P>
<P>
   An Internet site developer and college student, Walker believes
that Americans are too busy chasing money to realize that the
country has lost its moral bearings. Poverty chokes the streets,
scandal smothers Washington -- and nobody seems to care.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't clean up our act until Washington cleans up its
act,'' says the 25-year-old who says he may vote for the
Libertarian candidate.

   The road takes a sharp turn headed out of Franklin, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   After passing a red-brick courthouse and a row of low-slung
downtown shops, look for a tiny gas station on the left. It's the
one with a gravel drive, two rickety pumps and a bathroom open to
the public with a sign on the door that says ''Not open to the
public.''

   Owner Floyd Collins is a gap-toothed, self-described ''simple

this day, Floyd Collins Inc. is dressed in a green-and-blue checked

company.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who's my pick for president?'' he says. ''I'll tell you who it
isn't. It's not Gore. It's not Bush. I'll make it simple and vote
for whoever it is I don't recognize on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd trust a no-name before I'd trust them two boys running
now,'' says Floyd Collins Inc.

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeks Income Tax Extension  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush earned an
estimated $1.3 million last year and paid $514,000 in taxes,
according to a statement his campaign released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife Laura donated $210,000 to churches and
charities, including the $130,000 in royalties from Bush's
autobiography, ''A Charge to Keep.'' Royalties from the book were
earmarked for scouting and other groups working with youth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's income includes his $115,345 salary as governor, and
investment income from state and federal blind trusts in his name.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign said copies of his tax returns were not released
because of a complex financial picture for Bush because of the
blind trusts. Executives of those trusts prepare tax returns
independently and then provide the Bush family with a copy.
</P>
<P>
   No tax return has been delivered and ''therefore the campaign
assumes an extension has been filed, as has been the case in
previous years because information from the state trust is not
available until later in the year,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the country, Monday was tax filing day because April
15 fell on a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vice President Al Gore disclosed that he and wife
Tipper paid $59,178 in income taxes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores reported adjusted gross income of $240,792, placing
them in the top 2 percent income bracket. The figure includes the
vice president's salary of $175,400.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's income of $1.3 million was an estimate provided his
accountant, the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal financial disclosure report filed in May, Bush said
he owned $7 million in U.S. Treasury notes and estimated the blind
trust's worth at $1 million. He had two money market accounts worth
up to $1.25 million each.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Bushes paid $3.7 million in taxes on an estimated
income of $18.4 million, the bulk of which came from the sale of
Bush's interest in the Texas Rangers baseball team.

<HEADLINE> 500 IMF Protesters Arrested in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police clubbed defiant demonstrators and
dispersed them with pepper spray outside world finance meetings
Monday, but then -- in a grace note near the end -- the three days of
confrontations wound down with negotiated arrests. ''Give
yourselves a hand,'' a police official told protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, their ranks thinned in a driving rain,
disrupted the government's workday and private business in a big
swath of the capital but failed to shut down the two days of
meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   A day that began with swinging clubs turned more amicable as
police and the throngs they were watching orchestrated a
good-natured arrest of several hundred who wanted to be taken into
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Police negotiated for an hour with protest organizer Mary Bull,
who wore a plastic foam tree on her head, before proceeding with
the arrests. ''Give yourselves a hand,'' Terry Gainer, executive
assistant police chief, told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He gave Bull some flowers and then placed her under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were charged with unlawful assembly and crossing
police barricades. About 500 were arrested Monday, not all so
peacefully, making a total of more than 1,000 for the three days of
protests.
</P>
<P>
   ''We view this as a total success,'' said Robert Weissman,
co-director of Essential Action, one of hundreds of groups in the
protest coalition. ''We have shined the light on these institutions
as never before in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, drum-beating marchers vented their fury about the
treatment of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   They accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing debts on poor
nations, destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of
other ills. ''World Bank destroys tropical rain forest,'' said a
two story-banner hung on a building under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike demonstrations Sunday when police let protesters take
over empty streets, confrontations developed Monday over the din of
traffic as Washingtonians went to work.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic was disrupted and some government buildings and shops
never opened. When several hundred demonstrators came within a
block of the IMF and menaced a police car, black clad officers with
helmets, billy clubs and visors responded with pepper spray and
smoke canisters.
</P>
<P>
   Tear gas wafted into the crowd as an officer tossed what he
mistakenly thought was a smoke canister, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, some donning gas masks and tying bandanas over their
mouths, were chased down, clubbed and about 90 were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some protesters credited police with being more
restrained than during the destructive demonstrations in Seattle
against the World Trade Organization last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police seem to be doing a much more stable job than the
Darth Vader mode in Seattle,'' said a drenched actress-activist
Susan Sarandon, who spoke to the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   While many streets were normal, parts of the capital resembled a
city facing a coup d'etat.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police with their visors down marched up main streets in
squads of a dozen, blocks were sealed with metal barriers and about
70 National Guard troops in camouflage guarded the World Bank and
IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Signs, banners, T-shirts and shouted slogans carried a long list
of complaints against the two institutions, where finance ministers
managed to get their business done.
</P>
<P>
   World Bank spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the
meetings felt ''bewilderment and surprise at the degree of anger''
outside. She said the officials were talking about ways to relieve
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegates were spirited to work before sunrise. ''I
certainly protested myself this morning at 4 a.m. when the alarm
went off,'' said Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Charles Ramsey showed off a collection of material
he said had been seized from protesters, including rocks, nails, a
slingshot and urine and bleach that he said were meant to be thrown
in the faces of officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They call it the Seattle facial,'' Ramsey said of the bleach.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the outset that demonstrators knew they faced
arrest. An organizer with a megaphone asked a gathering at the
Ellipse in back of the White House to separate into two groups --
one willing to be arrested, one not. A determined group was willing
and marched onto the streets.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainians Vote on Kuchma's Power  </HEADLINE>
By MARINA SYSOYEVA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Voters have given Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma a strong mandate to expand his control over an unruly
parliament, but the vote alone does not ensure the president a
decisive victory in his power struggle with legislators.
</P>
<P>
   During a Sunday referendum, voters here gave overwhelming
approval to four Kuchma proposals that would alter parliament,
results showed Monday. The proposals, though, still must pass
parliament itself -- and if that approval is withheld, it could
ignite a deep political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum was intended to resolve a long-standing conflict
here between supporters of liberal economic reforms and those
nostalgic for more stable Soviet times and state controls. The
parliament, or Verkhovna Rada, was dominated by Ukraine's Communist
Party until earlier this year, while Kuchma has supported
IMF-sponsored reform efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum called for trimming the 540-seat Rada to a
300-seat assembly with two houses -- one composed of nationally
elected candidates and the other of appointed municipal and
regional officials. It also asked voters if they want to remove
deputies' legal immunity and give the president the right to
disband parliament in certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 100 percent of the 29.5 million ballots counted,
support for the four questions hovered at between 81.8 and 89.9
percent Monday, said Mykhailo Riabets, chairman of the Central
Election Commission. Initial voter turnout figures were an
unexpectedly high 78.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma initiated the referendum in January after years of
feuding with the parliament. Although a new pro-government majority
has been created in parliament, Kuchma insists it is not stable
enough to help Ukraine overcome its post-Soviet economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum is just a first step: Each question must pass the
Rada as a constitutional amendment. Analysts say parliament is
unlikely to pass all the amendments, and Kuchma has indicated he
might disband the legislature if it fails to approve the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people's will must not only be honored but implemented as
well,'' Kuchma told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Similar standoffs led former Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
forcefully dissolve his country's Supreme Soviet in October 1993
and Belarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko to
disband his parliament and vastly expand his powers in a November
1996 referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Political opponents say Kuchma is trying to create a pocket
parliament, and some accuse him of seeking dictatorial powers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time will show what are the real intentions of the president
and his circle,'' said Socialist Party leader Oleksandr Moroz, a
Kuchma rival.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Stabilize in New York  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index and the Dow
industrials both rose more than 200 points in a late-session rally
today after fluctuating throughout a tentative session on Wall
Street. The Nasdaq achieved its biggest one-day point gain one
session after its biggest point drop, but the overall market still
fell as investors remained highly cautious following last week's
devastating selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq changed direction throughout the day before closing
up 218.37 at 3,539.66, according to preliminary calculations. The
advance, which surpassed its previous one-day record gain of 178.89
on April 7, followed the index's record 355.49-point plunge on
Friday. The 6.6 percent rise in Nasdaq was second only to the 7.3
percent of Oct. 21, 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, which reversed course several times today, gained
276.74 to 10,582.51, regaining some of the 617.78 points it lost on
Friday in the blue chips' biggest point drop on record.
</P>
<P>
   The advance in both indexes was a welcome sign of possible
stability after last week's losses, which slashed nearly $2
trillion from the stock market's value and one-quarter of the
Nasdaq's value. But with five stocks falling for every three that
rose today on the broader stock market, it was too early to tell if
Wall Street was squarely on the way to recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street had been expected to decline today as investors are
extremely wary after last week's debacle. Still, the fact that
investors were interested in buying at all was a positive sign,
although they were focusing on big-name stocks, those believed to
be the most stable.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas markets closed lower, including a nearly 7 percent drop
in Tokyo, as traders reacted to Friday's plunge in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Europe's largest stock market, the FTSE 100 index of
Britain's largest companies fell nearly 3 percent on the London
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's DAX blue-chip index fell nearly 0.4 percent. In Paris,
the CAC 40 index of leading shares was down 0.09 percent from
Friday's close. Both indexes recovered from earlier heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Japan's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
nearly 9 percent before closing with a loss of 1,426.04 points, or
6.98 percent, at 19,008.64. It was the fifth-largest percentage
drop in the Nikkei's history.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tokyo close today, ruling coalition policy chiefs
agreed to recommend pumping up to 1 trillion yen, or $9.7 billion,
in public funds into the stock market if it continues to plunge.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index finished with its second-worst
one-day point loss in history, falling 8.55 percent, to 14,762.37.
In Singapore, the Straits Times Index closed 8.69 percent lower at
1,999.39.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to their Asian counterparts, investors in Europe
appeared to be somewhat less fearful that Wall Street's bull market
might finally have expired.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Meet Putin in June  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Arms control, economic reforms and
Russia's offensive in Chechnya will highlight talks between
President Clinton and Russia's new president in early June during a
two-day meeting in Moscow, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will be in Moscow June 4-5 to meet with President
Vladimir Putin and then will travel on to Kiev, Ukraine, on June 6,
according to the announcement released Monday in East Palo Alto
where Clinton was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president and President Putin spoke some time ago and
agreed that it was important to keep up regular meetings,'' White
House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said in Washington. They will
discuss such issues as economic and political reform and the
promotion of democracy, he said. ''Arms control will be an
important issue, and I expect they'll also discuss Chechnya.''
</P>
<P>
   The stops in Russia and Ukraine will come at the end of a trip
that will include Portugal and Germany. The president will be in
Portugal May 30 through June 1 for a regularly scheduled meeting
with European Union leaders and an official visit to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he will go to Berlin for still another meeting, June
2-3, with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and leaders from
Argentina, Brazil, Britain, Chile, France, Israel, Italy, South
Africa, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will pick up the prestigious Charlemagne prize in
Aachen.

<HEADLINE> McCain Meets With Jesse Ventura  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY H. GRANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- John McCain said again Monday that no one
-- not even Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura -- will entice him to run
for president as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not leave the Republican Party,'' McCain said during a
news conference at the Mall of America. ''The Republican Party is
my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who has said he's unlikely to endorse Al Gore or George
W. Bush, the likely Democratic and Republican presidential
nominees, has said McCain could win if he ran as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   Not likely, said McCain, who was also at the shopping mall to
sign copies of his best-selling memoir, ''Faith of My Fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not considering that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Ventura have talked several times by phone, but had
never met in person. A brief face-to-face meeting was scheduled,
presumably to discuss their old Navy days and wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a mediocre high school and college wrestler,'' said
McCain, R-Ariz. ''And I used to wear a feather boa around the
Senate sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both also have pushed for campaign finance reform, and McCain
said he would like to work with Ventura on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But that's where the similarities end, McCain said, brushing off
questions about whether he had modeled his presidential campaign
after Ventura's nontraditional campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''While I was winning, I think perhaps the governor took more
credit for my campaign than when I lost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura had questioned why McCain would only ''suspend'' his
campaign if he really was done for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going to happen there? I don't know,'' Ventura said
Friday during his weekly radio show. ''It ought to be pretty
interesting. Maybe we'll get some insight into whether he's truly
out of this race because we know he has only suspended his
campaign, and that always gives you a little bit of suspicion
there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he decided to suspend rather than end the campaign
so that supporters -- who back campaign finance reform -- could still
serve as delegates at the national GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added, ''I do not have any intention of causing
problems at the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, McCain said he would continue spreading his
message of reform.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Phone Plan Builds on Program  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   President Clinton's proposal to bring $1-a-month
phone service
to American Indians would build on an existing federal program that
keeps connections cheap for low-income families.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton, along with William Kennard, head of the Federal
Communications Commission, announced a plan Monday to boost by $17
million the Lifeline program, which provides discounts on phone
bills to make those services affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the $500 million program assists 5.6 million eligible
Americans, bringing down the cost of their phone service by as much
as $7.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are collected from telecommunications carriers who
provide interstate and international services. The companies
typically pass these costs on to consumers as line-item charges on
their phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials estimate that the increase in the fund -- meant to
bring down the costs of phone service for 300,000 American Indian
households -- would result in a small increase for phone customers.
For example, someone with a $25 monthly long-distance bill would
pay an additional penny for the program, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, this summer the FCC proposed spending more money to
entice phone and wireless carriers to expand their services to
underserved areas such as American Indian reservations. The
commission is also considering such steps as giving wireless
companies discounted licenses to expand their services.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 95 percent of all American homes have
telephones, in American Indian homes this number is closer to half,
according to federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   A report in April by the Benton Foundation, a nonprofit public
policy group, found that on some reservations, just 20 percent of
the homes had telephones.

<HEADLINE> Albright Promises Aid to Uzbekistan  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TASHKENT, Uzbekistan (AP) -- On a visit to Uzbekistan, once famed
for the goods that flowed through it on the ancient Silk Road,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Monday promised aid to
stifle the modern flow of drugs and militants.
</P>
<P>
   Albright warned, however, that the fight against narcotics and
terrorism must not involve human-rights abuses in the former Soviet
Central Asian republic bordering Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   On a five-day tour across Central Asia, Albright is seeking to
promote U.S. policy in a region known for its booming drug trade,
outbreaks of extremism and frequent neglect of democratic values.
</P>
<P>
   ''While you are geographically distant from the United States,
you are very closely connected to our most vital national
interests,'' Albright said in a speech at the Tashkent University
of World Economy and Diplomacy. ''Since narcotics traffickers and
terrorists know no borders, it's important that we work together to
counter the threat they pose.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright noted that the rise of the Islamic fundamentalist
regime in Afghanistan has raised concerns that extremism could
spread through the region in which three former Soviet republics
border on Afghanistan -- Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
</P>
<P>
   Members of an Islamic group have been convicted in bombings that
killed 13 people and wounded more than 100 last year in Tashkent,
Uzbekistan's capital. Neighboring Kyrgyzstan, which Albright
visited Sunday, suffered an invasion of several hundred Islamic
militants last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen were led by an Uzbek warlord alternately based in
Afghanistan and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Afghanistan has become a huge problem for regional stability,
both because of the ongoing war and the Taliban's poor record on
terrorism, narcotics and human rights,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright promised that the United States would commit $10
million to help provide training and equipment for
counter-terrorism, border guard and anti-drug units in Uzbekistan
and neighboring ex-Soviet republics Kazkastan and Kyrgyzstan. She
also invited the three nations to participate in a
counter-terrorism conference for Central Asia in Washington in
June.
</P>
<P>
   But she warned President Islam Karimov and other regional
leaders that the threat of Islamic extremism can't justify their
crackdown on opposition figures and the abuse of human rights and
religious freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States will not support any and all measures taken
in the name of fighting drugs and terrorism and restoring
stability,'' she said. ''One of the most dangerous temptations for
a government facing violent threats is to respond in a heavy-handed
way that violates the rights of innocent citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Karimov has ruled his nation with an iron hand, uprooting
Islamic movements and other opposition groups, saying harsh secular
rule is needed to prevent fundamentalists from taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Albright warned Karimov against suppressing peaceful opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indiscriminate government censorship and repression can cause
moderate and peaceful opponents of a regime to resort to
violence,'' she said. ''It can turn civilians who have never before
been interested in politics into extremists. It would be a terrible
mistake to treat peacefully practicing Muslims as enemies of the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Uzbekistan has rich natural resources, but the majority of the
population lives in poverty, surviving on an average monthly salary
that barely reaches $20. The nation's economic development has been
hampered by Soviet-style state controls which include government
regulation of the currency rate -- an obstacle to regional economic
cooperation and work with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Albright urged Uzbek officials to ease those controls and begin
free-market reforms. ''The best way to take a bitter pill is simply
to swallow it whole,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, she visited the 2,500-year-old city of
Samarkand, which saw the rise and fall of the empires of Alexander
the Great and Genghis Khan.

<HEADLINE> Quick Peace Unlikely in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- In a southern Philippine province, a
Muslim rebel group threatened to execute Americans Monday unless
the U.S. releases convicted terrorists, including the mastermind of
the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The group also says it will release 29 Filipino hostages it
holds -- but only if all Christian residents of the province are
forbidden from displaying crosses in public.
</P>
<P>
   In another province, more than 100,000 villagers flee their
homes to escape clashes between a second Muslim rebel group and
government troops that have killed more than 300 people in the past
month.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after a peace treaty raised hopes of an end to the
Philippines' decades-old Muslim secessionist rebellion, peace in
the country's impoverished southern Mindanao region appears
increasingly elusive.
</P>
<P>
   The number of casualties and evacuees in the past month's
fighting in Lanao del Norte province rate on the scale of a major
disaster, surpassing even the 68,000 people who were forced to flee
from the eruption of Mayon volcano in February.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes are the most serious since the government and the
secessionist Moro Islamic Liberation Front began talks in 1997.
They serve as an indication of the difficulties in finding a
solution to the struggle for Muslim self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the insurgency has killed more than 120,000
people and stunted economic growth in Mindanao, one of the
country's most resource-rich regions and home to its Muslim
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes for peace rose in 1996, when the largest Muslim rebel
group, the Moro National Liberation Front, signed a peace treaty in
which it accepted autonomy, not independence. But the compromise
was rejected by the MILF, a breakaway faction that wants to
establish an independent Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   President Joseph Estrada has rejected any kind of Muslim
independence, saying a dismemberment of the country is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Like previous presidents, Estrada says the rebellion can best be
solved by eradicating poverty and ending decades of discrimination
and neglect of Muslim communities by the central government. But he
has also shown less signs of sympathy toward the rebels and has
repeatedly threatened to use military force.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have given them a warning that if it is peace talks they
want, I will bring development to their communities,'' he said this
week. ''But if they commit terrorist acts, we will not forgive
them. We will go all-out against them.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent clashes flared last month when MILF guerrillas
attacked army outposts in several Lanao del Norte towns. The
soldiers pursued the rebels, particularly a group suspected in a
bus bombing that killed 40 people in February.
</P>
<P>
   The army has set Sunday as the deadline for taking a major camp
in the mountains of Munai where the rebels have sought refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting has killed more than 300 rebels and at least 18
soldiers, the military says. Among the soldiers killed was a young
lieutenant who was a godson of Estrada.
</P>
<P>
   As the military fought the MILF in Lanao del Norte, a smaller
but more radical Muslim rebel group, the Abu Sayyaf, seized more
than 50 hostages. The hostages seized in Basilan province on March
20 included a Catholic priest and many schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels were still holding 29 hostages on Friday.
They demanded the release of terrorists jailed in the United States
and a ban on the display of crosses by Catholics in Mindanao as
conditions for freeing the captives.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, they said they will kidnap or kill Americans in the
Philippines if the United States rejects their demand for the
jailed terrorists. The terrorists include Ramzi Yousef, the World
Trade Center bombing mastermind, and Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman,
accused of conspiring to blow up New York City landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf have been blamed for numerous attacks against
Christians, including foreign missionaries. U.S. embassy officials
were not immediately available for comment on their latest threat.
</P>
<P>
   Former Congressman Michael Mastura, a Muslim lawyer, said
government ''appeasements'' may temporarily halt clashes in
Mindanao, but unless the Muslim desire for genuine self-rule is
met, the fighting is likely to continue.
</P>
<P>
   He said the only way to prevent more bloodshed is to hold an
East Timor-type referendum to ask Muslims whether they want
independence. Government officials have rejected that proposal,
saying Mindanao is different from East Timor because it has always
been part of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Estrada's conflicting offers of aid and threats of
military action have sowed confusion, with many military field
commanders eager to interpret the posturing literally by attacking
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, warned
that any attack against the main rebel stronghold -- Camp Abubakar,
still untouched by the military -- would terminate talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''The moment they do that, it's an official declaration of war
against the MILF and I don't think it will be possible to continue
the peace talks,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Little Havana Is Home Away From Home  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Palm trees. Stucco houses in pastel hues. The smell
of rich, sweet coffee and the smoke of roasted pork wafting through
the narrow streets. It could be Cuba without Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   This is Little Havana, the parallel universe for thousands of
Cuban exiles who have turned it into their home away from home.
</P>
<P>
   The waves of Cubans fleeing communist Cuba reshaped this once
white neighborhood almost 40 years ago. The 4{-month struggle to
keep Elian Gonzalez from being sent back to Cuba has energized this
close-knit community, bringing its Cuban colors out in force.
</P>
<P>
   ''This street was no-name street,'' said Sergio Perez, 49,
standing near the house where 6-year-old Elian moved in with
relatives last fall. ''Now it's Elian's street.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Havana has been part of Miami for decades and, Elian
notwithstanding, its true heart is Eighth Street, called Calle Ocho
by everyone, even Anglos. Stretching west of downtown for more than
a mile, it is like another world within a sprawling city of 400,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   From Domino Park to the Orange Bowl to Calle Ocho, all of the
business signs are in Spanish. The houses are modest, with small
yards and tall, steel fences and security gates.
</P>
<P>
   Only boys wear shorts. The men -- the traditional Cuban men --
wear pants. Most people call dollars pesos. There are low-slung
churches in the primarily Roman Catholic community, many with open
doors. On Palm Sunday, the singing could be heard easily by
passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the food: Cuban sandwiches like medianoche -- that
means midnight -- with piles of pork and ham and cheese, grilled
hot. There is also moros y christianos, which is black beans and
white rice stirred together.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere there are sidewalk windows, traditional places in
Latin America to swap the latest gossip and argue politics for the
cost of a potent cup of coffee. The community was aghast two years
ago when state health officials began insisting on sliding glass or
screens between the cooks and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Street vendors sell ''pinchos'' -- chunks of sticky, aromatic
pork barbecued on wooden sticks. There is the steady rhythm of
salsa music from car radios and houses long after dark. Parades
coincide with Carnival and major dates on the church calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Like many others, Perez came to the United States and moved into
the neighborhood in 1980 after Castro let 125,000 Cubans travel to
Florida during the three-month Mariel boatlift. But Cubans have
been coming to South Florida for decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, 400,000 to 500,000 Cubans fleeing Castro came to
the United States. Many settled in the five-square-mile area that
would become Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, it was a collection of neighborhoods, all
lower-middle-class and white. There was a large Jewish contingent.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no white flight, historians say. The Anglos simply
moved out slowly, heading to the suburbs or farther north. For the
Cubans, rents were cheap and stores were within walking distance,
which was good because they couldn't afford cars. Few believed they
would stay for long.
</P>
<P>
   ''None of these people expected this to be permanent exile,''
said Jaime Suchlicki, director of the Institute for Cuba and Cuban
American Studies at the University of Miami. ''Everyone thought
Fidel would fall, he would be gone and they would go back to
Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they opened stores and restaurants and fixed up the
houses they bought, adding Latin touches like tile roofs, stucco
walls and flower-filled gardens.
</P>
<P>
   Some made enough money to move to more affluent neighborhoods,
but they were replaced by the Mariel Cubans and, during the last
decade, tens of thousands of immigrants from Cuba and Central
American countries.
</P>
<P>
   They did more than transform Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ''My god, the Cubans changed the city,'' said Wayne Smith, a
senior fellow at Center for International Policy in Washington and
the former chief of the State Department's U.S. interests section
in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always given the Cubans great credit, or almost sole
credit, for transforming Miami into the bustling international
economic commercial center it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Elian saga, the Cubans have been given another
opportunity to condemn Castro. Signs tacked to houses throughout
Little Havana say ''Back To No Future'' and ''No Castro No
Problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Isaac, 67, believes Elian would return to a country
without enough milk and food. The retired teacher is happy her
views are heard across the country and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the world knows what we know: That Cuba is no place for
this child,'' Isaac said.
</P>
<P>
   For her, and for thousands of Cubans, home is Little Havana. If
they win their battle, it will become Elian's home, too.

<HEADLINE> Okla. School Takes Action on Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICKASHA, Okla. (AP) -- Students at an intermediate school had
to pass through metal detectors and leave their book bags and
backpacks at home Monday after a student found a note threatening a
shooting and a listing of 26 students.
</P>
<P>
   The note found Friday was pushed through the vents of a locker,
Officer Rusty Winsett said in his police report. He said three
students found it when they opened the locker.
</P>
<P>
   The letter reportedly stated that a shooting would take place
later in the school year, and 26 people would die. It also
contained a picture of a gun, 26 circled x's and a list of 26
sixth- and seventh-grade students at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Principal Alex Souza told police that the list was a mixture of
male and female, black and white students, some of whom were
considered upper class, and some of whom were teachers' children.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Lynn Williams said the note also threatened harm to anyone
who found the note if they turned it over to authorities. The note
said the students would be harmed by May 17, the final day of
classes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, administrators allowed no loose clothing, no book
bags or backpacks, no oversized purses and no coats and jackets to
be worn during school hours.
</P>
<P>
   Students were allowed to enter through only one door and had to
pass through a metal detector. A dog trained in gunpowder detection
was at the school, along with police and school security staff.
</P>
<P>
   Only 140 of the 460 students in the intermediate school attended
classes Monday.

<HEADLINE> AG, DPUC commissioner say merger has little benefit for customers  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) -- The merger of Northeast Utilities and
Consolidated Edison Inc. gives little to ratepayers and does not
offer enough protection for workers and the environment, critics
said Monday at the start of public hearings on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no benefits -- absolutely no benefits -- given to
Connecticut consumers in this package,'' Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal told the Department of Public Utility Control.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Glenn Arthur also said he could find no immediate
monetary benefit for consumers, unlike other big utility mergers
around the country that resulted in rate cuts and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur urged ConEd and NU to amend their merger proposal to
offer more to Connecticut customers, saying the current proposal
''is not a dead ringer for approval.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief executives of the companies said the merger will mean
lower rates and better service for customers in the long run, as
the companies find savings and boost efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will pass these savings along to consumers. We will have
benefits for consumers,'' said Michael Morris, chairman and chief
executive of NU.
</P>
<P>
   ConEd chairman Eugene McGrath said the combined company would
invest in the community and its work force. He defended the company
against questions about its handling of worker complaints and
environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our people do make mistakes from time to time. We try to learn
from them and move on,'' McGrath said.
</P>
<P>
   The DPUC plans 10 days of hearings on the $3.5 billion merger,
which would create the country's largest electric and gas
distribution company with more than 6.4 million customers in New
York and New England. A draft ruling is scheduled for June 2.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders approved the merger Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A key issue is how much the merger would cost and how the
combined company would pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price is $1.5 billion over the book value of NU's
stock. To pay that premium, the company does not plan a rate
reduction for Connecticut customers until 2006 or later, Blumenthal
said.
</P>
<P>
   Any savings should be passed on immediately, or the premium
should be decreased, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris noted that Connecticut consumers are enjoying a 10
percent rate reduction already under the state's electric
deregulation law. The rate cut is in effect until the end of 2003,
at which time the DPUC will hold hearings to set new rates.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Michael Wertheimer questioned ConEd's
record on protecting workers' rights and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   A fire in a transformer in September 1998 resulted in a release
of hazardous chemicals around firefighters, who later settled with
the company for $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1989 steam manhole explosion, 700 pounds of asbestos
contaminated the Manhattan neighborhood of Gramercy Park. The
company was convicted in 1995 of having deliberately concealed the
asbestos threat.
</P>
<P>
   ConEd agreed to a court order to maintain an environmental law
compliance program and to hire an ombudsman to investigate
suspected violations. Wertheimer said some company employees feared
retaliation for reporting environmental concerns after the
ombudsman left.
</P>
<P>
   Wertheimer also questioned ConEd's handling of a radiation leak
at the Indian Point II nuclear power plant in February and a
blackout in the Washington Heights section of New York City last
summer.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Sentences in Baby Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- A lawyer and two women were sentenced to
federal prison Monday after admitting they schemed to smuggle
Mexican children into the United States, where prospective parents
paid as much as $20,000 for what they thought were legal adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''I realize I contributed to the pain and suffering of the
people in this case,'' said Arlene Lieberman of the Long Island
community of Medford, before being sentenced to 15 months. ''I
never meant to hurt anyone. ... I am truly sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Arlene Reingold, who also was sentenced to 15
months, were ordered to each pay $43,500 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Mario Reyes of Douglas, Ariz., was sentenced to two years
and six months in prison and ordered to pay $125,000 in
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, who had an office in a Mexican border town, had arranged
for at least 23 Mexican babies to be illegally brought into the
United States through Arizona over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   According to the criminal complaint, Lieberman and Reingold were
consultants who used various named adoption businesses on Long
Island to steer prospective parents to Reyes.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Environmentalists Supported  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans are broadly supportive of the
environmental movement three decades after the first Earth Day,
says a new Gallup Poll, but they don't consider the environment a
top political priority.
</P>
<P>
   The poll released Monday indicated that one in six people are
active with the environmental movement, while just over half say
they're sympathetic to the movement though not active. Four of five
said they're sympathetic to the goals of the environmental
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's all good news,'' said Brenda Box, a spokeswoman
for the National Wildlife Federation. ''Thirty years ago when we
celebrated the first Earth Day, most people weren't aware of the
environmental movement and most people weren't actively doing
much.''
</P>
<P>
   A vast majority of people say they take steps in their personal
lives such as recycling newspapers, cans and bottles, cutting down
on use of water and fuel, and avoiding products that harm the
environment. People were divided on whether they considered
themselves environmentalists, supporting the concept more than
actually getting involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people hear about specific crises, they get very
interested in the environment,'' said Colleen Costello, a
27-year-old waitress and environmental activist from Columbus, Ohio
in Washington Monday to protest the World Bank. ''But it's so easy
to just go home and turn the television on without actually doing
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   While awareness and sympathy of the environmental movement have
grown since 1970, people generally do not view the environment with
a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ''People care about it, but it's not the most significant
issue,'' said Riley Dunlap, a coordinator of the environmental poll
for Gallup.
</P>
<P>
   Support in the polls for the environmental movement peaked about
10 years ago, after events like the Exxon Valdez oil spill,
discussion of global warming and the discovery of medical waste on
beaches caught public attention.
</P>
<P>
   ''People expect clean air and clean water and they get engaged
when they think that's threatened,'' said Steve Cochran, a
spokesman for Environmental Defense. ''We need to engage people on
this issue in their daily lives, not just when they're
threatened.''
</P>
<P>
   The environment doesn't rank as high as an issue in the
presidential contest as issues like education, health care, crime,
family values and the economy, the poll said. But it ranks in the
middle with such issues as gun control and tax reduction in the
poll of 1,004 adults taken April 3 through 9, It has an error
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Because of other voter priorities, the environment is not likely
to be a dominant political issue in the presidential election. But
Vice President Al Gore's book on the environment ''Earth in the
Balance'' has been re-released and Gore defends elements of the
book that conservatives have used to paint him as an environmental
extremist, such as his call for the abolition of the internal
combustion engine. Likely Democratic nominee Gore says he's looking
for new types of cars, not the abolition of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely Republican nominee, has
pushed a few of his own environmental proposals, recently calling
for a cleanup of contaminated plant sites. But environmental
problems in Texas include Houston air pollution that recently
surpassed that of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unclear how the environment will play in the election,''
Dunlap said. ''Results suggest it's still a second-level issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of Earth Day, which falls on April 22, hope to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our intention is to catapult environmental issues generally
and global warming issues specifically into the top tier of
American political issues,'' said Denis Hayes, chairman of the
Earth Day Network, ''so that no one running for president or the
local city council can get elected without saying what they would
do to achieve clean energy.''

   Dow Ends Up 276; Record Nasdaq Gain
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Big-name stocks rallied back today, surging into
the close amid hopes Wall Street hit bottom in last week's
punishing selloff. Most other stocks fell again, however, as
bargain hunters remained leery of smaller companies. The battered
Nasdaq composite index jumped a record 217.68 points to 3,538.97,
nearly all of it coming over the final hour of trading. The Dow
Jones industrial average rose 276.74 to 10,582.51, recovering
nearly half of Friday's record one-day point drop of 617.78. But
while investors showed renewed interest in many of the big and
popular companies that tumbled last week, the bias remained
negative on the broad market, where declining issues outnumbered
advancers by nearly a 3-to-2 margin.

   European Stocks Close Lower
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Most European stocks fell today, but losses were
curtailed after signs of a rally in U.S. markets alleviated fears
that Friday's tumble was the start of a prolonged market slide. The

points, or 1.6 percent, to close at 368.24, while pan-European
technology index Easdaq was down 8.6 percent, both higher than
their day's lows. Observers warned that the U.S. rally could be
fragile. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index ended down 3.51 points on
today at 414.82. London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 183.5 points,
or 3 percent, to close at 5,994.6. Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index
recovered from early losses to close just 0.4 percent lower than
Friday, down 7,187.14. Amsterdam's AEX Index down 1.9 percent to

<HEADLINE> Seven murders of livery drivers has industry concerned  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Livery cab driver Juan Marical knows it's
against the law for him to pick up passengers on the street -- he's
only supposed to pick up fares called in from his dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   But to make more money, Marical, like scores of other livery cab
drivers, do pick up street fares, something only yellow cab drivers
can do. But Marical is more cautious now.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look suspicious, forget it,'' Marical said on Monday as
he slowed down to check out a passenger hailing him in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   A recent spate of livery cab murders has Marical and more than
41,000 livery drivers scared. So far this year, seven livery cab
drivers have been murdered -- two in the past week. Last year, 11
were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The police have made solving the murders a top priority --
there's been an arrest in only one case. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
expressed his outrage, and has pledged $5 million in a grant
program to help equip livery cars with bulletproof partitions or
digital security cameras.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Council hearing Monday to address the safety concerns
of livery drivers, NYPD Chief of Patrol John Scanlon said six of
the seven murders resulted from street hails, and he urged drivers
to avoid such passengers. Only yellow cab drivers can pick up
street fares, and although by law they must take passengers in all
five boroughs, they stick to the relatively safe streets of
Manhattan, making the need for livery drivers all the more
important in the outlying boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the conditions of the job itself -- cash oriented,
solo operated, evening hours -- (livery) drivers are especially
vulnerable to criminals who would prey on them,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Maria Estrella agreed. Her husband, Luis Francisco Perez
was the sixth cab driver killed this year -- he was found in his cab
last Friday with a gunshot wound to his head, two days shy of his
30th birthday. On Saturday, the seventh driver, Jean Scutt, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said it's dangerous for you,'' Estrella said as she held
their 16-month-old son, Liully. ''I'm waiting every night for you.
But he would never think that anything would happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani announced Monday that the city will be setting up a
fund to help the families of the slain drivers. In addition, the
police department has created a special task force, assigning 300
officers to protect livery drivers. Some cops will act as decoy
drivers and there will be designated safe zones where drivers in
trouble can go if they need help.
</P>
<P>
   But Scanlon stressed the best protection for the drivers is the
bulletproof partition. Taxi and Limousine Commission rules require
all yellow cabs and livery cars operated and owned by more than one
driver to have the partitions.
</P>
<P>
   Police stress that no yellow cab drivers have been killed since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   But cars owned and driven by individual drivers -- which make up
90 percent of all livery cars -- can have either the partitions or
tiny surveillance cameras installed behind the driver's rearview
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   However, many livery drivers say it's too expensive to equip
their cars with partitions, which cost between $250 to $300, or the
cameras, costing from $600 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the security devices, the job is still pretty
dangerous, said Jose Vinoria, a driver for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been attacked three times -- once, someone put a gun to
the back of my head,'' Vinoria said.
</P>
<P>
   So why do people become livery drivers?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not because it's a very good job,'' Vinoria said. ''You
have a time when you have to pay your bills. And in this job, you
can be your own boss. You can work as much overtime as you need.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of cab driving are not new. Scanlon said the NYPD
has been battling violence against cab drivers for years. Fernando
Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers,
said at least a dozen cab drivers are attacked each day.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most dangerous industry in the city,'' Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a cab was listed as one of the most dangerous jobs
nationwide in a 1996 survey by the National Institute for
Occupational Safety &AMP; Health.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Renames Streets As Reward  </HEADLINE>
By KATE N. GROSSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Muddy Waters has one. So do Clarence Darrow and
David Ben-Gurion. Even hot dog magnate Abe ''Fluky'' Drexler has a
Chicago intersection bearing his name.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the first to admit that maybe people get carried away,''
says City Alderman Burton Natarus, who takes credit for much of
Chicago's honorary street-naming. ''Some say the signs are tacky
and all that, but you can make people feel good, so why not?''
</P>
<P>
   Good will is overflowing on Chicago's streets.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, the number of honorary signs approached 860. That
means one out of almost every five major street intersections in
the city has a brown honorary sign just below the official green
one.
</P>
<P>
   The number of such signs has exploded this decade, putting
Chicago far ahead of both New York City, which has 115, and Los
Angeles, with just 15.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Chicago's signs honor celebrities like former Chicago
Bears coach Mike Ditka and writer Studs Terkel. Most of the signs,
however, honor the not-so-famous, including dozens of local clergy
members and community leaders who have made a difference in their
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   City Council approval is usually a foregone conclusion. But last
week, Playboy founder Hugh Hefner shook up the status quo. After
two days of rowdy debate -- including the unfurling of a Playboy
centerfold in the council chamber -- and a set of flip-flop votes,
the aldermen voted to create Hugh M. Hefner Way.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Alderman Thomas Allen proposed limiting each alderman
to two street signs a year. He offered the same measure in 1997,
but it generated such controversy that he dropped it. This time,
the odds are still iffy. Mayor Richard M. Daley hasn't come out in
support of it, and street-naming remains a popular gimmick among
aldermen.
</P>
<P>
   Kenan Heise, a former Chicago Tribune reporter who has written
several books on Chicago, says he knows why: ''You win favor with a
group of constituents by naming a street after a local -- preferably
someone in a group that votes.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. At one time, Chicago aldermen had
more impressive ways to curry favor. When Richard J. ''Boss''
Daley, the current mayor's father, ran the city, the Democratic
Machine hummed and patronage reigned. Aldermen rewarded
neighborhood loyalists with city jobs and public services.
</P>
<P>
   But good government advocates and Harold Washington, Chicago's
first black mayor, helped break the Machine. A federal decree
forbade patronage in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Heise says, aldermen reward their constituents with
''something that will put their star in the sky -- a lamppost is as
high as they can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Chicagoans say their aldermen's hearts are in the right
place.
</P>
<P>
   ''In my neighborhood, there are streets after people who died in
Vietnam and the Gulf War, and people who did something in the
area,'' says Don Hayner, a Chicago Sun-Times editor who wrote a
book on Chicago street names. ''It leaves a little bit of
neighborhood history.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, says Natarus: ''People hate the government. This might
actually help.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Tells of Lebanon Pullout Plan  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Israel officially informed the United
Nations Monday that it plans to withdraw its forces from Lebanon by
early July, handing the world body the tough task of helping to fix
borders and ensure security.
</P>
<P>
   All Israeli forces will be pulled out ''in one go'' by July 7 to
the internationally recognized border, Israeli U.N. Ambassador
Yehuda Lancry told reporters after delivering a letter from Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and has occupied part of southern
Lebanon since 1985 as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on
northern Israel. The withdrawal of Israeli forces would fulfill
1978 U.N. resolutions on ending the occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Israeli officers say there are less than a thousand
Israeli troops in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Lancry stressed that ''no pockets'' of Israeli military would
remain in Lebanon. ''We are going to redeploy in the international
recognized border under the auspices of the United Nations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Levy told reporters after meeting his French
counterpart, Hubert Vedrine, that ''the withdrawal will be at the
line accepted by the experts of all parties involved -- the United
Nations, Lebanon and Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 Security Council resolutions established a U.N.
peacekeeping force whose main job is to confirm an Israeli
withdrawal. U.N. troops have been in Lebanon since that spring
monitoring attacks by the Israeli forces and by the Islamic
Hezbollah guerrillas who have fought for years to expel Israel from
the country.
</P>
<P>
   The resolutions call for the peacekeeping force to restore peace
to the region and help the Lebanese government regain its authority
in the country, where Syria remains the main power broker. Levy's
letter, which Annan later sent to members of the U.N. Security
Council, said ''Israel will do its utmost to assist the United
Nations'' in implementing the resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israel Television, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said U.N. troops will be in south Lebanon after a withdrawal
-- ''possibly as an expanded force.'' Israel believes the U.N.
force, now numbering nearly 4,500 troops, will be enough to patrol
the Israel-Lebanon border if expanded to its full mandate of 7,000
soldiers, a senior Israeli official said recently, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has pledged for months to withdraw Israeli troops from
Lebanon by summer, preferably as part of an agreement with Lebanon
and Syria but unilaterally if necessary. Talks between Israel and
Syria have stalled since January.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Lancry, Annan held separate talks with Lebanese
U.N. Ambassador Selim Tadmoury and Syrian U.N. Ambassador Mikhail
Wehbe to inform them of Israel's intention. He also telephoned
Lebanese and Syrian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from Lebanese officials. In the
past, they have welcomed Israeli withdrawal but have insisted on
their own conditions to implement the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   On Israel's northern border, Kiryat Shemona Mayor Chaim Barbivai
called on Barak to reconsider his decision. Residents of the region
fear an Israeli withdrawal will leave them vulnerable to attacks
from the guerrillas across the border in Lebanon. Israel has
promised to swiftly respond to any such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is very grave,'' Barbivai said. ''To our dismay people
are frightened and feel in danger.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the challenge for
the United Nations is ''to see to it that the withdrawal is
conducted safely without any resumption of conflict or escalation
of violence.'' He said contingency planning by the U.N. Secretariat
is already under way.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. forces on the ground fear a unilateral withdrawal will be a
nightmare because they will have to deal with Israel's proxy
militia, the South Lebanon Army, as well as Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the South Lebanon Army will be allowed to live in
Israel after the withdrawal, Lancry said. He said the government
expects between 3,000 and 4,000 families to settle in the Jewish
state.

<HEADLINE> Copper Prices Down on Economy Worry  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Copper prices tumbled to a seven-month low Monday on investor
jitters about the stock market and the state of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   In other commodity markets, heating oil futures leaped higher,
pulling other energy products up with them, and sugar roared to a
five-month high.
</P>
<P>
   Every jolt to the stock market or confidence in the U.S. economy
has an aftershock in copper, whose fate is tied closely to that of
the construction industry and U.S. homebuilding trends.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, even a resurgent stock market couldn't overcome
uneasiness that the wind has gone out of the sails in the economy's
and equities' booms, meaning uncertain times ahead for the
industrial metal.
</P>
<P>
   Copper for May delivery settled down 1 cent at 74.35 cents a
pound after falling to a 7{-month low of 74.10 cents on the Comex
division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   That extended a slide that began in January with prices at a
26-month high of more than 88 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ''You would have thought you would have seen a little more
strength in copper because of the stock rally'' which began Monday
morning, said Dave Megar, metals analyst for Alaron Trading Corp.
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blame mostly heavy fund selling ... along with the equity
market jitters,'' he said. ''People are still extremely nervous
about the weakening economic outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, seasonal demand is waning with summer building projects
all booked by now. Bargain-hunting, the analyst said, is likely to
boost the market soon with prices having fallen so low.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the New York Merc, heating oil prices rocketed 5
percent higher as distillate fuel supplies tightened with farmers
filling their tractors for spring planting.
</P>
<P>
   Exacerbating the distillate supply crunch were continued
operating problems at an Exxon Mobil unit in Joliet, Ill. The unit,
which produces 240,000 barrels a day of diesel fuel, is a main
source for Midwestern farm suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   May heating oil rose 3.07 cents to 69.47 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil prices, meanwhile, also were buoyed by news that
Motiva was delaying the restart of a 90,000-barrels-a-day
gasoline-producing unit at its refinery in Port Arthur, Texas, by
two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   May crude rose 32 cents to $25.89 a barrel, May unleaded
gasoline rose 2.16 cents to 81.98 cents a gallon and May natural
gas rose 8 cents to $3.158 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, June Brent crude from the North Sea rose 33 cents to
$22.74 a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar zoomed higher on a technically inspired rally on New
York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange. Shrinking crop acreage in
some countries as a result of recently low prices underpinned the
price rise.
</P>
<P>
   July sugar settled up .25 cent at 6.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Visits the West  </HEADLINE>
By MARA D. BELLABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- On his first visit to the West as Russian
president, Vladimir Putin pledged Monday that his country would not
drift back into isolation, but would seek friendlier ties with
Europe -- despite sharp differences over Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Putin promised to implement economic reforms, defend property
owners and root out corruption to attract foreign investment, and
Prime Minister Tony Blair responded by saying the newly elected
Russian ''talks our language on reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, one could follow the logic of isolation, but I'm
entirely convinced that such logic is absolutely inappropriate not
only in relations with Great Britain but the rest of Europe,''
Putin said at a joint news conference with Blair.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader later traveled to Windsor Castle, where he
had a 30-minute private audience with Queen Elizabeth II, before
flying to the Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's 24-hour stop in London -- the centerpiece of his first
foreign trip -- appeared to signal a strengthening of ties between
the two nuclear powers. Putin already showed signs of cultivating
Britain by inviting Blair to visit him in St. Petersburg last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's aides said Britain is ideally suited to provide a bridge
not only between Russia and the European Union but also Russia and
the United States, whose relations have deteriorated in the past
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some say that because of our concerns about Chechnya, we
should keep some distance from Moscow,'' Blair said. ''I share this
concern ... but I believe the best way to get results is by
engaging with Russia, not isolating Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics argued, however, that Blair was premature in welcoming
Putin, a longtime KGB spy who never held elected office until last
month's presidential vote. They reiterated allegations that Russian
troops have used excessive force and executed civilians in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But while demonstrators had promised to dog Putin's visit, the
number was smaller than expected. About 50 people carried placards
and waved Chechen flags as his black, bulletproof limousine slid
out of the Foreign Office parking lot for a quick sightseeing tour
of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   During the joint news conference with Blair, Putin strongly
defended his troops' actions in Chechnya and said he hoped his
visit would put Russia's views across more clearly to the West,
which has condemned with near unanimity Moscow's hardline approach
in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also vowed to stabilize his country's unruly economy in a
bid to lure back badly needed foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   During a meeting with British business leaders, he acknowledged
that Russian instability had put off investors, but said he was
determined to proceed with reforms of the tax code, the judicial
system and the burdensome bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia is not a shortened map of the ex-Soviet Union, it is a
country which has tremendous self-confidence, a self-confidence
based not only on our experience of reform but on errors we have
committed,'' Putin told the Confederation of British Industry.
</P>
<P>
   On nuclear cooperation, Putin praised the ratification of the
START II treaty on Friday by the Russian Parliament, the Duma, and
said he discussed with Blair the United States' desire to amend the
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said Britain could help bring together Russian and U.S.
positions on the ABM treaty, which the United States wants revised
to allow it to establish nationwide anti-missile defenses. Russia
has said if that happens, it will scrap START II and other treaties
curbing nuclear and conventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our role in this is very much to try and build understanding
of the respective points of view both of Russia and the West and
Russia and the United States of America,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the White House announced that President Clinton will
travel to Moscow in early June for a two-day summit with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian and British leaders said Monday's brief summit would
be followed up with annual bilateral meetings, and Blair added that
he was prepared to work more closely with Putin to fight
international crime and drugs, and make Russia ''an equal partner''
with the West in tackling the global community's most pressing
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe his election is important for us ... and indeed for
the rest of the world,'' Blair said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Livery Deaths Have Industry Wary  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Livery cab driver Juan Marical knows it's
against the law for him to pick up passengers on the street. He is
only supposed to pick up fares called in by his dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   But to make more money, Marical, like scores of other livery cab
drivers, picks up people on the street -- something only yellow cab
drivers are allowed to do. Still, Marical is more cautious now.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look suspicious, forget it,'' Marical said on Monday as
he slowed down to check out a passenger hailing him in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Seven New York City livery cab drivers have been murdered this
year so far -- two in the past week. Last year, 11 were killed. The
slayings have scared Marical and more than 41,000 other livery
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The police have made solving the murders a top priority. An
arrest has been made in only one case. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
pledged $5 million to help equip livery cars with bulletproof
partitions or digital security cameras.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Council hearing Monday, police Chief of Patrol John
Scanlon said six of the murders resulted from picking up people on
the street. He urged drivers to avoid such passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Only yellow cab drivers can pick up street fares, and although
by law they must take passengers in all five boroughs, they tend to
stick to the relatively safe streets of Manhattan, making the need
for livery drivers all the more important in the outlying boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the conditions of the job itself -- cash-oriented,
solo operated, evening hours -- (livery) drivers are especially
vulnerable to criminals who would prey on them,'' Scanlon said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent murder, of Jean Scutt, was Saturday. Luis
Francisco Perez, 29, was the sixth cab driver killed this year. He
was found shot in the head in his his cab Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said it's dangerous for you,'' Perez's widow, Anna Maria
Estrella, said as she held their 16-month-old son, Liully. ''I'm
waiting every night for you. But he would never think that anything
would happen to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani announced the creation of a fund to help the families
of the slain drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the police department has created a task force,
assigning 300 officers to protect livery drivers. Some officers
will act as decoy drivers and there will be designated safe zones
where drivers in trouble can go if they need help.
</P>
<P>
   But Scanlon stressed the best protection for the drivers is the
bulletproof partition. Taxi and Limousine Commission rules require
all yellow cabs and livery cars operated and owned by more than one
driver to have the partitions.
</P>
<P>
   Police stress that no yellow cab drivers have been killed since
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cars owned and driven by individual drivers -- which make up 90
percent of all livery cars -- are supposed to have either the
partitions or tiny surveillance cameras installed behind the
rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   However, many livery drivers say it is too expensive to equip
their cars with partitions, which cost $250 to $300, or the
cameras, costing $600 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the security devices, the job is still pretty
dangerous, said Jose Vinoria, a driver for 12 years. ''I've been
attacked three times -- once, someone put a gun to the back of my
head,'' Vinoria said.
</P>
<P>
   So why do people become livery drivers?
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not because it's a very good job,'' Vinoria said. ''You
have a time when you have to pay your bills. And in this job, you
can be your own boss. You can work as much overtime as you need.''

<HEADLINE> Brokers Stressed, But Optimistic  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) -- Legg Mason broker Peter Muckerman tried
to sound upbeat Monday as he soothed an investor unnerved by last
week's stock market plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The magnitude of the correction has been bigger than anybody
expected,'' Muckerman told the client over the phone.
</P>
<P>
   As in brokerage offices across the country, the mood was one of
nervous anticipation Monday at the Legg Mason branch near
Alexandria's upscale Olde Town neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers here told clients to remain calm even as they tapped
their pencils nervously on their desks.
</P>
<P>
   Muckerman fiddled with a stack of ''sell'' orders as he tried to
gauge the direction the markets would take early Monday.
</P>
<P>
   All morning the phone lines were busy with investors calling,
looking for advice on what to do with their once high-flying
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unpleasant to go through this,'' said Shawn McLaughlin,
head of the branch office. ''The fear is: Could it get worse?''
</P>
<P>
   That fear was clearly on the minds of clients. Brokers told
customers to ''be patient'' and ''remain calm'' despite the market
plunge on Friday, when the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Nasdaq composite index suffered their biggest one-day point drops.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sigh of relief as the Nasdaq started up.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's coming back? Thank God,'' Muckerman said to a colleague
</P>
<P>
   Then, just as quickly, he got the news that Nasdaq was headed
back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be all over the place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That they were, with the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Nasdaq fluctuating throughout the day before finishing on a
positive note, both up more than 200 points for the session.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers' conversations with clients showed that, in addition
to providing investment advice and executing trades, they provide a
certain amount of mental health counseling to concerned customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got time to wait and see whether the market's going to
go back up,'' broker Alan Norris told a client by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Norris said his clients' are long-term investors with holdings
primarily in mutual funds, so they were not as jittery. Norris
spent the weekend looking for funds with consistent, albeit
smaller, earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people I deal with are not the ones who are panicking,
like the day traders,'' he said. ''I try to keep a longer
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Kane, another broker, said his clients are long-term
investors with portfolios from $20,000 to well over six figures.
Even for long-term investors, Friday's decline was alarming, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Friday was difficult for some people to grasp,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Changes in store for Niagara Falls park  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) -- For the first time in decades, the
state is changing its approach to improving the parkland
surrounding Niagara Falls, focusing less on concrete and asphalt
and more on nature.
</P>
<P>
   While construction blooms across the Niagara River on the
Canadian side, officials will concentrate on turning the American
side into an ''ecotourism'' destination, with interactive centers
that celebrate nature, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted
and the Free Niagara movement that saved the falls from
industrialization, state Parks Commissioner Bernadette Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Niagara Reservation should be a gateway to the Frederick
Law Olmsted experience,'' Castro told The Buffalo News. ''What we
have here you can't experience anywhere else. But we have to work
harder to get people to think, 'I can't possibly go to Niagara
Falls and not experience the American side.'''
</P>
<P>
   Officials will seek public input as they revise the master plan
for the Niagara Reservation over the next two years. Plans so far
include connecting existing sections of the Niagara Gorge trail to
create a scenic seven-mile hike from the falls to Artpark in
Lewiston, and turning the outdated Schoellkopf Geological Museum,
down the river from the falls, into an interactive children's
nature exhibit and virtual reality theater.
</P>
<P>
   A vacant century-old fieldstone building on Goat Island, which
had served as the park's vehicle garage until several years ago,
would become another education-centered, interpretive site,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Castro emphasized that the state's primary role in the Niagara
Reservation, to safeguard the natural resource, would not change.
</P>
<P>
   She said tourists are seeking more active and outdoor things to
do with their families while on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're taking a whole new approach. We think people are
different today,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will pursue corporate partnerships to help with the
cost, Castro said, but the project still will require support from
Gov. George Pataki and the state Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''As this gathers momentum and enthusiasm, I think the governor
will be interested in this plan,'' Castro said. ''I have every
reason to believe he would be (supportive).''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Schillaci, chairwoman of the Olmsted Conservancy, said
the private environmental preservation group would help in any way
it can.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shame on us for letting it get so run down, so far from what
it was and what it could be again,'' she said. ''Now is the time to
think about how we will leave this natural wonder to our children
and their children.''

</P>

   A recent spate of livery cab murders has Marical and more than
41,000 livery drivers scared. So far this year, seven livery cab

were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The police have made solving the murders a top priority --
there's been an arrest in only one case. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has

   ''Because of the conditions of the job itself -- cash oriented,

</P>
<P>
   Anna Maria Estrella agreed. Her husband, Luis Francisco Perez,
was the sixth cab driver killed this year -- he was found in his cab
last Friday with a gunshot wound to his head, two days shy of his
30th birthday. On Saturday, the seventh driver, Jean Scutt, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said it's dangerous for you,'' Estrella said as she held
their 16-month-old son, Liully. ''I'm waiting every night for you.

can be your own boss. You can work as much overtime as you need.''
</P>
<P>
   The dangers of cab driving are not new. Scanlon said the NYPD
has been battling violence against cab drivers for years. Fernando
Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers,
said at least a dozen cab drivers are attacked each day.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most dangerous industry in the city,'' Mateo said.
</P>
<P>
   Driving a cab was listed as one of the most dangerous jobs
nationwide in a 1996 survey by the National Institute for
Occupational Safety &AMP; Health.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Reports Higher Earns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., the country's largest
brokerage firm, reported a sharp increase in first-quarter earnings
Monday on higher revenues from stock trading and investment
banking.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch earned $1.04 billion, or $2.38 a share, well above
the $1.83 a share forecast by analysts surveyed by First
Call/Thomson Financial. The brokerage had profits of $609 million,
or $1.44 a share, in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter profits were down across Wall Street last year as
securities firms recovered from the fallout wrought by the Asian
and Russian financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Fees from advice on mergers and acquisitions jumped due to
Merrill's role as financial adviser on the largest corporate
takeover in history, the acquisition by British telecommunications
company Vodaphone AirTouch of Mannesmann, a German telecom and
engineering company.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it's too early to say how Merrill's second-quarter
earnings will be affected by the recent market downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Merger and acquisition activity, which has surged recently as
companies have taken advantage of their high stock prices to
purchase other companies, is certain to slow down if the market
fails to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   The market for initial public stock offering will also slow if
stocks continue to falter and demand for new shares dries up.
</P>
<P>
   Total first-quarter revenues were $7.25 billion, up from $5.27
billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''These outstanding results demonstrate the power of our global
institutional franchise and the momentum generated by the
far-reaching changes we have implemented in our private client and
asset management businesses,'' said Merrill Lynch chairman David
Komansky.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Regrouping  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- The war in Chechnya has simmered down to
isolated clashes, but rebels said Monday they were regrouping for a
new offensive and top Russian commanders warned that violence will
flare up again.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, in a sign of growing concern among Russians about
the war, a group of lawmakers said they were setting up an
independent commission to investigate the situation in Chechnya,
including human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been under strong criticism from the West over the
eight-month war and United Nations High Commissioner of Human
Rights Mary Robinson this month urged formation of an independent
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Krasheninnikov, a member of parliament and commission
initiator, told a news conference that the Chechen offensive has
reached a deadlock and ''a military settlement is unlikely to
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chechen fighters have kept up their hit-and-run attacks on
Russian forces in recent weeks, but the fierce battles that laid
waste to the rebel republic have abated.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can no longer fight the way they did three or four months
ago, but they have carried out, are carrying out and will carry out
terrorist acts,'' said a top Russian commander in Chechnya, Col.
Gen. Gennady Troshev.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel fighter, who only identified himself as Shirvani, said
Monday the insurgents needed time to recover and regroup after the
rough and bloody winter.
</P>
<P>
   Shirvani came to Nazran in neighboring Ingushetia with 11
wounded militants for medical treatment. He said the militants were
planning ''a number of terrorist acts on the territory of
Chechnya'' at the end of the month, but for the moment were
concentrating on ''quick attacks'' on Russian checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Gudermes, two Russian policemen were killed and
three wounded Sunday when unknown gunmen opened fire on them as
they raided an apartment where rebels were suspected of hiding out,
the Interfax and ITAR-Tass news agencies reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military claimed that nearly a dozen rebels were
killed and several taken prisoner during another battle in the
southern Itum-Kale region, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   After moving into Chechnya in September, Russian troops seized
about two-thirds of the republic in steady advances across the
northern flatlands. But the Russians have bogged down in the
southern mountains, the last major area still under rebel control.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has indicated in recent weeks that it may be looking for
a way out of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The independent commission whose formation was announced Monday
will investigate the events of the current war and of the 1994-6
Chechnya war, initiators said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, on a visit to London on Monday, said he only learned
about the commission from media reports, but that he welcomed its
creation.

<HEADLINE> Mutual Fund Investors Stay On Track  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mutual fund investors held firm Monday,
apparently shrugging off the temptation to flee the stock markets
in the wake of last week's huge selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that resistance helped the markets bounce back
from Friday's historic losses, when the Dow Jones industrial
average fell 617.78 points and the Nasdaq composite index dropped
355.49.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, stocks dipped in and out of positive territory before
rallying late in the session. The Dow average rose more than 276
points, and the Nasdaq experienced its largest one-day point gain
ever, climbing nearly 218 points.
</P>
<P>
   Art Bonnel, portfolio manager of U.S. Global Investor's Bonnel
Growth Fund, said most mutual fund investors don't concern
themselves with temporary market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in mutual funds have more of a long-term mentality,''
he said. ''They aren't the day traders. That's one of the reasons a
lot of the professional mutual fund people aren't selling out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnel speculated that most of the selling by mutual fund
managers in recent days was done by newer funds that were started
in the last few years to capitalize on the demand for technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But as those stocks began to plunge, fund managers needed to
sell to cut their losses, Bonnel said.
</P>
<P>
   Information on specific funds that have sold shares in the past
few days wasn't available Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Individual fund investors seemed to take the market's mood
swings in stride.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Methner, a retired investor in Denver who invests only in
conservative so-called value funds, said he pays no attention to
''market hiccups.''
</P>
<P>
   Value funds try to invest in solid companies whose stocks are
undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't even turned on the television or listened to the
radio today to see what the markets are doing because I'm not
selling or buying. Daily occurrences don't affect my investment
strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the larger fund families, there were few signs of panic.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tenor of our calls today was strictly business as usual,''
said John Demming, a spokesman at Vanguard Group, the second
largest U.S. mutual fund company.

<HEADLINE> Bush Touts Tax Plan As Boon  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Flanked by single mothers and working
families, George W. Bush argued Monday that the real winners in his
$438 billion tax-cut package are those ''living on the outskirts of
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive GOP presidential nominee used a high school
appearance to rip into Democratic rival Al Gore on both taxes and
gun control, accusing the vice president of flip flops and a dearth
of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want four more years of Clinton-Gore, I'm not the right
guy,'' Bush declared in President Clinton's home state.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor used the focus on tax-filing deadline day to
argue that fewer issues offer a starker contrast with Gore than
taxes, and to claim that his package focuses on blue-collar
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejected the ''risky'' label Gore and other Democrats apply
to his five-year tax cut plan in arguing that it would eat up too
much of the expected budget surplus and plunge the nation back into
deficit spending. Bush also dismissed critics who say his plan
would help the rich more.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's risky is overtaxing the people who work for a living in
America,'' said Bush, who criticized Gore for not convincing fellow
Democrats in Congress to get rid of the so-called tax marriage
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for Vice President Al Gore to stand up and show some
leadership,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane quickly fired back, repeating the
campaign's charges that Bush is offering ''an irresponsible, risky
tax scheme'' but conceding that taxes is a clear difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a real choice,'' said Lehane. ''The American people
will have to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush argued that troubling news on the stock market and economic
nervousness underscores the need for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you cut the taxes on people who work, it serves as an
insurance policy against economic downturn,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was pitching tax cuts, Bush got his biggest cheers
when he underscored his anti-abortion views during a question
session. He added, however, that ''people should be realistic''
about what can be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said there is insufficient support for a constitutional
amendment outlawing abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and
to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that people disagree,'' said Bush, who said he
backs the Republican Party platform's strict anti-abortion
language.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Thursday's anniversary of a bloody Columbine High
School shooting in Littleton, Colo., Bush also was questioned about
gun control and a Texas law allowing concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''This law has made Texas a safer place,'' Bush argued, noting
that when Tennessee adopted a similar law ''Al Gore was totally
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would sign a bill that mandated the sale of trigger locks
with guns,'' Bush added. ''It's one thing to have a trigger lock
sold with a gun, it's another thing to encourage people to use
them.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a distinct working class feel to Bush's campaign swing
Monday. He visited a town that's headquarters to the blue-collar
retailing giant Wal-Mart and toured a museum touting the company's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want tax relief to go to everybody ...,'' said Bush. ''Money
will go to people in families who are living on the outskirts of
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   In a high school gymnasium, packed with about 500 students and
adults, Bush was introduced by Kim Jenning, a single mother who
made $20,000 and said she would pay no taxes under Bush's plan,
saving $830.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, however, noted that the
richest 5 percent of Americans would get more than 50 percent of
the Bush tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign set up a Web site, allowing people who have
incomes of $100,000 or less to figure how much they would save with
Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC posted a rival Web site, ''millionairesforbush.com,''
that calculates the tax bill for people making $1 million or more.
''What a boon the Bush tax scheme is for the wealthiest
Americans,'' the DNC said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his tax-cut plan would spend barely a quarter of the
projected budget surplus over 10 years. Experts peg the cost of
Bush's tax plan at up to $1.3 trillion over 10 years, while
estimates of the projected budget surplus range from $900 billion
to $1.9 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, back in Washington after a weekend fund-raising swing
through California, took the day off at home. His White House staff
circuitously picked their way through police checkpoints to report
to work on a day when much of the capital was shut down by
protesters outside the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

<HEADLINE> Citigroup Posts 49 Pct. Profit Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Citigroup Inc. reported an impressive 49 percent
profit increase for the first-quarter, easily topping Wall Street's
expectations as the nation's largest financial service company
reaped the benefits of the economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, which owns Citibank, Travelers Insurance and the
Salomon Smith Barney investment bank, reported net income of $3.59
billion, or $1.04 a share. Analysts had expected the company to
earn just 78 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   In the year-ago quarter, Citigroup had net income of $2.42
billion, or 68 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue totaled $17.50 billion, up 19 percent from $14.66
billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are very well positioned going forward in all of our
businesses,'' said Sanford I. Weill, chairman and co-chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The recent turbulence in the stock markets and the threat of
higher interest rates -- often bad news for banks -- haven't dimmed
Weill's view.
</P>
<P>
   ''One never enjoys watching significant market corrections,'' he
said. ''As far as our company's position, long term, events like
this should put us in a better position, vis-a-vis what's happening
on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based company is spending a lot of money to expand
its brand online. The company lost $93 million on its e-Citi effort
in the quarter, up from a loss of $35 million in the first quarter
last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of just a few areas where Citigroup isn't making money.
</P>
<P>
   Citibank's banking and mortgage income rose 27 percent to $610
million in the quarter. Meanwhile, Salomon Smith Barney's income
from underwriting stock offerings and advising on mergers and
acquisitions totaled $957 million, a 48 percent increase over the
year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The Travelers Insurance Group was one of the weaker performers
with income rising 12 percent to $381 million.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's shares rose $1.25 to $59.25 in trading at 4:30 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bush Earned Estimated $1.3 Million  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush earned an
estimated $1.3 million last year and paid $514,000 in taxes,
according to a statement his campaign released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife Laura donated $210,000 to churches and
charities, including the $130,000 in royalties from Bush's
autobiography, ''A Charge to Keep.'' Royalties from the book were
earmarked for scouting and other groups working with youth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's income includes his $115,345 salary as governor, and
investment income from state and federal blind trusts in his name.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign said copies of his tax returns were not released
because of a complex financial picture for Bush because of the
blind trusts. Executives of those trusts prepare tax returns
independently and then provide the Bush family with a copy.
</P>
<P>
   No tax return has been delivered and ''therefore the campaign
assumes an extension has been filed, as has been the case in
previous years because information from the state trust is not
available until later in the year,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the country, Monday was tax filing day because April
15 fell on a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Vice President Al Gore disclosed that he and wife
Tipper paid $59,178 in income taxes in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores reported adjusted gross income of $240,792, placing
them in the top 2 percent income bracket. The figure includes the
vice president's salary of $175,400.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's income of $1.3 million was an estimate provided by his
accountant, the campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal financial disclosure report filed in May, Bush said
he owned $7 million in U.S. Treasury notes and estimated the blind
trust's worth at $1 million. He had two money market accounts worth
up to $1.25 million each.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Bushes paid $3.7 million in taxes on an estimated
income of $18.4 million, the bulk of which came from the sale of
Bush's interest in the Texas Rangers baseball team.

<HEADLINE> Eli Lilly Profits Rise 18 Percent  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SKILES LUKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Eli Lilly &AMP; Co.'s first-quarter profits rose
a better-than-expected 18 percent, fueled by strong sales of the
drugmaker's schizophrenia and diabetes medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding unusual items, Lilly's net income in the quarter was
$692.3 million, or 63 cents a share, up from $625.7 million, or 56
cents per share, a year ago. Results beat Wall Street analysts'
expectations by two cents, according to First Call/Thompson
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose to $2.54 billion from $2.26 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Prozac, which makes up nearly a quarter of Lilly's
revenues, rose 1 percent in the quarter to $596.2 million from
$589.9 million. Sales of the depression drug rose 2 percent in the
United States but plummeted by 35 percent overseas due to generic
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Zyprexa, a schizophrenia medicine, rose 14 percent to
$458.1 million from $401.2 million. In March, the Food and Drug
Administration approved the drug for the treatment of manic
depression.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis-based company's diabetes products, including
the pill Actos and insulin Humulin, rose 53 percent to $392 million
from $256.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the cancer drug Gemzar rose 19 percent to $136 million
$from $114.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Two one-time events in the quarter were the company realizing a
$214 million profit from the sale of claims processing firm Kinetra
to Healtheon/WebMD. In addition, about $91 million of sales that
normally would have been realized during the first quarter of 2000
were realized during the fourth quarter of 1999 due to Y2K-related
wholesaler buying.
</P>
<P>
   Including these events, sales increased 13 percent to $2.54
billion and operating income increased 16 percent to $874.1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly stock rose $2.56\ to $70 in trading at 4:30 p.m. Monday on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> France Details Looted Jewish Assets  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Calling the extent of wartime looting ''stunning,''
France on Monday acknowledged that $1.3 billion in assets was
confiscated from Jews during World War II -- including 50,000
businesses -- but that most property and money was returned to
survivors or their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000-page report, prepared by a special government
commission and headed by former French resistance fighter Jean
Matteoli, is France's answer to charges that the nation has been
unwilling to face its own role in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The report outlined the collaborationist Vichy regime's
systematic looting of Jewish property -- from bank accounts and
insurance policies to art works and pianos -- as well as postwar
restitution policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We discovered that the extent of the looting was far greater
than we thought, but the good news is that restitutions after the
war were also greater than we had thought,'' historian Claire
Andrieu told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Of the bank accounts dormant since 1945, only 5 percent have not
found their rightful owners or heirs, Andrieu said, adding that the
commission studied the banking situation ''account by account.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission Vice President Ady Steg said about $294 million in
assets was never returned to the rightful owners. The commission
has recommended that the funds go toward creating a Holocaust
foundation in France.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an important moment when our country can look lucidly
at part of its past,'' said Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, adding
that he agreed in principle with the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Three years in the making, the report distinguished between the
widespread confiscation of Jewish property by Vichy, eager to keep
French-owned assets in France, and Nazi looting.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis emptied some 30,000 Jewish apartments, shipping the
contents to Germany. They also seized valuable art works owned by
Jewish dealers and collectors in a plan established long before the
1940 invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Matteoli said it was ''profoundly revolting'' that the Vichy
government as early as 1940 took ''measures that went beyond what
the Nazis demanded.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is something we did not want to hide,'' he told a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Vichy's anti-Jewish measures banned Jews from many professions
and owning businesses. Bank accounts were frozen, insurance
policies and stock certificates were confiscated. Some 50,000
Jewish-owned companies were ''aryanized'' -- turned over to
non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Jews interned at French-run transit camps before being
transferred to Auschwitz were stripped of all personal possessions.
Their valuables were sold, and the proceeds were then turned over
to the French national deposit bank, which holds the funds today.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most stunning aspect of our findings is the extent of the
looting,'' historian Annette Wieviorka told The Associated Press.
''Every Jew in France was affected, from the poorest tailor to the
richest art collector.''
</P>
<P>
   About 76,000 Jews, including 12,000 children -- about a quarter
of the Jews living in France -- were deported from France to Nazi
death camps between 1941-44. Only about 2,500 survived.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that of the 2,000 unclaimed art works
looted by the Nazis and recovered in Germany after the war -- and
currently held by France's National Museums Authority, only 163
were seized from Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The report proposed that several art works with no known heirs
be donated to the Israeli Museum in Jerusalem as testimony to the
Nazi looting, and that the remainder become part of the French
national collections.
</P>
<P>
   The commission continues to handle individual claims for
restitution, and about 4,500 requests have been received so far.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Elects Tutsi for President  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- A former rebel leader whose forces stopped
the 1994 genocide was chosen on Monday as president of Rwanda, the
nation's first Tutsi leader since independence in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Kagame, 43, who previously had rejected the top post out of
fear of antagonizing the Hutu majority, was chosen president by the
Parliament and the Cabinet in an 81-5 secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame, who had been acting president since last month, won out
over Charles Muligande, also a leader in the Rwandan Patriotic
Front, the country's major political force.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame provisionally replaced the president, Pasteur Bizimungu,
in March when Bizimungu, a 49-year-old Hutu, stepped down amid
accusations of incompetence and rumors of conflict with the
Patriotic Front.
</P>
<P>
   After the results of Monday's vote were announced, Kagame
received a rousing ovation from lawmakers and government officials
in the National Assembly building in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame was slated to be sworn in Saturday by the Supreme Court
as Rawanda's fifth president since independence.
</P>
<P>
   The RPF is made up of Tutsi exiles who won power in 1994 after
stopping the then-extremist Hutu government's slaughter of more
than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the RPF and seven other political parties made up of
both Hutus and Tutsis have ruled Rwanda in a transitional
government, appointing the Cabinet and the 70-seat National
Assembly under a power-sharing formula.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the government put off elections and extended the
transition period to 2003, arguing that ethnic tensions stemming
from the mass killings are too high for a free ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Senior RPF officials said they would meet soon to make the
decision on a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said one of Kagame's adies likely would get the job of
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame's earlier reluctance to take the top post also stemmed
from confirming the perception that the minority Tutsis rule the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But RPF members said Tutsis should be eligible for any political
position, and not discriminated against as they had been since
Rwanda gained independence from Belgium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, hundreds of thousands of Tutsi families were forced
into exile and their land confiscated under Hutu President Gregoire
Kayibanda.

<HEADLINE> Film Sales Lift Kodak's 1Q Profits  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Eastman Kodak Co. reported a 15 percent
increase in first-quarter profits Monday thanks to higher film
sales and narrowing losses in its digital photography business.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding one-time charges, the world's biggest photography
company earned $297 million, or 95 cents a share, compared with
$259 million, or 80 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.
Revenues were unchanged at $3.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat Wall Street analysts' expectations of 93 cents
a share, as reported by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Including one-time charges, Kodak's net profit totaled $289
million, or 93 cents a share, up 51 percent from $191 million, or
59 cents a share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Company shares rose 31\ cents to $61.81\ in trading at 4:30 p.m.
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak benefited from continued cost savings during the quarter
but incurred $8 million in after-tax costs associated with closing
its Elmgrove manufacturing hub in Rochester. A year ago, earnings
were reduced $68 million by a variety of restructuring charges.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its revenues from film sales rose 2 percent in
the United States and 3 percent worldwide during the quarter, with
higher volumes offsetting a 3 percent fall in prices and the
negative impact of a strong U.S. dollar in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging-market sales accelerated 16 percent in the quarter,
helped by robust performances in China, India, Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Losses in digital photography, the recording of images on
computer chips, continued to narrow to $4 million in the quarter
from $12 million a year ago -- helped by Kodak's inclusion in the
category of digital products sold to the graphics industry.
</P>
<P>
   Digital products revenues increased 15 percent to $706 million
from $612 million a year ago, boosted by a 62 percent jump in sales
of consumer digital cameras and robust sales of health-imaging
scanners.
</P>
<P>
   Kodak has benefited from stronger volumes in the key U.S.
consumer film market, where falling prices have pinched margins.
The market has been softening over the last year since being roiled
by a price war sparked by Japanese nemesis Fuji in 1997. That
battle led to around 20,000 jobs cuts at Kodak.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive Dan Carp cautioned that sales, expected to grow
between 6 percent and 7 percent this year, could be reduced by 1
percentage point if the dollar remained strong against other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Carp took over Jan. 1 from George Fisher, who stepped down as
CEO after a turbulent, six-year reign. Fisher is staying on as
chairman until Dec. 31.

<HEADLINE> Bank of America's Profits Rise  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NOWELL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Bank of America Corp. said Monday its
profits climbed almost 17 percent in the first quarter as the
nation's second-largest bank benefitted from growth in securities
trading and investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte-based Bank of America earned $2.24 billion, or $1.33 a
share, beating Wall Street's average estimate of $1.24 a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America earned $1.92 billion, or $1.08 a share, in the
first quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are gaining market share in many investment banking
products as we meet more of our business clients' financial
needs,'' said Hugh L. McColl, chairman and chief executive officer.
''Our customer retention continues to improve, and we are having
good success in rewarding customers who bring more of their
business to our company.''
</P>
<P>
   A 26 percent jump in Bank of America's non-interest income more
than offset a 1 percent decline in net-interest income.
</P>
<P>
   Strong revenues from trading, investment banking and
underwriting fees pushed non-interest income to $4.05 billion from
$3.22 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's net-interest income, however, was squeezed by
unfavorable interest-rate spreads between what the bank paid on
deposits and charged on loans. Net-interest income totaled $4.60
billion in the quarter, down slightly from $4.65 billion in the
year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of America's stock rose 37{ cents to $50.31\ a share in
trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   McColl also noted that online banking enrollments increased to
125,000 per month, from a pace of 80,000 per month a year ago.
Total online retail customers rose to more than 2.1 million, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the bank's web site increased by more than 70
percent, and consumer loan products sold over the Internet
increased by 300 percent, the bank said in its earnings release.
</P>
<P>
   With $633 billion in assets and more than 4,500 branches in 21
states, Bank of America serves more than 30 million households and
2 million businesses.

<HEADLINE> RJ Reynolds Earnigs Top Expectations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Increased cigarette sales helped R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Holdings post a 5 percent increase in earnings in
the first quarter, beating Wall Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's second biggest tobacco company earned $80 million,
or 77 cents a diluted share, up from $76 million, or 70 cents a
share, from ongoing operations in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The latest results, helped by a 14 percent increase in sales of
Reynolds' cigarette brands and an active share repurchase program,
were ahead of analysts' consensus expectations. Analysts forecast
earnings of 74 cents per share for the first quarter, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds shares rose 62{ cents to $18.68} in trading Monday at
4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Net sales for the quarter were $1.92 billion, up 14 percent from
$1.69 billion for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing operations figures for a year ago exclude onetime
items related to last year's sale of international tobacco
operations and Reynolds' spinoff from RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes began operating
on its own in June after being spun off from RJR Nabisco Holdings
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Tobacco's volume for the first quarter was 23 billion units,
up 2.9 percent from 22.4 billion units in the first quarter of
1999. The company attributed the increased volume to shifts in
wholesale and retail buying patterns, rather than to an increase in
cigarette consumption.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Tobacco's retail share of market through February was 23.5
percent, reflecting a slight decline from its fourth-quarter 1999
share of 23.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Convictions in Israeli Bridge Fall  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Five Israelis were convicted Monday in
the death of four Australian athletes who were killed when a
rickety footbridge collapsed at the beginning of the 1997 Maccabiah
games, known as the Jewish Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The court blamed the chairman of the Maccabiah, the engineer who
built the bridge, the director of the company that staged the event
and two contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Elterman, the father of 18-year-old Australian Sasha
Elterman, who ingested a poisonous fungus from the polluted river
she and the others were dumped into, said he was pleased with the
verdict. After more than 30 operations, Elterman remains seriously
ill, her father said.
</P>
<P>
   In an Olympics-like opening ceremony on July 14, 1997,
delegations of athletes were supposed to enter the main stadium by
crossing the footbridge over the polluted Yarkon River. With the
Austrian and Australian athletes waiting on the bridge, it suddenly
buckled, dumping them into the water. Four died and 64 were
injured.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict blamed the defendants for using a traditional
Israeli ''trust me'' method of bypassing procedures and
regulations. Each level assured the one below that the bridge
construction was being carried out properly, but no one checked.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bridge was thrown up in less than a month with no
blueprint, no foundation and inadequate materials. It was designed
by an engineer who had never crafted a similar bridge before,
constructed by a contractor who had no experience in building
bridges and supervised by no one, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Mordechai Peled said, ''Allowing a contractor to work
without supervision is like telling a student that his teacher will
not check his work.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges heaped scorn on project engineer Micha Bar-Ilan,
noting that he has a doctorate in engineering and lectures at a
university, yet he built a bridge that was doomed to collapse and
did not keep an eye on the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Bar-Ilan's lawyer, Avraham Landstein, said he would
''definitely'' appeal. Pre-sentencing arguments are to be heard May
11. The charges carry maximum 5-year prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that Yoram Eyal, the chairman of the Maccabiah
organizing committee, ''tested the bridge by jumping on it to see
if it swayed.'' According to regulations, the bridge should have
been ten times as strong as it was.
</P>
<P>
   The court convicted the Maccabiah games organizer and
contractors along with Eyal and Bar-Ilan on the same charges of
criminal negligence, drawing no distinction among them about
responsibility for the collapse.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Israeli courts have come under criticism for
blaming workers and clearing managers. In a case that set the
standard over a decade ago, a military court sent a gatekeeper to
prison after a guerrilla infiltrated an army base after landing
nearby in a hang glider, but cleared officers of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Australia, Colin Elterman said he
hoped that Maccabiah organizers would learn the lesson of the
verdict, ''that they will realize that they are morally
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Eyal told reporters in the courtroom that the tragedy was a
personal blow to him since he knew all the victims. ''I feel I hold
full responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Israeli board members of the Maccabiah games said
they would suspend themselves until a meeting of the organization's
international body next month, Israel Television reported.

<HEADLINE> Garbo's Personal Letters Released  </HEADLINE>
By MEKI COX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- For years, rumors have circulated of a love
affair between Greta Garbo and socialite Mercedes de Acosta, but
the letters thought to hold the women's secret remained sealed on
Acosta's order. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Garbo's writings to Acosta -- 113 items including 25 letters,
notes, telegrams, photos and poems -- were opened on the 10th
anniversary of the actress's death Saturday, and about half of them
were laid out Monday before the media at the Rosenbach Museum and
Library.
</P>
<P>
   The writings chronicle a 28-year friendship of ups and downs,
but they give no explicit evidence of a lesbian relationship, said
the actress's grandniece Gray Reisfield Horan, 40, who witnesses
the unsealing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Garbo's mystery remains intact,'' she said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Acosta gave the letters to the Rosenbach in 1960 with the
stipulation they not be opened until 10 years after both women were
dead. Acosta, who wrote in her autobiography about a deep
relationship with Garbo, died in 1968. Garbo died April 15, 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the writings will open to the public Tuesday through
June 4 along with tidbits from the women's past, including a
tracing of Garbo's foot and Acosta's bible with cutout photos of
Garbo pasted inside. The entire collection will be available only
to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The museum would not allow excerpts of the letters to be
directly quoted, citing the Garbo estate, which is reserving the
right to publish the material.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that the letters didn't say anything explicit, like I
love you or I need you, says a lot,'' said Garbo biographer Karen
Swenson. ''Mercedes would have demanded that from her lover and
pasted it in her Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Other researchers may see something different,'' Swenson said.
''If they feel the need to see lesbianism, they'll see it.
</P>
<P>
   ''But for anyone to have expected she would say anything
explicitly was contrary to Garbo's character.''
</P>
<P>
   Garbo was one of the world's most famous recluses. After
starring in 26 films, including ''Anna Christie,'' ''Mata Hari''
and ''Grand Hotel,'' she walked away from Hollywood in 1941 for a
life insulated from the public and press.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years earlier, she had met Acosta, a woman who also claimed
affairs with actress Marlene Dietrich and dancer Isadora Duncan.
The letters chronicle Acosta and Garbo's on-and-off relationship
from 1931 to 1959.
</P>
<P>
   According to Swenson, the first year was probably the most
''intense part of their relationship, whether it was sexual or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Later letters reveal a friendship involving visits and birthday
wishes and told of Garbo's boyfriend, her unhappiness with acting
and various health problems. In one, Garbo told Acosta of her
wishes to be left alone. Years later, they were back on friendly
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship ended abruptly when Garbo discovered Acosta was
writing her memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   In Acosta's 1960 autobiography, ''Here Lies the Heart,'' Acosta
wrote of trips she and Garbo made to Stockholm, Sweeden and a
private cabin in the Sierra Nevada. For some, the book demonstrated
that the two were lovers, but other researchers say Acosta
embellished some of her anecdotes.

<HEADLINE> Campaign finance reform bill heads to governor  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A bill that would use taxpayer dollars to
pay for political races and creates voluntary spending caps on
campaigns narrowly cleared a final legislative hurdle Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign finance reform bill passed the House 77-71 and
heads to Gov. John G. Rowland. Only one Republican voted for the
measure Monday. Three GOP senators voted for the bill last week.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said the governor has not decided
whether he will sign the bill. Rowland had stipulated he would only
sign a bill that had bipartisan support
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill won't accomplish the dreams of its most ardent
admirers and it won't produce the nightmares its opponents say it
will,'' said Rep. Alex Knopp, D-Norwalk. ''It will move us a giant
step forward to campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans blasted the bill, saying it will drain millions of
dollars from the General Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe we should be using tax money to pay for
political speech,'' said House Minority Leader Robert Ward,
R-Northford. ''It is a mistake to begin to use tax dollars on
political campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would establish a Citizens Elections Fund to collect
cash to pay for campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The money would largely come from voluntary income and corporate
tax check-offs, drawing as much as $7.7 million from the General
Fund each year. With other donations, the fund is expected to raise
up to $9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gubernatorial candidates who raise $500,000 on their own would
qualify for public dollars if they agreed to spend no more than $6
million beginning in 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for other constitutional offices such as treasurer
and attorney general would get public funding if they raised
$75,000 on their own and capped their spending at $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   In 2004, voluntary spending limits would be set for House races
at $50,000; Senate races would be capped at $130,000. Critics say
the legislative caps are irrelevant because candidates historically
raise far less than those limits. Gov. Rowland had threatened to
veto any bill that did not include limits on legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, if only one candidate agrees to spending limits,
that person would receive taxpayer money matching every dollar over
the limit spent by the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The House earlier this month narrowly passed a similar bill that
capped gubernatorial races at $4 million. GOP lawmakers said that
voluntary limit was too low and was a political slap at Rowland,
who raised $6 million during his last election.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate then raised the voluntary cap to $6 million, and the
House OK'd that increase Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said the bill creates an unfair advantage to
incumbents and favored candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, gubernatorial candidates who win their party
endorsement would be eligible for $1.5 million of public financing.
Candidates who win 15 percent of the vote at the party's nominating
convention would receive $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The House defeated by one vote a Republican amendment that would
have made all candidates eligible for $1.5 million if they won
support from at least 15 percent of convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not fair,'' said Rep. Ronald San Angelo, R-Naugatuck,
''That's not equitable. It puts challengers at a three-to-one
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of capping expenditures, opponents said the bill should
ban special interest money from organizations such as political
action committees, lobbyists and unions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would does limit donations from private contributors
and business PACs.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance reform advocates applauded the bill Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not so sure the governor is going to veto this,'' said
Karen Hobert Flynn, executive director of Common Cause/Connecticut.
''We've tried to address Republican concerns with the bill, and
we've been successful.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 276; Record Nasdaq Gain  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Big-name technology stocks sprang back to life
Monday, driving the Nasdaq composite index to a record point gain,
as investors mustered some confidence to hunt for bargains in the
wreckage of last week's selling frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average each rose more
than 200 points after alternating between positive and negative
territory throughout the session. But on the broad market, most
stocks fell again as the bargain hunters remained leery of smaller
companies with less predictable revenues and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the spurts of buying, analysts said it was too soon to
tell if Wall Street was truly recovering from last week's plunge,
which slashed nearly $2 trillion from the market's value.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq rose 217.87 to 3,539.16 with nearly all the gain
coming in the final hour of the session, topping the previous
one-day record of 178.89 points.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dow rose 276.74 to 10,582.51. Leading the charge
were bellwether technology stocks such as Hewlett-Packard, Intel
and IBM, which together added the equivalent of 150 points to the
Dow.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Intel, high-tech favorites like Cisco Systems and
Sun Microsystems dominated the 6.5 percent gain by the Nasdaq
index, which last week lost one quarter of its value.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's too early to call a bottom, but today is evidence that
these low levels have sparked quite a bit buying interest,'' said
Bob Dickey, market analyst at Dain Rauscher Wessels in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was renewed interest in the biggest and most
popular companies that tumbled last week, the broad market
struggled all day, with declining issues outnumbering advancers by
nearly a 3-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will take time to heal. While we have some bargain
hunters, we have a lot of investors who were hurt very badly, so
it's not likely that the market will regain its enthusiasm very
quickly,'' said Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was encouraging to see signs of stability, especially
since foreign markets had tumbled overnight in reaction to Friday's
brutal slide on Wall Street, which sliced a record 617 points off
the Dow and a record 355 points off the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, analysts noted how the market bounced from its
downturns on Monday, suggesting that investors weren't panicking at
the first sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had several selloff attempts, and yet the market held up.
When the market just wouldn't fall victim to the selling attempts,
that encouraged people to get back in,'' said Eugene E. Peroni Jr.,
director of equity research at John Nuveen &AMP; Co. in Radnor, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, worried that rising inflation and interest rates will
cut into company profits, investors began dumping stocks in just
about every sector of the market along with the speculative
high-flyers from the Internet boom. The Dow was left 12 percent
below its record high, while the Nasdaq fell to 34 percent below
the record it reached March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly helping sentiment on Monday were some more strong
profit reports on the first three months of the year, this time
from Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, Eastman Kodak and Ford Motor.
</P>
<P>
   Among other leading market measures, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 44.88 to 1,401.44. The Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies rose 5.45 to 459.18.
</P>
<P>
   Among the day's big gainers, Intel rose 12{ to 123,
Hewlett-Packard rose 10} to 133}, IBM rose 6~ to 111~, Cisco rose
9{ to 66{ and Sun rose 8] to 84~.
</P>
<P>
   Volume of all stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange
totaled 1.44 billion shares, down from 1.57 billion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 6.98 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index fell 0.38 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 fell 2.97 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.09 percent.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Water Shortage Is Critical  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Abdul Nadir bowed his head and prayed
Monday for an end to a prolonged dry spell that has turned his
golden wheat fields into dry stubble.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out over his fields on the western edge of the Afghan
capital of Kabul, the 65-year-old Nadir said there is little else
for him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a tough year,'' he said, shaking his head. ''All
our hard labor is for nothing. We won't get a single morsel of
wheat from our fields because there is no water.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban religious army that rules 90 percent of Afghanistan
has been asking people to pray for rain, both in and around Kabul
and in southern Afghanistan, also hard hit by the dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   In Kandahar and Helmand provinces in the south, the World Food
Program has brought in tons of feed for dying cattle. Some
estimates say 60 percent of the cattle in the region have already
died as a result of water shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The drought is being blamed on light snowfall snow during winter
and no rain so far this spring. The Kabul River, which is usually
swollen this time of year, is dry. Two of the three dams that
provide water and power to Kabul are almost dry. The third one is
barely half-full.
</P>
<P>
   Some aid workers say the drought is the worst to hit Afghanistan
in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the worst in decades and these are just the initial
days of the drought,'' said Abdul Baqi Afzali, of the Danish
Committee for Aid to Afghan Refugees. ''People have yet to feel its
full effect. The crisis will become severe in the days ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Without international aid, the drought could result in a famine,
he warned. More than 85 percent Afghanistan's population is
dependent on agriculture or cattle breeding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Agriculture production will fall sharply this year, increasing
Afghanistan's dependence on outside help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan is already heavily dependent on international aid.
More than half of Kabul's 750,000 people rely on food provided by
the United Nations and other international aid groups. Bakeries
have been set up throughout Kabul to provide subsidized bread to
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of war have compounded the problem for impoverished
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Almost 70 percent of our irrigation system is destroyed so
people rely on the rains,'' said Maulvi Ahmed Jan, the Taliban's
minister for water and power.
</P>
<P>
   International aid is needed to rebuild the irrigation systems,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign donors have been reluctant to invest in Afghanistan
because of the Taliban's harsh brand of Islamic law that bars women
from work and education, forces men to wear beards and outlaws all
light entertainment, including music and television.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need foreign help to rebuild our systems,'' said Jan. ''But
unfortunately it's not there.''

<HEADLINE> Two DEA Agents on Leave During Probe  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN SKORNECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two Drug Enforcement Administration agents
have been taken off duty temporarily as investigators probe an
alleged bribery and obstruction of justice scam by two Miami men,
the agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA spokesman Terry Parman denied the two agents -- Larry
Castillo and David Tinsley, both part of a DEA enforcement group in
Florida -- were suspended. He said the two agents are not accused of
any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pending further inquiry by our Office of Professional
Responsibility, the agents were placed on administrative leave.
They were basically asked to stay home (with pay),'' said Parman.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation involves an alleged scheme of two Miami men
who used their status as occasional informants for U.S. law
enforcement agencies to scam narcotics traffickers, possibly of
millions of dollars, according to an FBI affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit says that the two men -- Baruch Jairo Vega and
Roman Hernando Suarez Lopez -- took money from indicted and
unindicted narcotics traffickers, and in return promised them they
could get federal agents to drop the charges or get their sentences
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to sources who have spoken with several of these
drug traffickers, Vega and Suarez's fees have ranged from $6
million to $100 million,'' FBI agent John C. Jones claimed in the
March 22 affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit cites a witness who allegedly paid Vega and Suarez
$3.5 million for help in connection with his own indictment and
that of several family members.
</P>
<P>
   That witness, who was not identified in the affidavit, reported
that Vega said about 80 percent of the money typically was ''paid
to important people in Washington'' while Vega and Suarez kept the
rest, the affidavit says.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit provides no evidence of wrongdoing by Washington
or other law enforcement officials even as it recounts that
cooperating witness' tale of a meeting with four DEA agents and a
Miami police officer in a Panama hotel room in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting lasted several hours, during which the agents
discussed the procedures for the surrender and cooperation of the
(witness') indicted family members,'' Jones wrote.

<HEADLINE> Hespe releases preschool standards, child advocates say more isneeded  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Preschool standards released Monday are a
nice first step, but New Jersey's poorest school districts need
more help to set up court-ordered, quality preschools, some
educators and child advocates said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't give a district any guidance on how to put together
high quality programs,'' Tom Dunn, superintendent of Elizabeth
schools, said of the 72-page document, ''Early Childhood Education
Program Expectations: Standards of Quality.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say they're high on expectations and low on standards,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Trenton superintendent James Lytle, who was a member of the
committee that wrote the standards, said they provide districts
with the right amount of guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's meant to be a kind of curriculum and instructional
framework for teachers and early childhood program providers,''
said Lytle.
</P>
<P>
   The standards are a collection of goals and activities for
various subject areas, including art, music, science, language
arts, social development and foreign language.
</P>
<P>
   They include lists of ''expectations,'' such as ''All children
will develop self-confidence and self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   The standards also offer broad goals for creating a good
classroom environment and getting parents involved in their
preschoolers' education.
</P>
<P>
   Lytle said people who are disappointed in the standards have
another agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they want is something that gives them more leverage for
squeezing the department and the state for additional funding,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner David Hespe said the document is a first
step toward guiding districts on creating high quality programs. He
promised more detailed direction.
</P>
<P>
   Hespe was meeting an April 17 deadline imposed by the state
Supreme Court in its latest ruling in the 30-year-old school
funding fight. That ruling required the commissioner to issue clear
standards for these court-ordered programs, which are being
developed in 30 of New Jersey's poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   Research has shown that providing poor children with quality
preschool is one of the best ways to ensure their success later in
school.
</P>
<P>
   In its last ruling in March, the court said the state is failing
to implement quality preschool programs. The justices ordered
several changes to the state's plan, including moving up the
deadline for having certified preschool teachers from 2004 to 2001.
The court also ordered the state to reduce permissible class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that ruling, districts can submit revised
preschool plans -- and request additional funding -- by May.
</P>
<P>
   But David Sciarra, director of the Education Law Center, which
represents poor children in the school funding fight, said the new
standards fail to meet the court's first requirement and they give
the districts no guidance for creating new plans.
</P>
<P>
   He said the standards lack guidance on teacher quality,
facilities, health and social services and transportation. Without
that guidance, the districts can't submit revised plans by May.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court called for substantive guidance so districts could
revise preschool plans to reach uniform, high quality programs,''
Sciarra said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All these expectations are fine, but if you don't have the
teachers you need, adequate space, supplies, support staff,
transportation and all the other ingredients that are necessary,
then children are not going to have the chance to learn them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sciarra also noted that Gov. Christie Whitman's proposed budget
includes no new state money for preschool programs. She is tapping
into $69 million in federal welfare funds that will go primarily to
daycare centers providing preschool to many of the estimated 50,000
eligible children.
</P>
<P>
   Ceil Zalkind, associate director of the Association for Children
of New Jersey, also said the state needs to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ''They describe what to do, but not how to get there,'' said
Zalkind. ''This is the first real program content document and, in
that regard, I think it's good. It is clearly not an implementation
guide to assist districts. There's still an enormous amount of
confusion for districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Zalkind said some key unanswered questions are: Do districts
provide transportation? How do they assess the quality of a child
care program? How are daycare centers going to get teachers
certified in time to meet the court's deadline? Who's going to pay
for it?
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are the basics and they're not getting those questions
answered,'' said Zalkind.

'The Real Thing' Ponders Love   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As Cole Porter once wrote, ''What is this thing
called love?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question that keeps coming back again and again to haunt
the discombobulated characters in ''The Real Thing,'' Tom
Stoppard's generous meditation on fidelity and faithlessness that
remains as potent today as when the play first opened on Broadway
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the current revival, which arrived Monday at the Ethel
Barrymore Theater, seems even more vibrant, particularly under
David Leveaux's careful, cinematic but not fussy direction.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dillane and the rest of a fine British cast from
London's Donmar Warehouse mine Stoppard's brilliant wordplay with
such intensity that ''The Real Thing'' feels freshly minted,
spontaneous and not at all dated, as do so many dramas from the
not-so-distant past.
</P>
<P>
   Dillane portrays a romantically challenged English playwright
named Henry, a sardonic intellectual, too smart for his own good
and a man who uses his intelligence to keep women at bay. It
prevents him from making a commitment, not only, as the play opens,
to his actress-wife, Charlotte, but to his lover, Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Annie, in turn, is cheating on husband Max, who is appearing
with Charlotte in Henry's new comedy about adultery, ''House of
Cards.'' Life and art get thoroughly mixed up -- and more than a bit
messy -- in Stoppard's world of London artists.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry and Annie finally settle down together, strains begin
to show. Annie becomes enamored of a young actor, forcing Henry to
rethink what his relationship to her really means. Love, he learns,
is more than lust and the banalities uttered in the beloved pop
songs of his youth.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes him reexamine his life as a playwright,
particularly when he has to learn how to come to terms with Annie's
most persistent charity case -- a loutish leftist, who happens to be
a terrible writer. And that, according to Henry, is the worst sin
of all.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, originally played on Broadway by Jeremy Irons, is a
marathon role. Dillane, a wiry guy with an ingratiating stage
presence, goes the course without tiring. He's funny and charming,
but he gets the pain behind the writer's glibness and cutting
retorts, too. By the end of the play, Henry has grown, and so has
Dillane's remarkable performance.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ehle has less to work with as the socially committed
Annie, yet she projects a passion that is not always suggested by
the script. Sarah Woodward brings a tart, acerbic quality to the
role of Henry's first wife, while Nigel Lindsay, as Max, perfectly
captures a wronged mate's overwhelming self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   Even the smallest roles make impressions, particularly Oscar
Pearce's flirtatious young actor and Charlotte Parry's portrait of
Henry's practical and sexually precocious daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The production design is spare, almost bare bones, with a few
tables, chairs and a record player suggesting Henry's living room.
Yet the feeling of this revival is anything but minimal. Leveaux,
who worked wonders with his Broadway reexaminations of ''Anna
Christie'' and ''Electra,'' has done it again here. ''The Real
Thing'' rates as real, adult entertainment, wise, witty and full of
compassion for the foibles of the human heart.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Urges McCain To Run  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY H. GRANT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Meeting for the first time Monday, Gov.
Jesse Ventura pressed John McCain to resume his presidential
campaign, but as an independent. However, the Arizona senator
earlier had said that no one -- not even Ventura -- could entice him
to make such a move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will not leave the Republican Party,'' McCain said during a
news conference at the Mall of America before meeting the Minnesota
governor. ''The Republican Party is my home.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, who has said he's unlikely to endorse Al Gore or George
W. Bush, the likely Democratic and Republican presidential
nominees, has said McCain could win as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated that sentiment during the hourlong meeting in his
Capitol office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told him I felt quite strongly he would have a chance to
win'' as a third-party candidate, Ventura said afterward. The two
had talked several times by phone but had not met until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had a very successful campaign,'' the governor said. ''He
was only defeated in the Republican party. As I told the senator,
if he continues on, he might not be defeated in the general
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at the shopping mall, where he signed copies of his
best-selling memoir, ''Faith of My Fathers,'' McCain said leaving
the GOP was not an option for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not considering that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting, the two also discussed their Navy histories,
wrestling, campaign finance reform and getting young and
disenfranchised voters to the polls, said McCain. He also praised
Ventura for using new tools like the Internet to entice people to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Ventura has injected new spirit into politics -- not
only here in Minnesota, but nationally,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He and Ventura also have pushed for changes in the campaign
finance system, and McCain said he has ''every intention'' of
working with the governor on reform issues.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said he emulated a few of Ventura's campaign tactics
such as using the Internet to communicate with voters and talking
straight about issues.
</P>
<P>
   Before the meeting, Ventura had questioned why McCain would only
''suspend'' his campaign if he really was done for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going to happen there? I don't know,'' Ventura said
Friday during his weekly radio show. ''It ought to be pretty
interesting. Maybe we'll get some insight into whether he's truly
out of this race because we know he has only suspended his
campaign, and that always gives you a little bit of suspicion
there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he decided to suspend rather than end the campaign
so that supporters -- who back campaign finance reform -- could still
serve as delegates at the national GOP convention.
</P>
<P>
   He quickly added, ''I do not have any intention of causing
problems at the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, McCain said he would continue spreading his
message of reform.

<HEADLINE> Italian Leader Rejects Resignation  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Italy's president on Monday rejected an offer by
Premier Massimo D'Alema to resign, a day after his center-left
forces suffered a stinging blow in regional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting at the presidential palace, President Carlo Azeglio
Ciampi told D'Alema to put his political fate in parliament's
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will now take my proposal (to resign) to parliament, because
I believe that's the politically sensitive thing to do, because I
have to take into account the success of the opposition in these
elections, and this opposition has long said that this government
should resign,'' D'Alema said after emerging from his talks with
the head of state at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   Senate officials said debate would likely start in the upper
chamber on Wednesday but that the exact schedule would be announced
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As head of state, Ciampi can dissolve parliament or ask for a
confidence vote to test the 18-month-old center-left coalition's
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it would be a mistake to dissolve parliament now,
because the country needs stability at this moment,'' D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
   The victorious conservative opposition led by media mogul and
former Premier Silvio Berlusconi earlier in the day pressed for
parliamentary elections soon. The elections must be held by spring
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Berlusconi's alliance won eight of the 15 regional races in
Sunday's balloting, while D'Alema's forces captured seven. Some 30
million of Italy's 56 million people voted.
</P>
<P>
   Every day D'Alema is in office ''is an affront to the popular
sovereignty,'' said Gianfranco Fini, whose formerly neo-fascist
National Alliance is a key member of Berlusconi's alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives scored big, sweeping the affluent north, in
part thanks to a campaign marriage with Umberto Bossi's Northern
League.
</P>
<P>
   Bossi, an undependable coalition partner, helped bring down
Berlusconi's conservative government in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The center-right's victory weakened D'Alema's prospects for
heading the center-left ticket in the next general election.
</P>
<P>
   ''How long can you govern knowing you have more than half the
country against you?'' asked the Rome daily, Il Messaggero.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly smarting defeat was the loss of Lazio, the region
which includes Rome. The regional presidency was won by the
spokesman for Fini's party, Francesco Storace.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema's Democratic Left kept its hold on central regions.
</P>
<P>
   His coalition ranges from hardline Communists to Greens to
former Communists to the former Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Pietro Folena, second-in-command of the Democratic Left, said
Berlusconi had successfully ''demonized the left'' during the
campaign and turned issues like crime and immigration to the
right's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives have called for tougher crackdowns on crime
and stricter controls on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear why the conservatives did well at
the center-left's expense. The campaigning had dealt little with
issues and instead was dominated by mudslinging by national
politicians.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Rains Claim 15 Lives  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Landslides caused by six days of nearly
nonstop rain have killed 15 people, wrecked homes and forced the
evacuation of dozens of residents in this Andean capital,
authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a total of 15 people dead as a direct result of rain
and landslides, close to 25 people injured to varying degrees and
nearly 30 homes completely destroyed,'' Red Cross representative
Rody Camino told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The rains, coming near the end of the region's September-May
rainy season, started Wednesday and continued nearly nonstop
through the weekend, causing about 150 landslides and prompting the
evacuation of some 180 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had rain before, but not like this, with landslides
inside the city,'' said Quito Mayor Alfonso Lasso.
</P>
<P>
   Lasso said 200 city workers with bulldozers, tractors and other
heavy machinery were working to shore up hillsides and dig out
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's Meteorological Institute said precipitation in the
first half of the month had already reached 5.5 inches and was at a
pace to set a record. Average rainfall for April over the last 15
years has never exceeded 6 inches.
</P>
<P>
   With more rain forecast for coming days, eight city districts
were considered at ''high risk'' of being hit by avalanches, Camino
said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Fails To Buy U.S. Warships  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's failure to persuade the United
States to sell it four high-tech Aegis warships has set back the
island's hopes of bolstering its defenses in the face of mounting
threats by China.
</P>
<P>
   For years, analysts have said Taiwan's military -- with its
highly motivated troops and advanced U.S.-made weapons -- could
repel or at least give China a bloody nose if it ever makes good on
threats to attack this island. Taiwan and China split amid civil
war in 1949, and Beijing has warned it might use force to reunify
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, some analysts have begun doubting Taiwan's war
readiness and have raised questions about whether morale, loyalty
and training have slipped in recent years as this island changed
from a poor, authoritarian society to a prosperous, vibrant
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson Fu, director of the Strategic Studies Institute at the
Armed Forces University, which trains Taiwan's military leaders,
doesn't believe the military is facing a talent crisis and he
doubts there is an ideological conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Those who disagree on the independence issue still share a
common goal, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both want to defend Taiwan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious signs the military is aware of the growing
urgency to attract new talent. A new slick ad being shown on TV and
at movie theaters encourages young, educated Taiwanese to put their
computer skills at work on board warships and jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
   But Damon Bristow, a researcher with Britain's Royal United
Services Institute for Defense Studies, doubts Taiwan's military
would have been able to find enough trained sailors to crew the
Aegis ships, equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles of the kind the
U.S. Navy used in the Kosovo conflict last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taiwanese have reached the saturation level when it comes
to the big things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, President Clinton decided Monday against the sale
of the destroyers. The Pentagon had recommended that the
administration put off Taiwan's request to buy new weapons in order
to avoid angering China.
</P>
<P>
   Bristow, who has spent the past six months in Taiwan researching
the military, said the Taiwanese should suspend purchases of
expensive weapons and focus on trimming their ranks and building a
professional armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taiwan's armed forces are flabby and unfit,'' Bristow said,
noting that the island's force of 400,000 troops is made up mostly
of unmotivated conscripts serving their two years of mandatory
service in the army.
</P>
<P>
   A war between China and Taiwan would be unlike ones they have
fought before. Like Taiwan's military, China's 2.5 million-member
People's Liberation Army has never fought a war over a body of
water as big as the 80-mile-wide Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The last big battles the two have fought involved each other 51
years ago. China's guerrilla PLA troops won that conflict, forcing
the Nationalist government and military to retreat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   While the military's top leadership still favors eventual
reunification with China and opposes independence, it's not clear
whether junior officers and the enlisted ranks agree.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of young people call themselves Taiwanese, not
Chinese, are interested in developing their own culture and oppose
reunification with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the soldiers aren't singing off the same song books
as their bosses,'' Bristow said.

Protests End Amicably, IMF Meets
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though demonstrators disrupted the government's workday
and private business in a big swath of the capital, they failed to shut down the
two days of meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About
600 people were arrested today, bringing the total to more than 1,300 since the
protests began. The protesters accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing
debts on poor nations, destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of
other ills. World Bank spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the
meetings felt ''bewilderment and surprise at the degree of anger'' outside. She
said the officials were talking about ways to relieve poverty.

Sale of Destroyers to Taiwan Nixed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior U.S. official said President Clinton today
decided against the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, but approved the
sale of a long-range radar designed to detect missile launches, and a weapons
package that includes help in integrating $18 billion worth of weapons Taiwan
has already bought. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Clinton acted on the recommendation of top advisers who met earlier in the day
at the White House. The decision could touch off a fight with Congress, where
support for Taiwan and its growing democratic trends is strong, especially in
light of menacing gestures by Beijing toward the island.

Court Ruling Awaited in Elian Case

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- On the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Cuban exiles
today stood watch at the home where Elian Gonzalez's relatives waited for a key
ruling in the custody fight. Protesters recalled the disastrous and deadly
attempt on April 17, 1961, in which CIA-trained exiles failed to invade Cuba.
Their criticism was extended to the Clinton administration, which wants the
6-year-old Cuban boy returned to his Cuban father. The boy's Miami relatives say
he will have a better life here. Both sides were awaiting a ruling from the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The government wants the court to lift

Bush: Tax Plan To Benefit Poor

   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Flanked by single mothers and working families,
George W. Bush argued today that the real winners in his $438 billion tax-cut
package are those ''living on the outskirts of poverty.'' The Texas governor
used the focus on tax-filing deadline day to argue that fewer issues offer a
starker contrast with Gore than taxes, and to claim that his package focuses on
blue-collar workers. ''What's risky is overtaxing the people who work for a
living in America,'' said Bush, who criticized Gore for not convincing fellow
Democrats in Congress to get rid of the so-called tax marriage penalty.

leader since independence in 1962. Paul Kagame, 43, who previously had rejected
the top post out of fear of antagonizing the Hutu majority, was chosen president

Poll: Environmentalism Supported
</SUBHEAD>

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans don't consider the environment a top political
priority, says a new Gallup Poll, but they are broadly supportive of the
environmental movement three decades after the first Earth Day. The poll
indicated that one in six people are active with the environmental movement.
Four of five said they're sympathetic to the goals of the environmental
movement. Support in the polls for the environmental movement peaked about 10
years ago, after events like the Exxon Valdez oil spill, discussion of global
warming and the discovery of medical waste on beaches caught public attention.

<HEADLINE> Judge: Columbine Records To Open  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office must
make its Columbine investigative report available to the families
of two of the slain victims, a district judge ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the families of Dan Rohrbough and Kelly Fleming had
requested emergency access to the documents to decide whether to
file lawsuits over the attack at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for filing the lawsuits is Thursday, the first
anniversary of the day two teen-age gunmen killed 12 students, a
teacher and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Brooke Jackson said he was not convinced that the sheriff
department's interest in withholding the investigative information
outweighed the families' interest in knowing how their son or
daughter died.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see how anybody can argue with a straight face that
these people don't have a right to that information,'' Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rohrbough hopes the information answers questions about
his son's death.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is more important as an emotional issue than it is as a
legal issue,'' Rohrbough said. ''All I know is what they told me
and that's not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Jefferson County Attorney Lily Oeffler argued that
releasing the information could jeopardize the safety of witnesses,
students or teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a compromise, the judge ordered the sheriff's report
available for ''their eyes and their eyes only ... solely for the
purposes to help the families decide what claims should be filed.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also ordered that the families be allowed to listen to
nearly 32 hours of 911 tapes and 14 hours of police and
firefighters' radio transmission tapes.
</P>
<P>
   He said the families may have copies of helicopter footage and a
firefighter training video that used a segment of surveillance tape
from the school's cafeteria during the shootings. Part of the
surveillance footage was broadcast on CBS News in October.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson denied access to ballistics reports, surveillance video
of the school's commons areas and 200 volumes of raw investigative
material.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on the release of the rest of the material will come
only after a court review, Jackson said. No hearing date has been
set.

<HEADLINE> Tribal Whale Hunt Begins in Wash.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- A Makah whaling family set out Monday in
the tribe's first gray whale hunt of the spring, but the crew
returned late in the day without killing a whale. The Coast Guard
arrested two protesters.
</P>
<P>
   While tribal leaders insist the seasonal hunt -- a centuries-old
tradition that resumed after a 70 years absence with the first kill
in May -- is vital to preserving the Makah identity, anti-whaling
activists fear it could open the door to a worldwide renewal of
commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah whale hunts stopped in the 1920s as commercial whaling
decimated populations. When the gray whale was taken off the
Endangered Species List in 1994, the tribe moved to resume the
practice, citing whaling rights granted under their 1855 treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the effort was cleared by the International Whaling
Commission, which allocated the Makah 20 whales through 2004, a
maximum of five per year.
</P>
<P>
   Protest groups, led by Ocean Defense International, have been
monitoring the northwest Washington shoreline by boat in an effort
to protect the whales from the tribal hunters.
</P>
<P>
   The two protesters arrested Monday were accused of violating a
500-yard exclusion zone around the hunt, said Coast Guard Petty
Officer Gino Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Johnson, chairman of the Makah Tribal Council, confirmed
Monday that tribal leaders had issued a 10-day whaling permit to
the Paul Parker family. At least four other families were preparing
to hunt, commission president Keith Johnson said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Seeks 'Smarter' Sanctions  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Confronted with a mixed record in the
success of U.N. sanctions, the Security Council took the first
steps Monday toward making embargoes more effective and less
harmful to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Council members announced they would set up a special working
group to recommend ways of making sanctions ''smarter'' by
targeting them better against regimes and enforcing them more.
</P>
<P>
   The move was aimed at answering mounting criticism that U.N.
sanctions, which are increasingly being used as an alternative to
military force, have often gone ignored in the past 10 years --
particularly in the case of arms embargoes on Rwanda, Liberia and
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   When enforced, they have often hurt innocents more than the
regimes they were intended for, such as the case of sanctions on
Iraq and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Those conclusions were highlighted by an independent analysis of
U.N. embargoes, ''The Sanctions Decade: Assessing U.N. Strategies
in the 1990s,'' which was launched Monday at a symposium and
discussed at length in an open meeting of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the symposium that the mixed
success had raised ''serious doubts'' about U.N. sanctions'
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in some cases not only transfer hardships onto their
people, ''but perversely often benefit from such sanctions by their
ability to profit from black market activity, by controlling the
distribution of the limited resources, and by exploiting them as
pretext for eliminating domestic sources of political opposition,''
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   The move to review of sanctions comes at a critical time for the
council, which is now negotiating a resolution to tackle violations
of sanctions against Angola's UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ambassadors are also dealing with the continued dilemma of
sanctions against Iraq, which has been under an embargo for nearly
10 years -- the most comprehensive of the 12 regimes imposed this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   French Ambassador Jean-David Levitte told the council that Iraq
sanctions had largely achieved Baghdad's disarmament. But Levitte
said they had been so extended that the human cost ''manifestly
outweighs the benefits the council can expect.''
</P>
<P>
   France, which has advocated a suspension of sanctions against
Iraq, suggested embargoes have a specific duration, which could
only be extended by council action. That mechanism would enable any
of the veto-wielding members to block attempts to continue the
measures, a clear critique of efforts by the United States to
maintain sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy U.S. Ambassador James Cunningham said it may be possible
in some cases to link suspension or a relaxation of sanctions to
changed behavior of the targeted state.
</P>
<P>
   But he stressed that ''once sanctions have been imposed, it is
essential to place the burden of proof regarding their suspension
or termination where it properly belongs: on the demonstrated
behavior of the sanctioned entity.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- Running back Rashaan Salaam, the 1994
Heisman Trophy winner from Colorado, was among four players
released Monday by the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam was signed before last season's final game, having been
waived by the Cleveland Browns in October. He didn't figure in
Green Bay's plans after the team acquired backup running back and
kick returner Ahman Green from Seattle last week.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam ran for 1,074 yards as a rookie with the Chicago Bears,
but missed the final 13 games of the 1997 season with a knee
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay also released safety Jamel Williams and defensive
linemen James Grier and Matt Keneley.
</P>
<P>
   The team signed eight undrafted free agents, including wideout
Bobby Brown, Notre Dame's leading receiver each of the past three
seasons.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll at Congo Airport at 109  </HEADLINE>
By KAMANGA MUTOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Emergency workers on Monday pulled eight
decomposing bodies from the wreckage of a hangar that collapsed in
a string of airport explosions, bringing the death toll to 109.
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasa Gov. Theophile Bemba Fundu said a mass funeral would
likely be held Wednesday for the victims of Friday's blasts at the
city's N'Djili international airport. The cause of the explosions
was still unclear.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people were also injured in the blasts. Fundu said
28 badly burned bodies still have not been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Red Cross workers resumed the search through the hangar in the
morning after quitting nearly 24 hours earlier for lack of food,
water, and tools. Rain fell overnight.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how many people were still missing after the
explosions knocked over the hangar, used by customs and tax
officials to handle incoming cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the dead complained of their treatment of the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have asked even for the ashes of our brothers. But the
authorities have refused to give us even that,'' said Lubunga Bya
Ombe, a local British Broadcasting Corporation correspondent whose
brother was among the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Kibonge Munkeni, whose brother -- a customs official -- also died
in the blasts, said he found the corpse dumped unceremoniously in a
sack outside the general hospital's morgue.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no respect for the dead here. No one cares,''
Munkeni said.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations for the blasts ranged from a short circuit to a
soldier dropping ammunition while unloading a plane full of
weapons. The blasts ignited stockpiles of rockets, shells and other
weaponry in explosions that lasted about an hour, shattering
windows and flinging debris for miles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Congolese authorities said the explosions were
accidental, a pro-government newspaper blamed saboteurs and said
the national intelligence chief was arrested over the weekend for
failing to heed warnings that Congo's rebels had been planning to
sabotage the airport.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Amateur Coach Pleads Innocent  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE BRISENDINE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- An AAU coach charged with defrauding
four major basketball schools by paying high school players was
ordered held without bond after he pleaded innocent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Piggie is accused in a federal indictment of defrauding
UCLA, Duke, Missouri and Oklahoma State after the universities gave
scholarships to the players he is accused of paying.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Larsen ordered no bond after
witnesses testified they were threatened by Piggie.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie also pleaded innocent to a federal charge of weapons
possession by a convicted felon. Police and federal prosecutors say
Piggie, who has a 1988 conviction for selling crack cocaine, was
carrying a weapon when he was stopped for a traffic violation last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie, named in a federal grand jury indictment handed down
Wednesday and unsealed Thursday, could face up to 49 years in
prison without parole and up to $1.85 million in fines.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, Piggie, of Kansas City, paid JaRon
Rush of UCLA $17,000, Kareem Rush of Missouri $2,300, Corey
Maggette of Duke $2,000, Andre Williams of Oklahoma State $250 and
Korleone Young $14,000.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment against Piggie alleges the universities were
defrauded when they awarded scholarships to players who were not
amateurs because they had accepted payments for playing in AAU
tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   Young, of Wichita, Kan., skipped college to enter the NBA draft.
He is now playing minor league basketball.
</P>
<P>
   JaRon Rush has not yet confirmed a report by the Los Angeles
Daily News that he will enter the NBA draft. He and Kareem Rush,
his younger brother, both played at Kansas City's Pembroke Hill
High School.
</P>
<P>
   Piggie also was accused of helping JaRon Rush lease a car on the
condition that he not accept a basketball scholarship from Kansas,
and of contacting sports agents with the help of George Raveling, a
Nike consultant and former coach at Iowa and Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Raveling, who testified before the grand jury that indicted
Piggie, was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   The Rush brothers and Williams were suspended by their schools
for varying periods. Those cases have since been resolved by the
NCAA with the Rush brothers each missing nine games and Williams
five. Maggette was never declared ineligible in his one season at
Duke.

<HEADLINE> Colonel Pleads Guilty in Drug Case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An Army colonel who once commanded the
military's anti-drug operation in Colombia pleaded guilty to a
federal charge Monday, admitting that he knew his wife was
laundering drug money but failed to turn her in.
</P>
<P>
   James Hiett, 48, entered the plea as his wife, Laurie Hiett,
sank her face into her hands and sobbed from a bench in the first
row of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   He faces up to three years in prison and $250,000 in fines when
he is sentenced June 23. Federal sentencing guidelines call for him
to spend between one year and one and a half years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett said that in April and May 1999, his wife traveled from
Bogota, Colombia to New York City twice and returned home with more
than $25,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
   In early June 1999, he said he was told by Army investigators
that his wife had been sending narcotics from Colombia to New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   ''Prior to that time I did not know my wife was involved in
narcotics trafficking,'' he said. ''I then knew that the cash my
wife had previously given me came from drug trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   In June and July, after he knew of his wife's drug activities,
he tried to get rid of the money and failed to tell law enforcement
authorities about the cash.
</P>
<P>
   ''I then took the steps to dissipate this cash by paying as many
bills as possible in cash and depositing the rest of the cash in
our bank accounts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Laurie Hiett pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy
charges, admitting she shipped packages containing $700,000 worth
of drugs to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   After his plea, Hiett hugged his wife and left the courthouse
holding her hand.
</P>
<P>
   The couple paused to allow their picture to be taken and were
asked how their marriage was holding up. ''Great,'' Laurie Hiett
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Hiett, a 24-year Army veteran, remains on active duty at Fort
Monroe, in Hampton, Va., where he was transferred after his wife
was accused of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee G. Dunst said Hiett has filed for
retirement from the Army.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Army Criminal Investigation Division in Panama had
cleared Hiett, saying he had ''no prior knowledge'' of his wife's
crimes.

<HEADLINE> FBI arrests former Grand Union executive in $2 millionembezzlement  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Hours before he and his wife were to board a
plane for Brazil, a longtime executive at Grand Union was arrested
Monday, accused of embezzling $2 million from the supermarket chain
over eight years.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents searching the Park Ridge home of Donald C.
Vaillancourt found round-trip tickets indicating that the Bergen
County man and his wife were leaving Monday night for Rio de
Janeiro, Assistant U.S. Attorney Vaughn McKoy said in seeking $2
million bail.
</P>
<P>
   McKoy said agents also found $55,000 in cash at the home.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate G. Donald Haneke ordered Vaillancourt, 56, held
on $600,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Vaillancourt's lawyer, Robert Reed, declined to comment after
the bail hearing. The former executive attended in a black leather
jacket and slacks, shackled at the wrists and ankles. He spoke only
to acknowledge the charges.
</P>
<P>
   His 29-year Grand Union career ended in February as part of a
downsizing, the Wayne-based company said. At the time of his
dismissal, Vaillancourt, a lawyer, held the posts of vice
president, public affairs counsel, and corporate secretary, Grand
Union said.
</P>
<P>
   Vaillancourt was among 30 people let go at headquarters just
three days after the chain fired its chairman, and its vice
chairman resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The upheaval followed last year's third-quarter loss of $35.6
million, 25 percent more than a year earlier. The company emerged
from bankruptcy court protection in August, its second Chapter 11
filing in five years.
</P>
<P>
   After Vaillancourt's termination, the company uncovered
wrongdoing and notified the U.S. attorney's office for New Jersey,
said a lawyer for Grand Union, Michael Chertoff, himself a former
U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   While at the company, Vaillancourt had the authority to approve
payments to vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the scheme outlined by McKoy and the FBI, from 1991-99,
Vaillancourt opened post boxes and bank accounts in the names of
Grand Union vendors, submitted false invoices on vendor stationery,
and then approved the payments, which were sent to the postal
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The mail fraud charge filed by the FBI carries up to five years
in prison and a $1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Union said that any embezzled funds will not hurt its
financial statements, because the funds already were accounted as
expenses in prior statements.
</P>
<P>
   The company will seek to recover embezzled funds, said Grand
Union, which operates 217 stores in Connecticut, New Hampshire, New
Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

<HEADLINE> Barak Readies Israel for Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak told the Israeli
people Monday they should prepare for a Palestinian entity that
would comprise a solid bloc of land abutting Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israel Television timed for the Passover
holiday, Barak made his case to the public for what he told his
Cabinet over the weekend -- that Israel would hand over West Bank
land to give the Palestinians territorial contiguity.
</P>
<P>
   ''It needs to be clear to us that what will emerge from an
agreement is not a limited autonomy or a protectorate,'' Barak
said. ''There will not be good neighborliness between the two
countries if one of them is collection of islands on a map.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak also suggested that the Palestinians would receive West
Bank suburbs bordering contested Jerusalem, though he insisted
Jerusalem would remain united and under Israel's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Jewish settlements would also be kept under the
country's control.
</P>
<P>
   In his report to the Cabinet on Sunday, Barak came closer than
ever to conceding the inevitability of Palestinian statehood. But
the Palestinians say he is not going far enough, and have continued
to demand all of the Gaza Strip, West Bank and east Jerusalem,
captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, President Clinton will meet with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a Palestinian human rights group accused Jewish
settlers of attacking and trying to kill a 71-year old Palestinian
woman.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Thahab al-Najjar, from the village of Borin outside
of the northern West Bank city of Nablus, told the Palestinian
Society for the Protection of Human Rights and the Environment that
settlers had tried to stab her with a knife and bury her alive
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rafi Yafe, a spokesman for the Israeli police, said an
investigation has been launched but at the time no suspects had
been identified. Yafe said al-Najjar was lightly injured in the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Cuba To Protest UN Rights Resolution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Bitterly denouncing the U.S. and Czech
governments, Cuba planned a protest march of 100,000 people for
Tuesday against a proposed U.N. human rights resolution sponsored
by the Czechs criticizing the communist island.
</P>
<P>
   The march before the Czech Embassy here is timed to coincide
with the start of a debate before the U.N. Human Rights Commission
in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban state television broadcast a statement Monday saying the
move to censure Cuba is ''directed by the United States and
seconded by the hypocrisy and racism of Europe with the miserable
complicity of lackeys headed by the Czech Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement charged that the action ''is creating an
atmosphere propitious for carrying out monstrous crimes,'' citing
the case of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, who is being held by his
great-uncle's family in Miami against the will of the boy's father.
</P>
<P>
   It accused the United States of ''making extraordinary efforts,
using all its power and political and economic influence'' to
convince countries that voted against such resolutions in the past
to accept it this time, or at least to abstain.
</P>
<P>
   A similar resolution censuring Cuba was narrowly approved last
year after being defeated in 1998 for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has refused to permit a specially appointed U.N. rapporteur
to visit the island, arguing that he was controlled by the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Chicago Janitors Hold 24-hour Strike  </HEADLINE>
By MARIO FOX, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Thousands of janitors who work at downtown office
buildings went on a 24-hour walkout Monday to protest a lack of
progress in their contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Munz, spokesman for Local 1 of the Service Employees
International Union, said janitors have seen their pay decrease
over the last eight years compared to the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   Their salary of $10.10 an hour in 1992 has only increased to
$11.40, $1.10 short of keeping up with the cost of living during
that period, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The wage they are offering this time is again below the cost
of living,'' Munz said. ''Also, the janitors are working harder and
harder each year as retirees are not being replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   The Building Owners and Managers Association, which is
negotiating with the union, released a statement saying ''it is
most unfortunate that our janitors, their families and building
tenants have been hurt by these actions and we hope for a speedy
resolution to minimize their suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The janitors' contract expired at midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout affects some 200 buildings and 5,500 workers,
hundreds of whom attended an afternoon rally outside the downtown
building where the contract talks were being held. Then they
marched to other union-serviced buildings in the Loop business
district to bring attention to their cause as office workers headed
for home.
</P>
<P>
   Janitors in the suburbs are threatening to walk off their jobs
if negotiations with a mediator fail to make any headway Tuesday.
Their contract expired April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is the latest city to see labor unrest among janitors.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of commercial building janitors are on strike in Los
Angeles, seeking wage increases and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say similar labor unrest could occur in other
cities, including New York, Cleveland, Detroit and Philadelphia,
where union janitor contracts are due to expire this year.

<HEADLINE> Women's Soccer Team Back On Field  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHULA VISTA, Calif. (AP) -- Although their uniforms had no
numbers on them, Mia Hamm, Brandi Chastain and some of their
teammates were identified easily.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm and Chastain, who starred on the 1999 Women's World Cup
championship team, were among 15 returning players who took part in
Monday's opening practice of the Olympic residency camp for the
U.S. women's national team.
</P>
<P>
   Joining them at the ARCO Olympic Training Center for the start
of extended preparation for the Sydney Olympics were 15 others
looking for spots on the final 18-member roster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Definitely this turns up the heat,'' said Chastain, who scored
the Cup-winning goal in a shootout against China, then stripped off
her jersey in celebration. ''The kitchen's getting a little hotter.
When you get out to the training center, it's hard not to feel the
anticipation and excitement of the Olympics with all these great
athletes surrounding you.''
</P>
<P>
   The team will remain at the center before heading to the U.S.
Women's Cup tournament starting May 5 in Portland, Ore., then
return for more training before defending the gold medal it won at
the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The United States won the World Cup at a sold-out Rose Bowl. On
Monday, there were about 50 onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was no doubting the carryover effect that remains
from the World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is more visibility and more responsibility. Everyone's
going to be watching and that's great,'' said Hamm, the U.S.
women's career leader with 117 goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that we pride ourselves on as a team is the
way that we represent ourselves. When we are out there training, we
don't cut corners and we work extremely hard.''
</P>
<P>
   New coach April Heinrichs, a former team captain, repeatedly
encouraged players during the opening two-hour practice by
shouting, ''That's the kind of aggression that I love.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The attitude is established by the players,'' said Heinrichs,
who succeeded Tony DiCicco after the World Cup. ''They are highly
motivated and bring that work ethic to the field every day. We are
putting an extra emphasis on competitiveness and how to show it.''
</P>
<P>
   The team, which has all 11 starters back from the World Cup
final, is 7-2-2 this year without the benefit of extended team
training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before a tournament, you only have four or five days together,
and there's only so much that you can work on and also look at the
opponent,'' Hamm said. ''But this is an opportunity to focus on us
as a team. Both as a group and individuals, we can sharpen our
skills and get our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinrichs said she's in no hurry to make roster cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to bring (new) players along as long as we can,''
she said. ''We want them to get experience with world-class
players. We're looking at that in terms of our long-term future.''

<HEADLINE> Lee Defense Disputes Search Warrant  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Attorneys for a scientist accused of
breaching security at Los Alamos National Laboratory asked a judge
Monday to throw out evidence obtained in an FBI search of his home,
saying the warrant wasn't specific.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant used to search Wen Ho Lee's White Rock home on April
10, 1999, failed to include specific descriptions of the place to
be searched or items to be seized and ''failed to include the
required statement regarding how the property to be seized related
to any alleged criminal activity,'' the defense motion said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, the warrant gave unfettered discretion to the
executing officers to seize anything,'' said Lee's attorneys, Mark
Holscher, John Cline and Nancy Hollander.
</P>
<P>
   Items seized, they said, included the ''Selected Short Stories
of Guy de Maupassant,'' the address book of Lee's daughter,
telephone numbers of a church group, the membership list of the Los
Alamos Chinese-American Society, Lee's school notebooks and
diaries, the plays of Tennessee Williams, children's photo albums,
personal correspondence, Lee's Ph.D. thesis published in 1966,
letters between Lee and his professors in the early 1970s and
computer printouts from 1977, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The defense asked the court ''to suppress all items obtained as
a result of the search of Dr. Lee's home ... all fruits of that
evidence and all other evidence, tangible or intangible, obtained
directly or indirectly as a result of that search.''
</P>
<P>
   First Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Gorence said he expects to
respond within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I can say is that we oppose the motion, and that
opposition will be reflected in the response we ultimately file,''
Gorence said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 60, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, is charged
with downloading materials from secured computers onto unsecured
computers and onto several computer tapes. Agents say seven of
those tapes are missing; Lee insists those tapes were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Lee could face life in prison if convicted of all 59 counts. His
trial is tentatively set for Nov. 6.

<HEADLINE> Tax cut package takes shape in new budget  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- New York's gross receipts tax on energy -- a
gross injustice to high-electricity users, according to business
interests -- would be immediately eliminated for manufacturers under
a tax-cut agreement Monday at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, to be included in the 2000-01 state budget, would
apply retroactively so big manufacturers will get refunds of the
gross receipts taxes on power bills they've paid since Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki called for such a reduction in his State of
the State address in January, and he and legislative leaders have
all been in favor of some form of gross receipts tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the tax-cut agreement said the new budget will
also include a reduction in the gross receipts tax for
non-manufacturing commercial customers over five years and for a
reduction in the tax charged to residential electric ratepayers of
$75 million immediately and $50 million to be phased in over the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The gross receipts tax is among the most unpopular taxes within
the state's business community, with executives long claiming it
puts New York companies at a disadvantage to those in other states
where there is no such tax.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Legislature and governor approved a modest
reduction of the 4-cent-per-$1 tax on electricity bills, which
became fully effective in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In all, legislative leaders and Pataki agreed the state could
afford to institute $1.2 billion in tax cuts in the 2000-01 budget.
That cost is when the taxes are fully phased in over five years.
The price tag in the first fiscal year is expected to be in the
range of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   In other tax-related agreements, according to sources Monday
night:
</P>
<P>
   --The state's ''marriage penalty'' will be eliminated by
increasing the standard deduction on state income taxes from
$13,000 to $15,000. That change will save typical married couples
about $140 a year and bring their tax bill into line with what two
unmarried adults living together would pay. Estimated savings when
phased in over five years: $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   --Residents will be able to deduct up to $10,000 of their portion
of schooling costs for each child in college on state income taxes,
regardless of income. Estimated savings when phased in over five
years: $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   --The state's Earned Income Tax Credit for working and
lower-middle-class poor will be increased. Estimated savings: $125
million, with almost all of the costs being picked up by the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   --The state's current Enterprise Zone program creating low-tax,
business-friendly enclaves in struggling parts of the state will be
retooled and expanded to tax-free ''Empire Zones.''
</P>
<P>
   If the agreement holds and is enacted in the final budget, there
is something for all the state leaders in the tax package.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno pushed hard for
gross receipts tax reductions. Initially, Assembly Speaker Sheldon
Silver did not want any cuts to the portion of the tax charged to
residential ratepayers, but sources said he ended up championing
inclusion of home and apartment ratepayers during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno was a strong proponent of the college tuition tax credit
and both he and Silver backed Earned Income Tax Credit
improvements. Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor and Silver had
advocated for elimination of the marriage penalty. Silver wanted to
see the ''Empire Zone'' program instituted.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders have also agreed to renew the Power for Jobs
program, which provides lower-cost electricity to manufacturers and
other big users like hospitals and commercial businesses, over the
next three years. The plan calls for 300 megawatts of power to be
provided at a cost of $240 million, sources said.

Gephardt Expected To Nix China Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt is expected to
announce on Wednesday he will vote against hotly contested legislation granting
permanent normalized trade relations with China, Democratic officials said
today. These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Gephardt,
D-Mo., had informed senior White House officials of his decision. Clinton favors
the measure, as do members of the Republican leadership in the House. In
opposing the legislation, Gephardt would side with the majority of his own
Democratic caucus. A close vote is expected on the legislation when the House
votes sometime next month.

IMF Meets Despite Disruptive Protests
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though demonstrators disrupted the government's workday in
a big swath of the capital, they failed to shut down the two days of meetings of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About 600 people were arrested
today, bringing the total to more than 1,300 since the protests began. The
protesters accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing debts on poor nations,
destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of other ills. World Bank
spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the meetings felt ''bewilderment
and surprise at the degree of anger'' outside. She said the officials were
talking about ways to relieve poverty.

Court: Baggage Squeeze OK Needed

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police officers must get travelers' consent or a court

Supreme Court ruled today in an expansion of public transit passengers' privacy
rights. The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border Patrol agent who
felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on
unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to contain drugs. The National
Association of Police Organizations said it was disappointed by the ruling.

U.S. Won't Sell Destroyers to Taiwan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior U.S. official said President Clinton today
decided against the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, but approved the
sale of a long-range radar designed to detect missile launches, and a weapons
package that includes help in integrating $18 billion worth of weapons Taiwan
has already bought. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Clinton acted on the recommendation of top advisers who met earlier in the day
at the White House. The decision could touch off a fight with Congress, where
support for Taiwan and its growing democratic trends is strong, especially in
light of menacing gestures by Beijing toward the island.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak told the Israeli people Monday
they should prepare for a Palestinian entity that would comprise a solid bloc of
land abutting Jerusalem. In an interview with Israel Television timed for the
Passover holiday, Barak made his case to the public for what he told his Cabinet
over the weekend -- that Israel would hand over West Bank land to give the
Palestinians territorial contiguity. Barak also suggested that the Palestinians
would receive West Bank suburbs bordering contested Jerusalem, though he
insisted Jerusalem would remain united and under Israel's sovereignty.

without killing a whale. The Coast Guard arrested two protesters. While tribal
leaders insist the seasonal hunt -- a centuries-old tradition that resumed after
a 70 years absence with the first kill in May -- is vital to preserving the
Makah identity, anti-whaling activists fear it could open the door to a
worldwide renewal of commercial whaling.

Abera and Kenya's Moses Tanui in the closest finish in the race's 104-year
history. Catherine Ndereba made it a Kenyan sweep, winning the women's race in
another close finish. Lagat won in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 47 seconds to break the
tape a stride ahead of Abera, who was second in the same time.

By The Associated Press	   Rain storms hit parts of the East Coast Monday while
the Midwest
had sunnyow and heavy rain hit Califorainia.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Storms hit portions of the mid-Atlantic and central
Appalachians, as a well-wound system moved from the upper Ohio
Valley. The storms were most widespread across Virginia and the
Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains and large hail were common with the scattered
storms. Rainfall totals across Virginia, West Virginia and
Washington were around 1 inch, although some areas had more than 2
inches.
</P>
<P>
   Flooding was reported across portions of northerain West Virginia
and in westerain Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Overrunning moisture also brought steady rains across central
and easterain Pennsylvania through southeast New York and southerain
New England. Some areas of easterain New York and westerain
Massachusetts had light sunnyow showers.
</P>
<P>
   sunnyow was a more common feature on the colder side of the system.
The Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and northeasterain Wisconsin also
had light sunnyow showers. Spotty rain showers were found further
south in southerain Indiana, Ohio and easterain Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive system was pushing across Califorainia and westerain
Nevada. Rain was falling, steady and heavy at times, over the
interior valleys of Califorainia through the Los Angles Basin. Some
scattered rain showers and thundershowers fell over the north and
central coastal counties.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierras had steady sunnyows showers. Winter storm warainings were
in effect for much of the day, with over a foot of accumulation
possible above 7,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and scattered rain showers were spreading into portions
of Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana and northwest Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   Other variably cloudy skies lay across the Pacific Northwest,

<HEADLINE> Transplant Patient Finishes Marathon  </HEADLINE>
By JAY LINDSAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Doctors who performed heart transplant surgery on
Danalyn Adams Scharf gave her this incentive while she was
recovering from the operation, unable to move her legs: Climb 16
stairs and you can go home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a month before Scharf made the climb. Her progress in the
subsequent three years has been astounding.
</P>
<P>
   Scharf completed the Boston Marathon in 5 hours, 53 minutes
Monday, and is believed to be the first female heart transplant
recipient to finish a marathon. A male marathoner with a heart
transplant completed the Boston Marathon in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Scharf, 28, who gave interviews along the marathon route,
finished next to her husband, Matt. The pair hugged as family and
friends crowded around to congratulate her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really good,'' she said. ''I made a difference today.''
</P>
<P>
   The marathon's 26.2 miles were considerably more than Scharf's
longest training run of 12 miles, and she said she struggled near
the end. Matt said the pair walked most of the last 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ''Around 18 and 19 miles, I was asking, 'How many more miles
left?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish line, Scharf met Kim Koza-Harris, sister of her
heart donor, Jane Koza, for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel proud,'' Koza-Harris said. ''I really feel like my
sister is part of this race, too.''
</P>
<P>
   To Scharf, of Dover, N.H., running the marathon was partly about
saying ''Thank you'' to the doctors who saved her and to the family
of the donor whose heart now beats inside her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so grateful,'' she said. ''These words don't mean much.
They did so much. They gave me life.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to take good care of this heart the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Scharf had medical clearance to run the marathon. She hopes she
has shown transplant patients can return to active lives, and she
wants to encourage organ donation.
</P>
<P>
   A nearly fatal virus hit Scharf, a high school track star, in
February 1997. Scharf thought she had the flu, but doctors at Lahey
Clinic in Burlington later diagnosed a condition called viral
myocarditis, an inflammation of heart muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   During the next month, doctors opened her chest five times,
first to massage her heart to life during cardiac arrest, then to
install and maintain a device that pumped blood for her, and
finally for the transplant at Brigham and Women's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was seconds away from dying'' after the cardiac arrest,
said Dr. David Adams, the hospital's associate chief of cardiac
surgery. ''She was walking through a minefield for several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The month between her visit to the hospital and her transplant
are hazy for Scharf. When she awoke after the surgery, she'd lost
25 pounds and couldn't move her legs, which were little more than
skin and bones.
</P>
<P>
   After Scharf passed the doctors' stairs test, she focused on
returning to her former good health. Scharf said she now feels like
her old self, though she realizes occasionally that she has someone
else's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''The scars are daily reminders,'' she said. ''Sometimes I think
of it as 'the heart.' Sometimes it's 'Jane's heart.' Sometimes it's
'my heart.'''

<HEADLINE> Arizona Sends Dellucci To Triple-A  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks optioned popular
outfielder David Dellucci to Triple-A Tucson on Monday and
activated utility player Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci, who has been with the Diamondbacks since he was chosen
from Baltimore in the expansion draft, is coming back from major
wrist surgery and had seen little playing time this season. He also
was one of the few Arizona players who could be sent to the minors
without clearing waivers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you know anything about baseball, anybody of the street
could have predicted it,'' Dellucci said. ''I kind of expected it,
but I didn't want it to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci, a fan favorite, was the odd man out in the battle for
playing time in right field, with manager Buck Showalter platooning
Travis Lee and Bernard Gilkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like I told David, he's a big-league player playing at
Triple-A,'' Showalter said. ''He can get some at bats and do what
he's capable of doing. At this point, with Tony Womack being gone
Fox being able to play the outfield, we feel like we're a better
club right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci had appeared in three games. He had one hit in two at
bats.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci, known for his aggressive style on defense and at the
plate, has had a hard time finding his old form after coming back
from surgery to repair a rare, career-threatening bone condition in
his wrist.
</P>
<P>
   But Showalter said Dellucci was just a victim of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not because of something David did,'' Showalter said.
''It's because of the way our ballclub's constructed right now. It
just doesn't fit. He's out of options this year, and we won't be
having this conversation again.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox had missed the team's first 12 games with a hairline
fracture in the bone that connects to his left thumb. The injury
occurred when he caught a line drive at third base in a spring
training game.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has played every position but catcher and pitcher for
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Womack missed Monday night's game against Colorado to attend his
grandmother's funeral. He might miss Tuesday's game as well.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, closer Matt Mantei was sent to Tucson for two more
rehabilitation appearances before he will be activated by the big
club. Mantei was placed on the disabled list April 1 with biceps
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched twice for Tucson last week without experiencing any
pain, but both of those appearances were starts. The Diamondbacks
want him to throw 25 pitches each Tuesday and Wednesday in a relief
role before making a decision on whether to activate him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's frustrating, but what can you do,'' said Mantei, who
thinks he's ready to be activated right now. ''I could pitch
tonight if I had to. It's just good to know that I'm healthy enough
to pitch again.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers Drop Interest in Marinovich  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Todd Marinovich and Ryan Leaf won't be
teammates, after all.
</P>
<P>
   After obtaining two quarterbacks from obscure colleges, the San
Diego Chargers dropped their interest in Marinovich, who was hoping
for a comeback after eight seasons away from the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich, whose career has been even more troubled than
Leaf's, worked out for the Chargers on Thursday, impressing them
with his accuracy and release.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we said then, it was an exploratory meeting,'' general
manager Bobby Beathard said Monday. ''We were very impressed with
Todd.''
</P>
<P>
   But after picking up two rookies and hearing from the agent for
Sherdrick Bonner, who was on San Diego's roster late last season,
''we don't want to be unfair and get too many people in there,''
Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers took JuJuan Seider from Division I-AA Florida A&AMP;M
in the sixth round of the draft on Sunday, then agreed to terms
with free agent quarterback Mike Burton of Division III Trinity
University of San Antonio, Texas. Burton went to high school in La
Jolla.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich, who was the No. 1 draft choice of the Raiders in
1991 but was released before the 1993 season, is the backup
quarterback for the Los Angeles Avengers of the Arena Football
League. He was a backup for the CFL's British Columbia Lions last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich spent three months in jail in early 1998 after
pleading guilty to growing marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers need the extra quarterbacks for minicamp April
28-30 because of continuing concerns about Leaf, who is
experiencing discomfort after a second surgery on his right
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf returned to the team's headquarters Monday to continue his
rehabilitation. He hadn't been seen at the complex in about a
month, since fullback Fred McCrary sharply criticized him for being
overweight and out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   When asked when Leaf will begin throwing again, Beathard said:
''I don't have a clue. We'll handle that when we get to that
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonner has chosen to play for Arizona of the Arena League, whose
season ends about two weeks before the start of training camp in
July. But Beathard said there's a chance Bonner will come over for
a few days. Bonner threw seven touchdown passes in Arizona's
season-opening win Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The only veterans on San Diego's roster who can throw right now
are 37-year-old Jim Harbaugh and Moses Moreno, who's started just
one NFL game.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's family apparently is acquainted with the family of
Chargers owner Alex Spanos. Spanos had a videotape of Burton and
passed it on to Beathard through his son, club president Dean
Spanos.
</P>
<P>
   Burton deserved the shot, Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really looks good on tape. He's a good guy to have in here.
At the time, I didn't realize he was a local kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton set 16 school records at Trinity and tied another. He
threw for 2,413 yards and 25 touchdowns last year, and for 11,833
yards and 112 TDs in his career.
</P>
<P>
   After serving as a backup at West Virginia for three seasons,
Seider had a sensational senior season at Florida A&AMP;M, throwing for
27 touchdowns and running for 14 more, and leading the Rattlers
into the I-AA semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Peru Candidate Demands Fair Play  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo on
Monday urged President Alberto Fujimori and his supporters to
ensure a clean vote count in the upcoming runoff election.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori fell less than 2 percentage points short of the
majority he needed to claim a third term victory last week, after a
first round election tainted by irregularities and accusations of
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates will face off in a second round showdown in
late May or early June.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said the balloting must have ''credibility in the eyes of
the world and in the eyes of Peruvians to dispel any question about
the results, whatever they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo called for an end to what he called stepped-up personal
attacks against him and his family on mostly pro-government
television networks, and he demanded equal access to TV stations to
present his proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Tudela, Fujimori's vice presidential candidate and a
former foreign minister, said Monday that the government would try
to increase vote monitoring as well as encourage more equitable
media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls during the April 9 election and unofficial tallies by
independent monitors had indicated Fujimori would not reach the 50
percent plus one vote needed to win. But after an unexplained
12-hour delay, the first official returns showed Fujimori on track
to claim a first-round victory, prompting suspicions of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo's supporters protested and much of the international
community added its voice, all but insisting on a second round.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials took three days to determine Fujimori had
fallen short of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori has denied that election rigging occurred and has
downplayed mounting irregularities, saying they had no significant
impact on the vote outcome.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Grand Union Executive Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Hours before he and his wife were to board a
plane for Brazil, a longtime executive at Grand Union was arrested
Monday, accused of embezzling $2 million from the supermarket chain
over eight years, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents searching the Park Ridge home of Donald C.
Vaillancourt found round-trip tickets indicating the Bergen County
man and his wife were leaving Monday night for Rio de Janeiro,
Assistant U.S. Attorney Vaughn McKoy said in seeking $2 million
bail.
</P>
<P>
   McKoy said agents also found $55,000 in cash at the home.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate G. Donald Haneke ordered Vaillancourt, 56, held
on $600,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Vaillancourt's lawyer, Robert Reed, declined to comment after
the bail hearing, where Vaillancourt spoke only to acknowledge the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   His 29-year Grand Union career ended in February as part of a
downsizing and management shakeup, the Wayne-based company said. At
the time of his dismissal, Vaillancourt, a lawyer, held the posts
of vice president, public affairs counsel, and corporate secretary,
Grand Union said.
</P>
<P>
   After Vaillancourt's termination, the company uncovered
wrongdoing and notified the U.S. attorney's office for New Jersey,
said Michael Chertoff, a lawyer for Grand Union, Michael Chertoff.
</P>
<P>
   While at the company, Vaillancourt had the authority to approve
payments to vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the scheme outlined by McKoy and the FBI, from 1991-99,
Vaillancourt opened post boxes and bank accounts in the names of
Grand Union vendors, submitted false invoices on vendor stationery,
and then approved the payments, which were sent to the postal
boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The mail fraud charge filed by the FBI carries up to five years
in prison and a $1 million fine.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Union said any embezzled funds will not hurt its financial
statements, because the funds already were accounted as expenses in
prior statements. The company said it will seek to recover the
embezzled money.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Union operates 217 stores in Connecticut, New Hampshire,
New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A rebound on Wall Street pushed Tokyo stocks
moderately higher early Tuesday after Monday's steep selloff. The
dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 226.96 points,
or 1.19 percent, to 19,235.60 in the first 30 minutes of trading.
On Monday, the average closed down a huge 1,426.04 points, or 6.98
percent after a record drop Friday on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.52 yen, up 1.16 yen from late Monday in
Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 104.26 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index rose as Tokyo investors
were reassured by a strong showing on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
276.74 points to 10,582.51 after a 617.78-point plunge on Friday.
The technology-rich Nasdaq composite soared 217.87 points to
3,589.16 at Monday's close after its 355.49-point slide on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 44.89 points, or 2.90 percent, to 1,597.35
percent. The TOPIX closed down 107.98 points, or 6.53 percent, the
day before.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa sought to calm
investors, saying early Tuesday that Japan's economic recovery
appears healthy enough that Monday's sharp plunge on the stock
market should have no impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the strength of Japan's recovery is quite strong, I'm
not that worried,'' Miyazawa told reporters, adding, however, that
he would be closely watching the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fall in the Nikkei was its fifth worst in both points
and percentage.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 98.98 yen, down from
99.51 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7300 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7050 percent. Its price
fell 0.23 point to 101.46.

Gephardt Expected To Nix China Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt is expected to
announce on Wednesday he will vote against hotly contested legislation granting
permanent normalized trade relations with China, Democratic officials said
today. These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Gephardt,
D-Mo., had informed senior White House officials of his decision. Clinton favors
the measure, as do members of the Republican leadership in the House. In
opposing the legislation, Gephardt would side with the majority of his own
Democratic caucus. A close vote is expected on the legislation when the House
votes sometime next month.

IMF Meets Despite Disruptive Protests
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though demonstrators disrupted the government's workday in
a big swath of the capital, they failed to shut down the two days of meetings of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About 600 people were arrested
today, bringing the total to more than 1,300 since the protests began. The
protesters accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing debts on poor nations,
destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of other ills. World Bank
spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the meetings felt ''bewilderment
and surprise at the degree of anger'' outside. She said the officials were
talking about ways to relieve poverty.

Court: Baggage Squeeze OK Needed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Police officers must get travelers' consent or a court
warrant before squeezing their luggage to see if drugs might be inside, the
Supreme Court ruled today in an expansion of public transit passengers' privacy
rights. The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border Patrol agent who
felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on
unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to contain drugs. The National
Association of Police Organizations said it was disappointed by the ruling.

U.S. Won't Sell Destroyers to Taiwan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior U.S. official said President Clinton today
decided against the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, but approved the
sale of a long-range radar designed to detect missile launches, and a weapons
package that includes help in integrating $18 billion worth of weapons Taiwan
has already bought. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Clinton acted on the recommendation of top advisers who met earlier in the day
at the White House. The decision could touch off a fight with Congress, where
support for Taiwan and its growing democratic trends is strong, especially in
light of menacing gestures by Beijing toward the island.

Barak Readies Israel for Concessions
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak told the Israeli people Monday
they should prepare for a Palestinian entity that would comprise a solid bloc of
land abutting Jerusalem. In an interview with Israel Television timed for the
Passover holiday, Barak made his case to the public for what he told his Cabinet
over the weekend -- that Israel would hand over West Bank land to give the
Palestinians territorial contiguity. Barak also suggested that the Palestinians
would receive West Bank suburbs bordering contested Jerusalem, though he
insisted Jerusalem would remain united and under Israel's sovereignty.

some confidence to hunt for bargains in the wreckage of last week's selling
frenzy. At the close of the regular session, the Dow industrials were up 276.74
to 10,582.51. On the NYSE, decliners led advancers 1,725-1,310. The Nasdaq had
its biggest one-day point gain ever, rising 217.87 to 3,539.16.

   NEAH BAY, Wash. (AP) -- A Makah whaling family set out today in the tribe's
first gray whale hunt of the spring, but the crew returned late in the day
without killing a whale. The Coast Guard arrested two protesters. While tribal
leaders insist the seasonal hunt -- a centuries-old tradition that resumed after
a 70 years absence with the first kill in May -- is vital to preserving the
Makah identity, anti-whaling activists fear it could open the door to a
worldwide renewal of commercial whaling.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Point Fingers in Cali Crash  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The crew of an American Airlines flight was
responsible for entering an incorrect code into a flight computer
that caused a 1995 crash in Colombia, killing 159 people, lawyers
for computer and software makers told jurors in opening statements
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors will be asked to apportion blame for the crash among
American, computer maker Honeywell Air Transport Systems of Phoenix
and software maker Jeppesen Sanderson Inc. of Englewood, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   American's Flight 965, a Boeing 757, veered from its flight path
on Dec. 20, 1995, after its flight management computer was
programmed incorrectly for its approach to Cali. Instead of
following a valley to the city, it turned into a mountainside. Only
four people survived.
</P>
<P>
   American attorney George Manfredi acknowledged that the crew
made mistakes, but told jurors that the pilots ''were concerned
about doing a good job,''
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Honeywell and Jeppesen, however, blamed only
American.
</P>
<P>
   ''American's mistakes caused this crash,'' said Jeppesen
attorney Michael Nachwalter. ''They did everything you could do
wrong on this flight computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell attorney Richard Dunn said the crew made so many
mistakes that he couldn't get into all of them in his allotted
time, saying they took shortcuts because they were running two
hours late on their flight from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn believes pilot Nicholas Tafuri guessed when he went to set
the computer for a navigational beacon named Rozo, which would have
guided the plane to Cali. He said he believes the pilot punched in
the first of 12 options for beacons sharing the letter ''R''
instead of hitting the correct code for Rozo.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, Jeppesen documents showed that 95 of 8,000
navigational beacons worldwide, including Rozo, were not coded in
its program's database. The company says Rozo was listed under its
full name rather than ''R.''
</P>
<P>
   Nachwalter said airlines had been aware of duplicate beacon
codes for years.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled in September 1997 that the crew caused the
crash and allowed victims' damage suits to proceed against American
alone.
</P>
<P>
   But an appeals court later rejected that ruling and said a jury
must decide blame, resulting in the current trial before a
different judge.
</P>
<P>
   Most family lawsuits against American have been settled.
American is trying to force Honeywell and Jeppesen Sanderson to pay
a portion of the crash awards.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Monday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Athletics-Red Sox:
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND: With the 11:07 a.m. starting time, one anonymous
Athletics player had some fun. Someone changed the times listed for
the team bus and meeting on a message board in the clubhouse. It
read: ''Team bus: 4:20 a.m.'' and ''Team meeting: 4:55 a.m.''
Apparently, no one was fooled by the prank because the clubhouse
was nearly empty about and 1{ hours before the start. ... How did a
West Coast team prepare for such an early game? ''We don't have
batting practice so most of us were able to sleep in a little,'' DH
John Jaha said before the game. ''It's awfully early though.'' ...
No West Coast team has played in the annual Patriots Day game in
the last 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: Despite announcing his retirement Friday, former Red Sox
infielder/DH Gary Gaetti's old locker still contains his nameplate
and former jersey. ... Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra was back
in the lineup after getting Sunday off.
Angels-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Mariners swept the Blue Jays this past weekend by
scoring 47 runs. Toronto manager Jim Fregosi held a pitchers-only
meeting Monday. ... The Blue Jays recalled LHP John Bale from
Triple A Syracuse. They optioned RHP Pete Munro to Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Anaheim's Scott Schoeneweis, Kent Bottenfield and Jason
Dickson are in the top 10 in ERA in the American League. ... The
Angels are in the middle of a 10-game road trip. ... OF Garret
Anderson played designated hitter against the Blue Jays. He has a
sprained left ankle.
Yankees-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK YANKEES: Cuban defector Adrian Hernandez, who said he
has signed a four-year contract with the Yankees, pitched his
second simulated game at their minor league camp in Tampa, Fla.
Hernandez, nicknamed ''El Duquecito'' because his pitching motion
is similar to that of Orlando ''El Duque'' Hernandez, pitched four
innings. GM Brian Cashman would not comment on whether the team has
signed Hernandez. The Yanks were off to their fastest 11-game start
since 1988 when they opened at 9-2. New York was 7-4 the last two
seasons, 5-6 in 1997, and 6-5 in 1996. ... Yankees closer Mariano
Rivera started the night needing seven saves to tie Sparky Lyle for
third in the team's career list with 141. Rivera converted 27
straight save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Manager Johnny Oates faxed congratulations to Cal Ripken
on Sunday in recognition of Rikpen's 3,000th hit on Saturday night.
Oates managed Ripken from 1991-94. ... Left-hander Justin Thompson
will make his next rehab start for Tulsa of the Texas League on
Thursday. Thompson started the season on the 15-day disabled list
following left shoulder surgery on Aug. 27, 1999 while a member of
the Detroit Tigers. Thompson threw 75 pitches on Saturday in a
rehab start for Port Charlotte of the Florida State League and
experienced no physical problems.
Mariners-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO WHITE SOX: The White Sox reinstated OF Jeff Liefer from
the 15-day DL and optioned him to Triple-A Charlotte. Liefer was
placed on the DL March 25 with a partial tear of the posterior
cruciate ligament in his left knee. ... Over the last six games,
the White Sox pitchers have compiled a 3.34 ERA (21 earned runs in
56 2/3 innings) compared to a 6.90 ERA in their first seven games.
... After committing 16 errors in their first nine games, the White
Sox have gone four straight without an error.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Aaron Sele (1-0) will start Tuesday and Gil Meche on
Wednesday, manager Lou Piniella said. Sele never made it to
Comiskey Park on Monday. He was on the later team bus which got
word of the postponement before it was scheduled to leave the
hotel. ... The Mariners went 8-4 against the White Sox in 1999 to
win the season series for the fifth straight year. ... Hitting
coach Gerald Perry was busy as the Mariners hit in the indoor
batting cages Monday. Included in the group were SS Alex Rodriguez,
DH Edgar Martinez and IF Mark McLemore.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Marlins-Cubs:	   FLORIDA: All the Florida Marlins want is a little love. Despite
a lineup filled with youngsters and little-knowns, the Marlins are
now 8-6 and a game ahead of Atlanta atop the NL East. But Pro
Player Stadium will probably still be empty when the Marlins return
home Tuesday. In the first series of the season, against San
Francisco, the Marlins drew 9,524, 8,365 and 7,741. ''When people
call us a Triple-A team, that's the biggest insult,'' manager John
Boles said. ''If we are, we're the best ever assembled. We want so
bad to be loved by the people of South Florida. We haven't been
accepted since the 1997.'' ... The Marlins' bullpen went the entire
seven-game road trip without giving up an earned run. ... 2B Luis
Castillo, who's missed the last two games with back pain, will have
a bone scan Tuesday after an MRI was inconclusive.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO CUBS: Manager Don Baylor would like Kerry Wood to make
his return at Wrigley Field. When the 1998 NL Rookie of the Year is
ready for the majors, though, Baylor is going to use him no matter
where the Cubs are. ''If it's on the road, we can only alter our
pitching rotation somewhat,'' Baylor said. ''When he's ready,
believe me, I'm going to find him a spot to pitch.'' Wood,
recovering from ligament replacement surgery, will make another
rehabilitation start Tuesday with Single-A Dayton. He'll throw 100
pitches or seven innings, and could be ready to rejoin the Cubs as
early as May. ... Seen on the Cubs clubhouse message board: ''Be
sure to stretch your Gutierrez muscles.'' The Cubs shortstop didn't
play in Japan because of a strained muscle in his rib cage. ...
With their three-game road trip to Montreal that begins Tuesday,
the Cubs will be playing in their third country. Shane Andrews and
Mark Grace will be looking to homer in three different countries.
Rockies-Diamondbacks:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds has been sent to
Colorado's extended spring training camp in Tucson for
rehabilitation. Hammonds has been on the DL since pulling a
hamstring on opening day. ... The Rockies' 14-13 victory over St.
Louis in Denver on Sunday night was the second-longest nine-inning
game in NL history (4 hours, 19 minutes). The Rockies-Dodgers game
in Denver on June 30, 1996 was one minute longer. ... Colorado's 14
runs Sunday night were the team's most ever without a homer.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Outfielder David Dellucci was optioned to Triple-A
Tucson and utility man Andy Fox (hairline fracture in his left
hand) was activated from the 15-day DL. ... Shortstop Tony Womack
missed Monday night's game and may miss Tuesday's game while
attending the funeral of his grandmother. ... Closer Matt Mantei is
being sent back to Tucson for two more rehab appearances before a
decision is made on whether to activate him. He's been out with
biceps tendinitis.

<HEADLINE> Judge Promotes Two in USDA Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge for the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission has ordered the Agriculture Department to promote two
black managers who were denied advancement because of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Herron and Harold Connor, managers at the department's
Farm Service Agency, will receive promotions, four to five years of
back pay and $10,000 each for damages, the commission said in a
decision made public Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The commission in December dismissed a class-action claim by
more than 300 black Agriculture Department managers who said they
were denied promotions because of their race. Connor and Herron
were the only exceptions to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ruling, dated April 14, denied the two managers most
of their requested damages, saying that they failed to prove they
suffered medical and emotional problems caused by the
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge did not consider the grave harm to their
professional reputations,'' said the Joseph D. Gebhardt, the
managers' attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The original class-action complaint was filed in 1997 against
the Farm Service Agency, which administers subsidy and loan
programs for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Other discrimination complaints by black, Hispanic and female
employees in the department are still pending before the
commission.

<HEADLINE> Father Talks About Athlete Daughter  </HEADLINE>
By MARTA W. ALDRICH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- In December, Kaia Jergenson was running
on the basketball court and hitting jump shots for Lipscomb
University.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she's using a wheelchair until she can be fitted for
prosthetic limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-2 freshman from nearby Gallatin, who averaged 12.5
points and 5.5 rebounds during her short career at Lipscomb, was
hospitalized Jan. 3 with a bacterial infection in her bloodstream.
Surgeons later amputated to remove dead tissue and muscle they said
threatened her life.
</P>
<P>
   With both legs gone below the knee, Jergenson is learning how to
shift from bed to a chair. And writing is another challenge for the
18-year-old pre-med student, with only her thumb and half of her
ring finger remaining on her writing hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a survivor,'' father Bert Jergenson said Monday in an
interview with The Associated Press. ''She keeps herself upbeat.
She has her days and her times when she's down, but it doesn't last
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaia (pronounced KYE'yuh) recovered from the meningococcal
disease and was transferred March 23 to the Rehabilitation
Institute of Chicago, where she is learning new skills with a
wheelchair and voice-activated computer and relearning some old
ones with her remaining fingers and limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's out of shape and they've got to bring her back,'' her
father said in the first family interviews since Kaia went in the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever you stay in a hospital bed that long, no matter how
good a shape you're in, you lose a lot of muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   Jergenson recounted the long fearful days during his daughter's
illness, including the anguish of signing forms permitting doctors
to amputate if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were hoping it would only be the toes,'' he said. ''But the
worst-case scenario was above the knee. When the doctor came out
smiling and said it was below the knee, that was good news, even
though you normally wouldn't think of it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kaia regained consciousness about three weeks later, her
doctor and mother explained that part of her legs and fingers were
gone. But Jergenson believes his daughter already knew the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she came out of her induced coma, she was reaching
around,'' he said. ''I think they more or less just confirmed what
she already knew.''
</P>
<P>
   At St. Thomas Hospital in Nashville, Kaia received daily visits
from friends, teammates, coaches, teachers and pastors that
Jergenson believes helped his daughter come to grips with her new
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   He was concerned her spirits would dissipate when she arrived in
Chicago with only her mother, who is a physical therapist, for
support. But that worry was short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ''That first Sunday, they got her into a wheelchair with a
joystick and went outside. That's when I realized she was going to
be OK -- that she could get around and meet people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaia's biggest physical challenge now is the numerous skin
grafts St. Thomas surgeons performed around the stumps on her legs
and on her thighs and arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have to heal, and only time will do that,'' Jergenson
said. ''And they can't fit her with prostheses until the skin
heals.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she is fitted, though, she will learn to walk again. She
hopes to return to Nashville in late May, and to school at Lipscomb
in August.
</P>
<P>
   Jergenson said it's the tenacity his daughter learned on the
basketball court, where she was MVP of the Tennessee prep
tournament in 1999, that likely will get her through the
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ''When she first started playing, she went into weight training
and couldn't even lift the bar,'' Jergenson said. ''She had to work
at it. She'll have to work at this, too.''
</P>
<P>
   And she has no plans to abandon the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think basketball will always be a part of her life,'' he
said.

Court Expands Passengers' Privacy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an expansion of public transit passengers' privacy
rights, the Supreme Court ruled today that police officers must get travelers'
consent or a court warrant before squeezing their luggage to see if drugs might
be inside. The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border Patrol agent who
felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth Amendment ban on
unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to contain drugs. The National
Association of Police Organizations said it was disappointed by the ruling.

IMF Meets Despite Disruptive Protests
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though demonstrators disrupted the government's workday in
a big swath of the capital, they failed to shut down the two days of meetings of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About 600 people were arrested
today, bringing the total to more than 1,300 since the protests began. The
protesters accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing debts on poor nations,
destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of other ills. World Bank
spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the meetings felt ''bewilderment
and surprise at the degree of anger'' outside. She said the officials were
talking about ways to relieve poverty.

U.S. Won't Sell Destroyers to Taiwan
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senior U.S. official said President Clinton today
decided against the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, but approved the
sale of a long-range radar designed to detect missile launches, and a weapons
package that includes help in integrating $18 billion worth of weapons Taiwan
has already bought. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Clinton acted on the recommendation of top advisers who met earlier in the day
at the White House. The decision could touch off a fight with Congress, where
support for Taiwan and its growing democratic trends is strong, especially in
light of menacing gestures by Beijing toward the island.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak told the Israeli people Monday
they should prepare for a Palestinian entity that would comprise a solid bloc of
land abutting Jerusalem. In an interview with Israel Television timed for the
Passover holiday, Barak made his case to the public for what he told his Cabinet
over the weekend -- that Israel would hand over West Bank land to give the
Palestinians territorial contiguity. Barak also suggested that the Palestinians
would receive West Bank suburbs bordering contested Jerusalem, though he
insisted Jerusalem would remain united and under Israel's sovereignty.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Baseball owners voted unanimously today to approve the $96
million sale of the Kansas City Royals to team chairman David Glass. Glass took

owner Ewing Kauffman. Under Kauffman's succession plan, the team was offered for
sale to Kansas City-area individuals and companies, with the money earmarked for
charity. Glass is the former chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

<HEADLINE> Procter &AMP; Gamble Gets Drug Approval  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. has received federal
approval to market Actonel, its drug for prevention and treatment
of osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   Actonel, which received Food and Drug Administration approval
Monday, faces some well-established competition in the lucrative
market, which is quickly expanding as the baby boom generation
ages.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co.'s Fosamax, also sold as a prevention and treatment
medication for osteoporosis, has been on the market five years. It
had sales of $1.06 billion last year and has been used by more than
3.5 million patients. And in September, the FDA approved Eli Lilly
&AMP; Co.'s Evista as an osteoporosis drug.
</P>
<P>
   Osteoporosis gradually weakens bones and often leads to painful
and debilitating fractures. Vertebral fractures can lead to stooped
posture, chronic pain or disability and can cause compression of
the lungs and stomach. Hip fractures can be life-threatening
because of possible complications. Twenty percent of those who
suffer hip fractures die within a year.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10 million U.S. women age 50 and older have the
disease, but fewer than one-quarter of those have been diagnosed
with it, Procter &AMP; Gamble spokesman Don Tassone said. Over the next
decade, 200 million women worldwide could be at risk to contract
the disease, according to industry estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Fosamax, the market leader, costs $1.69 per tablet at wholesale
rates, Merck spokeswoman Donna Cary said from the company's
headquarters in Whitehouse Station, N.J. P&AMP;G's goal is to set a
wholesale price that is 10 percent less than Fosamax, Tassone said.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G expects to start shipping Actonel, generically known as
risedronate, in the United States within three weeks. Since
February, the company has obtained market approval for the drug in
Sweden, the United Kingdom and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Tassone declined to say how much money P&AMP;G has spent in a decade
of developing Actonel. But, he said the spending is in line with
industry averages of $300 million-plus costs of getting a drug to
market approval from its first discovery.
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G and partner Aventis Pharmaceuticals will co-market Actonel.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 7, Angels 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Kelvim Escobar pitched eight strong innings as
Toronto recovered from its worst pitching weekend ever to beat the
Anaheim Angels 7-1 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer hit a grand slam and Raul Mondesi hit a solo homer
for the Blue Jays, who snapped a three-game skid.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto allowed 47 runs in a three-game sweep by the Seattle
Mariners over the weekend -- the most runs allowed in any three-game
stretch in team history.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jim Fregosi held a ''heated'' pitchers only meeting
before the game and Escobar (1-2) got the message. The 24-year old
settled down after escaping a first-inning based loaded jam on
Garret Anderson's double play grounder. He allowed eight hits and
two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who went 2-for-4 with two runs scored, homered off Mark
Petkovsek in the eighth inning to give Toronto a 3-1 lead. After
Petkovsek loaded the bases, Lou Pote relieved and gave up Fullmer's
second career grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim starter Ramon Ortiz (1-1) balked in a run with the bases
loaded in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   A base running mistake cost Anaheim a chance to take the lead in
the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Mo Vaughn led off with a double, Anderson hit what looked
to be an RBI single, but Vaughn missed the bag at third. After the
ball was thrown back into the infield, Escobar threw to third
baseman Tony Batista for the out.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim manager Mike Scioscia ran from the dugout to argue with
third base umpire Rick Reed, but Reed pointed to the dirt where
Vaughn's foot prints were. Scioscia immediately jogged back to his
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took a 2-1 lead in the bottom of the sixth on
consecutive doubles by Mondesi and Carlos Delgado.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, pitching with a slight tear in his pitching shoulder,
allowed two runs and five hits in 5 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on Orlando
Palmeiro's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The 47 runs allowed against Seattle were the most in any
three-game stretch in Toronto history. ... Edgard Clemente started
in center field for the Angels. Clemente is the nephew of Hall of
Famer Roberto Clemente. ... Darin Erstad didn't play because of a
sore right shoulder. He jammed it while making a diving catch in
Sunday's game against Chicago. ... Craig Grebeck started at second
base for the third straight day. Homer Bush is hitting just .154.
He also has a slightly pulled left hamstring. ... Shannon Stewart
remains day-to-day with a pulled quadriceps and right hamstring.
... The Blue Jays had lost nine of their previous 11 games. ...
Mondesi has three home runs.

<HEADLINE> Bush: Tax Plan To Benefit Poor  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- Flanked by single mothers and working
families, George W. Bush argued Monday that the real winners in his
$483 billion tax-cut package are those ''living on the outskirts of
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive GOP presidential nominee used a high school
appearance to rip into Democratic rival Al Gore on both taxes and
gun control, accusing the vice president of flip flops and a dearth
of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want four more years of Clinton-Gore, I'm not the right
guy,'' Bush declared in President Clinton's home state.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor used the focus on tax-filing deadline day to
argue that fewer issues offer a starker contrast with Gore than
taxes, and to claim that his package focuses on blue-collar
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejected the ''risky'' label Gore and other Democrats apply
to his five-year tax cut plan in arguing that it would eat up too
much of the budget surplus and plunge the nation back into deficit
spending. Bush also dismissed critics who say his plan would help
the rich more.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's risky is overtaxing the people who work for a living in
America,'' said Bush, who criticized Gore for not convincing fellow
Democrats in Congress to get rid of the so-called tax marriage
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's time for Vice President Al Gore to stand up and show some
leadership,'' said Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane quickly fired back, repeating the
campaign's charges that Bush is offering ''an irresponsible, risky
tax scheme'' but conceding that taxes is a clear difference.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a real choice,'' said Lehane. ''The American people
will have to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won the public endorsement Monday of 1996 GOP presidential
nominee Bob Dole, who made the announcement during an MSNBC talk
show.
</P>
<P>
   ''I endorse George Bush,'' Dole said, adding, ''I think he is
coming back to the (political) middle, which I think is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, whose wife Elizabeth dropped out of the race, had kept
quiet during the primaries but has since been playing liaison
between Bush and his former presidential rival John McCain, a close
Dole friend.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called the Doles ''good people'' and his friends. ''I am
honored to have the senator's official endorsement and pleased to
have the senator and Elizabeth Dole actively supporting my
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was pitching tax cuts at a high school stop here,
Bush got his biggest cheers when he underscored his anti-abortion
views during a question session. Bush, who has been courting GOP
moderates, added, however, that ''people should be realistic''
about what can be accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said there is insufficient support for a constitutional
amendment outlawing abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and
to save the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that people disagree,'' said Bush, who said he
backs the Republican Party platform's strict anti-abortion
language.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Thursday's anniversary of a bloody Columbine High
School shooting in Littleton, Colo., Bush also was questioned about
gun control and a Texas law allowing concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''This law has made Texas a safer place,'' Bush argued, noting
that when Tennessee adopted a similar law ''Al Gore was totally
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would sign a bill that mandated the sale of trigger locks
with guns,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   There was a working class feel to Bush's campaign swing Monday.
He visited a town that's headquarters to the blue-collar retailing
giant Wal-Mart and toured a museum touting the company's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want tax relief to go to everybody ...,'' said Bush. ''Money
will go to people in families who are living on the outskirts of
poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   In a high school gymnasium, packed with about 500 students and
adults, Bush was introduced by Kim Jenning, a single mother who
made $20,000 and said she would pay no taxes under Bush's plan,
saving $830.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, however, noted that the
richest 5 percent of Americans would get more than 50 percent of
the Bush tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign set up a Web site, allowing people who have
incomes of $100,000 or less to figure how much they would save with
Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   The DNC posted a rival Web site, ''millionairesforbush.com,''
that calculates the tax bill for people making $1 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his tax-cut plan would spend barely a quarter of the
projected budget surplus over 10 years. Experts peg the cost of
Bush's tax plan at up to $1.3 trillion over 10 years, while
estimates of the projected budget surplus range from $900 billion
to $1.9 trillion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has 'Digital Divide' Plan  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHIPROCK, N.M. (AP) -- Pushing to bring high-tech benefits to
places excluded from the nation's prosperity, President Clinton on
Monday promised $1-a-month telephone service to 300,000 American
Indian households to spread the power of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this day and age, when we want every American to have
access to the Internet, we must first make sure that every American
has access to a phone so there will be a line to hook into,''
Clinton told the Navajo Nation.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back over a history of broken promises, Clinton also
said the federal government ''did not live up to its end of the
deal'' when Indians gave up fighting and surrendered their land in
return for peace, security, health care and education. ''That was
wrong,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke in this impoverished Navajo town after earlier
announcing more than $100 million in pledges from the computer
industry for hard-luck communities nationwide -- an effort to erase
the digital divide that separates poor and prosperous Americans in
technology's benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ''In much of America it takes just a modest amount of money and
time to get someone on the Internet,'' Clinton told the Navajos.
''But here an astonishing 37 per cent of the households are without
electricity, about 70 percent without phone service, more than half
without work.''
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Clinton answered questions in an Internet
video conference with seventh- and eighth-grade students at Lake
Valley School, 150 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came to Shiprock -- named for a 1,700 foot geological
monument rising from the surrounding plains -- after a morning stop
in East Palo Alto, Calif., a pocket of poverty in technology-rich
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   More than 24 percent of youngsters in East Palo Alto live in
poverty and over 80 percent are eligible for the free-lunch
program. Schools have just one computer for every 28 students.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visits, along with a stop Tuesday at a computer show
in Chicago, were intended to dramatize the ''digital divide'' of
inequality between computer haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that new technologies like the Internet and wireless
communications can have an enormous positive impact on the Navajo
nation,'' the president said. ''They can help you to leapfrog over
some of the biggest hurdles to develop your economic and human
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   The president was sporting cowboy boots as he spoke in the
parking lot of the Boys and Girls Club in Shiprock. He was
introduced by 13-year-old Myra Jodie, who won a computer from a San
Jose-based website, but was unable to connect to the Internet
because she lives in a home with no telephone.
</P>
<P>
   American Indians rank far below the national average in their
access to telephones, computers and the Internet. The Navajo high
school dropout rate averages 20 percent for 9th graders, and only
one-quarter of adult Navajos have graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a plan to provide basic telephone service to
American Indians for $1 a month. That would be financed by raising
universal service assessments on interstate and international
carriers by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, head of the president's National Economic
Council, said long-distance users would pay about a penny a month
more if carriers pass the charge on to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   In East Palo Alto, speaking at a community technology center
called Plugged In, Clinton said, ''We can truly move more people
out of poverty more rapidly than ever before. Or we can allow
access to new technology to heighten economic inequality and
sharpen social division. ... The choice is ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a young boy about his own computer use, Clinton said,
''I confess I don't use it much for e-mail but that's for very
personal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you work for the government you don't use e-mail very much
unless you want it all in the newspapers,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has opened an investigation into the
White House failure to review thousands of e-mails that may have
been under subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined in East Palo Alto by computer and civil
rights leaders.
</P>
<P>
   He said Gateway would provide technology training to 75,000
teachers, including every teacher in East Palo Alto, while Novell
would donate $20 million in software for nonprofit organizations
helping Hispanic organizations. Hewlett-Packard will invest $15
million in a new ''digital village'' initiative in three
underserved communities, including East Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Qualcomm will commit $25 million to bridge the digital divide in
San Diego, where it is based.
</P>
<P>
   PowerUp, a partnership of America Online, Gateway and other
companies to bring technology to young people in schools and
community centers, pledged to expand from 19 to 250 sites
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   AOL said it would provide 100,000 accounts for use at PowerUp,
and the Waitt Family Foundation said it would donate 50,000 Gateway
computers.

<HEADLINE> Football Player Leaves Florida  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida sophomore John Capel, a member
of the Gators' football and track teams, withdrew from the
university.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Oswald, spokesman for Florida's track team, confirmed
Monday that Capel left the Gainesville school last week before the
Sea Ray Relays meet at Tennessee. But Oswald refused to give any
details concerning the departure.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Doug Brown told a Knoxville newspaper during the meet that
Capel, a 2000 Olympics, had left the team.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Capel nor Brown could be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Capel, of Brooksville, Fla., likely will concentrate on
qualifying for a spot on the U.S. Olympic track team.
</P>
<P>
   Capel currently leads the nation's 200-meter qualifiers with his
19.87 second effort to win the NCAA outdoor title in June,
according to USA Track &AMP; Field. The U.S. Olympic Trials begin on
June 14 in Sacramento, Calif. The top three finishers qualify for a
spot on the Olympic squad.
</P>
<P>
   Capel was used mostly as a kick returner on the football team.
He also caught nine passes for 84 yards, but did not participate in
spring drills so he could concentrate on the track season.
</P>
<P>
   He had been expected to play a larger role on the football team
after the departures of wide receivers Travis Taylor and Darrell
Jackson, who left school early for the NFL.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Expected to Nix China Bill  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt is
expected to announce this week he will vote against a bill granting
permanent normalized trade relations to China, Democratic officials
said Monday, dealing a blow to administration lobbying efforts on
the hotly contested measure.
</P>
<P>
   These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Gephardt, D-Mo., had informed senior White House officials of his
decision, and would likely announce it on Wednesday in a speech in
his hometown of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton favors the measure, as do members of the Republican
leadership in the House and the two men in line to become the major
party presidential nominees, Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov.
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing the legislation, Gephardt would side with the
majority of his own Democratic caucus, as well as virtually the
entire House Democratic leadership and the party's traditional
allies in organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   A close vote is expected on the legislation when the House votes
sometime next month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House played down Gephardt's decision, saying it had
been expected for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's important is that he's going to let Democrats in the
caucus vote on this up or down on the merits,'' said presidential
spokesman Jake Siewert, accompanying Clinton on a visit to New
Mexico. ''We think that given a chance to explain the merits of
this deal to Democratic caucus, that we'll secure enough support to
approve the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Until this year, Congress has reserved the right to make an
annual decision on whether to extend trading rights to the Chinese
that are currently extended to almost every other country. The
pending legislation would put an end to that practice in favor of a
permanent grant.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt is expected to argue the measure is not strong enough
to justify surrendering the potential for the United States to
influence China's polices on human rights, the environment and
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that while Gephardt intends to announce his
opposition to the measure, he is not expected to join in a
full-fledged effort to defeat it, a campaign being led in the House
by the Democratic whip, Rep. David Bonior of Michigan. Rather, the
Missouri lawmaker likely will explain his position to fellow
Democrats, and continue to urge the members of the rank-and-file to
come to their own decision, this official added.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a politically perilous one for Gephardt and the
Democrats, who are waging a strenuous effort to win back the House
in the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor is fighting the trade bill, fearing the
potential loss of jobs. Business groups, eager to open up an
enormous new market, are strongly for it. That sets up a
potentially dangerous vote for Democratic lawmakers from swing
districts, who might customarily rely on backing from the AFL-CIO
to win difficult re-election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gephardt's leadership, Democrats also have made a strong
effort to raise campaign donations from business leaders,
particularly the high tech industry, without diminishing their
traditional ties to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, Gephardt emphasized support for several
items on the high tech industry's agenda, but sidestepped the issue
of trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand your concerns,'' he said late last month to a
business group. But he added that any legislation must provide
''the right incentives for China to move towards the rule of law,
to protect both personal and property rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on trade relations with China is expected to be one of
the most hardfought of the entire 106th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert recently announced a vote would be
held on the bill the week of May 22. That was widely seen as a
concession to Clinton and an enticement to wavering Democrats, who
had feared that the GOP leadership would maneuver to postpone the
roll call until closer to the fall elections, when the political
danger to Democrats could be greater.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Calif., a supporter of the
bill, recently predicted that as many as 70 or 80 Democrats would
wind up supporting the measure. Many of those votes will come from
within the New Democrat Coalition, a group of mostly younger
lawmakers who are attempting to push the party toward a new
position on economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even support from 70 or so Democrats would fall short of what
Republicans once said they would need. Recently, however, some GOP
aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, have begun to suggest
that 70 or 80 Democratic votes will be enough to get the measure
passed.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Defense Minister Visits Russia  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraq's defense minister met in Moscow last
week with his Russian counterpart to discuss military cooperation,
the official Iraqi News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's ITAR-Tass news agency also reported the visit, saying
Lt. General Sultan Hashim Ahmed made the stop in Moscow while
returning home from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first official foreign trip by an Iraqi defense
minister since the end of the 1991 Gulf War. It wasn't immediately
clear why he visited the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi military cooperation with other countries has been a
sensitive subject given that Baghdad has been refusing for more
than a year to allow the United Nations to carry out inspections
for suspected weapons of mass destruction. Iraq is under an arms
embargo as part of U.N. sanctions imposed after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed was in Russia from Friday to Sunday and met with Russian
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. INA said the two dealt with
''bilateral relations in military fields'' and ''the unjust
sanctions imposed on Iraq.'' It gave no other details.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is a staunch ally of Iraq in its efforts to have U.N.
sanctions lifted, in part because of the millions of dollars of
debts from the Soviet-era owed by Iraq. Iraq now pays Russia with
oil.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries have had military pacts since 1970, and the
Iraqi army uses almost entirely Russian weapons and machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military experts had left the country days before the
Gulf War started in 1991, but returned later to maintain the Iraqi
military industry and what was left of the Iraqi air force.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed was appointed defense minister just after the Gulf War. He
was the top military official who negotiated the cease-fire with
the U.S.-led allies on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti borders in March 1991.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic Lawmakers Seek Explanation  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Hispanic state lawmakers, dissatisfied with
a recent apology by the state's health commissioner, sent letters
Monday demanding a better explanation of his remarks on Hispanic
communities' attitudes toward teen pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Health Commissioner William ''Reyn'' Archer apologized last week
after being quoted in newspapers as saying Texas has a high teen
pregnancy rate because the state's Hispanic population lacked the
belief ''that getting pregnant is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Were these comments personal feelings, impressions of Hispanic
culture or a slip of the tongue?'' said one of the letters, signed
by Democratic Rep. Rene Oliveira, chairman of the 37-member Mexican
American Legislative Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Mario Gallegos Jr., chairman of the Senate
Hispanic Caucus, wrote in another letter on behalf of the caucus:
''Your remarks showed complete lack of understanding of our culture
and our values.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez, D-San Antonio, and the National
Council of La Raza have called for Archer's resignation, but Gov.
George W. Bush, who approved Archer's 1997 appointment, has
rebuffed those demands.
</P>
<P>
   In his written apology, Archer said he deeply regretted creating
an ''erroneous impression about Hispanics and teen pregnancy. I
apologize for any harm that it may have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   Department of Health spokesman Doug McBride said Archer ''will
respond to the caucus concerning the questions raised by the
caucus.''

<HEADLINE> Penguins 4, Capitals 3  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jiri Slegr's slap shot beat goaltender Olaf
Kolzig with 4:32 remaining and the Pittsburgh Penguins, luring
Washington into an unwanted shootout, won 4-3 Monday night to seize
a 3-0 Eastern Conference playoff lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Hrdina scored twice -- with four goals, he has as many as
Washington does in the series -- as the seventh-seeded Penguins
moved within a victory of their second major playoff upset in two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins eliminated top-seeded New Jersey in the first round
a year ago and now need one more victory to oust the second-seeded
Capitals, who failed to hold a 1-0 lead for the second successive
game.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 will be Wednesday night in Washington, where Pittsburgh
won 7-0 in Game 1, followed by Game 5, if necessary on Friday. The
quirky schedule, which wound up benefiting the Penguins, resulted
from scheduling conflicts at Mellon Arena and ABC-TV's request to
televise Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams in NHL history have squandered a 3-0 playoff
lead, the Penguins doing it last in 1975 against the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, playing with the desperation of a team about to go
down three games, tied it at 3 on Calle Johansson's goal at 14:02,
but Slegr won it less than two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Straka drew the defense by carrying the puck down the
right wing boards, only to make an on-the-tape cross-ice pass to
Slegr, who slammed it past Kolzig from the edge of the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Hrdina scored a critical tying goal in the second period, then
put Pittsburgh ahead 3-2 by taking Jaromir Jagr's pass and steering
the puck off Olaf Kolzig's glove at 2:13 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals, well aware that a loss would almost certainly end
their season, played desperate, gambling hockey after that and
finally tied it on Calle Johansson's power-play goal at 14:02. With
Darius Kasparaitis off for interference, Richard Zednik went to the
net to occupy Ron Tugnutt and Johansson beat him from the high
slot.
</P>
<P>
   Tugnutt, now 11-2 against Washington the last four seasons,
stopped 24 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's offense was nonexistent for the first 25 minutes,
managing only two shots in the first period while being outshot
19-5 -- a virtual replay of Game 2, when Washington also opened a
1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It took an unlikely source, the fourth line, to finally open up
the Penguins' offense with an excellent shift that created several
scoring chances and awakened a standing-room crowd of 17,148 in the
NHL's oldest arena.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, with Ulf Dahlen off for holding down Jagr
along the rear boards, Hrdina skated down the slot to take Jagr's
pass from the right circle and steer it past Kolzig at 8:04.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh kept pressuring after the power play and the fourth
line scored this time, with Pat Falloon's wraparound deflecting off
defenseman Sergei Gonchar's skate and into the net to make it 2-1
at 9:44 -- 1:40 after Hrdina's goal.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the fans still celebrating the goal, Tugnutt
abandoned the net as he tried to clear the puck, allowing Jeff
Halpern to jam it into the net 11 seconds after Falloon scored.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's Chris Simon, returning from his one-game suspension
for cross checking Peter Popovic to the jaw in Game 1, gave
Washington the 1-0 lead at 15:39 of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, abandoned by defenseman Hans Jonsson in front of the net,
went from his backhand to his forehand to lift a rebound of his own
shot by Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   Popovic, cited by coach Herb Brooks for his consistent
shot-blocking in Game 2, missed the game with an apparent
concussion resulting from the Game 1 hit.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is 0-6-1 since last winning at Pittsburgh in November
1997. The Penguins are 5-1 overall against the Capitals this
season.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani paid $3.6 million for direct mail; Hillary video cost$277,000  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Giuliani Senate campaign only raised about
twice as much money as it spent on fund-raising during the first
three months of the year, largely due to huge sums paid out to
direct mail firms, according to campaign finance documents released
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to elect Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to the U.S. Senate
spent about $3.6 million on direct mail between Jan. 1 and March
31, according to documents filed with the Federal Elections
Commission. Another $300,000 was spent on postage, fund-raising
consultant fees and telemarketing.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani raised $7.3 million during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the Clinton campaign spent about $1
million on direct mail and postage but raised $4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the campaign to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Senate
paid $277,000 for the production of the 18-minute ''Hillary''
documentary that was shown at the February event officially
launching Clinton's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The biopic featured interviews with Clinton's mother and various
admirers, in addition to a clip of the first lady making fun of her
own lack of culinary skills by saying ''I make a mean tossed
salad.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary was made by Clinton supporter Linda
Bloodworth-Thomason.
</P>
<P>
   About $1 million of Giuliani's direct-mail bills came from
American Target, the Virginia-based company run by Richard
Viguerie. His appeals for money for Giuliani have painted Hillary
Clinton as an ultra-left-winger.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides have sent out their own fund-raising letter
condemning Giuliani's association with Viguerie, who is renowned
for his fund-raising on behalf of arch-conservatives like Sen.
Jesse Helms of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Giuliani spent $1.3 million on direct mail while
Clinton spent $500,000 on it.
</P>
<P>
   Both this period and last year, Giuliani significantly outpaced
Clinton's fund-raising, with the mayor raising nearly $20 million
while the first lady raised nearly $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   The January-through-March expense forms also show that Clinton
paid $230,000 for political consulting and media work to various
firms, including the New York advertising company, Devito Verdi,
and a company run by Mandy Grunwald, who was a strategist for Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani listed about $60,000 in fees for various consultants
but also made $770,000 in payments for media production and media
placement, most of it apparently for the purchase of television ad
time.
</P>
<P>
   A series of television commercials for Clinton that ran late
last year was paid for by a Democratic party committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates paid hefty sums to pollsters in the first
quarter of this year -- Clinton listing a $56,500 payment and
Giuliani listing $34,000 in polling expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton expenses also include $57,000 paid for White House
air travel, plus about $20,000 paid out for various train and plane
expenses incurred by campaign staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani listed about $85,000 worth of travel expenses
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has complained that Clinton should be reimbursing the
government for a greater share of her travel expenses. She has only
been paying for the equivalent cost of one first-class airfare on
her campaign and fund-raising swings around the state and the
country, even though the actual cost to the government is much
higher because she flies on a White House jet.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign has defended the practice, saying it is a
standard reimbursement formula used by first ladies, presidents and
vice presidents when they campaign for themselves or others.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Co's Ask For Suit Dismissal  </HEADLINE>
By BOB EGELKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds asked a
judge on Monday to throw out a jury's $21.7 million damage award to
a dying ex-smoker, arguing that she should have paid attention to
the warning labels on cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the fact that (Leslie) Whiteley had an opportunity to
view these warnings ... hundreds of thousands of times over the
course of her smoking history ... she either ignored them or
decided that she could disbelieve them,'' the nation's two largest
tobacco companies said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said the only cause of her lung cancer that could
be recognized under the law was ''her failure to observe those
warnings, and not any design defect in (the companies') products.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies asked Superior Court Judge John Munter to overturn
last month's verdict and dismiss the suit. A hearing is scheduled
May 19.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was the nation's first in favor of a smoker who took
up the habit after surgeon general's warnings started appearing on
cigarette packs in the 1966. Whiteley started smoking in 1972, at
age 13, and testified she thought smoking was safe because
companies promoted it and the government allowed it.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors expect Whiteley, 40, of Ojai in Ventura County, to die
of lung cancer this year.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing internal industry documents, jurors found that
the companies designed cigarettes negligently, then made false or
misleading statements to the public and concealed the dangers of
smoking. The jury awarded $1.7 million in compensation to Whiteley
and her husband, and $20 million more in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's court filing argued that the entire verdict was
unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris' Marlboros and Reynolds' Camels, the brands
Whiteley smoked, couldn't have been negligently designed because
they were legal products whose dangers were well-known, wrote H.
Joseph Escher, a lawyer representing both companies. He also said
there was no evidence that Whiteley would have smoked a safer
cigarette if one had been available.
</P>
<P>
   ''A manufacturer should not be found liable for supplying a
product that the ordinary consumer recognizes as having inherently
dangerous qualities but chooses to use anyway,'' Escher said.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued that the fraud verdict was unfounded because
there was no evidence that Whiteley heard or relied on a false
statement by either company in her decision to smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was absolutely no evidence that (the two companies) ever
claimed that smoking was safe, or that it did not involve serious
health risks, much less that Ms. Whiteley ever became aware of such
statements,'' Escher wrote.

<HEADLINE> Det Lawyers Sue Diabetes Drug Maker  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Lawyers for a woman who says her mother died
after taking the diabetes drug Rezulin filed a federal class-action
lawsuit Monday against the manufacturer, claiming the company
misled consumers about the drug's risks.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm Charfoos &AMP; Christensen filed the suit against
Warner-Lambert Co. and its subsidiary, Parke-Davis, in U.S.
District Court on behalf of Kimberly Kent, whose mother, Virginia
Kent of Detroit, died.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert in March complied with a Food and Drug
Administration request to withdraw Rezulin after the drug was
linked to 61 deaths and seven liver transplants. About 750,000
people have taken the drug, which went on the market in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges that Rezulin remained on the market too long
because Warner-Lambert and Parke-Davis withheld information about
the adverse effects of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lives would have been saved and suffering prevented if this
product had been pulled from the shelves when these problems were
first documented,'' plaintiff's attorney J. Douglas Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit contends that people who have taken Rezulin before
it was pulled from the market March 21 need extensive medical
testing, even if they have suffered no ill effects.
</P>
<P>
   Peters estimated damages could exceed $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also claims Warner-Lambert hid information and
contrived data attributed to clinical trials during the Food and
Drug Administration's approval process.
</P>
<P>
   Warner-Lambert said Monday it has strictly adhered to FDA
regulations. The company acknowledged some adverse effects with
Rezulin but said it has adequately warned patients of the risks and
would vigorously defend all lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Three New Jersey residents filed a similar lawsuit in state
court there April 11, seeking to represent all people who took
Rezulin for type 2 diabetes between March 1, 1997, and the
beginning of this month.

<HEADLINE> Tax Procrastinators Mob Post Office  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE CARROLL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- As the midnight tax deadline loomed Monday
night, thousands of last-minute filers mobbed post offices around
the country to get their forms postmarked on time.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, umbrella-toting procrastinators crowded into
the city's main post office to face the inevitable. These
stressed-out latecomers didn't let the extra two days given to
taxpayers this year stop them from cutting it close.
</P>
<P>
   Qudsiya Assan, 26, of Brooklyn, couldn't finish her forms on
time, and said she ''just came for the extension.'' Finishing up a
letter to the Internal Revenue Service explaining why her form was
going to be late, her head started to hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I caught a headache coming in here today,'' Assan said at the
James A. Farley Post Office in midtown Manhattan. ''I pay enough
taxes already.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone at the block-long columned building on Eighth
Avenue was feeling the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Parker, 36, said he likes ''the party atmosphere'' of the
post office on tax day. ''I'm in a good mood,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a man dressed as Uncle Sam in silver pants and a top
hat was hoisted up on stilts, giving out chocolate coins to promote
his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just mailed my taxes,'' Parker said. ''I'm getting a
significant return. Then I got some pens and chocolate outside.''
He says the many promotional freebies that companies distribute at
the main post office on tax day keep taxpayers' spirits up.
</P>
<P>
   Because April 15 fell on a Saturday this year, most Americans
got two extra days to file their taxes. But people in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire, Rhode Island,
Vermont and most of New York outside of the New York City area have
another day -- until midnight Tuesday -- because of the Patriot's Day
holiday in Maine and Massachusetts. Many of the returns from the
region are handled by the IRS service center in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   At the Terminal Annex post office in downtown Los Angeles, lines
of cars a block long snaked steadily past open-air booths set up to
collect tax returns in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the booths, postal workers wearing yellow slickers to
protect them against the day's steady rain, collected the envelopes
and sent the taxpayers on their way.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wanted to see the lovely postal workers,'' was Maureen
Tabor's excuse for waiting until the last minute Monday night.
''And I guess I like procrastinating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles woman will procrastinate a bit longer, having
filed an extension form, not her return.
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, so many people chose electronic filing that the
usual last-minute rush seemed calmer, one tax preparer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're less swamped than usual,'' said Dan Griffiths, district
manager for H&AMP;R Block's 11 offices in south central Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   But in Chicago, pen and paper ruled.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second year in a row that Isaiah Heard, 28, found
himself trying to beat the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't mind waiting to the last day. It's almost like
tradition now,'' he said at the downtown post office, which was
open until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Heard said he had planned to file electronically before he was
informed of the additional charges. So, he spent Monday morning
completing the forms.
</P>
<P>
   Eric O'Quinn, another last-minute Chicago filer, said he waited
on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I owed money,'' he explained. ''I figured it didn't
make sense to send it in earlier.''

<HEADLINE> Senators 4, Maple Leafs 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Rob Zamuner's second goal of the game
past an angry Curtis Joseph helped the Ottawa Senators end an
eight-game playoff losing streak with a 4-3 victory Monday night
over the Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs still lead 2-1 in the best-of-7 Eastern Conference
first-round series. Game 4 is Wednesday night at the Corel Centre.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Alfredsson and Colin Forbes also scored on Joseph, who
faced just 15 shots and was given a misconduct penalty for abusing
referee Mick McGeough after Zamuner's second goal, at 14:17 of the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, incensed at interference in the crease as Alfredsson
wrestled with defenseman Cory Cross, skated out to argue, lost his
footing and took McGeough down with him. Joseph stayed in the game
as Cross served the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Thomas, Dmitri Khristich and Jonas Hoglund beat Tom
Barrasso, who made 31 saves in response to criticism for soft goals
in two Toronto victories last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa, swept last season by Buffalo, had not won a playoff game
since a victory over Washington in the second round in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators, accused of playing passive in a 5-1 loss Saturday
night at Toronto, slammed every Leafs player who touched the puck.
Ottawa drew an early two-man advantage when Alyn McCauley and Kevyn
Adams took penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson's shot from the left side slipped between Joseph's
legs at 5:24 of the opening period, giving Ottawa the lead for the
first time in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Zamuner made it 2-0 when his pass across the crease went in off
Thomas Kaberle's skate at 9:44 of the second, but Thomas banged in
Gerald Diduck's rebound to put Toronto on the board 19 seconds
later.
</P>
<P>
   A turnover at the red line allowed the low-scoring Forbes to
sweep in on the right side and beat Joseph high with a backhander
5:27 into the third.
</P>
<P>
   Khristich banged in a Darcy Tucker pass on a power play at 10:18
before Zamuner's long shot got through. Hoglund got one back with
17 seconds left, making it 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto's Nik Antropov left the game 7:40 into the first with an
apparent knee injury after he missed Chris Philips with a hit and
banged heavily into the boards.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 85, Magic 83  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The Milwaukee Bucks clinched the eighth --
and final -- playoff berth in the Eastern Conference, beating the
Orlando Magic 85-83 Monday night on Glenn Robinson's breakaway dunk
with 21.9 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Chucky Atkins missed a 3-point attempt on Orlando's last
possession, and Milwaukee's Darvin Ham batted the rebound into the
backcourt as the final seconds ticked off and the Magic's
improbable challenge for a post-season spot came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The teams began the night tied for the eighth spot with two
games remaining. Orlando had to win to keep its hopes alive because
Milwaukee had clinched the season series between the clubs by
winning the first three meetings between them by an average margin
of 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Tim Thomas scored 21 points and Sam Cassell had 19
points and 10 assists for the Bucks, who won despite playing
without leading scorer Ray Allen in the fourth quarter and getting
a poor shooting performance from Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Allen sprained his left knee during a scramble for a loose ball
in the final minute of the third quarter and did not return.
Robinson only made 5 of 16 shots, but was in the right place at the
right time on the fast break that produced the winning basket.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins led Orlando, which wiped out a 19-point first-half
deficit and took its first lead late in the fourth quarter, with 18
points. Another reserve, Pat Garrity, had 15 points and Darrell
Armstrong added 13 for the Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made three clutch baskets for the Bucks down the stretch,
tying the game at 79, 81 and 83 before Milwaukee went ahead for
good.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando missed nine of its first 10 shots and turned the ball
over seven times while falling behind 20-3 in the first nine
minutes of the game. The Bucks built the lead to 19 before the
Magic gradually worked their way back into it with help from a 19-9
run that spanned much of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks only got two points from Allen and Robinson while
Orlando was making the comeback, with Allen hitting the only shot
he took in the period and Robinson going 0-for-2 to finish the half
1-for-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic pulled within one with 1:05 remaining in the half, but
Milwaukee scored six quick points to lead 43-36 at the break. The
Bucks threatened to pull away again twice in the second half before
Orlando finally caught them midway through the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The playoff berth is the second straight for the Bucks
under second-year coach George Karl ... Allen averaged 29.3 points
in Milwaukee's first three games against Orlando, but only took
nine shots in 32 minutes Monday night ... Ervin Johnson had 13
rebounds and Ham and Robinson each had 11 for the Bucks.

Najm Al-Sadoon
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Najm Al-Sadoon, an Iraqi journalist jailed
in the 1980s on charges of spying for Saudi Arabia, died in a
Baghdad prison. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The Saudi newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat published his obituary
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sadoon was the Baghdad correspondent of the Saudi daily
Al-Riyad when he was arrested in 1986 and charged with spying for
the oil-rich kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   A revolutionary court later sentenced him to death, but
President Saddam Hussein commuted it to a life imprisonment in an
apparent bid to appease Saudi Arabia, among Baghdad's supporters
during the 1980-88 Iraq-Iran war.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Sadoon worked as a journalist for several Iraqi newspapers
during the days of Iraq's monarchy, which ended in a bloody
military coup in 1958. He later set up his own publications.
</P>
<P>
Abram Chayes
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Abram Chayes, a Harvard Law School professor who
represented Nicaragua's Sandinista government in a successful World
Court lawsuit against the United States, died Sunday of cancer. He
was 77.
</P>
<P>
   Chayes, a World War II veteran, served as a clerk for U.S.
Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter before joining the Harvard
faculty in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he was a legal adviser for the U.S. Department of State
under President Kennedy. He worked in private practice for the
Washington, D.C., firm of Ginsburg &AMP; Feldman before returning to
teach at Harvard in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Chayes successfully argued before the World
Court that the United States' backing of the Nicaraguan resistance
forces was inconsistent with international law. The Reagan
administration did not consider itself bound by the World Court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Chayes served as staff director for the platform committee at
the Democratic national convention in Los Angeles in 1960, and was
director of foreign policy task forces for the McGovern campaign in
1972 and during the Carter campaign four years later.
</P>
<P>
   He taught several courses at Harvard, including international
law, international peacekeeping and civil procedure.
</P>

Joseph Burton DeLaCruz
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Joseph Burton DeLaCruz, former president of the
National Congress of American Indians and head of the Quinault
Indian Nation for more than two decades, died Sunday of a heart
attack. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   DeLaCruz gained attention in battles with state and federal
agencies over timber cutting, fishing rights and tribal
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   He also led the drive for tribes to obtain line-item
appropriations from Congress rather than allocations through the
federal bureaucracy, boosting tribal control over police, health,
land use, education and other services.
</P>
<P>
   DeLaCruz became the Quinaults' president and executive director
in 1972. He also served two terms as president of the National
Congress of American Indians and headed the National Tribal
Chairman's Association and the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest
Indians.
</P>
<P>
Pyotr Glebov
</P>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Pyotr Glebov, a prominent Russian stage and screen
actor, died Monday after a long illness. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Glebov was best known for playing Grigory Melekhov in Mikhail
Sholokhov's classic Cossack epic ''And Quiet Flows the Don.'' He
also starred in ''The Virgin Land Upturned,'' ''Baltic Sky'' and
''The Youth of Peter the Great.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, he was named a People's Artist of the Soviet Union, the
highest award given an actor by the state.
</P>
<P>
James C. Laxson
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- James C. Laxson, whose 51-year career with The
Associated Press included handling photo coverage of the civil
rights struggle and the early years of the space program, died
Sunday of a brain tumor. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   As an AP photo editor in Atlanta in 1946, he worked with the
amateur photographer whose pictures of people jumping from windows
during the deadly Winecoff Hotel fire in Atlanta won a Pulitzer
Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Laxson also handled pictures from the early space shots at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., and was in Montgomery, Ala., when riots broke out
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Laxson later served as news editor of the AP's Atlanta bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Lorraine; three children; and three
brothers.

<P>
Auguste R. Lindt
</P>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Auguste R. Lindt, a Swiss diplomat who served as
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the 1950s, died over the
weekend. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Lindt was appointed to head the U.N. refugee agency in 1956, and
immediately began to mobilize an assistance program for some
200,000 Hungarians who fled to Austria and Yugoslavia to escape
Soviet repression.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, he oversaw the agency's involvement in
helping more than 260,000 Algerian refugees in Morocco and Tunisia.
He served as the U.N.'s top refugee official until 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Lindt, born into the Lindt family of chocolate makers, studied
law and then worked for eight years for several European
newspapers, reporting from places including Manchuria in northern
China, Liberia, Jordan, the Persian Gulf and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   After his term at UNHCR, Lindt went to Washington as
Switzerland's ambassador. He later served as ambassador to the
Soviet Union, Mongolia, India and Nepal.

Justice W. Shepro
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Justice W. Shepro, a Chicago-area attorney and
businessman who became one of the nation's leading collectors of
antique clocks, died March 30 in an automobile accident. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Using money he made from real estate investments and other
business ventures, he became the owner of one of the world's
largest collections of antique clocks, some dating from the 15th
century.
</P>
<P>
   Shepro was president of the American section of the Antiquarian
Horological Society for almost a decade and wrote articles and
notes about clocks in catalogs at galleries and auctions. In 1977,
he became only the second American admitted into the Worshipful
Company of Clockmakers, a London guild that traces its roots back
to a royal charter granted in 1631 by King Charles I.
</P>
<P>
Bessie Thomas
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Bessie Thomas, who lived through two world
wars and used her centenarian fame to share her principles of hard
work, saving money and treating others with respect, died Saturday.
She was 112.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press last June, Thomas,
known as ''Ms. Bessie,'' said she never drank alcohol, believed in
eating lightly and stayed away from movies, preferring to sing old
religious hymns.
</P>
<P>
   She said her parents probably were slaves early in their lives,
but they never talked about it. She said they taught her rules to
live by.
</P>
<P>
   ''Work hard, save your money and mind your own business,'' she
advised. ''You treat everybody alike and be as good to everybody as
you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas never drove a car or flew in a plane. She helped care for
relatives, but never married. She had a sixth-grade education, but
she said she never stopped reading and learning.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Area 51 Images Said Posted on Web  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA WAGGONER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- The truth is out there -- on the Web. Photos
of Area 51, the super-secret Air Force test site in Nevada that has
long tantalized UFO and conspiracy buffs and fans of ''The
X-Files,'' are being posted on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first glimpse into the most secret training and
testing facility for the Air Force,'' said John Hoffman, president
of Aerial Images Inc. of Raleigh.
</P>
<P>
   The company posted five images of the site, divided into four
frames each, in collaboration with Microsoft, Kodak, Digital
Equipment Corp., Autometric Inc. and the Russian agency
Sovinformsputnik.
</P>
<P>
   The partners launched a Russian satellite from Kazakstan in 1998
to map Earth's surface and Area 51. An open-skies agreement signed
in 1992 by 24 nations, including the United States and Russia, made
the effort possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force only recently acknowledged that Groom Dry Lake Air
Force Base even exists. The 8,000-square-mile base is 75 miles
northwest of Las Vegas, in the arid, rugged Nellis Range.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the U-2 spy plane in the 1950s, the base has been
the testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the
SR-71 Blackbird and, more recently, the F-117A stealth fighter and
B-2 stealth bomber.
</P>
<P>
   The base's airspace is restricted; aircraft are not allowed to
fly over it. But satellite overflights are allowed as part of an
agreement to verify arms-control compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Among UFO aficionados, it has long been known simply as Area 51,
the base's designation on old Nevada test site maps. They believe
that unidentified flying objects from other worlds are hidden at
the base, where their parts are copied for U.S. prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   The images, with resolution good enough to distinguish a car
from a truck, are better than earlier telephoto shots from the
nearby mountains. The only other known image purportedly was shot
by a satellite in the 1960s. It is much fuzzier.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are runways, there are buildings, there are buses, there
are test sites, but there aren't any little green men or
super-secret aircraft to be seen,'' Hoffman said of the new photos.
</P>
<P>
   Several government agencies are aware of the images and haven't
responded, said Hoffman, 52, a Vietnam veteran who recently retired
from the National Guard after 23 years. ''I've had no feedback from
anybody that indicates anybody gives a hoot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force spokeswoman would not comment Monday on any
security concerns about the images.
</P>
<P>
   ''We acknowledge having an operating site there, and the work is
classified,'' spokeswoman Gloria Cales said. The work involves
''operations critical to the U.S. military and the country's
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Aerial Images, at www.terraserver.com, planned to offer a link
to the Area 51 pages. Viewing the images is free; downloading them
costs $8.95 and up. Kodak will print photographs for $20 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   The images show craters, some seemingly formed by something
dropped from the sky, others possibly by something coming out of
the ground. There are hundreds of buildings, living quarters,
tennis courts, a baseball field, a track and a swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   There are no paved roads and no parking lots; buses are the only
visible vehicles, raising the question of how employees get to and
from work. Unpaved roads disappear into cliffsides, suggesting a
possible underground network.
</P>
<P>
   A shrouded aircraft is visible on a ramp, unusual considering
the Air Force knows when Russian satellites are overhead, Hoffman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Andrus Jr., international director of the Mutual UFO
Network, based in Seguin, Texas, seemed to have a hard time
believing the object of so much secrecy and discussion was
available on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have other photos taken from the ground and from the air,
but they aren't this current,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chris Carter, creator of ''The X-Files,'' apparently was
skeptical when Hoffman contacted him. Some of the show's favorite
themes are UFOs and secret government activities, and one of its
mantras is ''The truth is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He clearly didn't believe me,'' Hoffman said. ''From his tone,
you could tell he didn't believe me that we had Area 51 and we had
the whole area covered.''

<HEADLINE> RFK Jr. Joins Puerto Rican Causes  </HEADLINE>
By RICARDO ZUNIGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Environmentalist Robert F. Kennedy
Jr. said Monday he would sue the Navy for allegedly polluting
Vieques island, as he joined the Puerto Rican campaign to shut down
a Navy bombing range on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a senior counsel for the New York-based Natural
Resources Defense Council, accused the Navy of breaking
environmental laws in a way it never would on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe that the Navy could behave the way it has been
behaving in Vieques in any of the other 50 states. There would be a
revolution,'' Kennedy told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   A Navy spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques has a wealth of bird and sea life, including sea
turtles, manatees, whales and endangered peregrine falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican protesters are preparing vigils to mark the year
anniversary on April 19 of the death of a civilian guard killed by
an errant Marine bomb within the Vieques range -- one the sparks of
popular protests against the base.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has negotiated a deal for the Navy to resume
exercises but with only inert bombs until the people of Vieques
cane decide in a referendum whether they want the base removed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the agreement, some protesters are refusing to budge,
saying they will not tolerate any more exercises.

U.S. Nixes Taiwan Destroyer Sale
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, backed by his senior advisers, decided
today against the sale of four Aegis destroyers to Taiwan, but approved a
smaller package including long-range radar designed to detect missile launches,
two senior U.S. officials said. Clinton acted on the recommendation of top
advisers who met earlier in the day at the White House. The Pentagon had
recommended that the administration put off Taiwan's request to buy new weapons,
including the destroyers, submarines and anti-submarine aircraft, in order to
avoid angering China, which views Taiwan as a rebellious province.

Court Expands Passengers' Privacy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court ruled today that police officers must
get travelers' consent or a court warrant before squeezing their luggage to see
if drugs might be inside. The 7-2 decision in a Texas case said a U.S. Border
Patrol agent who felt a bus passenger's bag violated the Constitution's Fourth
Amendment ban on unreasonable searches. The bag later was found to contain
drugs. The ruling expands public transit passengers' privacy rights, but the
National Association of Police Organizations said it was disappointed by the
ruling.

IMF Protesters Disrupt Capital

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Demonstrators disrupted the workday in much of the
nation's capital today, but they failed to shut down the two days of meetings of
the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. About 600 people were arrested
today, bringing the total to more than 1,300 since the protests began. The
protesters accused the bank and IMF of imposing crushing debts on poor nations,
destroying the environment and perpetrating a host of other ills. World Bank
spokeswoman Caroline Ansety said officials in the meetings felt ''bewilderment
and surprise at the degree of anger'' outside. She said the officials were
talking about ways to relieve poverty.

Elian's Fate in the Hands of Court
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- On the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, Cuban
Americans in Miami stood watch at the home where Elian Gonzalez's relatives
waited for a key ruling in the custody fight. Protesters recalled the deadly
attempt on April 17, 1961, in which CIA-trained exiles failed to invade Cuba.
Their criticism was extended to the Clinton administration, which wants the
6-year-old Cuban boy returned to his Cuban father. The boy's Miami relatives say
he will have a better life here. Both sides were awaiting a ruling from the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta. The government wants the court to lift
an order that bars Elian's removal from the United States and to order Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to release the boy.

Penguins Beat Capitals 4-3
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jiri Slegr's slap shot beat goaltender Olaf Kolzig with
4:32 remaining and the Pittsburgh Penguins, luring Washington into an unwanted
shootout, won 4-3 today night to seize a 3-0 Eastern Conference playoff lead.
Jan Hrdina scored twice as the seventh-seeded Penguins moved within a victory of
their second major playoff upset in two seasons. The Penguins eliminated

victory to oust the second-seeded Capitals, who failed to hold a 1-0 lead for
the second successive game. Game 4 will be Wednesday night in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Pacers 92, 76ers 90  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- With their starting backcourt in street
clothes, the Indiana Pacers beat the poor-shooting Philadelphia
76ers 92-90 on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers' Toni Kukoc missed an 18-foot shot from the corner
that would have tied the game in the final seconds. Philadelphia
missed 13 straight shots and went more than 10 minutes without a
field goal in the fourth quarter as Indiana overcame a 10-point
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's Chris Mullin, making just his second start of the
season, scored 21 points, including nine in the fourth quarter on
three 3-pointers. Jalen Rose added 20.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson led the Sixers, who made 41.5 percent of their
shots, with 24 points. George Lynch had 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which secured home-court advantage throughout the
Eastern Conference playoffs Monday, played without starters Reggie
Miller and Mark Jackson. Miller is nursing a sore lower back and
groin and Jackson has a thigh bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Both had started every game prior to Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The loss leaves the Sixers a half-game ahead of Charlotte for
the No. 4 spot in the East. The Sixers must beat Chicago in their
regular season finale Tuesday and need Charlotte to lose one of its
final two games to get home-court advantage in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Kukoc cut the deficit to 89-88 with a 3-pointer from the wing
with 50 seconds left. Rose, who spent the final minutes taunting
fans sitting courtside, hit two free throws to make it 91-88 with
26.6 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Snow made two free throws to cut it to 91-90 with 19.4
seconds left. Travis Best hit one to make it 92-90, setting up
Kukoc's miss.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers trailed throughout most of the first half, but
outscored Indiana 32-16 in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Iverson, playing with a broken left toe and inflammation in his
right elbow, took over midway through the third. First he put the
Sixers ahead 60-59 with a slicing layup. Then he electrified the
crowd with a behind-the-back pass to Snow, who completed the fast
break with a layup for a 62-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After Mullin made a 3-pointer to tie it at 62, Iverson answered
with a 3-pointer that gave Philadelphia a 65-64 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana opened the fourth quarter with an 11-2 run. Rose capped
the spurt by hitting a 3-pointer to give the Pacers an 84-82 lead
with 6:26 left.
</P>
<P>
   Theo Ratliff gave the Sixers their first lead since the opening
minutes with a slam that made it 56-54 with 8:49 left in the third
as the Sixers opened the second half with a 10-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   With Iverson sitting on the bench for 6:13 of the second
quarter, the Sixers cut a 10-point deficit to 43-37. Kukoc sparked
a 10-2 run with several key passes, getting five of his six assists
during the stretch.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Former National League umpire Eric Gregg covered the game
as a reporter for a newspaper distributed on local public
transportation. Gregg, one of the umpires who lost their jobs in a
labor dispute last year, writes a weekly column. ... Former Detroit
Pistons coach Alvin Gentry sat behind the Sixers' bench during the
game as a guest of coach Larry Brown. ... The Sixers are 21-10
since Kukoc arrived in a deal with Chicago on Feb. 16. The Los
Angeles Lakers and Utah Jazz are the only teams with better records
over that span. ... Mullin's 21 points and 38 minutes were both
season bests.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Can't Persuade U.S. on Ships  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's failure to persuade the United
States to sell it four high-tech Aegis warships has set back the
island's hopes of bolstering its defenses in the face of mounting
threats by China.
</P>
<P>
   For years, analysts have said Taiwan's military -- with its
highly motivated troops and advanced U.S.-made weapons -- could
repel or at least give China a bloody nose if it ever makes good on
threats to attack this island. Taiwan and China split amid civil
war in 1949, and Beijing has warned it might use force to reunify
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, some analysts have begun doubting Taiwan's war
readiness and have raised questions about whether morale, loyalty
and training have slipped in recent years as this island changed
from a poor, authoritarian society to a prosperous, vibrant
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson Fu, director of the Strategic Studies Institute at the
Armed Forces University, which trains Taiwan's military leaders,
doesn't believe the military is facing a talent crisis and he
doubts there is an ideological conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Those who disagree on the independence issue still share a
common goal, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both want to defend Taiwan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious signs the military is aware of the growing
urgency to attract new talent. A new slick ad being shown on TV and
at movie theaters encourages young, educated Taiwanese to put their
computer skills at work on board warships and jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
   But Damon Bristow, a researcher with Britain's Royal United
Services Institute for Defense Studies, doubts Taiwan's military
would have been able to find enough trained sailors to crew the
Aegis ships, equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles of the kind the
U.S. Navy used in the Kosovo conflict last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Taiwanese have reached the saturation level when it comes
to the big things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, President Clinton decided Monday against the sale
of the destroyers. The Pentagon had recommended that the
administration put off Taiwan's request to buy new weapons in order
to avoid angering China.
</P>
<P>
   At a Taipei news conference Tuesday, Taiwanese military
spokesman Kung Fan-ding declined to discuss the requests for
weapons. But Kung said Taiwan urgently needs a better anti-missile
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military has always done its best to acquire any weapons
that would help build up its anti-missile defenses,'' Kung said.
</P>
<P>
   Bristow, who has spent the past six months in Taiwan researching
the military, said the Taiwanese should suspend purchases of
expensive weapons and focus on trimming their ranks and building a
professional armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taiwan's armed forces are flabby and unfit,'' Bristow said,
noting that the island's force of 400,000 troops is made up mostly
of unmotivated conscripts serving their two years of mandatory
service in the army.
</P>
<P>
   A war between China and Taiwan would be unlike ones they have
fought before. Like Taiwan's military, China's 2.5 million-member
People's Liberation Army has never fought a war over a body of
water as big as the 80-mile-wide Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   The last big battles the two have fought involved each other 51
years ago. China's guerrilla PLA troops won that conflict, forcing
the Nationalist government and military to retreat to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   While the military's top leadership still favors eventual
reunification with China and opposes independence, it's not clear
whether junior officers and the enlisted ranks agree.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of young people call themselves Taiwanese, not
Chinese, are interested in developing their own culture and oppose
reunification with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the soldiers aren't singing off the same song books
as their bosses,'' Bristow said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index fell Tuesday
morning adding to Monday's big losses, despite a rebound on Wall
Street. The dollar was higher against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which was up some
300 points early in the session, fell 103.99 points, or 0.55
percent, to 18,904.65 at the end of the morning session. On Monday,
the average closed down a huge 1,426.04 points, or 6.98 percent
after a record drop Friday on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.41 yen in late morning trading, up 1.05
yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also above its late New York
level of 104.26 yen.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started higher as Tokyo
investors were reassured by a strong showing on Wall Street but
moved into negative territory as players locked in profits.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the Nikkei average was technically weighed down by
active portfolio adjustments before next Monday's reshuffle of 30
index components.
</P>
<P>
   The Nihon Keizai newspaper, Japan's major financial daily and
the administrator of the index, has said it will replace some
old-line industrial stocks April 24 to better reflect market
trends.
</P>
<P>
   In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
276.74 points to 10,582.51 after a 617.78-point plunge on Friday.
The technology-rich Nasdaq composite soared 217.87 points to
3,589.16 at Monday's close after its 355.49-point slide on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Nikkei's decline, the broader Tokyo Stock Price
Index of all issues listed on the first section was up 33.11
points, or 2.14 percent, to 1,585.57. The TOPIX closed down 107.98
points, or 6.53 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa sought to calm
investors, saying early Tuesday that Japan's economic recovery
appears healthy enough that Monday's sharp plunge on the stock
market should have no impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the strength of Japan's recovery is quite strong, I'm
not that worried,'' Miyazawa told reporters, adding, however, that
he would be closely watching the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fall in the Nikkei was its fifth worst in both points
and percentage.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 99.08 yen, down from
99.51 yen late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond rose
to 1.7200 percent from Monday's finish of 1.7050 percent. Its price
fell 0.14 point to 101.55.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Show Early Gains  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- Shares rose across Asia early Tuesday in line
with Wall Street's gains, but the big Tokyo market soon turned
lower, raising concerns about the fragility of any recovery from
the global sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not out of the woods entirely,'' said Russell Jones,
chief Asia economist for the investment bank Lehman Brothers in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average was up by as much as 1.7
percent early Tuesday, after prices rose Monday on Wall Street and
signaled to some that the selling had run its course.
</P>
<P>
   But by late morning, the Nikkei was off by 103.99 points, or
almost 0.6 percent, at 18,904.65, adding to its losses of 7 percent
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The panicky mood that swept Asia a day earlier had eased after
prices increased later Monday in New York -- but traders were more
cautious than optimistic after seeing shares take such huge hits in
recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa sought to calm
investors, saying early Tuesday his nation's economic recovery
appears healthy enough that the sharp plunge on the stock market
should have no impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the strength of Japan's recovery is quite strong, I'm
not that worried,'' Miyazawa told reporters. But Miyazawa added he
would be closely watching U.S. shares.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, where the blue chips had fallen 8.6 percent on
Monday, they came back Tuesday with a quick gain of 3.6 percent.
The Hang Seng Index was up 537.11 points at 15,299.48 after about
15 minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong investors gathered around stock-quotation terminals in
local bank offices, anxiously watching the numbers flash.

<P>
   In Hong Kong, where the blue chips had fallen 8.6 percent on

The Hang Seng Index was up 537.11 points at 15,299.48 after about
15 minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index, or Kospi,
started Tuesday with a gain of more than 8 percent but dipped by
later in the morning to show an increase of just 4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean shares were hit particularly hard Monday with a
loss of 11.6 percent as red ink splashed through Asia's exchanges,
to be followed later by substantial but slightly lesser losses in
major European markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the share price outlook -- at least for the short-term --
appeared brighter after Wall Street opened again on Monday and
finished with some sizable gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 276.74 points to 10,582.51
on Monday, following its slide of 617.78 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Nasdaq composite index, a major barometer of the
so-called ''new economy'' high-tech companies, gained 217.87 points
to 3,589.16 in Monday's dealings, after a plunge of 355.49 points
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In other Asian markets Tuesday, Australian shares were up 2.6
percent, Singaporean shares rose 2.7 percent and Taiwanese shares
were up 3.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Spurs 100, Grizzlies 93  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- David Robinson scored 12 of his 27 points in
the fourth quarter to rally the San Antonio Spurs to a 100-93
victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio played its third straight game without Tim Duncan,
who has a left knee injury. The Spurs are 4-3 this season without
their All-Star forward.
</P>
<P>
   The win clinched at least the No. 5 playoff position in the
Western Conference for the Spurs, and moved them within a half-game
of Phoenix for the No. 4 slot. The Spurs have one regular season
game remaining, at home Wednesday against the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns play at home Tuesday against Houston, and at Golden
State on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Avery Johnson scored a season-high 24 points, and Antonio
Daniels added 12 for the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, loser of seven straight games, was led by Michael
Dickerson with 29 points. Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 27.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 83-74 early in the fourth quarter, San Antonio rallied
with a 15-2 run to take an 89-85 lead on a Daniels 3-pointer with
5:19 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver went back up 91-90 on Dickerson's jump shot with 3:34
to play.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio then took the lead for good on consecutive baskets
by Robinson and Daniels, the latter coming on a driving layup which
gave the Spurs a 94-91 advantage with 2:51 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio, which has won five of six games, continued to pull
away, and two Johnson free throws made it 100-93 with 20 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Held to only two points in the first half, Abdur-Rahim exploded
for 19 of Vancouver's first 21 points in the third quarter as the
Grizzlies grabbed a 74-62 lead with 3:31 to play in the third
quarter. He finished with 21 third-quarter points and Vancouver led
78-72 going to the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Behind 10 points by Johnson, San Antonio closed the first
quarter with an 11-4 run to lead 28-25 after one.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson had 21 first half points, on 7-of-10 shooting, as
Vancouver took a 53-50 halftime lead.
Notes: San Antonio is 30-10 at home. ... San Antonio swept the
four-game season series from Vancouver, and leads the teams'
all-time series 16-3. ... Vancouver is 3-22 since Feb. 26. ...
Vancouver point guard Mike Bibby added to his club season assist
record with seven against San Antonio. He has 657 this season.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Stabilize  </HEADLINE>
By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Heartened by better results on Wall Street Monday,
European stock markets clawed back much of the ground they had lost
earlier in the day following last week's dramatic plunge in U.S.
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Many European exchanges recovered from heavy losses suffered in
the first few hours of trading, as the Nasdaq Stock Market and New
York Stock Exchange staved off a repeat performance of Friday's
collapse and ended the day higher.
</P>
<P>
   Also emboldened by Wall Street's bounce, Asian markets opened
higher Tuesday, after taking sharp declines the day before in
response to U.S. losses last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the big Tokyo market soon turned lower in early trading
Tuesday, raising concerns about the fragility of any recovery from
the global sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, trading intensified later in the day, with the number
of purchase orders rising as investors noted the relative stability
on U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
   The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares climbed back from a
4.3 percent drop to finish the day 3.0 percent lower at 5,994.60.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were seeing a bit of recovery at the close, on the back of
a steady opening on Wall Street,'' said Andrew Miller of the
London-based brokerage Greig Middleton.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was quite a rally in some of the technology stocks over
the day,'' he added, suggesting that the flight from high-tech
shares might be nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   On Europe's second-biggest stock market in Frankfurt, Germany,
the Xetra DAX index of blue-chip shares bounced back from a 4.3
percent slump to end 0.4 percent down from Friday's close at
7,187.14 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Paris CAC 40 index did even better, closing just 0.1 percent
lower at 6,060.54 points.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Dow fell 617.78 points, or by 5.7 percent,
Friday, its biggest one-day point drop ever. The Nasdaq, home to
technology stocks whose popularity has evaporated, tumbled 355.49
Friday, or by 9.7 percent. The point drop was its worst ever.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, the markets bounced back, with the Nasdaq gaining
6.5 percent, its highest one-day rise. The Dow also rose 276.74 to
10,582.51.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts said it was too soon to tell if Wall Street was
truly recovering from last week's plunge, which slashed nearly $2
trillion from the market's value.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly in Asia early Tuesday, analysts were unsure if the
stronger opening was a sign that prices were recovering from their
plunge on Monday or just pausing at the start of a new downturn.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the region's largest market, the 225-issue Nikkei
Stock Average rose 248.34 points, or 1.3 percent, to reach
19,257.98 in early dealings. The Nikkei had fallen almost 7
percent, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index, or Kospi,
opened with a surge of more than 8 percent, wiping out much of
Monday's 11.6 percent decline, but prices soon eased to show a gain
of 6.7 percent on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa sought to calm
investors, saying early Tuesday his nation's economic recovery
appears healthy enough that Monday's sharp plunge should have no
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the strength of Japan's recovery is quite strong, I'm
not that worried,'' Miyazawa told reporters. But Miyazawa added he
would be closely watching the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Wall Street's showing Monday, stock markets in Eastern
Europe tumbled on average by as much as 6 percent, with shares in
telecommunications companies among those hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
   While most main European markets struggled upward but still
closed lower, Sweden offered a rare example of recovery into
positive territory. Shares in Stockholm closed up 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that investors' dumping of technology stocks
last week caused a much-needed correction in share prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this will do is sort the wheat from the chaff, but at a
faster rate than anyone would have thought. Investors have been
spooked by the speed of these falls,'' said Nigel Little of the
investment bank Nomura.

<HEADLINE> Niger Meningitis Death Toll Rises  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAMEY, Niger (AP) -- The death toll from a meningitis outbreak
in the West African country of Niger has risen to 459, the
government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Since the outbreak surfaced in January, close to 5,700 cases
have been reported, overwhelming the nation's health facilities,
Health Minister Assoumane Adamou said, appealing for international
support.
</P>
<P>
   Meningitis, an infection of the membranes surrounding the brain
and spinal cord, can be caused by a virus or bacteria. With
treatment, only 1 percent of infected people die.
</P>
<P>
   Outbreaks are common in Niger, one of the world's poorest
countries, which straddles the southern tip of the Sahara desert.
</P>
<P>
   Africa suffered its worst meningitis epidemic in 1996 when more
than 150,000 people -- most of them children -- were infected in
several countries and 16,000 died. Another 16,000 suffered brain
damage or paralysis.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- About 100 journalists marched in
Haiti's capital Monday to protest the slaying of the country's
foremost radio commentator.
</P>
<P>
   With demands that the government crack down on attacks, the
journalists marched from Port-au-Prince's central plaza to the
nearby Palace of Justice under the eye of heavily armed police.

   ''The assassination of Jean Dominique was an appalling attack
against freedom of the press,'' said Joseph Guyler Delva, a
newspaper and radio reporter.
</P>
<P>
   Unidentified gunmen fatally shot Dominique April 3 as he arrived
to work at Radio Haiti Inter, a station he owned and directed.
</P>
<P>
   Police have made no arrests in the slaying, but President Rene
Preval defended their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   After Dominique's funeral April 8, street activists loyal to
former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide burned down the
headquarters of an opposition political coalition and stoned the
building that houses the private Radio Vision 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Vision 2000, which has often been targeted for its
anti-government stands, stopped newscasts for several days; and
talk show host Daly Valet has gone into hiding after death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Few violations of press freedom have been reported since U.S.
troops intervened in Haiti in 1994 to stop three years of
repressive military-backed rule. But the atmosphere has worsened
since January 1999, when Preval shut down Parliament and called for
new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ten political killings have been reported since March 29.

<HEADLINE> Van Goes Over Cliff in Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE PASS, Texas (AP) -- A van carrying suspected illegal
immigrants plummeted down a 50-foot cliff on the U.S.-Mexico border
Monday, killing two people and seriously injuring more than a
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   The van was in reverse, with people still trying to get in, when
a Border Patrol vehicle approached, said patrol spokesman Carlton
Jones. After agents told the driver to stop, he jumped into the
front passenger seat while the van was still in reverse. The van
kept rolling backward until it went off a 50-foot cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Seven or eight people were able to get out of the van before it
flipped and rolled several times.
</P>
<P>
   The exact number of passengers and the extent of their injuries
was being determined, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened around 3:45 p.m. along the Rio Grande,
about a mile east of the old Eagle Pass port of entry, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Border Patrol suspects illegal immigrants were
being smuggled into the United States in the van. He said people
would not be arrested until they are released from the hospital.
