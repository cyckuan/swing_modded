<HEADLINE> Microsoft Making PC More Interactive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the software
giant of the U.S., today announced the new technologies to make
personal computers more interactive by integrating them with
television.
</P>
<P>
Building on the Simply Interactive PC (SIPC) initiatives
announced in April 1996, these technologies consist of broadcast
components that allow PCs to receive television programming, data
services and new forms of entertainment blending the two, plus
user interface elements suitable for use on large-screen display
devices, such as a large VGA monitor or television.
</P>
<P>
With these technologies, people can have new ways to experience
television, such as combining the functions of the PC, television
and the Internet, and making programs more attractive.
</P>
<P>
In addition, broadcast networks can deliver and store data
locally on the PC, reducing the Internet bandwidth bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft also announced the introduction of new user interface
elements for the Windows operating system. These interfaces are
designed for use with remote control devices and for controlling
audio, video and other consumer electronics devices. These
components will appeal both to customers who use computers and to
those who may never have used them before.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft intends to deliver initial development kits to key
companies this February. Products and services that support these
technologies are expected to be available to the public by the end
of 1997, according to the company.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Moves DNA Molecules with Magnetic Tweezers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Denis Wirtz, an assistant
professor at the Johns Hopkins University, switches on his
magnetic tweezer, grabs a single DNA molecule and uses a joystick
to steer it through a solution.
</P>
<P>
However, Mr. Wirtz is not playing an electronic game. Using his
device, a physician may soon magnetically move a microscopic sac
filled with cancer-killing medicine through a patient's veins,
then empty it directly into diseased cells.
</P>
<P>
"You could use the tweezers as a surgical tool to take it to
the fluid-filled cell containing a drug," said Mr. Wirtz. Doctors
now can move things inside a vein mechanically and invasively,
with magnetic force, "it's non-invasive."
</P>
<P>
The forces that allow Wirtz's device to work are very simple.
If you place a sheet of paper over a steel button, then hold the
magnet on top of the paper, you can move the button without
touching it.
</P>
<P>
Wirtz's magnets are three sets of coiled copper wire, each
connected to a power sources. The coils are positioned to produce
electromagnetic fields in three dimensions: backward and forward,
side to side, and up and down.
</P>
<P>
Then Wirtz need his "steel button", the DNA molecule by itself
isn't magnetic. Wirtz resolves the problem with iron oxide beads,
each no larger than one-hundredth of a micron in diameter. He
coats the beads with protein Biotin which could automatically
attaches itself to an end of a DNA molecule, giving it a tiny
magnetic partner.
</P>
<P>
For his research, Wirtz selected the lambda-phage DNA molecule,
found in a virus and large enough to view with a simple
microscope. But he believes the magnetic manipulation technique
will work with other biological polymers, including those designed
to carry medicine to a specific site or move genes and enzymes
within microscopic cells.
</P>
<P>
Wirtz, who invented the tweezers three years ago as a
postdoctoral student in Belgium, has been able to collect clear
video and computer images of DNA molecules in motion at Hopkins
with the aide fo a confocal microscope. "You see this DNA moving
around," he said, "this is exciting stuff!"

<HEADLINE> Large Quantity of Hashish Seized in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athens, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Police on the Greek island of
Corfu have arrested an Albanian man in possession of 16.5 kilos of
top quality hashish.
</P>
<P>
Aleko Prifti, 22, from Avlona, Albania was arrested after Corfu
police received a tip off. The hashish was found in two travel
bags he was carrying.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the hashish, wrapped airtight in 10
balls, is of Albanian origin. They believe Prifti is responsible
for smuggling large quantities of the narcotic into northwest
Greece for eventual sale in Great Athens Area.
</P>
<P>
Prifti was arrested the moment he was about to board a coach
for Athens. He was due to appear later today before a public
prosecutor on Corfu when he is expected to be formally charged
with possession and trafficking of narcotics.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Predicts Conclusion of Hebron Pact Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat said today that he expects an agreement on partial
Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank city of Hebron to be
signed soon, reported the state-run Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the remarks in a meeting with a "Peace Now"
delegation from Israel in Gaza this morning. He briefed the
Israeli peace activists on the latest developments of the
deadlocked peace talks on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
A "real crisis," as Palestinian officials put it, has emerged
from Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's plan to postpone
further Israeli pullback from the West Bank from September 1997 to
spring 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat told his "Peace Now" guests that he still
regards Netanyahu as his peace partner, but he also accused the
Israeli government of what he called trying to make his life
miserable.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah said that the
Palestinians are demanding that further Israeli withdrawal from
the occupied West Bank be completed by next September as defined in
the Oslo 2 accord signed in Washington on September 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians will ask the international
sponsors of the peace process to put pressure on Israel to
implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross is
still busy trying to narrow the differences between the Israelis
and Palestinians. He is expected to have a meeting with
Netanyahu this evening, but no summit is scheduled between
Netanyahu and Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration appears to be satisfied with
Ross's achievements so far. U.S. Secretary of State-designate
Madeleine Albright pledged Wednesday that the peace process would
remain a top priority when she assumes office.
</P>
<P>
In her confirmation hearing before the U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Albright said the Middle East would continue
as an area of the "highest importance to the president and to
me."
</P>
<P>
In what is widely regarded as her first official foreign
policy statement since appointment, Albright emphasized that the
Hebron talks are now at a "very delicate" stage. She called
Ross's attempt to broker the Hebron deal a "brilliant job."
</P>
<P>
A Hebron agreement would be a "critical step in consolidating
the gains" made in the peace process to date, and would "lay the
basis for future progress" in final-status talks, Albright
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Up to 6-year High in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Wholesale prices in U.S. shot
up by 0.5 percent in December, helping push the rate for 1996 to
2.8 percent, the highest level in six years, the U.S. Labor
Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Department said that the 2.8 percent increase in its
Producer Price Index (PPI) last year was the biggest since a 5.7
percent advance in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The 0.5 percent increase of PPI in last December was also the
largest since a 0.6 percent gain in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. PPI increase last year topped the 2.2 percent
rate of 1995, U.S. analysts contend that it does not portend a
major price acceleration since much of last year's advance was due
to volatile food and energy prices.
</P>
<P>
The report said that energy costs jumped by 12 percent in 1996
and food prices rose by 3.4 percent. But when food and energy are
excluded, the so-called core index rose just 0.6 percent compared
with a 2.6 percent advance in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said there was little sign of inflation in the U.S.
economy which had slowed in the second half of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 0.5 percent PPI increase in December was
up from 0.4 percent in both October and November. But excluding
food and energy, the core increase was up just 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The gain mainly resulted from energy prices which soared by 3.1
percent, up from 2.3 percent in November and the largest gain
since a 3.8 percent advance in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
But food prices dropped 0.1 percent for a second straight month
in December as the cost of vegetable plunged by 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cost of raw materials in the month was up 4.2 percent and
prices for intermediate goods up 0.4 percent, both reflected
sharply higher energy prices.
</P>
<P>
There also has been little evidence of price pressures from
labor costs, which typically represent two-thirds of a product's
price, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Gold Production Falls Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's gold production last
year fell from 24 tons in 1995 to 23.7 tons valued at nearly 300
million U.S. Dollars, the Chamber of Mines said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the Chamber of Mines Derek Bain said the
decline in production, which had been expected to reach 25 tons
for the first time in five decades, also coincided with a
dramatic fall in prices which had reached an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
Bain said, ''normally if the price drops, mines produce more
to cover the loss of revenue but they are actually producing
less. The depreciation of the Zimbabwe Dollar has, however,
helped in terms of increasing revenue.''
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is Africa's third largest gold producer after Ghana
and South Africa, and is ranked number 17 in the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bain said gold and base mineral exports are
estimated to have earned about 730 million U.S. Dollars in 1996,
slightly up from 680 million US Dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in export earnings was mainly due to high prices
and not necessarily higher output, particularly of base minerals,
he said.

LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 public school
teachers and educational workers began boycotting classes to
press demands for payment of salary arrears and instructional
materials, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
They would continue the strike until they were paid for 1996,
said the report, quoting a statement of the National Teachers
Association of Liberia and the Liberia National Educational
Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
Lack of funds has caused the nonpayment of arrears owed the
public school teachers and other civil servants for the past nine
months, the Finance Ministry of Liberia said.
</P>
<P>
The teachers also demanded explanation from the government
over the mysterious disappearance of one of their colleagues,
Charles Davis, a member of the Liberia Peace Council Militia and
Special Assistant to Education Minister Moses Bah.
</P>
<P>
He disappeared last month, reportedly to be picked up by rival
militiamen believed as fighters of the National Patriotic Front

<HEADLINE> New Violence Takes Place in Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phnom Penh, January 9 (Xinhua) -- New violence erupted here
today when police confronted workers of the Tack Fat Garment
company who were staging a strike again under the leadership of
Sam Rainsy, president of the opposition Khmer Nation Party (KNP).
</P>
<P>
Police confronted striking workers and Sam Rainsy's men in
front of the Tack Fat factory, which had been slowed by workers
strikes. The strikes began on Saturday when workers crashed
police barricades and marched towards the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
A police officer confirmed that "eight of nine bodyguards of
Sam Rainsy were seriously beaten by policemen in plain clothes
this morning, and that the KNP's secretary-general Khieu Rada
escaped by motorcycle-taxi with blood on face."
</P>
<P>
The officer, who spoke anonymously, also said the policemen had
been deployed since 2 a.m. local time today and "Sam Rainsy's
group began to arrive at 6:55 a.m., and provoked disorder at the
factory."
</P>
<P>
A press release by the KNP said Khieu Rada was seriously
beaten by police officers and was bleeding.
</P>
<P>
"Five of Sam Rainsy's bodyguards were severely beaten, and one
of them was taken to an isolated place by the riverside and
threatened with execution, but released at the last minute," the
release said.
</P>
<P>
"More than 50 gunshots were fired and workers were forced by
the police to move into the factory and to resume work," it added.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy's, wife Tiulong Samura, said this evening that her
husband was not beaten in the incident which she described as
"very cruel."
</P>
<P>
Tiulong Samura said the bodyguards did not react because there
were some 50 policemen and only 10 to 15 bodyguards for Sam Rainsy
and Khieu Rada.
</P>
<P>
"Khieu Rada was kicked and escaped into a neighboring house,"
she said. "About 100 shots were heard as Sam Rainsy got into his
car for safety."
</P>
<P>
But Secretary of State for Interior Ministry Em Sam An
dismissed the press release from the KNP, saying: "Only four to
five shots were fired into the air to keep order by the police."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Khieu Rada's bleeding, Em Sam An said it was not
caused by beating but by running into each other during the riot.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, who is claimed to be the advisor of the
newly-formed Free Trade Union of Workers, was the mastermind of
the union and driving force behind the recent labor movement in
Phnom Penh.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy Poised for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's investment promotion
agency today said all indicators showed the southern African
country is poised for its highest ever growth rates in over four
decades.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary, the Zimbabwe Investment Center (ZIC) said the
country is "inexorably" on the way to becoming a modern economy,
with strong characteristics of an emerging market.
</P>
<P>
The center listed the drastic fall in inflation and interest
rates, the strong balance-of-payments position and a surge in
direct foreign investment as some of the factors in Zimbabwe's
favor.
</P>
<P>
"For over four decades, never has a consensus existed as it
does now on the status of the Zimbabwean economy and its future,"
the ZIC said, adding that "economic analysts, both local and
foreign, are in agreement that never in a long time has the
Zimbabwean economy been better poised for growth."
</P>
<P>
It said interest rates, once pegged at over 45 percent three
years ago, had eased to below 30 percent, while inflation fell to
an annualized figure of 13.9 percent last November.
</P>
<P>
The key tobacco crop continues to do well, while the booming
stock exchange is enjoying its best ever trading period, in sharp
contrast to the gloom experienced in 1992/93 when Zimbabwe was
suffering from a crippling drought-induced recession.
</P>
<P>
"GDP growth of nearly six percent is projected for calendar
year 1997. This would give an average growth rate of some 6.5
percent over the next two years, a very satisfactory performance
by regional, or any, standards," the ZIC said.
</P>
<P>
However, the ZIC said on the downside, monetary policy would
remain tight until inflation fell to sustainable levels.
</P>
<P>
"This means that in the foreseeable future, real interest
rates of five percent or higher appear likely to be maintained.
Fortunately, there does not appear to be any compelling reason
for the monetary authorities to push nominal rates up further
again," the ZIC said.
</P>
<P>
"Faster economic growth over the next two years, combined with
all of the deficit reduction measures, should result in a
substantial fall in the deficit to GDP ratio from the financial
year 1996/97 onwards," it said.
</P>
<P>
The ZIC warned that the government has to continue reducing
spending and cut the budget deficit to below three percent,
compared to the current 10.1 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African cultural
authorities today expressed deep concern over the fate of the
National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) after its custodian decided to
discontinue money support.
</P>
<P>
Brigitte Mabandla, Deputy Minister of Arts, Culture, Science
and Technology, issued a statement today, calling on the South
African Broadcast Corporation (SABC), primary money supplier of
the NSO, to overcome financial difficulties to go on supporting
the state musical team.
</P>
<P>
The SABC announced earlier that it would stop its annual
15-million-Rand (3.4 million U.S. Dollars) support to the NSO as
of April 1.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made to meet challenges brought about by the
emerging broadcast environment in the country and the need to
deliver fully fledged public broadcasting to the entire South
African nation, SABC spokeswoman Marj Murray said.
</P>
<P>
The corporation is faced with prospects of revenue decline as
a result of the licensing of new broadcasters, Murray said,
adding that its expenditure is increasing due to broadcasting in
11 official languages, the upgrading of the African-language
radio stations and an increase in educational programs.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman also said the SABC sincerely hoped sponsors
would be found to keep the NSO going, and urged business
organizations, the government and individuals to help find a
solution.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Plunge Amid Worries Over Japanese Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Worries about Japan's sluggish
economy slumped Tokyo share prices today, with the key Nikkei
average sliding by three percent to its lowest level in over a
year.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei 225 share index, the market's main barometer, ended
at 18,073.87, down 606.51 points or 3.25 percent from Wednesday's
close.
</P>
<P>
The index has fallen some 1,300 points since trading opened for
the year on Monday. Today's close was its lowest since 17,939.52
on November 16, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Traders say market losses were sparked by disappointment over
the lack of fresh growth-spurring measures in the proposed 1997
government budget released last month.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said a weak market could continue to the end of March
unless the government reconsidered its spending plan for fiscal
1997, which began in April.
</P>
<P>
The government forecasts economic growth of 1.9 percent for
fiscal 1997, but some analysts have estimated the figure at below
one percent.
</P>
<P>
In today's session, fierce selling by foreign investors,
notably of banking issues, accelerated the Nikkei's fall in late
trading, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's major banks are still trying to write off their bad
loans left over from the economic boom of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The sell-off has also been prompted in part by the fall in the
Japanese yen against the dollar. The dollar was changing hands at
116.32-34 yen at 5 p.m., up substantially from 115.76-79 yen at 9
a.m.. It was traded between 115.70 yen and 116.43 yen until 5
p.m..
</P>
<P>
The dollar moved higher following unconfirmed reports that
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had reiterated that a strong
dollar is in the best interests of the United States.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Hold Local Council Polls in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's local government
elections on party basis are once again fixed on March 15, the
National Electoral Commission of Nigeria (NECOM) announced today.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the compilation of the final voters's register
will be conducted between February 26 and March 7, said NECOM
Chairman Chief Sumner Dagogo-Jack, quoted by a radio report.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian military government's transition to
civil rule program, the local government councils elections were
scheduled for the fourth quarter of last year, but were postponed
following the delayed announcement of the newly-created local
areas in the country in October last year.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference today in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, the
chairman said the ward congresses of the five political parties
to nominate councillorship candidates and select delegates to
local government party congresses will be held on February 24.
</P>
<P>
And the local government party congresses to nominate
chairmanship candidates for local government councils is set on
February 26.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the inauguration of elected councils will
take place on March 24.
</P>
<P>
Late last December, the NECOM tentatively fixed December 17 as
the date for the elections of local government councils on party
basis. But it was put off because of the fear that the result
would not be as good as expected with the approaching of
Christmas and the New Year.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Interior Minister Appointed New Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's Interior Minister
Nikolai Dobrev was approved today as the country's new prime
minister by the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP).
</P>
<P>
Dobrev told reporters that he would be ready to discuss with
all political forces the problems of the economy and social order.
</P>
<P>
The new cabinet due to be formed on Friday will work out its
program in this week and carry out radical financial and business
reforms to boost the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's former prime minister Zhan Videnov resigned at a
party congress last month. He was criticized by his own party as
well as other parties for his failure to deal with the country's
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Dobrev, a geology physics engineer, became interior minister
last May after his predecessor Lyubomir Nanchev was dismissed for
failing to deal with escalating crime in the country.
</P>
<P>
He has also been BSP organizational secretary dealing g with
human resources issues and has chaired parliament's national
security committee.
</P>
<P>
According to Bulgaria's constitution, after a new prime
minister was approved by the parliament, he will be given a

<HEADLINE> Syria, Iran Trying to Resume Meeting on Kurds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Syria and Iran will discuss
next Sunday how to revive a tripartite meeting, which also
involves Turkey, on security of northern Iraq, well-informed
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Iranian High Coordination Committee will meet in
Tehran and discuss proposed Iranian mediation in the cool
Syria-Turkey relations before the tripartite meeting could be
resumed.
</P>
<P>
The three countries used to hold a regular foreign ministerial
meeting every six months on their relationships. But it was
suspended nearly a year ago as the Syria-Turkey ties went soured
due to disputes over the share of the Euphrates river water and
the alleged Syrian support of Kurd rebels in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has made an initiative
attempting to improve the Syria-Turkey relations and both
countries have welcomed the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the three countries share the same
stand to support a defined and secured Kurdish area in northern
Iraq, with the fear that an independent Kurdistan pursued by rebel
Kurds would affect each of the three countries' sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The coming meeting to be co-chaired by Syrian Vice-President
Abdul Halim Khaddam and his Iranian counterpart Hassan Habibi and
attended by the foreign ministers will also serve to strengthen
the Syria-Iran ties, the well-informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting opens amid criticism by Iranian newspapers of
Damascus' bias in favor of the United Arab Emirates in its dispute
with Iran over the Gulf islands of Greater, Lesser Tunbs and Abu
Moussa, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Syria plays a major role in improving Iranian-Arab relations.
</P>
<P>
The committee meeting is also expected to touch the stalled
Middle East peace process, developments in the region and the
Syrian policy on the Mideast crisis, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Calls for Efforts for Economic Reform in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The international High
Representative in Bosnia Carl Bildt today said the economic reform
in Bosnia is of fundamental importance for the war-torn country's
long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
"It is the efforts at economic reform (in Bosnia) now that will
decide the economic and social, and thus also political
development of the country then," he said at the opening of a
two-day meeting preparing for a donors' conference for Bosnia, set
for early March.
</P>
<P>
Bildt, in charge of the civil aspect of the Bosnian Peace
Accord, said that 1997 must be the year of transition from
reconstruction to economic reform in terms of emphasis.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out a number of decisions which must be taken
"urgently" by the Bosnian government, including a state budget
for 1997, a central bank law, arrangement for common tariffs and
trade arrangements, saying that this would pave the way for an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the Republika Srpska, member of a Bosnian
delegation to the preparatory meeting, demanded at a press
conference that the Bosnian Federation and the Republika Srpska
should be treated evenhandedly under the reconstruction programs.
</P>
<P>
Bildt has acknowledged that in 1996, only 2 percent of
reconstruction resources were spent in Republika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
After promising 1.2 billion U.S. dollars at the 1996 donors
conference, of which 720 million dollars have actually been paid,
donors are expected to commit to 1.4 billion dollars for 1997,
according to the World Bank's official for Bosnia, Christine
Wallich.

<HEADLINE> Lusaka's Environment Disastrous: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- An Expert has described the
environment of Zambia's capital Lusaka as disastrous because its
poor waste disposal has contaminated drinking water and posed
risks to public health.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Nkhuwa, a specialist in environmental studies, said the
city is always under constant threats of outbreak of cholera,
dysentery and other killer diseases because most bore holes
siphon contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted the lecturer of the University
BAH424SPE053S09PEQL01:2101:212495
of Zambia as saying in southern Zambia that all the high density
residential townships use pit latrines while most of the low
density areas use septic tanks to dispose of sewerage.
</P>
<P>
''But in both cases, the liquid component of the sewerage is
sipped into the soil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The local paper quoted him as saying that worse still, in
order to avoid the rapid filling up of pit latrines and clogging
of septic tanks, the facilities are dug much deeper, resulting in
dirty water to percolate directly to the water table.
</P>
<P>
He also said most of the processing plants which were
initially on the central sewer systems have been disconnected
because of discharging untreated effluent.
</P>
<P>
Nkhuwa noted that the current water quality monitoring
programs are inadequate and irregular leading to intestinal
disorders such as cholera and hepatitis.

<HEADLINE> Four Greeks Charged for Vessel Sinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athens, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A local public prosecutor in
Peloponnesos today charged four Greeks with murder, for allegedly
causing the deaths of 283 illegal immigrants by sinking the vessel
which was carrying them off the coast of Sicily last month.
</P>
<P>
After hearing testimony from illegal immigrants currently held
in Greece, Nafplion prosecutor Yannis Provataris charged Greek
sailors Eftihios Zervoudakis, Michalis Fanourakis, Antonis
Sfakianakis and Dionysis Avgerinos with murder and contravention
of the law on illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Charges have also been brought against seven foreigners
implicated in the case, who are being sought by police.
</P>
<P>
According to the testimony of the illegal immigrants, 283
people drowned when the boat in which they were being transported
was rammed by the freighter "Yioham" on December 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Italian authorities said earlier however that they had been
searching the area and found no signs of a sinking.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 illegal immigrants from India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka
were arrested recently in Ermioni on Peloponese coast.

OTTAWA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Olympic 100m champion Donovan
Bailey critcized the American media again on Wednesday for the
"disrespecting to him and his relay teammates' victory in last
year's Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
U.S. weekly magazine Sports Illustrated said in its last issue
that the Canadian Olympic 100-meter champion is "whining" over
being ignored in favor of American Michael Johnson.
</P>
<P>
A photo of the double-gold medallist, named Canadian male
athlete of the year in balloting conducted by The Canadian Press,
appeared above the caption: "Thin-skinned Olympic champion Bailey
should let his legs run, not his mouth."

<P>
Bailey said it was part of the "line of disrespect" the
Canadian sprinters, who beat the United States in the 400 meter
relay, have been getting since the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"I guess it's the ignorance of Americans not understanding that
people are better than them. It's starting to become funny,"
Bailey told the Toronto Star on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I'm the only human - and that includes Ben Johnson's drugged
9.79 (seconds at the 1988 Seoul Olympics) - to run 27.06 mph (43.5
kph). No one in history has done that. I'm not looking for the

<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- British car makers accelerated
sales overseas last year, while new car registrations at home
breaking through two million barriers for the first time since
1990.
</P>
<P>
Rover, the biggest car exporter in Britain, said that total
sales in 1996 broke through the half-million mark for the first
time in eight years. Meanwhile Rolls-Royce, one of the most famous
car manufacturers in the world, announced a 12 percent jump in
sale.
</P>
<P>

world-wide sales last year reached 506,000 -- the highest since
1988.
</P>
<P>
The company said that for the first time in its history exports
had out-stripped home demand with 53 percent of sales going
overseas.
</P>
<P>
Tom Purves, sales and marketing director, said that the
world-wide increase had been driven by the success of the new
Rover 200 and 400 series, particularly in European markets, and
strong demand for the Ranger Rover and Discovery, both of which
set sales records.
</P>
<P>
Sales in the US were 15 percent ahead of 1995 while demand was
up 50 percent in Germany and 10 percent across the Continent as a
whole.
</P>
<P>

1,556 in 1995 to 1,744 last year. The biggest increase was in the
UK where sales rose 29 percent to 638. Demand was 10 percent
higher from the Americas and 7 percent up in Japan.
</P>
<P>

the introduction of the Rolls-Royce Silver Dawn and the revamped
turbo-charged Bentley Brook-lands.
</P>
<P>
However, Ford's (UK) performances in 1996 was depressing, it
was reported the company is prepared to take imminent action to

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General Kofi
Annan today stressed healing the financial crisis, relations
between the secretariat and the member states and the morale of
the secretariat as well as a real reform of the Organization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the UN staff around the world, Annan said that the
next five years must, above all, a time of healing.
</P>
<P>
"We must heal the financial crisis of the Organization, which
cannot be expected to move forward if it is dragged down by the
burden of unpaid dues," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the bottom the financial crisis is a political crisis -- a
crisis of faith in the Organization. Therefore, the UN staff
should prove to the member states that their contributions are
used widely and efficiently for the implementation of programs
which they have mandated.
</P>
<P>
On improving relations between the secretariat and the member
states, he noted though much of the criticism of the secretariat
has been arbitrary and unfair, "we must remain open to honest and
constructive criticism. We also know that we can do more to
restore the confidence of the international community in us."
</P>
<P>
When dealing with the morale of the secretariat, he said, "we
must, however, carry on, secure in our ideals, moved by the
strength of our convictions" in the difficult and challenging
times.
</P>
<P>
On reform of the United Nations, he said that reform is not an
end itself. It must not be seen simply in terms of dollars and
cents either. It is a tool to create a more relevant and a more
effective organization.
</P>
<P>
"I have never believed that disjointed downsizing, with
arbitrary staff cuts that weaken essential capabilities, can bring
real improvement," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
It is not reform, when for lack of funds, the UN has to turn
its back on massacres and suffering and the collapse of civil
society. "Real reform will enable us to put in place new
mechanisms for confronting the world's political and economic
crises promptly, courageously and efficiently," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Real reform requires an ongoing search for excellence -- in our
structures, in our procedures, in our methods, and above all, in
the performance of our staff," he said.

<HEADLINE> Faction Leader Urges Ethiopia to Pull Out of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 9 (xinhua)-- Somali faction leader Hussein
Mohamed Aidid has requested the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) to intervene and stop Ethiopia from occupying
part of Somalia's territory.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to the foreign ministers of IGAD member
states available here today, Aidid's self-styled government said
the claim by Ethiopia that it is fighting against Islamic
extremists in Somalia is fallacy and has no evidence at all.
</P>
<P>
It is "serious aggression" against the sovereignty and the
territorial integrity of Somalia, the letter charged.
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that the IGAD's failure to end this
intrusion will set an undesirable precedent and can have negative
effect upon the stability of the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the government of Hussein Aidid has sent
a note and verbal protest to the government of Ethiopia,
demanding an immediate withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement complained that Ethiopia has up to now
over three weeks failed to end "its invasion" or heed the
legitimate protest demanding the withdrawal of their forces from
Somalia's soil.
</P>
<P>
The statement charged that Ethiopia now occupies 30 square
kilometers of Somalia's territory, adding that Ethiopian forces
"burned Somali houses and killed civilians."
</P>
<P>
The strong statement by Hussein Aidid followed an underground
meeting between top officials from the government of Hussein
Aidid and senior members from Al-Itihad Al-Islam in South
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to confidential sources, the two sides agreed on
military cooperation in ending the occupation of Ethiopia in the
border town of Dolow.
</P>
<P>
Al-Itihad and Hussein Aidid earlier issued statements
separately, condemning the Ethiopia-sponsored conference for 26
Somali factions which ended in Sodare last week.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Says Mitterrand Encourages Him to Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said today that former President Francois Mitterrand did not send
a personal envoy to him to ask him declare his candidature for the
1995 presidential election, but his predecessor once encouraged
him to do so.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Chirac to comment on a story told by
journalist Georges-Marc Benamou in his new book, "Le Dernier
Mitterrand (the Last Days of Mitterrand)," in which the author
said that Mitterrand sent a personal envoy on November 1, 1994, to
Chirac, asking the latter to rapidly announce his candidature for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Agence France Presse (AFP) quoted Chirac as saying that
there was "no envoy of any kind" from Mitterrand, but the former
president said to him during a ceremony of the 50th anniversary of
the liberation of Paris from Nazi occupation on August 25, 1994:
"I think you should present yourself."
</P>
<P>
But Chirac added that Mitterrand was a kind of man who "did
not open up easily," so what he was thinking about was
"difficult to decipher."
</P>
<P>
Several former ministers of the socialist government under
Mitterrand, including Jack Lang and Roland Dumas, have expressed
scepticism over the story told by Benamou, who was personally
acquainted with the former president.

down Wednesday to overpower American Alex O'Brien 1-6, 7-6 (7-3),
6-4 and reached the semifinals of the Sydney International tennis
tournament.

The 22-year-old Briton now faces Croatian Goran Ivanisevic in

<P>
Henman had never reached the final of any ATP event before last
week's Qatar Open, but is now just one match away from reaching
his second in a fortnight after winning his quarterfinal on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The men's other semifinal will be an all-Spanish affair between
Carlos Moya and Albert Costa.
</P>
<P>
Costa, the tournament third seed, defeated Zimbabwe's Byron
Black 6-4, 6-2 and has still to drop a set in the tournament,
while Moya beat Australia's Patrick Rafter 7-6 (8-6), 6-3.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Complains Over Sudanese Diplomat's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia today complained
over the provocative statement of Sudan's Charge D'affairs in
Mogadishu which urges the Somalis to take up arms and fight
Ethiopia in a Jihad (holy war).
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported this evening that Daniel
Yifru, acting Director General of African Affairs in Ethiopia's
Foreign Ministry today sent an official letter of protest to the
Sudanese Charge D'affairs.
</P>
<P>
The letter said, ''Ethiopia would like to request the
government of Sudan to take an urgent action to disassociate
itself from the provocative statement made by its diplomat in
Mogadishu.''
</P>
<P>
It further said the Ethiopian government views the statement
of Sudan's diplomat in Mogadishu as a hostile act directed
against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, Sudan's Charge
D'affairs in Mogadishu Ali Hassan Ali made the statement, which
was carried by the Mogadishu Times newspaper, during a meeting at
his house on December 29, with supporters of the Al-Ithad
Al-Islam group.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat urged Somalis to fight Ethiopia in a Jihad to
counter the recent operation by the Ethiopian armed forces
against the extremist religious group.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government official also announced that
beginning from Wednesday the movement of Sudan's diplomats in
Ethiopia is restricted to only the capital, saying that the
measure is taken in response to the provocative statement of the
diplomat in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Somalia also accused Ethiopian troops of crossing into Somali
territory 30 kilometers in pursuit of Islamic extremists and
occupying a border town.
</P>
<P>
''It is saddening to hear such a provocative statement from a
diplomat of a neighboring country at a time when the regional
countries, under the umbrella of Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD), are trying to jointly address issues of
conflict in Somalia and Sudan,'' the official added.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Government Urges Speedy Return to World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government's top
priority in 1997 is the country's return to international
political, economic, financial and trade organizations and the
consistent implementation of the country's economic policy.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet session chaired by Prime Minister Radoje Kontic
which focused on the new year's activity program, the government
gave priority also to bringing into accord the country's laws with
its constitution and to adopting regulations necessary for putting
into effect the federal laws that had already been passed, a
government statement issued after the session said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Yugoslavia had resumed diplomatic relations with most
countries in the world, which were suspended due to the
disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in 1991. But it has not
yet joined the United Nations nor many key international financial
organizations, such as International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
and the World Trade Organization. To join these institutions is
vitally important for Yugoslavia to revive its economy which was
wrecked by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
At the session, an act on technical regulations was passed,
which defined the way on drafting and adopting regulations in line
with the standards of World Trade Organization member-states.
</P>
<P>
"This is important for the Yugoslav economy to become part of
world economic trends because, instead of running against
administrative or customs barriers, the country is faced at this
point with obstacles of technical or technological nature," the
statement released by Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The government also determined a bill on ratifying an agreement
reached with neighboring Croatia last year on abolishing visas to
those who hold diplomatic or service passports.
</P>
<P>
The agreement envisages that Yugoslav and Croatian citizens who
hold diplomatic or service passports be allowed to enter, leave,
transit or stay in the other country up to 30 days without a visa.
</P>
<P>
The government also decided to set up a commission for
cooperation with the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal
for the Former Yugoslavia with a view to monitoring the
implementation of the Bosnia peace deal, especially as regards
Yugoslavia's commitments assumed under the deal, and an agreement
with the United Nations on opening a liaison office in Belgrade of
the Hague-based tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The commission will monitor the implementation of these
agreements, coordinate activity of federal and other relevant
bodies in charge of the implementation, review issues considered
to be vital for cooperation with the tribunal and inform relevant
Yugoslav bodies about it, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Intensify Activities to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to complicate the
deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, Jewish settlers held
several demonstrations and began the construction of a new
building in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Hebron settlers today began clearing rubbles and pouring
foundations of a new residential building in the Avraham Avinu
quarter. They claimed that the land belonged to a Jewish resident
who lived there before the Arab riots in 1929.
</P>
<P>
Settler spokesman David Wilder said Wednesday that the
construction of the building, which will house 10 apartments,
would show the settlers' determination to live in the city.
</P>
<P>
Wilder insisted that he had the government license to build
the new construction, a claim that was denied by a spokesman for
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai who is in charge of issuing
building permits.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hebron settlers blocked a main road near the Beit
Hadassah Jewish neighborhood. They said they did it to show the
government how easily the Palestinian residents would block
rescue vehicles from entering the Jewish quarter following the
Israeli troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Near the Beit El settlement north of Ramallah, where a Jewish
settler mother and her son were killed by Palestinian gunmen
last month, over 1,000 settlers held demonstrations to demand
building of a new settlement near the site of murder. Last week,
the settlers set up several mobile homes in the site, but were
late evicted by the police.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a Jewish religious seminar moved into
a house in the Christian quarter of the Old City in eastern
Jerusalem. The students said that the house was recently given
to them by a Jew living abroad who purchased the building.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, settlers living in the Bekaot and Roi
settlements in the Jordan Valley confronted a group of
Palestinians in a dispute over the ownership of a piece of
land. The Israeli police intervened in the dispute to avert
possible violent clashes.
</P>
<P>
The recent settlement activities were part of a campaign
launched last week by the Council of Settlers in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip which was aimed at drawing attention to the
so-called illegal building activities by the Palestinians in the
Israeli-controlled areas.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Broker-Test Scam Exposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street's biggest ever scam
in a broker test is now under close investigation by the Manhattan
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal reported today that the office
announced indictment and arrests of 53 stockbrokers for cheating
on broker-licensing examinations. The move was the first time that
prosecutors have alleged widespread criminal fraud in brokerage
test taking, the paper said. Prosecutors are considering an
organized ring in the fraud.
</P>
<P>
The alleged ringers -- Igor Shekhtman and Robert Idzi, two
former brokers, -- took at least 28 and 22 tests, respectively,
for more than a dozen brokers, prosecutors alleged.
</P>
<P>
"The impostors were paid between 2,000 and 5,000 U.S. dollars
or were promised future legitimate business and shares of
commissions in addition to having their expenses paid," said
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The middle-men typically received a portion of the payments,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The alleged impostors traveled to various test centers
apparently to avoid detection, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The case, which covered a 2 year and a half investigation, was
triggered by an anonymous tip received by the National Association
of Securities Dealers (NASD), which administers the tests through
56 centers nation-wide. The NASD already has banned 26 brokers
from the securities business for allegedly paying people to
impersonate them to take the tests.
</P>
<P>
According to the operational rules on Wall Street, brokers must
pass a licensing test before selling securities to investors. The
NASD administered more than 200,000 such tests last year alone.

AMMAN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Upper House of Parliament of
Jordan today approved the 1997 draft budget with 19 votes out of
25, Jordan Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Following a debate, the senate approved the 1.91 billion
Jordanian dinars (about 2.69 billion U.S. dollars) budget at a
session attended by Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti.
</P>
<P>
The Lower House of Parliament last week approved the draft
budget by a vote of 53 to 15.

<P>
The draft budget has been referred to King Hussein for
ratification.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget projects a total revenue of 1.86 billion dinars
(2.63 billion dollars), with local revenue estimated at 1.69
billion dinars (2.38 billion dollars) or an 8.2 percent increase
over 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deficit, estimated at 3.9 percent of the gross domestic
product, will be largely covered by foreign grants and assistance.
</P>
<P>
The budget reflects the last two years of reforms
implemented under the restructuring program agreed with the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).

<HEADLINE> Lebanese House Speaker Calls for Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri today called for the "most careful" investigation into a
Wednesday attack on northern Israel in which Katyusha rockets were
fired into the western Galilee from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite house speaker, who is also the head of the
pro-Syrian Amal movement, underlined that attack of this kind
could "cause a disturbance" which is not needed by the Lebanese
people.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Mohammed Baalbaki, chairman of the
Lebanese Press Syndicate, Berri categorically denied that the
Katyusha rockets were fired by Lebanese guerrillas operating in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel said that three rockets were fired into northern Israel
from south Lebanon Wednesday night, in a second Katyusha attack on
the same area in less than one month.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the end of their meeting, Baalbaki
quoted Berri as saying that "the Katyusha rockets which are
said being fired into Galilee were absolutely not launched by
the Lebanese resistance, neither by the Amal movement nor by
Hezbollah."
</P>
<P>
"A most careful investigation should be conducted in order
to find out who fired the Katyusha rockets and what their
motives were in doing this because the attack could cause
disturbance which is not needed by us," Berri noted.
</P>
<P>
The house speaker underlined his country's commitment to the
so-called "April understanding," a cease-fire agreement brokered by
 the United States and France between Lebanon and the Jewish
state, which barres launching of Katyusha rocket into northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated in south Lebanon following a series of
exchanging fire between Israeli forces and Lebanese Muslim
guerillas Wednesday on the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army confirmed that one Israeli soldier was killed
and eight others were wounded in two separate clashes in the
Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Shiite Amal movement also announced that its three
fighters were killed in a fighting with an Israeli commandos
force near the village of Deir Siryan at Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, a five-nation committee monitoring
a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border is scheduled to
hold a meeting in the south Lebanese border town of Naqoura
Friday in order to discuss a complaint filed by Israel over
the Wednesday Katyusha attack.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that the Lebanese Foreign Ministry
received today a copy of the Israeli complaint, which was
conveyed by the committee's French chairman Jean-Michel Gaussot.
</P>
<P>
Katyusha constitutes the only serious threat for the Jewish
settlers in northern Israel after Israel established the
1,100-square-kilometer buffer zone along the border in south
Lebanon in 1985.

JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people were

<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the explosions.
</P>
<P>

labors.

in legislation to protect the fundamental rights of people living
with HIV and AIDS, said the press statement.
</P>
<P>
The escalaing AIDS epidemic has created an atmoshphere that
encourages intolerance and provokes discriminatory measures and
behaviour towards infected and affected people.
</P>
<P>
Their feeling of isolation leads to despair with a negative
effect on their health. This affects also their employment,
education, freedom of movement and access to care, social
security, insurance, property inheretance and privacy.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the press statement noted, an effective
response to slow the spread of the epidemic will be determined in
part by the consideration given to the ethical and legal issues
emanating from the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
The worksop is aimed to lay a foundation for an ethical and
legal environment that guarantees respect and the promotion of
fundamental human rights tha will allow infected and affected
people to overcome their condition, to live positively and to
remain responsible and fully participatory members of their
community.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Reaffirms Plan to Reform France's Justice System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today reaffirmed his plan to reform France's justice system, which
will be focused on the full separation of the public prosecutor's
office from the Ministry of Justice, and to strengthen the civil
right of presumption of innocence.
</P>
<P>
During a new year's goodwill meeting with the press, Chirac
said that a commission in charge of preparing for the reform of
the country's justice system will start working by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
During a television talk to the nation on December 12, 1996,
Chirac expressed his wish that the executive government, mainly
the Ministry of Justice, would no longer intervene with the work
of the public prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
He also regretted that in France, the fundamental right of
presumption of innocence of the citizens "are always jeered at."
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Jacques Toubon has suggested the holding of
a referendum in France over the role of justice in the French
society, the role of the magistrates, and the function of judicial
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Justice has always played a central role in
France's legal field, bringing the independence of the country's
justice system into question.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Live Longer in Large Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Canadians who live in large
urban centers can expect to live a year longer on average than
those in smaller cities and rural areas, according to a study by
Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
The study, to be released soon, shows that those living in
Canada's 25 metropolitan census areas have a longer life
expectancy than those in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The 25 census areas, each with a population of more than
100,000, include Toronto, Vancouver, Victoria, Edmonton, Calgary,
Montreal, Hamilton and St. John's.
</P>
<P>
The longer expectancy is mainly a result of easier access to
hospitals and other health services, the Globe and Mail newspaper
today quoted the data gathering agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Canadian women live an average life of 81.1 years
while men 75.1, the agency's figures show.
</P>
<P>
To set up its life expectancy projections, the agency uses
death rates per thousand people of each age and both genders in
Canada, adjusted to take into account mortality rates in other
industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
It also considers changes in health behavior that can be
expected to affect future mortality, such as trends to smoke less
and exercising more.

<HEADLINE> Number of Suicides Rises in French Prisons in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of suicides committed
by prisoners in French jails totaled 138 in 1996, a 29 percent
increase over 1995, said the International Observatory of Prisons
(IOP) today quoting official figures.
</P>
<P>
Describing the number as "record high" in France, the IOP said
that the suicide rate in French prisons is 11 times that among the
free population of the country.
</P>
<P>
The IOP expressed its regret that the French authorities failed
to take concrete measures to stop the rising suicide rate of
prisoners, as has been suggested by the group since 1995.
</P>
<P>
It said that some suicides could have been avoided, as numerous
studies have shown that prisoners are most likely to commit
suicide in the night, on Saturday, briefly after attending a
trial, and just before being released.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-eight percent of suicides took place within six months of
imprisonment, 20 percent within 12 months, and most of them
committed by young prisoners, said the group.
</P>
<P>
Woman prisoners are more likely to commit suicide than men,
while the number of suicides committed by detainees in police
custodies is 3.3 times that of condemned prisoners.

If powerful measures are not be taken against the crimes,
foreign visitors will be afraid to tour the isles, causing the

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Imposes Strict Measures to Save Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has decided to impose
strict measures to save fresh water as the island's water reserves
are currently at the lowest level since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Agriculture, Natural Resources and Environment
Costas Petrides today called for urgent water supply cuts to deal
with the severe water shortage which followed a dry winter.
</P>
<P>
"If this situation continues, there will be no drop of water
left by 1998 in our reservoirs," the Minister told reporters,
noting strict measures are "the only solution."
</P>
<P>
Petrides classified the measures to ease water shortage in
three categories, namely the reduction of water supply, its
better saving and the increase of water reserves available.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, water supply to households will be
cut by 20 percent, which means water will be supplied only three
days a week, compared with 10 percent last year. Water for farming
purposes will be cut by up to 70 percent compared with 35 percent
the year before.
</P>
<P>
The measures also include higher fines against people who waste
water.
</P>
<P>
A study would be carried out for recycling of households water
for watering gardens. This can save up to 34 per cent of a
household's needs, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Petrides called on the public to make "painful saving" of
water and said his ministry will launch an intensive campaign to
increase public awareness of the problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister said water shortage will be solved "if we develop
an increased awareness on water saving."
</P>
<P>
This East Mediterranean island relies mainly on rainfall for
is water supply.
</P>
<P>
The first desalination plant is being constructed on the island
and will be operational in April.
</P>
<P>
The government approved Wednesday a plan for setting up a
second desalination plant near the southern town of Larnaca,
which will be completed by 1998.
</P>
<P>
A further two similar plants are also envisaged for Limassol and
Paphos areas.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed here that water shortage would be eased
to a great extent once these plants become fully operational.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, Paris Surges Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with London and Frankfurt still finishing in
the negative ground in spite of Wall Street's revival, and Paris
being the only market that closed higher.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London staged a late recovery on the back of
a resumption of the Dow's rally, with the FTSE 100 index wiping
out the day's early losses in the final two hours of trading after
the Dow rose on receipt of reassuring producer prices figures.
</P>
<P>
The market ended at the day's highest levels, 0.5 points down
at 4,087, as interest rates hike worries still dominated the
market sentiment throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, share prices also closed lower in response to
losses overnight in New York, with the DAX-30 index 13.71 points
down at 2,892.63.
</P>
<P>
Traders said that hopes for lower German interest rates,
reinforced by a big increase in jobless figures for December,
tempered losses.
</P>
<P>
Among the three major European markets, Paris is the only one
which ended higher, with the CAC-40 index 17.46 points up at
2,349.08, revived by strength in the US stock and debt markets.
</P>

London's FTSE 100 leading British shares index ended 0.5 points

CAIRO, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan's jewellers consider their market to be in a
state of recession due to low demand and some of them even go as
far as saying that it is the begining of the downfall for the
jewellery industry in Jordan, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The jewellers attribute the recession to people who are
showing little interest in buying jewellery, to expatriates who
are reluctant to purchase gold and to the large number of
businessmen who entered the jewellery industry in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Samir Qweik, a jeweller at downtown Amman, said gold prices
have remained stable for about four years.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that although locally-made gold carries lower
labor cost and a low profit margin, the demand for it has
plummeted by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is considering to
introduce corporate taxes by the year of 2000 as part of its
plans to rationalize the state's finances, according to Kuwaiti
financial sources.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Planning Minister Ali Al-Zumai while explaining a
financial program of action said Wednesday that the Kuwaiti
government is considering "taxes on profits of companies and
institutions."
</P>
<P>
He said the initiative would be among a series of measures
aimed at streamlining state finances to prevent the state budget
deficit from growing again in the future.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti budget deficit which hugely rose after the Gulf War
was forecast at more than 5 billion U.S. dollars for 1995-96
fiscal year, but the actual figure has been slashed to a little
more than 2 billion U.S. dollars due to higher oil prices
since last June.
</P>
<P>
At present, only foreign firms pay taxes in Kuwait, and the
Kuwaiti government recently said these taxes would be cut to 30
percent from the current 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian-Tunisian trade exchange volume reached
about 52.3 million U.S. dollars between January and November 1996,
the English-language newspaper The Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian exports to Tunisia reached about 28 million
U.S. dollars while the Egyptian imports hit nearly 25.3 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trade exchange between the two countries reached 57.3
million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The revenues of the Suez Canal in 1996 dropped by
4 percent as compared with 1995. The total revenues last year
amounted to 1.881 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A statement to this effect was made by Ahmed Ali Fadil,
Chairman of the Suez Canal Authority today at the Authority's
headquarters in Ismalia, some 110 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Fadil said that the drop in revenues was due to the
decrease of crude oil shipments through the Canal by 10 per cent
as compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Revenues of the Suez Canal are considered one of Egypt's four
principal sources of hard currency.

<HEADLINE> Half of UK Adults Illiterate: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 9 (Xinhu) -- Nearly half of the British
population lacks the basic skills to cope with modern life and
work, according to a national survey to be published by the Office
for National Statistics (ONS) in summer.
</P>
<P>
In an international study carried out by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), adults aged between
16 and 65 were given tests such as reading instructions on a
medicine bottle and using a bus timetable, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Half of the 3,800 British adults surveyed failed the bus
timetable test, which is considered by the OECD as the minimum
level for functioning effectively in a modern workplace.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the OECD survey did not put Britain at the
bottom of the league but showed huge room for improvement.
</P>
<P>
Previous studies of adults in England and Wales by the Basic
Skills Agency showed that one in six could not read, write or use
mathematics well enough to function at work and in daily life.
</P>
<P>
Education and Employment Secretary Gillian Shephard said that
raw data from the OECD survey should be treated with caution, and
she had already taken steps to improve basic skills, including
setting up literacy and numeracy centers.

<HEADLINE> 13 Injured in Tel Aviv Explosions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 people were
injured when two bombs went off in southern Tel Aviv this evening,
with official suspicion of a move by anti-Israeli Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
The first bomb was detonated at about 8:20 p.m. (18:20 GMT) in
a cabbage can near a cinema in the old Tel Aviv bus station.
</P>
<P>
After a large number of police arrived at the bombing site,
another bomb was set off in an apparent attempt to cause more
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who was immediately informed
of the incident, expressed deep concern about the situation. He
was then holding talks with U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross over the
deadlocked talks over Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
In the first official reaction to the attacks, Israeli
government spokesman Moshe Fogel strongly denounced the bombings,
saying the terrorists were wrong in thinking that they could gain
more concessions from Israel through the terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Police and hospital sources said at least 13 people were
injured, two of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bombs were pipe ones, which are less powerful
than the previous terrorist bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of policemen quickly sealed off the area to conduct
search for the attackers and tried to detect if there was other
explosives. However, no arrest has been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani arrived at the site
shortly after the incident. Speaking to Israel Television, he
suspected theses to be terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
Tel Aviv municipal officials said that it was lucky that the
explosions only happened at night, otherwise they could cause more
casualties at daytime because the slam areas were usually crowded
with people, most of them are foreign workers in Israel.
</P>
<P>
No one has yet claimed responsibility for the explosions, but
there is speculation that this could be carried out by the
anti-Israeli Islamic militant group Hamas which has been carrying
out terrorist attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has already vowed to launch revenge attacks in Israel to
mark the first anniversary of the death of its "engineer", or
bomb-maker, Yihye Ayash who was killed last January in Gaza when a
bloody-trapped mobile phone exploded. Hamas blamed Israeli agents for
the murder.
</P>
<P>
Today's bombing was the first since the four suicide bombings,
one in Tel Aviv, launched from late February last year by Hamas
and another anti-Israeli Islamic militant group and the Jihad. 62
people were killed in the wave of attacks.

NICOSIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government is ready
to discuss any issue concerning the Cyprus problem with
U.S. officials, Government Spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said
here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement following reports that Carey Cavanaugh,
southern European affairs director of the U.S. State Department,
will visit Cyprus early next week.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that he expected Cavanaugh's talks in
Cyprus would focus on the preparation of the forthcoming
U.S. initiative for a political settlement in the island state.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Cypriot government is ready to discuss any
matter, such as the military dialog and a proposed-ban of flights
of Greek and Turkish military planes in Cyprus' air space.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh was due to travel to the Hague, the Netherlands,
today, accompanying U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European
and Canadian Affairs John Kornblum, to meet European leaders.
</P>
<P>
After the Hague, Cavanaugh will fly on to Cyprus, Greece and
Turkey to discuss developments on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh's four-nation European tour follows strong reactions
from the United States, Britain, Turkey and other states to
Cyprus' decision to buy Russian-made surface-to-air S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has described the Cyprus' missile deal with Russia as
"a step down the wrong path" and believed the action will
"complicate efforts to achieve a lasting peace in Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened Cyprus with war in case the
anti-aircraft missiles are installed on this Eastern Mediterranean
strategic island.
</P>
<P>
But Cyprus has insisted that the missiles will boost its
defense capability and facilitate the peace process on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
seized the northern third of the island following a short-lived
coup seeking union with Greece.

<P>
PARIS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Dalil Boubakeur, rector of the
Mosque of Paris, today criticized French President Jacques Chirac
for refusing to invite him to a new year presidential good wish
meeting with religious leaders of France Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Islam, the second largest religion of France, has not been
invited to the presentation of good wish by the president of the
republic," said Boubakeur in a communique.
</P>
<P>
He said, "The Muslims of France feel this discrimination as a
new humiliation."
</P>
<P>
Chirac gave a presentation of good wish at the Elysee
presidential palace Tuesday with the Roman Catholic and Jewish
leaders of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The presidential office said today that Boubakeur was not
invited because he cannot represent himself as the unique leader
of Muslims in France.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Institute of the Great Mosque of Paris, which is led
by Boubakeur, said in October 1996 that it had been designated by
the French government as "representative of the Muslim worship at
official, religious and civil ceremonies organized by the
authorities of the Republic of France."
</P>
<P>
However, the Agence France Presse (AFP) said that the
representativeness of the organization has been greatly contested
by other Muslims in France.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that the Muslim community in France is
recently highly frustrated by a series of problems such as the
terrorist bombing of a Paris underground train in early December
and the on-going debate over immigration.
</P>
<P>
France has about 4 million Muslims, most of them Northern
African immigrants.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Unemployment Reaches Record High in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 192,171 people were
jobless in Switzerland by the end of 1996, head of the Federal
Office of Arts, Profession and Labor Jean-Luc Nordmann announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate of 4.7 percent in 1996 broke the record
of 4.2 percent in the previous year, Nordmann was quoted by local
press reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment fell a little from last February to June, said
Nordmann. But it began to rise from July. By the end of last
November, the unemployment rate once reached an unprecedented
record of 5.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nordmann said that he was not optimistic about the situation
this year. The number of people out of work would exceed 200,000
by the end of January, he said, adding that he expected no
decrease of the unemployment rate before 1998.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the assurances for the unemployed this year
would go up to 6.7 billion francs (about 5.15 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Nordmann also mentioned possibilities to overcome the
current economic recession, such as a flexible government monetary
policy that could release the pressure on the Swiss franc in the
financial market.

<HEADLINE> Misuse of Antibiotics Dangerous: Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The rampant misuse and
overprescription of antibiotics have resulted in increased
resistance to the drugs and in making people sicker, a group of
Canadian doctors warned.
</P>
<P>
Antibiotics are drugs that kill bacteria directly or halt their
multiplication. The miracle drugs of the 1930s, launched with the
introduction of penincillin, are now considered on many fronts to
be enemies.
</P>
<P>
"People are dying today because they're developing infections
that we don't have effective therapies for," said Dr. Gary Garber,
a researcher with the Canadian Infectious Disease Society.
</P>
<P>
Antibiotic resistance is a major public-health issue around the
world, added Dr. Ronald Grossman, chairman of the new awareness
campaign to set doctors and consumers straight about proper
antibiotics use.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed "superbugs," antibiotic-resistant bacteria are causing a
crisis in traditional medicine. And it takes researchers a decade
or more to get any new type of antibiotics in general use.
</P>
<P>
Resistance occurs when so-called bad bacteria grow or reproduce
because they were not fully destroyed -- such as when antibiotics
are not taken on time or to the end of a prescription -- or when
antibiotics, especially those unnecessarily given, kill the body's
good bacteria and allow harmful bacteria to multiply.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, antibiotics have been abused to the point that
infections once thought eradicated, such as tuberculosis and
meningitis, are resurging with greater force, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
"Canadians need more information about when antibiotics should
be prescribed, how to take their medicine properly and why
adhering to prescribed regimens is important," Dr. Grossman was
quoted by today's local newspaper reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
The doctors also asked parents to pay more attention to the
dangers involved with children, and never to stop a course of
antibiotics just because their child is feeling better.

<HEADLINE> US Warns Turkey Against Attacking Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton Administration
warned Turkey today not to attack Cyprus following reports from
Ankara that Turkey was considering a military strike on the
Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's state-run news agency said today that Ankara was
seriously considering a military strike if Cyprus went ahead with
plans to deploy Russian anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan also reportedly said
Wednesday that Turkey would use all possible means to halt the
missile deployment by the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
"This is no time for the Turkish government to be making wild
and dramatic statements which will not be supported by any
sensible member of the international community. It would be
completely out of bounds for Turkey to take this action," State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
"We hope very much that this report ... is incorrect. We hope
it does not reflect in any way, shape or form the views of the
Turkish government," he added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Washington criticized the Cypriot government for the
purchase of Russian missile. Burns said, however, the missile
systems will not be deployed for at least 16 months.

</P>
<P>
More than 130 of the world's top 500 transnational firms have
invested in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The mushrooming of technology- and capital-intensive
overseas-funded projects in the city are expected to gear up the
improvement of local industry.

<P>
The third phase of expansion of the Beijing Matsushita Color
Kinescope Co. Ltd., is expected to help the company produce
800,000 more color kinescopes and three million more color display
screens a year.

The Mistsubishi Stone Integrated Circuit Co. Ltd., valued at
more than 90 million US dollars, is expected to produce 120
million blocks of integrated circuits a year, and bring in 240
million US dollars in foreign exchange from exports.
</P>
<P>
Local overseas-funded enterprises generated more than 46 billion
yuan in output value during the 11-month period, up 23 percent
over the same period in 1995, and nearly 50 billion yuan in sales,
up nearly 19 percent over 1995.

<HEADLINE> Housing To Lead the Economic Growth of Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Housing construction will be
accelerated in the coming few years, ultimately playing a leading
role in the economic growth of Beijing, Beijing's deputy mayor
said today at a working meeting.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baifa noted that during 1997, the capital city will
complete eight million square kilometers of housing to meet the
huge demand.
</P>
<P>
"The housing construction sector should be viewed as a measure
of the growth of Beijing's overall economy," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, as many as 53,000 families in Beijing
now live in housing that provides less than four square meters per
person.
</P>
<P>
Some 31,000 of those families with housing problems are
expected to move into new apartment buildings soon, with the aid
of the state project for comfortable housing, Zhang said. The
housing difficulties of the other 22,000 families should be
settled by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, 1.1 billion yuan (130 million US dollars)
of World Bank loans will be used for housing projects in Beijing
this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Electronics Industry Grows Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China's electronics industry
reaped a gross output value of 301 billion yuan in 1996, up 22
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The electronics industry grew steadily and maintained a rapid
growth rate last year, a senior official with the Ministry of
Electronics Industry (MEI) said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, electronic products such as
program-controlled switchboards and personal computers have become
the industry's fastest-growing sectors, which increased 42.4
percent in output value in the first 11 months of last year.
</P>
<P>
In the January-November period of 1996, the industry turned
out 11 million lines of digital program-controlled switchboards
and 848,145 units of personal computers above 32 bits, up 50.7
percent and 129.9 percent, respectively, over the same period in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Large electronic enterprises, which are few in number but
represent the output value of the top 100 electronic firms,
account for 46 percent of the industry's total, becoming a driving
force for the industry.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded electronic firms and joint ventures continued
to grow rapidly, and their output value increased by 34 percent in
the first 11 months in 1996, compared with the corresponding
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of last year, the export trade volume of
the industry reached 30.87 billion US dollars. The exports stood
at 16.847 billion US dollars, up 30.14 percent over the same
period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Though it made significant progress, the electronic industry
also was plagued by a series of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 electronic firms reported profit loss in 1996; the
total losses of the industry increased by 66.5 percent; and the
gross post-tax profits decreased by 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
MEI officials said that state-owned enterprises grew slowly in
production and half of the state firms are losing money.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the rampant smuggling of color TV sets, computers,
video recorders and mobile telecommunications products dealt a
powerful blow to the normal production of domestic electronic
firms.
</P>
<P>
MEI officials said that the electronic industry will grow
rapidly this year, as the market demand will increase following
the rebounding of the national economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A total of 5,7430 small
factories had been shut down by the Chinese government as of
mid-December, accounting for 81.2 percent of the firms that must
cease operations due to excessive discharge of pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Local governments in 12 provinces and municipalities are now
required to carry out inspections to make sure these closed mills
do not re-open, according to the State Environment Protection
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The newly-closed factories include papermaking mills, leather
processors, electroplators and coking plants, which are regarded
as sources of pollution and prone to wasting resources.
</P>
<P>
Although the central government has worked steadily to close
all such environmentally-harmful factories, small factories of the
kind are still flourishing in some regions, especially in remote
and poor areas.

SHANGHAI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A modernized, electronic
Shanghai Bill Clearing and Distribution System went into formal

<HEADLINE> Sick Tigers in Shanghai Zoo Recover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese veterinarians are
investigating the origin of a mysterious virus which has seriously
afflicted 11 tigers at the Shanghai Zoo, according to today's
Shanghai newspaper "Wenhui Daily."
</P>
<P>
Of the sick cats, three Manchurian tigers and two Bengal tigers
have been cured of their symptoms. Four of the zoo's six South
China tigers appear to be recovering, and the other two are still
being treated, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Veterinarians at the Changchun-based Military Veterinary
Medicine Research Center believe the tigers' illness was caused
by a deadly virus that is most commonly found in dogs, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers were quoted as saying this is the first time such
an animal virus in the cat family has been found in China, and it
could be deadly.
</P>
<P>
Zoo keepers first noticed on December 26 that some of the
tigers showed signs of poor appetite. Soon after, the cats began
to fall ill, one after the other.
</P>
<P>
Although zoo veterinarians suspected that the illness was
caused by a virus, they did not receive confirmation until the
tiger's blood and stool samples were sent to Changchun and the
virus was finally revealed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The zoo has asked zoos in Beijing, Nanjing and Xi'an to supply
vaccines, which have run up a bill of at least 200,000 yuan
(24,000 US dollars) over the past 15 days, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that more than 20 animals in the Shanghai Zoo
died of old age or illness in the July-December period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Manchurian tiger and South China tiger have been listed as
two of the top endangered wild animals in the world by the World
Wildlife Foundation (WWF).
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that about 300 Manchurian tigers are presently
living in northeast China and Siberia. A survey conducted by the
WWF and China's Ministry of Forestry showed that there are only
about 20 South China tigers living in the wild in south China's
four provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian and Guangdong.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- With only four months' of
Chinese studies behind her, Camilla Lewis from Britain never
expected to win a Chinese writing contest that accepted entries
from foreign students throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
But she did.
</P>
<P>
A teacher-turned-student at the Yantai Teachers' University in
east China's Shandong Province, Lewis's prize-winning story in the
competition "The True China In My Eyes" recalls her experiences in
China, centered around her decision to teach in China and to later
switch roles and become a student of the language and culture.
</P>
<P>
Lewis was in Beijing today to attend an awards ceremony
honoring her essay, written in Chinese, titled "Two Decisions I've
Made."
</P>
<P>
Named Liu Min by her Chinese teacher, Lewis was one of the
80-plus foreign students on campus after the summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
"What foreign students wrote in their essays is all that they
see, hear, and feel in China," said Wu Chuhe, deputy
editor-in-chief of "People's Daily," the largest newspaper in
China, and a co-sponsor of the contest. "As a reader, I was really
moved by those stories," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Office of the State Leading Group for Teaching Chinese as a
Foreign Language was also a competition sponsor.
</P>
<P>
It was the first of its kind held nationwide since the founding
of New China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Entries included 875 Chinese writings recommended by 82
colleges and universities over a nine-week period. More than 4,000
foreign students in China participated.

The other prize winners come from 15 countries, including the
Republic of Korea, Russia, Germany, Sweden, Yugoslavia, Israel and
Malaysia.

conditions and customs, or people and events during China's reform

<P>
"Whether their stories included praise or friendly criticism,
the writers expressed their true feelings with care, love and
friendship toward China," Zhao continued.

The competition attracted attention from universities abroad,
accepting entries from overseas students, even though it was
designed for foreign students in China.
</P>

Sponsors plan to hold the competition again in an effort to
further promote China's teaching of Chinese as a foreign language
as well as friendly contacts among Chinese and people from other
countries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Issue SADC Recognized Driving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Millions of South African
motorists are to get a new and standardized driving licence which
will be recognized in the 12 Southern African Development
Community (SADC) countries, the local daily "the Star" reported
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The SADC consists of South Africa, Namibia, Botswana,
Swaziland, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mauritius,
Tanzania, Angola and Malawi, which have a total of 6.5 million
vehicles, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The new licence was issued in South Africa in October and will
be issued in other countries at the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the international driving licences, a result of
negotiations by SADC countries, is believed to be the first step to
developing an efficient, cost-effective and well-integrated transport
and communications network for the southen African region.
</P>
<P>
South African transportation officials said they believed the
new driving licences would increase efficiency and help eliminate
obstacles in regard to the cross-border movement of people, goods and
services. It would also mean the rationalization of existing
licence codes.
</P>
<P>
Before the licences are officially issued, the report said, new
traffic regulations have been made, which include the standardization
of roads and bridge designs, limits and overload controls, the
numbering of routes, traffic signs and signals, toll charges and road
mantenance.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the process will take about five years before
all existing licences are declard obsolete, the report said.
</P>
<P>
There is no clarity as yet whether some motorists, particularly
the aged, will be required to undergo new tests, as is required in
some European countries, to determine their suitability to hold a
licence. enditem

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Hit Cyprus If Missiles Deployed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that Turkey is
ready to strike at Cyprus if the Greek Cypriot government goes
ahead with the deal to buy Russian-made S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the strongly-worded statement at an urgent press
conference at the Foreign Ministry after her talks with Chief of
General Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
She said: "There is no way that we allow the missiles to be
placed in Cyprus. If the missiles are deployed on the island,
Turkey is ready to do everything to protect the security of
Turkish Cypritos, including striking Greek Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Ciller accused Greece of "encouraging and guiding" the Greek
Cypriots, saying that Athens should bear the responsibility for
Cyprus' attempt to use Greek Cypriots to threaten Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The arms deal between Cyprus and Russia is part of a plot to
stop Turkey from using its "guarantor rights" effectively over
the eastern Meditterranean island, said Ciller, adding: "We will
not fall into this trap. Turkey will follow the developments in
cold-headed manner and will take the necessary measures in time
and with determination."
</P>
<P>
She said: "Every attempt to put the Turkish Cypriots under a
threat will see Turkey to contend with."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Turkey had sent a note of
protest to Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin over
Moscow's sales to Cyprus of the missiles with a range of 150
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Ciller stressed that Turkey will not watch the arms
accumulation in Cyprus as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots' purchase of S-300 missiles has drawn
strong criticism from Turkey and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a
strongly worded statement, vowing that Turkey would take necessary
actions to protect Turkish Cypriots if the situation in Cyprus
continues to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cypriot government, in response to the criticism
from the United States, said Thursday that it was ready to
discuss any issue concerning the Cyprus problem with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Carey Cavanaugh, south European affairs director of the
U.S. State Department, will reportedly visit Nicosia, capital of
Cyprus, early next week.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since the Turkish
troops landed on the island in 1974 to protect the Turkish
Cypriots following an abortive coup engineered by then Greek
military regime.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus has long been a thorny issue to block the
normalization of relations between Greece and Turkey.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts on the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) reached consensus on the revenue aspect
of Hong Kong's financial budget today when their 16th meeting on
the transitional budget ended.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zuo'er, Chinese representative on the JLG, said the two
sides finally reached agreement on the revenue policy after three
meetings.
</P>
<P>
They had earlier agreed on the expenditure aspect.
</P>
<P>
The compiling of either aspect of the 1997-1998 budget should
take account of the interests of all social sectors in Hong Kong
and adopt a long-term point of view, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that, on the last Sunday of 1996, the Chinese
side had briefed Chief Executive designate Tung Chee-hwa on the
budget and asked for his advice.
</P>
<P>
He invited members of Tung's administration, which is to be
formed in the near future, to join in the Chinese side of the JLG
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is ready to continue the positive and
practical cooperation with the British side, to see the
compilation of the budget through, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
He expects that the budget will be a prudent and steady one
which accords with the Basic Law, and will leave a broad space for
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to draft the
next budget.
</P>
<P>
Consensus that has been achieved on both aspects of the budget
after so many meetings has yet to be turned into concrete data in
the budget, said Kwong Ki-chi, Hong Kong secretary of treasury and
also British representative on the JLG.

<P>
The next meeting is scheduled for January 23 and 24.

URUMQI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Six deaths have been reported
since Thursday in connection with snowstorms in the Ili Prefecture
and the Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture of Bayingolin, in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The storms, following an earlier one in the region's Altay
Prefecture that resulted in at least ten casualties, also took the
lives of more than 2,000 head of livestock and left nearly 500,000
domestic animals unable to look for food.
</P>
<P>
The two prefectures have been under seige of heavy snows for
six days running, with the deepest snow reaching one meter in some
counties and cities, according to a local official.
</P>
<P>
Up to 1,000 herdsman families and over 100,000 domestic animals
are still trapped by the snow and floodwater, the official
said, adding that total economic losses have reached 10 million
yuan (about 1.2 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A disaster rescue team composed of over 50,000 officials,
members of the Communist Party of China and troops has been formed
to combat the snowstorms. Grain, animal feed and fodder are being

BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Tang Shubei, deputy executive
chairman of the Association for Relations Across Taiwan Straits,
today criticized Taiwan authorities for engaging in divisive
activities against the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Any of their words and deeds that serve to split the country
will surely be strongly opposed by the entire Chinese people,
said Tang during a meeting here this afternoon with a visiting

Tang said the Chinese inland area has always believed in settling
differences through negotiation, and has shown great sincerity and
flexibility in this area which have led to dozens of consultations
between the Mainland Association for the Relations Across the
Taiwan Straits (ARATS) and the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
China's approach also contributed to the smooth meeting between
Wang Daohan, chairman of the ARATS and Koo Chen-fu, chairman of
the SEF in April, 1993, and pushed forward the relations across
the Taiwan Straits, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, following the Wang-Koo meeting, the Taiwan
authorities became increasingly involved in promoting "returning
to the United Nations" and "practical diplomacy" in an attempt to
split the motherland.

<P>
During the consultations between the two organizations, he said
obstacles have appeared again and again, leading to the
failure of the signing of an agreement reached by the two
organizations.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a leading Taiwan authorities visited the United States
in an attempt to promote the principles of "two Chinas" and "one
China, one Taiwan." As a result, the negotiations between the two
organizations and the second "Wang-Koo" meeting were terminated.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Authorities should bear full responsibility for
this, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever started the trouble should end it," Tang emphasized.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan Authorities take practical steps and return to the
"One China" position, so that consultations between the two
organizations and the second "Wang-Koo" meeting can be resumed, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said the reunification of the motherland needs more time: if
the Taiwan compatriots do change their ideology, the work will
progress slowly.
</P>
<P>
He also urged that the two sides across the Taiwan Straits
should create favorable conditions for the final reunification
through consultations.
</P>
<P>
Tang expounded on the Chinese government's consistent stand on
the relations between Hong Kong and Taiwan regions after july 1
this year, the relations between China and the United States and
the issue of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Tang said he hoped that the federation will contribute to the
promotion of the exchanges across the Taiwan Straits and to the
reunification of the motherland at an earlier date.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will Relief Package for Pakistan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 10 (Xinhua) -- As one of the major policy
initiatives taken by the two-month-old interim government in
Pakistan, the latest relief package for the country's vital
textile industry has received a positive response from the
spinning sector.
</P>
<P>
However, it remains a question mark: To what extent will the
new package prove to be effective for the whole textile industry?
</P>
<P>
The caretaker government recently announced a comprehensive
relief package aimed at revitalizing and restructuring the textile
sector, the backbone of Pakistan's economy.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's textile industry occupies a pivotal position in the
national economy. It accounts for eight percent of the GDP, 42
percent of the total employment in the large-scale manufacturing
sector and it also contributes about 60 percent of the country's
foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
However, the textile sector has been caught in a prolonged
bearish spell mainly because of the acute shortage of raw
materials and the high input costs.
</P>
<P>
The government's latest relief package contains a solution to
some of the pressing problems facing the textile industry. Duties
on import of raw cotton and some other inputs used in the
production of man-made fiber have either been abolished or
significantly reduced.
</P>
<P>
The abolition of import duty on raw cotton and a reduction in
the levy on other inputs used in the production of polyester fiber
will certainly help solve the problem of raw material shortages,
business leaders and analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Javed Saifullah Khan, chairman of the All Pakistan Textile
Mills Association, said the measure "will create not only an even
playing field but also induce a healthy trend by stabilizing the
fiber market and minimizing speculative tendencies."
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here believe that the package, while offering
a short-term relief for the industry, has failed to identify the
problems prevailing at grassroots level.
</P>
<P>
The move will help reduce the input costs, but the benefit will
be wiped out when overseas buyers start demanding reductions in
export prices of textiles or when exporters are going to
voluntarily reduce their prices in a bid to negotiate more orders.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry has classified the package as one of
relief measures for the spinning sector only, as the real
value-added sectors, such as weaving, finishing and made-ups
manufacturing, are ignored.
</P>
<P>
Although the government has promised it will announce similar
incentives for the value-added sectors later, the fact the package
for the spinning sector came out first again indicates that cotton
growers and spinners still have much sway in setting government
policies.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the immediate serious problems
facing the textile industry are not those concerning trade
liberalization but the prevailing inefficiency, lower
productivity, high cost of production as well as non-pragmatic
policies.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, one of the world's top five cotton producing
countries but which contributes only about two percent of the
world's textile exports, needs the kind of policy decisions which
can make the country's textile products competitive
internationally, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Many local economists here are of the view that since the
textile sector is of crucial importance to Pakistan's economy
especially with regards to the balance of payments situation, more
attention needs to be focused on the value-added sectors.
</P>
<P>
Increasing cotton production, textile products and hence
exports in this area will prove more beneficial in the long run
and will help Pakistan obtain the largest possible share of
value-added textile products in the world market, they say.

<HEADLINE> HK's Western Harbor Crossing to Open in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The two-kilometer-long
Western Harbor Crossing will open in April, four months ahead of
schedule, Western Harbor Tunnel Company Limited chairman Robert
Adams said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering sponsored by the American Chamber of Commerce in
Hong Kong, Adams said the overall project with an investment of
7.5 billion HK dollars (nearly 1 billion U.S. dollars) was 95
percent completed at the end of December last year and sufficient
progress has been made since to ensure that the much-needed
transport route will open in April.
</P>
<P>
He said key installations such as ventilation, environment
monitoring, toll collection, traffic surveillance and control
systems are now being installed in what is virtually the final
phase of construction.
</P>
<P>
He added that training of traffic controllers, operations staff
and other personnel is proceeding well and that the formal
operating procedures for Hong Kong's first dual three-lane tunnel
have been approved by the Hong Kong Transport Department.
</P>
<P>
The Western Harbor Crossing is the third of its kind in the
territory. The other two tunnels are the two-lane Eastern Harbor
Crossing completed in 1989 and the two-lane harbor Tunnel
completed in 1972.
</P>
<P>
It is also the start of the new Route 3, which includes the
West Kowloon Expressway, and will provide a vital link with Chek
Lap Kok, where Hong Kong's new airport is located, and Hong Kong's
border checkpoint at Lok Ma Chau.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the tunnel is expected to ease traffic pressure
on the two existing cross-harbor tunnels and cut congestion in
adjacent areas.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Opposition Party Accepts NCMP Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The opposition Workers' Party
accepted the offer of a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament
(NCMP) seat today and the party's Secretary-General J B Jeyaretnam
will be the NCMP.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released today, the Workers' Party said it made
the decision on Monday and informed the Returning Officer of it
today.
</P>
<P>
Jeyaretnam was a member of the Workers' Party team which lost
in the Cheng San Group Representation Constituency (GRC) in the
country's eighth general election on January 2. However, they
managed to garner 45.2 percent of the valid votes in the
constituency.
</P>
<P>
Under Singapore's constitution, if fewer than three opposition
candidates were elected to the parliament, the highest scoring
losers among the opposition parties would be awarded an NCMP seat.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said at a press conference shortly
after the general election that the Workers' Party team in the
Cheng San GRC would be given the NCMP seat.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, the opposition party had all along objected in
principle to the provision of the NCMP in the constitution.
Although it accepted an NCMP seat in 1988, it said it still
believed that the provision should be repealed.
</P>
<P>
But this time, the party decided to accept the offer in view of
what it called the "extreme lengths to which the ruling People's
Action Party went to deny the voters of the Cheng San an
opportunity to exercise their votes freely."
</P>
<P>
To refuse would do an "injustice" to those who voted for the
Workers' Party team, it said.

<HEADLINE> Nine Years of Warm Winters for Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai is enjoying its ninth
warm winter in a row since 1988, local meteorologists said today.
</P>
<P>
Shi Youhao, a senior engineer in the Shanghai Municipal
Meteorological Bureau, claimed that this winter will probably be
another warm one for China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
"Usually, we call the winter warm if its average temperature is
at or above 5.5 degrees celsius," he noted, adding that the
monthly average for last December had exceeded 7 degrees, even
higher than December of 1995.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the monthly average temperature for January
and February this year will reach 4 and 5 degrees, also above the
normal level in the past years.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we expect this winter to be warm or at least
slightly warm," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that since Shanghai began keeping
meteorological records in 1873, there have only been 29 warm
winters, with the average winter temperature (December through
February) for the past 123 years measured at 4.5 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
"However, since 1988, the city has already witnessed eight
consecutive warm winters," he said, adding that "It is also rare
that the winter minimum temperature, which was normally below
minus 5 degrees, has maintained above minus 5 since 1994."

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller said here today that Turkey
will not allow Greek Cyprus to deploy S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles, which are scheduled to be bought from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ciller made the statement at an urgent press conference at
the Foreign Ministry following her talks with Chief of General
Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that Turkey had sent a note of
protest to Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin over
Moscow's sales to Cyprus of the missiles with a range of 150
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Ciller stressed that Turkey will not watch the arms
accumulation in Cyprus as a spectator.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Cyprus and Russia concluded an agreement in
Nicosia on the latter's purchase of S-300 surface-to-air missiles
from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The arms deal has drawn strong opposition from both Turkish
Cypriots and Turkey, the only country in the world to recognizes
the self-proclaimed "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas accused Russia of
displaying enmity toward Turks on the eastern Mediterranean
island by selling missiles to Greek Cypriots, warning that
Cyprus was on the verge of an armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO allies, have been at loggerheads
over the divided island for years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus was partitioned in 1974 when the Turkish troops landed
on the island and took control of its northern part following an
abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Expected to Earn More from Oil Export in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, the leading oil producer in
west Africa, may have earned an extra 1.28 billion U.S. Dollars from
oil export last year, thanks to the high price in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
During the 1996 fiscal year, the government predicted its oil
export earnings on a revenue of 16 Dollars per barrel. This means
some 13.9 million Dollars per day, based on the estimated daily
export level of 867,200 barrels.
</P>
<P>
But statistics on the sales of Nigeria's Bonny Light, the country's
quality crude oil widely received in the world market, indicated that
the crude sold for an average of 20 Dollars per barrel in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Thus comes the windfall of 1.28 billion Dollars last year, the
local newspaper "The Punch" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 prices of crude oil fluctuated between 19 and 23
Dollars per barrel. Much of the year, it sold above the 20-dollar
mark.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria boasts a daily production level of 1.862 million barrels.
After deducting the 40 percent share to oil operators and 250,000
barrels for the onshore refineries, its daily export is estimated at
867,200 barrels.
</P>
<P>
Beside crude, according to the newspaper, Nigeria also exported
about 100,000 barrels equivalent of condensate products into the
international market last year.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted sources with the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries as saying that between March and December last
year, Nigeria's production level shot up to about two million barrels
per day, an induction of a higher revenue accruing to the government
purse.
</P>
<P>
But no further figures have been provided.

<HEADLINE> HK Commerce Chamber has duty to work for Region's Stable Transition: Tsang Hin Chi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Tsang Hin Chi, chairman of the
Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong, said here today
that it is the chamber's duty to become actively involved in the
work associated with the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tsang, who arrived here on January 7, heading a chamber
delegation, said at a news briefing this afternoon that the
Chamber of Commerce has always been an organization that promotes
its love of the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the members of the chamber have participated in a
number of activities related to Hong Kong's return, such as
publicizing the Basic Law, holding National Day celebrations, and
contributing to the work of the Preliminary Working Committee, the
Preparatory Committee and the Selection Committee.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the delegation members were honored to meet with the
state leaders in Beijing, and that this could be regarded as a
show of recognition and trust by the motherland. It also offers
encouragement to the entire chamber membership, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that the principles of "one country, two
systems," "the Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high
degree of autonomy will surely be implemented in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the backing of the powerful motherland, Hong Kong will
become more prosperous and stable after July 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for the exchanges and cooperation between Hong Kong and the
Chinese inland areas, Tsang said the commerce chamber has played
an important role in promoting economic ties and trade between the
two regions. And since the country began its policies of reform
and opening to the outside world, chamber members have taken the
lead in investing in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
In the future, he said, the chamber will focus more attention
on the development of the country's central and western areas and
organize its members to be involved in construction in these
areas, and contribute more to the country's economic development.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Ban Importation of Planes Over 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has planned
to ban the importation of aircrafts which have more than 15
years of service in a bid to improve the airworthiness of the
planes owned by domestic airlines.
</P>
<P>
An decree to this effect is soon to be signed by Nigerian Head
of State General Sani Abacha, said a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
"The move is triggered off by the indiscriminate importation
of old and sometimes discarded aircraft into the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 90 percent of aircrafts currently being used by airline
operators in Nigeria are over 20 years old, while the ratio is 50
percent in Ghana, nil in Cote d'Ivoire and about 20 percent for
other west African countries.
</P>
<P>
"This situation suggests that significant investments are not
being made on the acquisition or lease of more recently made
aircrafts," said a 1996 expert report on the Nigerian aviation
industry.
</P>
<P>
"Most aircrafts in Nigeria are second-handed. Foreign exchange
needed to buy spare parts are hard to acquire. And apart from
that, high maintenance cost has also manifested a significant
drop in the number of serviceable aircrafts," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 72 aircrafts available and operating in 1994
and 1995, only 25 are currently being operated while 47 have been
grounded owing to a lack of funds to perform engine overhaul
maintenance, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing 727 jetliner, belonging to the Domestic Aviation
Development Corporation, crashed last November, killing all the
143 passengers and crew on board.
</P>
<P>
Greatly shocked, the Nigerian government started to consider a
proposal to set age limit for the aircraft operators in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The government said it would not continue to fold its hands
and watch while airlines import "flying coffins" into the
country.

Berne Union, formally known as the Berne Union of International
Credit and Investment Insurers, was established in 1934 to
standardize member countries' rules and operations in export
credit insurance business. It also works to create international
cooperation that can foster a favorable investment climate.
</P>
<P>
The union now has 43 formal members and three observer
institutes from 37 countries and regions as well as a multiliteral
institution.

BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Total trading of the Shanghai
center on the national inter-bank money market hit a record high
of 178.4 billion yuan in 1996, almost 30.38 percent of the
nation's total, according to today's Shanghai Securities News.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing and lending almost broke even in amount during the

"A unification of money market last year was the major element
behind the huge volume of transaction, as it channeled more fund
outside Shanghai into the municipality," said an official with the
city's money center.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai-based national money market was currently
electronically hooked up to 20 banks and 35 regional money centers.

thousands of its workers walk off their jobs in protest against a
new labor law.

Meanwhile, a worker with the auto company today got serious
injuries after set himself on fire.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to close down indefinitely as of 5 p.m. (0800
GMT) Friday, as the union's illegal strike has left the company's
operations crippled," Hyundai said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai became the first big company to be closed down since
workers nationwide took to the streets on December 26, 1996 to
protest against a labor law pushed through parliament by the
ruling New Korea Party in the absence of the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai said it has suffered sales losses of 400 billion won
(480 million U.S. dollars) since the strikes began.

A worker with Hyundai, Chung Jae-sung, was said to be in
critical condition after trying to burn himself today in protest
against the new labor law which makes it more easier for companies
to dismiss workers.
</P>
<P>
The 34-year-old poured paint thinner over his body and set
himself on fire in a street outside the main Hyundai Motor plant
in the southern port city of Ulsan around 5 p.m. local time,

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Transforms Low-Yielding Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
plans to transform 357,000 hectares of low-yield farmland in the
1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The transformation of the land in 13 poverty-stricken counties
and 205 towns in the northern part of Jiangsu will increase grain
output by 1.2 million tons a year, providing an annual increase in
income of 250 yuan for every peasant.
</P>
<P>
The project is directed on the northern area of North Jiangsu
irrigation canal, Hongzehu lake area and Weishanhu lake areas,
with 656,000 hectares of arable field and 6.84 million people.
</P>
<P>
Due to the inadequate water supply problems about 70 percent of
the poverty stricken areas are low-yield farmland with slow
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Apart from 90 million yuan put in this year, the provincial
government will arrange a yearly fund of 120 million yuan in the
next four years to transform the low-yield farmland in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has combined water conservancy and
agricultural technology to curb problems of saline-alkali soil. A
responsibility system for fund-collecting has been set up to
ensure the appraisal of projects and carrying out of the
transformation work.
</P>
<P>
Some efforts have already achieved results. Yancheng city in
north Jiangsu has put 30 million yuan into the poverty-stricken
counties to transform 21,300 hectares of low-yielding farmland,
with an increase of grain output of 2.25 tons per hectare.

<HEADLINE> Ramadan Starts In Egypt Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today kicked off the
Islamic Holy month of fasting with a full agenda of cultural and
religious activities as well as public care for the needy.
</P>
<P>
The sighting of the Crescent was announced Thursday evening by
Farid Muhammed Wasel, Egypt's mufti, the country's highest Islamic
religious authority.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Libya, Iraq and seven other Arab countries
also declared that Ramadan began today.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic lunar year, observed
as sacred with fasting from dawn to sunset. It is the month when
Koran, the Islam Holy book, was revealed to Prophet Muhammed 1,400
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim fasting month has special importance for the one
billion Muslims worldwide not only because of its religious
significance but also because it includes the largest amount of
religious cultural and even artistic activities.
</P>
<P>
Working hours are cut short and Cairo streets and public places
in the capital are full of cultural and artistic events.
</P>
<P>
Religious seminars, cultural soirees and folk art performances
are held in different state-owned theaters and palaces of culture
and never fails to attract large audience.
</P>
<P>
This year Opera House, responsible for art performance during
the holy month, has recently decided to hold a series of religious
lectures.
</P>
<P>
It will host folk art troupes and music ensembles from Jordan,
Morocco, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Tunisia, Oman, Kuwait and Algeria to
present their countries' art to the Egyptian viewers.
</P>
<P>
Its cultural program will also include a special section for
films, to be named "Memory of the Egyptian Cinema." Held on
Wednesdays, the event will screen films produced by prominent
directors during the 1940s-50s which were never shown on the
Egyptian TV.
</P>
<P>
In Alexandria, the second largest city of Egypt, a giant stage
has been set up where folk art troupes from different Delta
governorates will give performance.
</P>
<P>
Amid diversified cultural and entertainment activities, many
people are already relishing the prospect of having a thoroughly
cultural Ramadan and enjoying their midnight meal, Sohoor.
</P>
<P>
Although the majority of students will not be able to enjoy the
folk art performances in the first half of the Ramadan as it
coincides with mid-term exams at schools and universities, they
can catch the rest of the performance in the second half of the
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the governorates and cultural authorities nationwide
are doing their utmost for Ramadan through helping the less
fortunate.
</P>
<P>
About 42 million Egyptian pounds (12.4 million U.S. dollars)
have been earmarked from businessmen and charity organizations
for distribution to the lower income brackets.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Insurance and Social Affairs Amal Othman said
earlier that the Cairo governorate has appropriated 25 million
pounds(7.3 million dollars) for the social insurance cases and
other critical cases decided by the Almas Committees. Other
governorates have also made such appropriations.

<HEADLINE> Good Financial Results Recorded at Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Strict cost management measures and
a freeze on staff recruitment have helped the University of Zimbabwe
produce good financial results for the year ending in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The university achieved a 3.4 million u.s. dollars net
surplus, the daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The institution also managed to transform its working capital from
a previous deficit of 3.7 million US Dollars to a more than 6.1
million US Dollars surplus, the first surplus since 1989.
</P>
<P>
For the first time, funds released by the Ministry of Higher
Education have managed to almost meet the day to day running of the
institution. But the flow of these funds, released on a monthly basis,
has been erratic, making it difficult for authorities to plan in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Vice Chancellor Levison Nyagura said the key
to achieving the good results was through avoiding ''unauthorised
overdrafts'' by ensuring that amounts spent every month did not
exceed money available at the bank.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we had to redefine our priorities. We paid first
salaries, then contractual and committed obligations such as
electricity bills. The remainder was then used to pay for
requirements of departments in order of priority without undermining
academic excellence.''
</P>
<P>
This meant departments were forced to buy only what was
necessary and had to do without what had been deemed
''luxiries''.
</P>
<P>
Work also began to recover a lot of money which had been lying
idle. Ways of reducing expenditure were also implemented, resulting
in huge savings for the institution.
</P>
<P>
Nyagura was optimistic that a better year awaited the institution
as financial control measures were to be tightened further and
corruption reduced.  enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Various impoverished parts of
China have managed to overcome poverty as part of a nationwide
anti-poverty campaign that started last year.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province in the northwest, which has 50 poor counties,
allocated eight million yuan in cash disbursements and 30 million
in loans last year to help poor areas speed up economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Priority was given to growing mulberries, tea, fruits, herbal
medicines, and edible fungus in the southern part of the province,
while the northern part devoted itself to tobacco, fruits, sweet
potatoes, and sheep, which contributed 70 percent of farmers'
annual net income.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 1.7 million people living below the poverty line,
meaning less than 530 yuan, have greatly improved their standard
of living, and the province is making concrete plans to help the
remaining 3.2 million poor people escape poverty this year.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Province, in the north, sent some 20,000 officials at
the provincial, prefectural, and county-levels down to 492 poor
townships last year to help them with economic development.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: ASEAN in Regional Tourism Promotion Mood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are all geared up to boost
regional tourism through enhanced cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With the objective to promote cooperation among member
countries in tourism and market ASEAN as a single tourist
destination, a week-long ASEAN Tourism Forum (ATF) with the theme
"Expanding the ASEAN Horizon Toward the 21st Century" ended here
today.
</P>
<P>
In its conjunction, the ASEAN Tourism Conference (ATC) held
here appealed to tourism industry companies in the region
including airlines, tour operators and travel agents to promote
the region as a tourist destination with a greater sense of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Besides, ASEAN tourism ministers had an informal meeting to
discuss common policies related to tourism.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Tourism Association (ASEANTA), the Federation of
ASEAN Travel Associations (FATA), the ASEAN Hotel and Restaurants
Associations (AHRA) also met separately at the forum to define
their roles in the region's tourism development.
</P>
<P>
A three-day TRAVEX (ASEAN Travel Exchange), the most important
event of the ATF, was also held here to advocate ASEAN members'
tourism products.
</P>
<P>
The TRAVEX attracted about 300 buyers from some 42 countries
and regions and 900 sellers from some 400 organizations in ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Participating in these events were the ASEAN members -- Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and
Vietnam. Cambodia and Laos, which have observer status in ASEAN,
were also represented.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with today's trend toward regionalization, the ASEAN
tourism industry can make more gains by promoting itself as a
single entity, Malaysian Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister
Sabbaruddin Chik said at the forum.
</P>
<P>
"Together, we are able to create synergy and have much more to
offer to tourists as a region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN tourism ministers agreed to strengthen efforts to
further develop tourism on a regional basis for the benefits of
all the members at their one-day informal meeting.
</P>
<P>
On intra-regional tourism, the tourism ministers discussed
among other issues the establishment of special lanes at
immigration check points for ASEAN tourists and visitors to
facilitate travel of ASEAN nationals.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia pledged to follow the example of Bangkok which has
already implemented the system when its Kuala Lumpur New
International Airport in Sepang is put into operation in January
next year.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of such lanes would be complementary to the
elimination of visa requirements for ASEAN nationals traveling
within ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, ASEAN's newest member, is the only country which has
yet to eliminate its visa requirements for ASEAN visitors and
tourists and ASEAN is currently engaged in discussion with the
country on the issue, according to Sabbaruddin.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN will be promoted as a venue for major conventions and
sports events and the Mekong Basin as a tourist destination will
be promoted to enhance tourism development for Mekong Basin
countries, participants vowed.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which covers about 3.4 million square kilometers of land
with a population of some 432 million, is a region of great
diversity and cultural richness, with each country having its own
unique culture, language and identity.
</P>
<P>
"We are also diverse in terms of geography and wildlife. We see
our region's diversity as a strength and it is this very diversity
that lends the region its intrigue and fascination," Sabbaruddin
said.
</P>
<P>
ASEANTA took the initiative by setting up a working committee
to create special packages with promotional airfares to boost
intra- and inter-regional travel to mark ASEAN's 30th birthday
this year which is seen as an important event for the regional
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Tourist Promotion Board Chief Executive Tan Chin Nam
said his country is prepared to work with its neighbors in ASEAN
in reformulating and packaging the region's attractiveness which
will enable them to come up with superior tourism products.
</P>
<P>
As intra-regional tourism continues to grow at a rapid pace,
regional cooperation will enable ASEAN to achieve collective and
complementary attractiveness, observers said.

<P>
PARIS, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Just like blood stocks contaminated with AIDS virus were sold
in France in the 1980s, the stocks of growth promoting hormone which
could contain the virus of the fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease were
put into market in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The scandal of the French public health authorities was revealed
on Thursday by the ``Express'' weekly, and was confirmed by judicial
authorities. About 1,500 children have been treated since 1985 for
diseases likely to be linked with the consumption of the hormone.
</P>
<P>
-- To the great worry of Washington, tension once again is
rising between Greece and Turkey following the purchase by Greek
Cypriots of 20 S300 missiles from Russia for several million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To be delivered in a couple of weeks, the sophisticated
ground-to-air missiles which are the equivalent of the U.S.
``Patriots'' defense missiles, have never been out of the soil of
Russia before. According to Turkish press, Ankara does not rule out
the possibility of launching preventive attacks against the missile
deployments.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- According to a Gallup poll, while the French and Italians
remain eager supporters of the single European currency, Euro, the
Germans are more and more hesitant about the monetary unification
process, and the British are simply hostile to it.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-three percent of the French and 66 percent of the
Italians think that to adhere to the European Union is a good thing,
against 51 percent among the Germans and 34 percent among the
British. Only 16 percent of the Germans polled said that the Euro
would be good for them.

<HEADLINE> China Improving Foreign Copyright Offices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A new set of regulations
released in China today will improve management of foreign
copyright agencies operating in the country, according to the
State Copyright Administration.
</P>
<P>
It explains that holders of foreign copyrights and foreign
agencies must be recognized by the administration before they can
submit applications for opening permanent offices in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The set of regulations were issued by the SCA and the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce, who say that the move
will increase protection of foreign copyrights and improve
controls on foreign copyright agencies.
</P>
<P>
After obtaining SCA approval, foreigners must apply for SAIC
approval, based on the Provisional Regulations on Managing the
Permanent Offices of Foreign Enterprises issued by the State
Council, and Methods of Registration and Management of the
Permanent Offices of Foreign Enterprises, issued by the SAIC.
</P>
<P>
Foreign copyright agencies can send one representative to
Beijing, and the number of permanent staff members cannot exceed
five.
</P>
<P>
The representative can stay for three years and must obey
China's laws and regulations and not harm China's public
interests, and can only engage in copyright-related activities.
</P>
<P>
China's copyright departments and industry and commerce
administrations have the right to oversee these foreign
offices. Those who violate related regulations will be given a
warning, and can have their licenses revoked.
</P>
<P>
China has already approved several foreign copyright offices in
Beijing, including one from a US film group.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Companies Sue Lawyer for Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Malaysian companies
have filed a 60 million ringgit (about 24 million U.S. dollars)
defamation suit against lawyer Param Cumaraswamy over an article
in an international litigation magazine.
</P>
<P>
They are claiming, in the writ of summons filed at the Kuala
Lumpur High Court on December 12 last year, damages of 15 million
ringgit (about 6 million dollars) each for slander and another 15
million ringgit each for libel over the article carried by the
International Commercial Litigation magazine in its November 1995
issue, according to official Malaysian news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The companies, MBf Capital Corporation and MBf Northern
Securities Limited Company, claimed that the lawyer had made to
David Samuels, a staff writer of the magazine, certain defamatory
allegations against MBf and their legal counsel V. K. Lingam
between September and November 1995, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
This was in connection with a legal suit filed by the MBf
companies against East Asiatic Company (EAC) which was heard in
the High Court here in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
The companies said Param was quoted extensively in an article
entitled "Malaysian Justice on Trial" carried by the magazine
published by Euromoney Publications of London.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that the words in the article were understood to
mean that MBf had connived and participated in the corruption or
the attempted corruption of the Malaysian judiciary through their
legal counsel in the EAC case.
</P>
<P>
They are also seeking an injunction to restrain Param from
speaking or publishing further defamatory words against MBf.
</P>
<P>
Param, who is a former Malaysian Bar Council chairman, is the
chief executive partner of the Shook Lin &AMP; Bok legal firm.

<HEADLINE> Macao Collects 440 Tons of Garbage Each Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Population increase in Macao
led to a 10-percent increase in the amount of garbage collected
in Macao last year.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Macao Cleaning Company, which
monopolizes the collection of solid refuse in Macao, show that a
total of 160,600 tons of rubbish were collected last year, which
translates to 440 tons each day, up about 10 percent from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Considering the fact that the amount of garbage had decreased
over the previous several years, the increase resulted from the
increase in local and floating populations following the
opening of the international airport, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to raise the number of large refuse
collecting stations from 27 to 64 during the holidays of the
Chinese Lunar New Year in early February, when people tend to
clean their house thoroughly. Garbage collection vehicles will
also be increased.

COLOMBO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Maldivian Foreign
Minister Fathulla Jameel said today Colombo is the gateway to his
country and that the centuries-old trade and cultural ties between
the Maldives and Sri Lanka had always been very cordial.
</P>
<P>
Jameel told a press conference here that a larger number of
Maldivians are continuing to receive their education in Sri Lanka,
which has played a major role in the Maldives' educational system.
</P>
<P>
Many Sri Lankan teachers are now teaching in the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives, which takes over the chairmanship of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in May this
year, will attach great importance to the establishment of a
regional identity among the seven member nations, Jameel said.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan businessmen are investing more and more in the
Maldives, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that there is a trade imbalance in favor of
Sri Lanka. The Maldives imports fresh vegetables, meat and a
large number of essential items from Sri Lanka, and uses Colombo
as a re-export center for its products, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Jameel arrived in Colombo Wednesday night on an official visit.

<HEADLINE> Visitor Arrivals in HK by November Exceed 10 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's visitor arrivals
for the January-November period in 1996 exceeded the total for the
 whole of 1995, according to the latest figures issued by the
Hong Kong Tourist Association.
</P>
<P>
The 1.54 percent increase over the same period in 1995 brought
the total number of visitors to 10.6 million, against the 10.2
million for the whole of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In November alone, arrivals topped the one million mark to
1,016,805, up 10.9 percent over November in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Over the 11 month period, all major market regions registered
growth. Top of the list was North Asia, whose arrivals rose
by 34 percent to 2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals form Australia, New Zealand and the South
Pacific increased by 16.7 percent to 356,300, while those from
South and Southeast Asia rose by 16.4 percent to 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitor from the Chinese mainland increased by
4.3 percent to 2.1 million, while those from Europe, Africa and
the Middle East rose by 3.7 percent to 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
The increases can be attributed mainly to the growing interest
in Hong Kong as it approaches the time of its handover, as well as
the increases in air capacity between the Philippines and Hong
Kong, an HKTA spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA predicts that total arrivals for 1996 will be some
11.6 million, compared with 10.2 million in 1995.

<HEADLINE> No Talks with Greek Cyprus: Northern Cyprus Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern Cyprus Leader Rauf
Denktas said that Turkish Cypriot participation in continued talks
on Cyprus will be impossible unless their sovereignty over
northern part of the island country is acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with Turkey's newspaper
Daily News published today, Denktas said that Turkish Cypriots
would not sign any agreement if their conditions were not met.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the tough position after a serious crisis was
triggered off by a Greek Cypriot decision made public last
Saturday to purchase S-300 surface-to-air missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is considering Greek Cypriots as
the legitimate government and us as a community and then asking
for a Cyprus settlement. For a Cyprus settlement this has to
change," Denktas said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the sovereignty of Turkish Cypriots over the
self-proclaimed "Turkish Republic of North Cyprus", should be
respected. Turkey is the only country so far to have recognized
the "republic" since its formation in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots' purchase of the 150-kilometer-range S-300
missiles has drawn strong criticism from Turkey and some other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the Turkish Foreign Ministry issued a strongly
worded statement, vowing that Turkey would take necessary
actions to protect Turkish Cypriots if the situation in Cyprus
continues to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cypriot government, in response to the criticism
from the United States, said Thursday that it was ready to
discuss any issue concerning the Cyprus problem with the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Carey Cavanaugh, south European affairs director of the U.S.
State Department, will reportedly visit Nicosia, capital of
Cyprus, early next week.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since the Turkish
troops landed on the island in 1974 to protect the Turkish
Cypriots following an abortive coup engineered by then Greek
military regime.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has long been a thorny issue to block
the normalization of relations between Greece and Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Bohai Oilfield Produces 2.1 Million Tons of Crude Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The application of research
findings helped the Bohai Oilfield in the Bohai Sea to pump
out 2.12 million tons of crude oil and 367 million cubic meters of
natural gas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin-based Bohai Oilfield of the China National Offshore
Oil Corporation is China's oldest offshore oil production
base. Over the past two years, the oilfield has had great
difficulties in stabilizing its output as two of its many oil
wells have stopped production and one more has reported lower
production.
</P>
<P>
However, the oilfield has relied on modern scientific and
technological progress and applied new research findings to oil
production in its newly-explored oil wells, and has achieved great
success.
</P>
<P>
The oilfield has also implemented a joint-development method in
the construction of the Boxi (western Bohai Sea) oil production
Project.
</P>
<P>
The project, which links six oil wells by an pipeline in the
sea, and has a designed refining capacity of 500,000 tons of crude
oil a year and 250,000 cu m of natural gas daily, will be
completed at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
It will then supply Tianjin residents with oil and gas and will
also play a big role in helping stabilize Bohai Oilfield's oil
output.
</P>
<P>
China's offshore oilfields produced 15 million tons of crude
oil las year, according to earlier reports.

region considered the center of current international economic
development.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Buy Missiles from U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will purchase 72
surface-to-surface missiles from Loral-Wought Company of the
United States, Turkish military sources said here.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper Daily News today quoted the sources as saying
that Turkey will pay a total of 50 million U.S.dollars for the
Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS).
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the 150-kilometer-range missiles will be
delivered to Turkey in May or June 1998, according to an agreement
signed last year.
</P>
<P>
After a modification in the Multi Launcher Rocket Systems,
which Turkey already has in its possession, the ATACMS can easily
be launched by these launchers, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Turkey had decided to buy these
missiles in a bid to strengthen its land defense.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Cyprus and Russia concluded an agreement in
Nicosia on buying 150-kilometer-range S-300 anti-aircraft
missiles from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The arms deal has drawn strong opposition from both Turkish
Cypriots and Turkey, the only country in the world to recognize
the self-proclaimed "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
Northern Cyprus leader Rauf Denktas accused Russia of
displaying enmity toward Turks on the eastern Mediterranean island
by selling missiles to Greek Cypriots, warning that Cyprus was
on the verge of an armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both member states of the NATO, have been at odds
over this divided island for years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been partitioned in 1974 when the Turkish troops
landed on the island and took control of its northern part
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lankan Tamil Rebels Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 10 (Xinhua) -- About 60 government troops were
killed and over 230 wounded when Sri Lankan Tamil rebels stormed
army defenses in the Elephant Pass and the Paranthan military base
in the North of Sri Lanka on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In their first major assault this year, the rebels launched a
two pronged attack from North of Paranthan and Southwest of the
Elephant Pass in the early hours of Thursday morning. Over 1,000
rebels, including members of the Sea Tigers, took part in the
assault.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Ministry disclosed that, as of Thursday night, 60
government troops were killed and a total of 232 troops injured in
the fighting while about 500 rebels were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
But informed sources today said at least 170 rebels were
killed and 500 others injured in their attack.
</P>
<P>
At the start of the attack, the rebels were able to cut off the
Paranthan sector from the Elephant Pass sector for several hours,
thus isolating the Elephant Pass headquarters from the Army's Task
Force Two at Paranthan.
</P>
<P>
Defense sources said the attack was aimed at smashing
government defenses and destroying artillery positions situated
between the Elephant Pass and Paranthan. According to reports from
the North, arms, ammunition and some equipment belonging to the
army were captured by the rebels. But the Defense Ministry says
that no arms were captured by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from the North today, the rebels broken
through lightly held defenses after a fierce fight.
</P>
<P>
The rebels appeared to have been aware of the exact location
where the long range guns were positioned. The two pronged attack
forced the defenders of Paranthan and the Elephant Pass to fall
back, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Military sources believe that the long range artillery
pieces seized by the rebels when they overran the army's military
base at Mullaitivu last July were used to pulverize the Elephant
Pass-Paranthan defenses.
</P>
<P>
At Mulaitivu, the rebels had captured two pieces of artillery,
dozens of mortars and a massive stock of arms and ammunition. The
army lost more than 1,300 personnel on that occasion.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's battle, air force helicopters were used to
attack the rebels from the air and airlift the wounded.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had not shown any desire to hold on to territory.
Their aim appeared to be to destroy the artillery, armored
fighting vehicles and kill as many government soldiers as
possible, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Paranthan is strategically important as it sits astride the
main North South highway from Colombo to Jaffna and controls the
road junction connecting the rebel-held Northeastern town of
Mullaitivu.
</P>
<P>
It was captured by government forces last July and used as the
launching pad to capture Kilinochchi last September after one of
the fiercest battles in the 13 year ethnic conflict during which
over 75,000 persons are believed to have been killed.

BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese banks will continue to
give full support to the merging and bankruptcy of enterprises
in China, according to the governor of China's central bank.
</P>
<P>
But the support does not mean that banks would write off bad
debts and dead loans without choice, Dai, governor of the
People's Bank of China, said this week.
</P>
<P>
"We have to fight firmly against unapproved bankruptcies being
declared without official permission from the head office of the
debtor bank," he told a national conference on re-employment of
displaced workers in state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that any applications for bankruptcy would be passed
by the head office of the debtor bank before the
enterprise can declare bankruptcy and plead for exemption from
paying back bank loans.
</P>
<P>
"The state-owned commercial banks will try to speed up the
shift in the state enterprises' management system, spending a
fairly large amount of reserve funds to write off bad debts and
dead loans in bankrupt enterprises," the governor stressed.
</P>
<P>
He added that such illicit bankruptcies can only result in
failure to fulfill such a goal.
</P>
<P>
"It is more than a waste of government funds, and the result
can be out of the worst expectations if the credit system in the
banking sector is ruined, or if any enterprise is able to evade
paying back bank loans by declaring itself bankrupt," he added.
</P>
<P>
By sticking to a moderately tight monetary policy, the
nation's banking sector has created a favorable financial
environment for the far-reaching state enterprise reforms in the
past three years, expediting the process of merging and bankruptcy
of such firms, said Dai Xianglong.
</P>
<P>
China has decided to try out optimizing capital allocation in
110 cities this year, which means that more debt-ridden state
enterprises will either be merged or declared bankrupt, he added.
</P>
<P>
"It also poses a tougher task for state-owned commercial banks,
which will then grant more financial support to merged or
streamlined enterprises," explained the governor.

<P>
CHANGSHA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Police rushed to help after
receiving an emergency call that a 60-year-old man had collapsed
while walking along a road in Loudi City, central China's Hunan
Province .
</P>
<P>
The policemen gave artificial respiration to help revive the
old man and sent him to a nearby hospital for further treatment
after he came back to life.
</P>
<P>
"I am proud and very happy about the fact that my hometown has
so many police officers who serve the people heart and soul," said
Wang Wei, a Taiwan compatriot who witnessed the drama.
</P>
<P>
An official said that 11 cities and 18 counties in the province
already have emergency police stations which pledge to offer a
helping hand at any time to anyone.
</P>
<P>
He said that experiences in the past four months show that
local police usually arrive at the scene of incidents within five
to ten minutes, and can basically cope with many situations and
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the emergency stations in 11 cities alone
receive over 2,000 calls everyday. Calls about crimes, public
security, and requests for help account for 10 percent, 23 percent
and 30 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the provincial public security
department allocated a total of 1.65 million yuan to help set up
police emergency stations which have played an important role in
cracking down on crime, safeguarding social order and serving the
people.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Former Tanzanian
President Julius Nyerere is expected to brief the Tanzanian
government on his last mediation on the Burundi conflict.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said here today that Nyerere, who is

<HEADLINE> Ross Offers Compromise Proposal To Break Deadlock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross will continue to stay in the region and discuss with
Israeli and Palestinian officials a U.S. compromise proposal on
partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank, reported
Israel Radio today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal calls for completion of final Israeli
pullbacks from the West Bank in September 1998, almost a one-year
putoff from the date defined in the Oslo II accord signed in
Washington on September 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified U.S. official was quoted as saying Thursday
that the proposal avoids a specific date, but should be done "at
some point during 1998."
</P>
<P>
A stalemate on the Hebron talks came after Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu offered to complete the last of three
pullbacks from the occupied West Bank by spring 1999, two years
behind schedule. The idea touched off furious reactions from
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Ross held talks with Netanyahu on the U.S. proposal in Tel
Aviv Thursday night, but the meeting was interrupted by two
bomb explosions in the city. Thirteen people were injured in the
blasts.
</P>
<P>
Plans for a U.S.-Palestinian meeting at the Herzliya home of
U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk were also called off since this
meeting was aimed at relaying Netanyahu's response on the
U.S.proposal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is apparently seeking a compromise between Arafat who
insists on strict adherence to the original plan, and Netanayahu who
tries to postpone it.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told a group of Peace Now activists in Gaza Thursday
morning that December 1998 "was too distant."
</P>
<P>
Janet Aviad, a leading Peace Now activist who attended the
meeting, told reporters that there seems room for hope for a
compromise. She added that Arafat did not say September
1997 was the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is scheduled to fly to Paris for a visit today while
Ross has no plan to leave. Ross's boss, Secretary of
State-designate Madeleine Albright, Wednesday praised him for
doing a "brilliant job."

<P>
SHENYANG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- State-owned industrial firms
in northeast China's Liaoning Province, the country's leading
heavy industrial center, have reversed the trend of a drop in
their economic returns..
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the added-value of the firms increased by four percent
compared with the previous year, with losses incurred by the coal
industry reduced by 590 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Wen Shizhen, governor of Liaoning, credited this to a large
scale technological transformation at state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
The province earmarked 23.6 billion yuan for technological
transformation of various kinds last year. Stress was laid on
pillar industries such as iron and steel and petrochemicals, Wen
said.
</P>
<P>
Industrial transformation of 44 projects has been completed,
generating a combined additional output value of 4.2 billion yuan
a year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the assets of some loss-making state-owned
enterprises have been rationally used through mergers and
regrouping.
</P>
<P>
Over 200,000 workers discharged by 100 bankrupt enterprises
have found new jobs.

energy, according to engineers at the Changzhou Research Institute
of Machinery and Electronic Products.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that vehicles using the device are able to
save about seven percent fuel.
</P>
<P>
Another advantage of the device is that it can help start
engines at very low temperatures. Engines left at minus 40 degrees
Celsius will start quicker.

<HEADLINE> East China's Steam-Free Glass Invention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Glass that keeps from getting
steamed over in the bathroom has been invented in Fuzhou, the
capital of east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The secret of the discovery is in an electric circuit at the
back of the glass that keeps the surface of the glass a certain
temperature, preventing the fog that results from condensation of
water vapor.
</P>
<P>
The patented product fills a void in the steam-free glass
business in China, experts say, because it has widespread
applications in automobiles, eye-glasses, airplanes, and
individual housing, especially in cold areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Road accident cases declined
from 8,068 in 1995 to 5,566 in 1996 in Kampala, capital of Uganda,
reported the local daily the Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
A report released by police on Thursday was quoted as saying
that the number of people WHO died in traffic accidents in the
city, however, increased from 284 in 1995 to 289 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,022 people were injured in the traffic accidents last
year, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The main cause of accidents during the year was reported to be
reckless driving and speeding.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the decrease of traffic accidents in the
city to the new strategic deployment approach adopted by traffic
police since last August.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the new approach, policemen are deployed on
black spots in the city and surrounding areas as well as around busy
streets during rush hours.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, speed control units were expanded and given logistical
support to effectively patrol all roads in and out of the city.

<HEADLINE> China's Post and Telecoms Have Good Year In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China's post and
telecommunications business was worth an estimated 133 billion
yuan in 1996, an incredible 34.5 percent increase over the
previous year, according to a senior government official.
</P>
<P>
The China Business Times quoted Wu Jichuan, the minister of
post and telecommunications, as saying the sharp increase also
represented an increase in earnings, with an income of 126.2
billion yuan expected.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, China had a telephone switching capacity of
100 million lines, and had a mobile telephone network that covered
the whole country. The telephone availability rate went up to 6.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that telecom service quality also improved last year,
and people in most cities no longer have to spend nearly half a
year waiting for telephone installation as is the case in the
past, with the waiting time having been cut to no more than a
month.
</P>
<P>
The new year will bring more challenges, however, Wu warned
post and telecommunications employees, because this year the
central government will scale back or even withdraw some
preferential policies the industry enjoys.
</P>
<P>
Post and telecommunications development is still one of the
government's major economic goals, and the domestic market, which
was solely controlled by the ministry in the past, will be opened
to more competitors, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has already approved more than 2,800 telecommunications
service providers, and more foreign companies are knocking on
China's door to offer telecom services.

<HEADLINE> Israel Warns Against Repercussions of Terrorist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has sternly warned against the repercussions
of terrorist bombings in Tel Aviv on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A dozen of people were injured Thursday evening in two bomb
explosions in southern Tel Aviv. Netanyahu, who arrived late night
at the hospital where the wounded were treated, said it seemed to
be a terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
He also said if it is proved to be a terrorist attack, he would
respond with "severity" to the incident.
</P>
<P>
Police suspected the bombings were carried out by Palestinian
militants, but they have not ruled out criminal motives behind the
explosions.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that such act would negatively affect the
already deadlocked peace process. "If it tends out to be
(carried out by) terrorists who came from the areas controlled by
the Palestinian Authority, we will not treat the business as
usual," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We can not have peace if ... people cannot walk in the
streets of Tel Aviv," Netanyahu added.
</P>
<P>
In the first official reaction to the bombings, a government
spokesman said that Israel would not let the terrorists to gain
any benefits from their acts. He demanded the Palestinian
Authority (PA) for its "consistency" in cracking down terrorists.
</P>
<P>
There is concern that Israel's hardening of position could cast
further shadow over the current deadlocked talks on Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron. Israel and PA remain split over the
timetable for further Israeli troop redeployments in the rural
areas of the West Bank following the Hebron pullback.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat was briefed on the attack, but a
Palestinian spokesman said Arafat would not comment on it until
the cause of the attack was clarified, and that Israel should not
use this as a "pretext" to stall the peace process.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the Thursday attack,
Israel police said that they suspected the bombings were launched
by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), an
Palestinian militant group based in Syrian capital Damascus.
</P>
<P>
The group have been active recently in carrying out terrorist
attacks, the latest of which being the drive-by shooting in last
month when three PFLP gunmen killed a Jewish mother and her son
near a settlement north of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Some experts also suspected the attack was carried out by
anti-Israel Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, which is
marking the first anniversary of the death of its bomber-maker
Yihya Ayyash, who was killed last January when a bobby-trapped
cellular phone exploded. Hamas held Israeli agents responsible for
the murder, and has repeatedly vowed revenge attacks against
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Garment, Textile Exports Shoot Up in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The garment exports recorded 211,000 U.S. Dollars in
November, up from 181,000 Dollars in 1995, according to the
lastest data from the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ).
</P>
<P>
The textile exports rose from 1995's 35.9 million Dollars to
37.2 million Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The boom is due to the development of free market economy in
the southern African country, which succeeds in stirring
competition, EBZ Director Mwansa Musonda said.
</P>
<P>
Reinvestment in Zambia's textile sector was estimated to hit a
record high of no less than 40 million Dollars by the end of
1996, predicting a more significant hike in 1997, the local press
said.

<HEADLINE> More Mineral Resources Found in Southwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- A number of newly found mineral
deposits are showing a bright future for another nonferrous metal
production center in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
During the last few years, ten-plus large mines have been
discovered in the area of the "three rivers," namely,
the Nujiang River, the Lancang River and the Jinsha River.
</P>
<P>
With a total area of 160,000 square kilometers, the "three
rivers" region is believed to be a world-rare place rich in noble
and nonferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
Among the newly founded deposits, a sliver deposit with proven
reserve of 3,000 tons and a medium-sized copper deposit are
expected to be developed soon.
</P>
<P>
According to a local source, further prospecting will lead to
the discovery of more deposits in the area. The proven reserve of
cobber in the region will possibly top 10 million tons during the
9th Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), the source said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, British Experts End Meeting on HK Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Experts on the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group (JLG) reached consensus on the revenue aspect
of Hong Kong's financial budget today when their 16th meeting on
the transitional budget ended.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zuo'er, Chinese representative on the JLG, said the two
sides finally reached agreement on the revenue policy after three
meetings.
</P>
<P>
They had earlier agreed on the expenditure aspect.
</P>
<P>
The compiling of either aspect of the 1997-1998 budget should
take account of the interests of all social sectors in Hong Kong
and adopt a long-term point of view, Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned that, on the last Sunday of 1996, the Chinese
side had briefed Chief Executive designate Tung Chee Hwa on the
budget and asked for his advice.
</P>
<P>
He invited members of Tung's administration, which is to be
formed in the near future, to join in the Chinese side of the JLG
as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side is ready to continue the positive and
practical cooperation with the British side, to see the
compilation of the budget through, Chen added.
</P>
<P>
He expects that the budget will be a prudent and steady one
which accords with the Basic Law, and will leave a broad space for
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to draft the
next budget.
</P>
<P>
Consensus that has been achieved on both aspects of the budget
after so many meetings has yet to be turned into concrete data in
the budget, Kwong Ki-chi, Hong Kong secretary of treasury and also
British representative on the JLG, said.
</P>
<P>
The next meeting is scheduled for January 23 and 24.

</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Machinery and Electrical Share-Holding
Corporation, the other company, scored 23 billion yuan in sales
and 600 million US dollars in exports last year.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established Shanghai Electric Products Manufacturing
Group will give top priority to environmental protection of power
stations, petrochemical machinery, and the production of
refrigeration vehicles and subway cars.
</P>
<P>
The new company, with 260 subsidiaries and gross assets of 35
billion yuan, aims to become the country's largest equipment
manufacturer.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Soliciting More Help from China on Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is looking for closer co-operation
with China in its refugee work, the China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sadako Ogata, the UN high commissioner for refugees, is on her
second official visit to China to exchange "views on Indo-Chinese
refugees and other issues," the English language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
China and the UNHCR have co-operated closely since 1979, when
286,000 Vietnamese, Cambodian and Laotian refugees flocked across
the Chinese border, Ogata was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many of these people now work at 190 Chinese state-owned farms
and factories, but it is possible for some to plan to return to
their home countries, where the economies are picking up.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said the UNHCR and the Chinese government will jointly
conduct a survey to identify those people who wish to be
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the approximately 5,500 Vietnamese "boat people"
remaining in Hong Kong, Ogata said the UNHCR will continue to help
them return home within the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already asked the British Hong Kong
government several times to repatriate the Vietnamese before China
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Another 1,300 Vietnamese have been recognized as refugees, and
the UNHCR is trying to find a place to resettle them.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, about 15,100 people were repatriated from Hong Kong,
and two camps closed.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Bird Sets Feathers Flying in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- What scientists claim to be the
world's first bird has gone on show to the public for the first
time in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The feathered animal is believed to be the ancestor of all of
the world's birds.
</P>
<P>
It is the star attraction at a special exhibition in Beijing,
showing the fossils of a group of ancient birds, all living 142
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the Liaoning Bird, believed to be the
earliest bird on the planet, has been shown to the public at
China's ancient animal museum.
</P>
<P>
Some scientists have given the bird a scientific name,
"Sinosauropteryx", reflecting that it is the true ancestor of the
bird, instead of the archaeopteryx, discovered in mid-19th century
in Germany.
</P>
<P>
But some scientists still disagree with the idea, insisting
that it was merely a "warm-blooded dinosaur with feathers".
</P>
<P>
The fossils of the animal were discovered last year in
northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, being held until February, is expected to
become a hot spot for visitors in the cold winter, following a
grand exhibition on dinosaurs at the museum last year. That event
attracted large numbers of adults and children.

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Massive Offshore Oil Construction Program (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China's offshore oil industry
will be riding on the crest of a wave during 1997.
</P>
<P>
Work is to start during the year on 15 large-scale offshore oil
and gas fields and petrochemical projects, a three-fold increase
over 1996. The plans envisage five of them going into operation by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yan, president of the China National Offshore Oil
Corporation (CNOOC), told Xinhua in an interview today that the
projects include the Xijiang 24-1 and the Lufeng 22-1 oil fields
in the South China Sea, the J block of Suizhong 36-1 oil field and
Boxi oil field group in the Bohai Sea, as well as the Jinzhou 20-2
gas field in the Bohai Sea's Liaodong Bay.
</P>
<P>
Petrochemical schemes include the Huizhou ethylene project,
costing four billion US dollars, with an expected annual
production capacity of 600,000 tons.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Launch Massive Offshore Oil Construction Program (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The offshore oil and gas outputs exceeded 15 million tons and
three billion cubic meters in 1996, representing respective
increases of 81 percent and seven times over 1995. The offshore
crude currently accounts for one tenth of the country's total oil
output.
</P>
<P>
The authoritative source expects the offshore crude output to
hit 16 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC president said that China is enjoying a faster
offshore oil development than most countries. It took the United
States and the former Soviet Union 20 years or more to develop
their offshore oil output to 15 million tons. While in contrast,
China has achieved the same progress in only 14 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a huge potential remains to be
tapped for the country's offshore oil production. China has so far
proven geological offshore oil reserves of 1.3 billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has recently discovered a group of large
offshore oil and gas fields, including the 32-6 oil field in Bohai
Bay with geological oil reserve of 200 million tons, the Nanbao
35-2 oil field in Bohai Sea with expected geological oil reserve
of 100 million tons, as well as one gas field in the Yinggehai Sea
with geological gas reserve of 50 billion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
This will provide reliable guarantees for the country's
sustainable offshore oil development in coming years, the official
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC source said that China's offshore oil industry has
greatly benefited from large-scale Sino-foreign cooperation. China
has signed 126 oil contracts with 65 oil companies from 18
countries and regions, absorbing direct foreign investment of
nearly six billion US dollars, which accounted for 60 percent of
the country's total investment in the offshore oil sector.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tim Henman reached
the men's final when he defeated top seed Goran Ivanisevic Friday
in the Sydney International tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
Henman scored a 4-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1 victory in his semifinal
match. The Briton's ability to overturn Ivanisevic hung on five
break points that the frustrated Croatian failed to convert late
in the second set.
</P>
<P>
In the final set, Ivanisevic offered only token resistance.
</P>
<P>
In another upset, Jennifer Capriati of the United States came
backe to edge fourth-seeded Lindsay Davenport, also from the
United States, 2-6, 6-4, 6-2 to claim the women's final.
</P>
<P>
A revitalized Capriati emerged victorious from the battle
between the 1992 Olympic gold medalist and Davenport, the 1996
Atlanta winner, but it was Davenport who held the early advantage,
leading by a set and 3-1.

<P>
BELGRADE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Janez Drnovsek narrowly won the
re-election today to serve as Slovenia's prime minister, according
to reports from the Central European nation's capital of Ljubljana.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek won 46 of the 90 seats at the parliament in the
election today, with 44 legislature members voting against him,
thus ending a two-month political uncertainty in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the parliamentary election on November 10 last year,
Drnovsek's Liberal Democrats emerged as the strongest single party
by winning 25 seats and the support of other 20 deputies.
</P>
<P>
But his rivals, from the People's Party, the Social Democratic
Party and the Christian Democratic Party, controlled the same
number of seats in the republic's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the premiership was undecided until Wednesday,
when a deputy defected from one of the rival factions and joined
the Liberal Democrats, making Drnovsek's re-election possible.

DHAKA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's dismissed chief of
army staff Lieutenant general Abu Saleh Mohammad Nasim has been
awarded premature (compulsory) retirement from the service of the
army.
</P>
<P>
Nasim and some other army officers were dismissed from the
service of the army with effect from June 14, 1996 by the then
president Abdul Rahman Biswas who was in charge of the Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president, who took power from the nomination of the
ex-ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) which is now in
opposition, alleged that the dismissed army officers had organized
a "foiled mutiny" against the then caretaker government on May 20
following the failure of "conspiracy" of involvement in politics
by supporting the then opposition Awami League which is now the
ruling party.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources today, six other dismissed army
officers including two major generals and four brigadiers were
also granted the premature retirement.

<HEADLINE> G-77 to Play Important Role on International Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 (G-77), in a
process of transformation, will play a positive and important
role in international forum, Costa Rican Foreign Minister Fernando
Naranjo said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Some time ago some people considered that the G-77 had ceased
to be important in today's world. However, our estimation is that
the G-77 is in a process of transformation," said the minister of
Costa Rica, which is serving as one-year presidency of the group
with 132 developing country members.
</P>
<P>
"The guidelines for a positive G-77 agenda, facing the
challenges the underdeveloped countries are going through, will
come out of San Jose where G-77 members will meet in January
13-15," he said.
</P>
<P>
"All of us have, in some degree, the same problems. What
matters is to find an answer to the challenges of globalization,
how to face the economic integration processes, how to take
advantage of the opportunities presented by the industrial world,
how to strengthen the member countries themselves through trade,
investments and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The South-South forum will be attended by some 200 delegates
from 108 countries of the its 132 members. Costa Rica's presidency
of the group ends with this meeting, and the mandate will be
passed to Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to Naranjo, in past decades the third world countries
looked up to the North as their last resource. The opportunities
they sought were to enter the European, United States, or Japanese
markets.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that with this new agenda we can do a lot with each
other," he added.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo quoted the rapprochement between the Central American
countries and the South American Common Market as an example of
the integration process between the nations of the South that
could be followed suit by the third world countries.

KATHMANDU, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Finnish government has
agreed to provide about 16.8 million U.S. dollars as grant
assistance to Nepal for two electric power development projects,
according to the Nepali Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The first project, with a cost of some 15.3 million dollars,

The two hydropower stations, respectively located in eastern
and northern Nepal, are expected to be completed by 2000 with a
total generating capacity of 96 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Under the second project supported by the Finnish grant, about
1.5 million dollars will be used for environment improvement work

<HEADLINE> Breakaway Faction Back to India's Congress Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress Party
President Sitaram Kesri Thursday readmitted leaders of a breakaway
faction along with their supporters into the party, the newspaper
National Herald said today.
</P>
<P>
The faction, led by veteran Congress Party leaders N.D. Tiwari
and Arjun Singh under the name of All India Indira Congress or
Congress (Tiwari), was split from the parent body on May 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tiwari and Singh deserted the party due to their serious
differences with then Congress Party leader P.V. Narasimha Rao.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Congress Party spokesman V.N. Gadgil
said Tiwari and Singh were readmitted as individual members and
not as a party.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that there was "no merger" of Congress (Tiwari) as
it had never been recognized at least as an equal or as a party by
the parent organization.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the status of the two leaders in the party, Gadgil
said they would be active members of the party.
</P>
<P>
The admission of Congress (Tiwari) leaders into the party comes
about one month after they announced "integration" of their
faction with the parent body on December 11.
</P>
<P>
Congress Party President Kesri, who is striving for the unity
and revival of the 111-year-old party, has not been so eager to
readmit Tiwari and Singh in view of possible threats to his
position in the party.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Factions Meet in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of two
feuding Kurdish factions from northern Iraq met today at the
U.S. State Department to discuss possibilities of a meeting between
their leaders.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau met the representatives of
the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK).
</P>
<P>
British and Turkish diplomats also attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Burns told reporters that the consultations went well, but it
remained to be seen whether KDP leader Massoud Barzani and PUK
leader Jalal Talabani would hold a face-to-face meeting in Turkey
next month.
</P>
<P>
"There are preliminary negotiations to try to make sure that we
can contribute to stability in northern Iraq ... and make sure
that Saddam's influence is severely limited and promote some kind
of a reconciliation between these two Kurdish groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bloody clashes broke out last August between KDP and PUK,
backed respectively by Iraq and Iran. More than 100 people died in
the fightings.
</P>
<P>
At request of KDP leader Barzani, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein sent troops to PUK-controlled areas and attacked Irbil,
the main city in the "no-fly" zone imposed by Western allies in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's military movement immediately triggered punitive missile
attacks from the United States in early September.

in Central Thailand, while three senior police officers were
wounded, the local press reported today.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The rescued crew members of the
capsized Russian oil tanker, Nakhodka, returned home from Japan
today, seven days after their vessel sank in the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov, the spokesman for the Russian Foreign
Ministry, thanked Japan for its rescue work of the crew members
today, while Russian President Boris Yeltsin expressed his
gratitude in a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.

the Oki Islands in Shimane Prefecture, western Japan, last
Thursday.

oil slicks with one of them three kilometers wide and 53
kilometers long.
</P>

<P>
LIMA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Ecuador have agreed to
meet on February 17 in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia to start
discussing pending impasses concerning their border dispute,
Peruvian acting Foreign Minister Jorge Gonzalez Izquierdo said
today.
</P>
<P>
Gonzalez Izquierdo told a press conference that the meeting,
divided into two stages, will fall on the second anniversary of
the Itamaraty Peace Declaration, signed by both sides in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign ministries of both countries will
inaugurate the meeting, after which two negotiating commissions
will tackle the matter at a technical level.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, who is still held
hostage by the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement guerrillas at
the Japanese ambassador's residence in Peru, is expected to attend
this meeting, he said, because the Peruvian government believed
that the hostage crisis will have been solved by that time.
</P>
<P>
It is also reported that before the meeting, Ecuadoran
President Abdala Bucaram will visit Peru from February 13 to 15.
</P>
<P>
Border disputes have occurred continually between Peru and
Ecuador, two former colonies of Spain, since they won independence
in early nineteenth century. A border war broke out last January,
killing and injuring several hundred people.
</P>
<P>
Last February, the two countries signed the Itamaraty Peace
Declaration in Brasilia, agreeing to resort to direct dialogues
and negotiations to solve the border dispute. The forthcoming

<P>
URUMQI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region is to raise 200 million yuan (24.1 million
U.S. dollars) to build a state-level holiday and tourism zone in
the suburbs of regional capital Urumqi this year.
</P>
<P>
According to local tourism officials, the autonomous region
will also spend six million yuan building more dry-land toilets
and another six million yuan buying two motorized sleepers for the
construction of a tourist reception station at Tazhong Oilfield in
the Taklimakan Desert.
</P>
<P>
It also invest heavily in improving the conditions of many
existing hotels, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Xinjiang has 116 hotels authorized to receive
overseas tourists, including 40 star-rated hotels.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the autonomous region plans to
receive 6.23 million tourists this year, including 230,000
overseas tourists, and will earn 188 million U.S. dollars from
tourism.
</P>
<P>
To realize the goal, the autonomous region has accelerated
construction of major communications facilities, which include the
283-kilometer-long Turpan-Urumqi highway. The highway will cost
2.28 billion yuan (275 million U.S. dollars), with the World Bank
covering 150 million U.S. dollars. It is scheduled to be opened in
September, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Air services have been improving in the remote Chinese
region. So far the autonomous region operates 50 domestic,
overseas and regional air routes. Chartered air flights linking
Urumqi with southeast Asian cities are also being operated by
Malaysian Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
Local officials pledged that they would combine Xinjiang's
unique natural scenery, cultural relics and historical sites,
local customs and folk customs. They said they will create new
tourist products, and will build a tourist network with Urumqi as

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Makes Progress in Military Demobilization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STUNG CHRAL, Cambodia, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia has
achieved significant progress in demobilizing military servicemen,
but the work has been hindered by lack of fund, a high ranking
officer of the Royal Cambodia Armed Forces said here today.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of a military development center at
Stung Chral, about 100 kilometers southwest of the capital Phnom
Penh, Deputy Chief of Staff General Ly Seng Hong said 430,000
servicemen across Cambodia would be decommissioned in three years.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-year plan and in the first two stages of this
year, some 11,500 soldiers will retire, said the general.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the development center at Stung Chral, opened in
August 1994 with an initial fund of 700 U.S. dollars to accept
decommissioned servicemen, had trained some 500 retired soldiers
to become teachers in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ly Seng Hong said, the Headquarters of the General
Staff had provided nearly 1 million dollars to develop the center,
which has set aside 8,000 hectares of land for new decommissioned
soldiers with half hectare for each.
</P>
<P>
In addition, farms, workshops for weaving and brick-making, a
primary school and family houses had been set up at the facility,
with a long-term goal to accommodate some 100,000 decommissioned
servicemen with 10,000 houses, one college, nine schools, nine
clinics and one hospital with 250 beds, Ly added.
</P>
<P>
The general said the center had been developing largely on a
self-supply basis but it was now facing a 280,000-dollar deficit,
therefore needed more financial assistance and investment there to
carry out the demobilization plan.
</P>
<P>
Ly said the World Bank and the Royal Government recently
pledged to provide 60 million and 10 million dollars respectively
for the demobilization project.

<HEADLINE> Poland's Trade Deficit Hit $11-12 Billion in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Poland's trade deficit, along
with the sharp reduction of exports, reached 11-12 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, double that of the previous year, according
to the statistics issued by the Ministry of Economy.
</P>
<P>
The total trade volume last year stood at 60 billion dollars, a
rise of 9 billion over the year earlier. Out of the number,
exports grew 7-8 percent while imports soared 26 percent. Imports
outstripped exports by 11-12 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the increased deficit to the depressed
markets in European Union countries, which cut their imports of
Poland's raw materials and processed goods.
</P>
<P>
However, the statistics show that Poland's trade ties with the
republics of the former Soviet Union have improved in 1996,
winning a long-delayed balance between imports and exports since
1990.

<HEADLINE> Regional Leaders to Meet Nicaraguan President at Inauguration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Central American leaders will
join Arnoldo Aleman, Nicaragua's president-elect, at the latter's
inauguration ceremony scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
Presidents of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras
have planned the trip to Managua as a show of regional unity,
Costa Rican Foreign Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Aleman will take office Friday for a five-year term, succeeding
outgoing President Violeta Chamorro.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres today arrived in
Nicaragua with Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo, congratulating
Aleman being elected president.
</P>
<P>
Though the Costa Rican and Honduran governments adopt liberal
political agendas, opposite to those of Nicaragua, Guatemala and
El Salvador, all of them share similar economic policies, such as
reduction of the government role in economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Naranjo said Costa Rica would be benefited if Nicaragua
could achieve its economic development and solve problems of
poverty and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Nicaragua owes debts to every nation in the Central American
region, and its total to Costa Rica currently stand at 350 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 Nicaraguans, most of them illegal immigrants, live
and work in Costa Rica to flee the unemployment crisis at their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of the Central American Monetary Council,
the countries in the region are seeking a joint solution to the
debt issue of Nicaragua.

URUMQI, January 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 6,000 families in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have moved into
newly-built apartments constructed as part of the nationwide
"comfortable housing" project.
</P>
<P>
The program is a key move by the Chinese government to solve
housing shortage faced by low and moderate-income families. Under
the program, which was launched in 1995, governments at various
levels will reduce taxes and construction costs to build the
apartments, which will be sold to needy families at production
cost.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the autonomous region has so far
spent 525 million yuan on the project and has completed and sold
apartments with a combined floor space of more than 400,000 sq m.
</P>
<P>
Six cities in the region have been authorized by the state to
carry out the program. the central government has also earmarked
175 million yuan over the past two consecutive years for the
implementation of the project in these cities to be used in tandem
with the regional government's investment.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan's Data Telecom Development in High Gear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics from
Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications show that the city of
Wuhan, capital of Central China's Hubei Province, has signed up
more than 2,140 data telecommunications users, ranking fourth
among Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based "China Electronics News" said that in 1996
alone, the telecommunications bureau of Wuhan recruited more than
1,500 subscribers of the data telecommunications service, eight
times the figure of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the fields of finance and security trading,
Wuhan's data telecommunications service has expanded its coverage
to schools, hospitals and airline ticket centers.
</P>
<P>
Industrial analysts say that such quick development should be
attributed to the service's high safety, transmission speed, and
large handling capacity for information.
</P>
<P>
At present, Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin are the top three
data telecom consumers in terms of their subtransmission speed and
large handling capacity for information.

JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of people
contracting HIV/AIDS in Indonesia could reach more than one
million by the year 2000 if the authority acts recklessly, a

</P>
<P>

<P>
According to the latest official figure, the number of people
across the country who tested positive to the human

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Inflation Rate Reaches 300 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Inflation in Bulgaria reached
310.8 percent in 1996, the highest since 1990, the official
Bulgarian Telegraph Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate, up to 10 times higher than those of
other Central and Eastern European nations, led to sharp increases
in the prices of commodities and services last year.
</P>
<P>
The prices of food and housing shot up by 301.7 percent and
233.6 percent respectively, said the report quoting latest figures
released by the country's State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The high inflation was attributed by some Bulgarian economists
to the unchecked economic crisis, the political instability and
the delay in implementing a monetary reform program last year.
</P>
<P>
Some statistics experts said that the inflation rate of 1997,
on an annual basis, would be at least 150 percent, with gross
domestic product (GDP) down by at least 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, in some other economists' view, the inflation could be
brought down to around 70 percent if the government took effective
measures to turn businesses into profitable operations.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Targets NATO Expansion As Germany's Top Goal in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 9 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today
stressed that the eastwards expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) tops Germany's diplomatic agenda in 1997.
</P>
<P>
At a New Year reception here, Kohl said that he hoped the NATO
summit conference to be held in Madrid in July will serve as "an
important milestone" for NATO's eastwards expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said that the German government would do its best to give
Russia "rational interest compensation", which would help
strengthen mutual trust, saying that he would telephone Russian
President Boris Yeltsin again over the NATO expansion issue, and
that he believed NATO could reach consensus with Russia on this
issue.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the European Union summit conference to be held in
Amsterdam in June as of equal importance with NATO expansion, Kohl
promised to offer "boundless support" to the EU reform.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that the U.S. is the major middle East peace
mediator, Kohl said, Europe should contribute its bits to the
peace in the region, adding that Germany has done quite a lot in
promoting peace process there in the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Kohl held talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin last week
in Moscow, where he stressed again that nobody could veto NATO's
eastwards expansion.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto: Stances of Indonesia, Japan Not Always Same </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said Indonesia and Japan may sometimes be in disagreement on
certain issues but when this happened it was because of their own
national interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet Thursday night in honor of visiting
Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, Soeharto said, "As
sovereign countries, our stances are not always the same due to
our respective national interests."
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the two countries had always done their best
to promote partnership. Their awareness of the importance of
partnership was a strong foundation for long-term cooperation, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
"The thrust of out bilateral ties which are imbued with the
partnership spirit is in long-term rather than in short-term
interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Japan so far had shown mutual understanding for
each other's needs and worked toward closer cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto also expressed gratitude to the Japanese government
and people for their assistance and support which had contributed
to Indonesia's national development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hashimoto, who arrived here Thursday for a three-day
visit, said his government was determined to enhance the existing
good bilateral relations with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to give assurance that we intend to do
everything to help Indonesia realize its national development
goals," Hashimoto said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was exactly during this period of transformation
that the two countries needed to "join hands to work for stability
and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the third leg of Hashimoto's eight-day tour of
five Southeast Asian countries which also includes Brunei,
Malaysia, Vietnam and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto and Hashimoto are scheduled to hold bilateral talks
Friday morning.

<HEADLINE> Four Missing After Snowstorm Hits Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Four people remained missing in
Altay Prefecture after heavy snowstorms in northwestern Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a prefecture official as saying that about 10
people died, and four are severely injured as a result of the
storms. Of 29 people initially reported missing, 25 have been
found,
</P>
<P>
About 985 people were trapped in mountainous areas after the
heaviest snow in 30 years. Most were prepared with stocks of food,
water and clothing because they are miners in the area.
</P>
<P>
However, about 200 face serious food shortages.
</P>
<P>
The military post in Xinjiang is sending food, clothing and
other relief items by helicopter, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Transportation, telecommunications and power generation have
been out for about a week, but power supply had resumed in the
prefecture's cities by yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture is working to restore power in other areas.
</P>
<P>
Government departments have been clearing snow from roads for five
days.
</P>
<P>
The paper also said that the storm also killed about 5,000 farm
animals. It demolished 186 homes and buried 1,267 cattle and sheep
pens. After 532 cave-ins, 580,000 farm animals were left without
food and shelter.
</P>
<P>
However, residents stored sufficient straw, maize, beans and
food for livestock, so the animals are expected to survive the
storm.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- China plans to train more
scientific researchers and technicians this year in a bid to
promote the development of water conservancy projects, according
to Minister of Water Resources Niu Maosheng.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has set 1997 as a "Year of Water Talents" and
decided to make big strides in training more senior water experts
to play a key role in energizing construction of water
conservancy, one of the country's economic infrastructure
priorities, Niu said.
</P>
<P>
"About 50 senior water experts were scheduled to be trained as
the world's best with 100 others as domestic senior experts, and
another 500 others as supporting experts," a report in today's
"China Daily" also quoted vice minister Zhu Dengquan as saying.
</P>
<P>
A group of young Chinese water experts, chosen from 30,000
scientific researchers, attended a national conference held here
Thursday, on which ten of them were awarded the titles of China's
"Young Scientific and Technological Elites" for distinguished
achievements.
</P>
<P>
The top ten experts, averaging 35 years of age, have engaged in
more than 100 key water-related scientific research and
technological transformations set by the country and the ministry,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Niu urged the young water experts to focus on the study of key
water-related issues, including flood-control and harnessing
China's largest rivers, water-saving irrigation, the sustainable
utilization and the protection of water resources in arid areas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, China has spent 137 million yuan (16.5
million US dollars) in water-related scientific research and
education. The investment is expected to be increased this year,
Niu said.

<P>
BEIJING, January 10 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese national diving
team which won three gold medals out of the four at stake at the
Atlanta Olympic Games is to be disbanded, a Chinese sports
official announced here late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese diving team will be officially disbanded on
January 15," said Guo Qinglong, vice chairman of the Chinese
Swimming Association (CSA), China's ruling body for both swimming
and diving.
</P>
<P>
The decision means that China will abandon the central training
system and turn to the short-term training camp for the
preparation of the world and international competitions, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
"It's the decision of the Chinese Physical Culture and Sports
Commission," said the CSA vice chairman. "Divers and coaches on
the national team will return to provincial squads where they came
from."
</P>
<P>
National diving team members will represent their provinces or
cities in the China's Eighth National Games to be held in Shanghai
in October, according to Guo.
</P>
<P>
The CSA and the Chinese Physical Culture and Sports Commission
have yet to decide the date to recall, as well as the way to
select, Chinese divers for this year's international competitions,

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Trade Surplus to Decline in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's trade surplus will
diminish this year with a moderate deficit to emerge in its
current account, analysts of a financial group said today.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the current account deficit will be
covered with the input of direct foreign investment, which will
permit a more healthy financing.
</P>
<P>
They said the direct foreign investment in the country
stood at 4.712 billion U.S. dollars between January and September
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The rescheduling of the short-term foreign debts led to the

<HEADLINE> City Squares Add Color in Dalian People's Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 10 (Xinhua) -- Arctic temperatures and a cold
sea wind have failed to freeze the enthusiasm among people in
Dalian for the city's famous squares.
</P>
<P>
They flock in their thousands to the squares during the
evenings and at weekends to enjoy singing, dancing, talking - or
just watching.
</P>
<P>
Zhongshan Square is a typical venue for leisure seekers in the
northeast China's port city, despite the sub-zero level on the
thermometers.
</P>
<P>
Local residents head to the square from neighboring blocks to
listen to music, dance, skate and practise English.
</P>
<P>
Foreign tourists are also often seen in the square, admiring
the scenery and talking with joy.
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen such a beautiful square," said a 60-year-old
Japanese tourist, strolling across the square.
</P>
<P>
In Dalian there are several large squares like this as well as
numerous small squares. Architects call them the "living rooms" of
city dwellers.
</P>
<P>
Each square has something special to attract visitors.
</P>
<P>
Zhongshan is known for its pleasant music, Renmin Square can
accommodate big activities with its wide space, and Youhao Square
has distinctive structures.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists believe that the squares help relieve people's
stress in modern life by providing them a place to escape from
tedious work, observe nature, and make friends with each other.
</P>
<P>
A series of activities, with the theme of "Green Melody" were
held in Zhongshan, Renmin and other squares last summer.
Thousands of residents enjoyed concerts, balls and family reading
evenings.
</P>
<P>
Dashi Art Group and Lushun Longwangtang Chorus, both famous
farmers' art troupes, have given performances in the city's
squares.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners, working and studying in China, also contributed
their artistic talents to entertain the people in squares. In the
evenings there are pop songs from Japanese students, short dramas
played by British experts, and Huangmei Opera by American
students, all winning warm applause from Chinese audiences.
</P>
<P>
"I feel that people from various places can get close here,
because we are all taken to be true, the good and the beautiful,
and are willing to make others happy," said a university student.
</P>
<P>
The student says she likes the atmosphere in the squares, and
often spends her evenings and weekends in the squares.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Party Sues Daily for Disinformation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav United Left (JUL)
spokesman Ivan Markovic said today that his party decided to sue a
Belgrade daily which claimed that the bombing attack on the JUL
headquarters was organized by the party itself.
</P>
<P>
Markovic, who is also a member of the JUL leadership, said the
JUL had demanded that the public procurator invoke all measures
regarding articles "aimed at marring the reputation of state
organs and legal social organizations and individuals."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an article published today by the Belgrade
daily Dnevni Telegraf which said the bombing attack on the JUL
headquarters Monday evening was organized by the JUL headquarters
secretary.
</P>
<P>
An explosive device was hurled into the JUL Directorate
building Monday night, causing substantial material damage but no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
"The newspaper's disinformation on the bombing had caused the
JUL leadership to sue the paper," the official Tanjug news agency
quoted Markovic as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said each call by the opposition Zajedno coalition for the
use of bombs, guns and metal poles is followed by a terrorist
attack. He warned that this is the fifth in a series of attacks
with explosive devices on facilities of left-wing democratic and
progressive forces.
</P>
<P>
The planned terrorist acts aim to topple the constitutional
order and the legally elected institutions, Markovic said, adding
that the organizer of these "acts of violence is a part of the
opposition which is dissatisfied with the results of the
elections, and is financially and politically aided from abroad."
</P>
<P>
The Zajedno coalition has been organizing daily demonstrations
over the past 52 days in Belgrade and other cities in Serbia after
the November 17 election results were canceled by the government,
triggering a political crisis in Serbia. The opposition leaders
said the demonstrations would not stop until the elections results
were recognized and the media and judiciary were freed in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the anti-government protest continued today in
Belgrade, with students and civilians marching through streets and
pedestrian malls. There were no conflicts between protesters and
police.

<HEADLINE> Ashrawi Calls on US to Give Fresh Push to Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Education
Minister Hanan Ashrawi said today that the new Clinton
administration should give a fresh push to the slow-moving Middle
East peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the National Association of Arab-Americans in
Washington D.C., Ashrawi said, "We feel that with this new
administration, the peace process should be not just at the top of
the agenda, but there should be higher level active involvement."
</P>
<P>
The former spokeswoman for Palestinian negotiators said that
the key issues on the peace process "must not be left to third and
fourth level decision makers," indicating she was not satisfied
with current U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, a senior aide to
Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
"Given the fact that there is a new secretary of state, we are
hoping that American policy... will try to work out mechanisms of
participation in a way that would bring the parties to comply"
with past agreements between the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Christopher will be replaced by Madeleine Albright on January
20 as secretary of state if she was confirmed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
At a confirmation hearing held by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Wednesday, Albright only said a Hebron agreement was
critical for the Middle East peace process and no more.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi called on the Clinton administration to revitalize the
peace talks between the Israelis and Palestinians, which appear to
be dragging on to a stop as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has asked for postponing for one year more the
implementation of pullout of Israeli troops in the rural areas of
the West Bank. And Ross has asked Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
to compromise with Netanyahu on his suggestion. But Arafat
rejected the compromise, demanding that they stick to the 1995
accord, as agreed by the former Labor government.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that (U.S.) decision making has to be at the highest
level of foreign policy as well as the executive level, and should
not be left to the level of mediators or the peace team," Ashrawi
said.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said Israeli policies were creating a "pressure cooker
effect" among Palestinians. She urged all parties to view this
situation with the utmost seriousness and bring Israel to its
senses.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, it will be plunging us back into a cycle of
confrontation and conflict," she said.

<HEADLINE> US Says NATO to Expand Even Without Charter With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
said today that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will
announce its expansion plans this summer even if a NATO-Russia
charter for cooperation has not been worked out.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana met today with U.S.
President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Secretary of
Defense William Perry and Secretary of State Warren Christopher in
preparation for talks on the charter in Moscow beginning January
19.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said the Clinton
administration wants to give its view of details that should be
addressed in the "special relationship" between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
NATO leaders are expected to announce admittance for Poland,
Hungary and the Czech Republic at a summit in Madrid on July 8.
Burns said that announcement will be made even if Russia drags its
feet on agreeing to the charter.
</P>
<P>
Burns said, "Even if these negotiations can't be fruitful, we
will continue with the NATO summit in Madrid and announce which
new members will be admitted."
</P>
<P>
Russia strongly opposes NATO's eastward expansion to include
former Warsaw Pact nations, fearing that it would pose threat to
its national security.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said that Russia wants a conventional arms treaty rewritten to
keep NATO forces away from its borders and a guarantee that
nuclear weapons will not be deployed on the territory of new
alliance members from the former Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that if NATO and Russia can agree on these
conditions, as well as on a mechanism giving Moscow a say on
matters that concern it "and on several other questions, then we
will sign the corresponding document."

</P>
<P>
The second tranche for 500 million Czech koruna (18.5 million

<HEADLINE> Immigrants Bring New Life to New York City: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Legal immigrants, who are
making New York City their home at a rate unmatched since World
War Two, have helped drive the economy and bring new life to New
York City, the City Planning Department said in a report released
today.
</P>
<P>
Legal immigration into New York averaged 113,000 people each
year between 1990 and 1994, up from 86,000 in the 1980s and 78,000
in the 1970s, a jump of more than 30 percent compared to the
1980s, the report showed.
</P>
<P>
The big increase was prompted by a tide of new arrivals from
the former Soviet Union and the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
With new immigrants arriving in New York at a rapid rate, the
city is becoming more racially and ethnically diverse, the report
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"The effect of immigration into the city is to revitalize the
city and make it grow," Mayor of New York Rudolph Giuliani said.
"New York City is going through an economic revival right now...
and immigration plays a big role in that."

<HEADLINE> Dow Returns to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rallied with
bonds today, pushing the Dow Jones industrial average to a new
high, amid news that inflation has remained tame despite the
recent flurry of robust economic data.
</P>
<P>
The Dow ended with a gain of 76.19 at 6,625.67, erasing
Wednesday's 51-point slide and beating Tuesday's record finish at
6,600.66.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 12-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume reaching 554.12
million shares, compared with 556.57 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 6.44 to 754.85, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 3.33 to 398.58, just shy of
November 25's record close at 398.86.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.95 to 1,326.30, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.01 to 576.72.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 list of smaller companies, which has lagged the
blue-chip sector's rebound from last summer's steep selloff, rose
1.42 to 365.59, closing at a record high for the first time since
May 22.
</P>
<P>
But in a sharp contrast to the day's enthusiasm about
inflation, the Dow's advance was led by its oil-related
components, which benefited from the recent spike in energy
prices.
</P>
<P>
Stocks continued to be influenced by bonds, which recovered
Wednesday's losses after the Labor Department reported that
although wholesale prices shot up 0.5 percent in December, the
increase measured just 0.1 percent when the volatile food and
energy sectors are excluded.
</P>
<P>
The long-bond yield had risen sharply since early last week.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose today, the yield on the 30-year Treasury
bond fell from late Wednesday's 6.84 percent, the highest level
since late October, to 6.75 percent.

BRUSSELS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch electronic concern
Philips announced today the formation of a new group in the United
States dedicated to the development and marketing of personal

</P>
<P>
Called Philips Consumer Communications - Americas, the group

<P>
The new group is making its first product introductions at the

<HEADLINE> Belgian Police Raid Over 60 Homes in Porno Swoop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Belgian police involved in a
major search for child pornography raided today more than 60 homes
across the country, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the mass search action was taken on the basis
of a lists of addresses made up from information from British and
French mail-order companies. The firms have passed on their client
lists to the Belgian police.
</P>
<P>
The police did not let out anything about the results of the
operation, but it was known that child porno had been found in
some houses.
</P>
<P>
Possession of child porno is illegal in Belgium. The country
wants to make it also punishable in the whole European Union, and
the proposal was objected by Denmark and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has been embroiled in a child abuse scandal since last
August after the discovery of two girls in a dungeon at a home of
rapist Marc Dutroux. Four girls' bodies were later found.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Vice Chairman: Economy Not Overheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of the U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) Alice Rivlin has said that the U.S. economy
is not expanding too quickly and inflation does not pose a problem
going into the new year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the U.S. Mortgage Bankers Association in New York
Wednesday night, she said that there are "no clear signs of
overheating or a serious imbalance, and just about everyone
believes that that will continue into 1997," according to an AP
report today.
</P>
<P>
She portrayed the U.S. economy as in a "Goldilocks" phase of
"low unemployment and non-accelerating inflation." The Goldilocks
term has been used to describe the economy as neither too hot nor
too cold, but just right, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating mortgage bankers' questions about the future
direction of interest rates, she said, "All I can promise from the
Fed is that we will be vigilant and we will pay attention."
</P>
<P>
Rivlin also said that the U.S. government's Consumer Price
Index does overstate inflation, but the Fed does not know by how
much.
</P>
<P>
She said that the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Labor
Department, which compiles the index, should be given the tools to
redo the measure over five years.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks on the economy may help ease jitters in the
financial markets where some investors are worried the economy may
be expanding too quickly. Some fear the U.S. Fed might be tempted
to clamp down on potential inflation by tightening interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government's statistics released recently showed that
the U.S. economy was expanding faster than expected in the final
quarter of 1996 and some analysts have raised their forecast of
the increase for the last three months.
</P>
<P>
The Fed's Open Market Committee, the U.S. Fed's policy-maker,
is scheduled to meet on February 4 and 5, the first policy-making
meeting this year. The meeting is important because it sets the
monetary policy for the year.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Guatemala to Abandon Wrong Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun today urged Guatemala again to abandon its wrong position
and observe the United Nations Charter and relevant resolutions to
remove the barriers to Sino-Guatemalan cooperation in the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said that the Chinese permanent representative
to the United Nations elaborated China's position when the
Security Council held consultations on Guatemala today.
</P>
<P>
Before the government of Guatemala and the Unidad
Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca (URNG) signed the final peace
agreement on December 29, 1996, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the then UN
secretary-general, had recommended that the strength of the United
Nations Mission for the Verification of Human Rights in Guatemala
be increased with 155 military observers and some medical
personnel.
</P>
<P>
Qin said that China has always supported the peace process of
Guatemala. The Chinese delegation has no objection to the draft
resolution itself on sending military observers to Guatemala. It
has no difference with the sponsors known as friends of the
Guatemalan peace process for the draft resolution either.
</P>
<P>
However, the actions of Guatemala in the UN have damaged the
basis of cooperation between China and Guatemala and created
barriers for China to support the draft resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation has reiterated that only if Guatemala
recognizes and adopts specific measures to correct its mistakes,
can the issue be solved.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Guatemalan mission to the United
Nations had told the president of the Security Council for
January, Japanese Ambassador Hisashi Owada, that Guatemala was
willing to show a gesture to the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
When talking on this question, the Chinese ambassador said that
it is regrettable that Guatemala has not made clear what mechanism
it will adopt, what content it will express and what commitment it
will make.
</P>
<P>
Now, it is up to Guatemala to adopt measures to correct its
mistakes, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala has supported splitting activities of authorities of
Taiwan, an inalienable part of China, thus damaging the basis for
Sino-Guatemalan cooperation in the United Nations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Toshiba Makes 4MB Version Storage Card </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 9 (Xinhua) -- Toshiba America Electronic
Components, Inc. (TAEC) today announced its latest generation of
the Solid State Floppy Disk Card (SSFDC) SmartMedia storage card.
</P>
<P>
The card provides four megabytes (MB) of storage capacity for a
wide range of portable electronics applications.
</P>
<P>
In a "digital film" application for digital cameras, the 4MB
card can store approximately 50 high resolution (640x480) images
or 190 low resolution images. Unlike conventional film, the card
can be erased and reused. Once it has reached capacity, the "roll
of digital film" can be downloaded onto a PC for storage or
manipulation and then erased.
</P>
<P>
The SSFDC SmartMedia card, available in a five volt version and
a 3.3 volt version, can be inserted into a direct connector on the
digital camera or used in conjunction with a PC Card adapter for
use with a PC Card slot. This makes data transfer about ten times
faster than using a serial port.
</P>
<P>
The 4MB card is easy to be upgraded. Currently in development
are an 8MB version as well as a preprogrammed 64MB serial mask
read only memory (ROM) version which can be used for game
cartridges, digital maps, GPS systems, language translators and
other solid state applications.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Officially Declared Winner After Electoral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress counted the
Electoral College votes today and officially declared Bill Clinton
and Al Gore were re-elected president and vice president
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Gore, who is also the president of the Senate, declared Clinton
and Gore the winners of the November 5 election after members of
the House and Senate, carrying out their constitutional duties,
counted the Electoral College votes at a joint session of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who carried 31 states and the District of Columbia,
got 379 electoral votes, Republican nominee Bob Dole won 19 states
and 159 electoral votes, and Reform Party candidate Ross Perot won
no states and no electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
The electors, chosen by their political parties to represent
their tickets in the election, met in state capitals on December
16 to cast their votes. The number of electors for each state
equals the state's representation in Congress.
</P>
<P>
Under the indirect U.S. election system, the electors from each
of the 50 states were chosen on November 5 when Americans voted
for slates pledged to either Democrats Clinton and Gore,
Republicans Bob Dole and Jack Kemp or any of the many other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 538 electors, with each state getting the
same number as represented in its congressional delegation plus
three for Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral College has had a profound effect on American
presidential politics. Under the winner-take-all system, a narrow
victory in a big state can translate into a crucial margin in the
electoral count.
</P>
<P>
In the November election, Clinton won 49.2 percent of the
popular vote but got about 70 percent of the electoral vote.
Although Dole won more than 40 percent of the popular vote, he got
only 30 percent of the electoral vote. And Perot was shut out
despite winning 8.5 percent of the popular vote.
</P>
<P>
An outgrowth of the Founding Fathers' distrust of direct
popular elections, the Electoral College is regarded by many as
arcane and unnecessary. Some lawmakers said the system was
outdated and sponsored a bill to abolish it.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be sworn in for a second term as president on the
inauguration day, January 20.
