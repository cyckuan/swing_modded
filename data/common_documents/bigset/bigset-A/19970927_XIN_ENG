<HEADLINE> Serb Receives Life Sentence in German Court for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A German court in Duesseldorf
today sentenced a 50-year-old Serb to life imprisonment on charges
of wartime genocide and murder in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Nikola Jorgic was found responsible for 11 counts of genocide
and 30 counts of murder. He led a group of paramilitary Cetnik
extremists in the Doboj area during the summer of 1992 which
played a major role in killing Moslems and driving them out of the
region.
</P>
<P>
Jorgic argued he was a victim of mistaken identity. His lawyers
vowed to appeal, saying a German court did not have the
jurisdiction to try him.
</P>
<P>
The court said that under international law national courts
could take up the war crimes case that was rejected by the
international court in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
In May this year a Bavarian court sentenced Bosnian Serb
Novislav Djajic to five years in prison. Another war crimes case
against a suspected Serbian war criminal is also pending in a
Duesseldorf court.

MADRID, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Laurent Jalabert won
the 20th stage of the Tour of Spain on Friday.

<P>
His win ended the hopes of a triumphant homecoming for Jose

<HEADLINE> NATO, Russia Hail Closer Security Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and Russia today hailed the beginning of a process
leading to a closer security partnership between them in the
post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
A NATO press release received here described the first meeting
of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council (PJC) foreign ministers
as underscoring the importance of the fundamental change in recent
NATO-Russia relations and underlining its significance in the
wider context of developing a new cooperative security system in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
At the first PJC ministerial meeting, held today in New York,
the foreign ministers, under the co-chairmanship of Russian
Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, Belgian Foreign Minister Erik
Derycke and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, approved a
detailed work program for the PJC until the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The program outlined a number of issues for consultations as
well as such practical cooperation activities as civil emergency
planning, projects in the scientific and environmental fields as
well as retraining of retired military personnel in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers agreed to meet again on December 17 to
continue the work begun in New York, by broadening the intensive
cooperation along the lines laid down in the NATO-Russia Founding
Act signed in Paris on May 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed issues of mutual concern such as the
situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. All stressed the importance of
NATO-Russia cooperation in the NATO-led Stabilization Force (SFOR)
and highly valued the experience gained so far from peacekeeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers expressed satisfaction, according to the
press release, about the way the municipal elections were held in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and reiterated that NATO and Russia, together
with other SFOR partners, are determined to continue their close
cooperation under the Dayton peace accord to help bring peace and
security to Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Bonn's Major Tax Reform Plan Abandoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
ambitious tax reform package has been finally abandoned after
negotiators of the government and the main opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) announced today that they have once again
failed to reach a compromise at the last round of talks.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform package, which would lead to an annual net tax
cut of 30 billion marks (17.6 billion US dollars), was hailed by
Kohl's government as "the tax reform of the century."
</P>
<P>
At a time of sluggish economic growth and record-high
unemployment, the reform was designed as the government's main
remedy to bolster business confidence, investment and hiring.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, however, has repeatedly rejected the reform package,
saying that it was socially unjust to fail to ease the tax burdens
on average income earners. It has also accused the government of
not being able to organize enough financing to make up for the
huge financial shortfall that would be induced by the tax reform.
</P>
<P>
After failing to pass the Bundesrat, upper house of parliament
where the SPD holds a majority, the tax reform plan was submitted
to a mediation panel comprising parliamentary members from both
the government and the SPD.
</P>
<P>
However, after two rounds of talks and a series of concessions
offered by the government, the two sides stilled failed to bridge
their deep differences on the plan.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the collapse of the mediation talks dashed
the chance of any serious tax reforms in Germany before the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference in Bonn today, German Finance Minister
Theo Waigel sharply criticized the SPD, saying that the tax reform
talks were sunk "by a pure party- and power-political strategy."
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Kohl today also warned that the failure of the talks
would exert a negative impact on Germany's competitiveness as a
production location.
</P>
<P>
German business and trade union organizations also poured their
anger at the government and the SPD, saying that they had wasted
the precious time of 4.3 million jobless people in the country.

BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- World number one Pete Sampras of
the United States defeated Jonas Bjorkman 7-6, 6-4 for a
semi-final berth at the Grand Slam Cup tennis tournament in
Munich, Germany on Friday.
</P>
<P>
American Sampras and Swede Bjorkman, likely to meet again when
their countries clash in the Davis Cup final in November in
Gothenburg, offered the most exciting match so far in the six-day
event which started on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Open semifinalist Bjorkman delighted the meagre crowd in
Munich's Olympic Hall with powerful groundstrokes and blistering
returns.
</P>
<P>
But he was let down by his serve when it mattered most,
double-faulting to allow Sampras to win a tense tie-break 8-6 and
wrap up the first set, then again to give the American a 2-1 lead
in the second set.
</P>
<P>
Sampras, who goes on to meet either Briton Greg Rusedski or
Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov for a place in Sunday's final, has
already made sure of a huge 925,000 U.S. dollars after winning
just two matches in this Bavarian city.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Open and Wimbledon champion has won 425,000
U.S. dollars for reaching the semifinals plus a 500,000
U.S. dollars bonus for having won two grand slams.

SEOUL, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Second Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) Ministerial Meeting on Human Resources
Development (HRD) ended here today after adopting a Joint
Statement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Ethiopian Foreign Ministers Talk on Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese and
Ethiopian foreign ministers talked about the bilateral ties and
ways to deal with African issues during their meeting here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen, China's vice-premier and foreign minister, told
Ethiopian Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin that both China and
Ethiopia have a long history and have staged dauntless struggles
against invasion.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit to Ethiopia by Chinese President Jiang Zemin
last year and the visit to Beijing by Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi in 1995 gave a forceful push to the bilateral
friendly relations.
</P>
<P>
China appreciated the active role of Ethiopia in promoting
national and regional stability, according to the Chinese
vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Qian also said that the affairs of Africa should be decided
upon by the African people themselves. China supports the
Organization of African Unity in its efforts for peace and
stability, and a unified economy in Africa. The external world
should support Africa in its development efforts, not interfere
its internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum echoed by saying that Ethiopia feels proud of having a
prolonged traditional friendship with China. It has been a firm
friend of China all the time, he said, adding that the development
and strength of China have greatly inspired developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has been consistent in its principle, which
has gained understanding and sympathy from the African people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of China's resumption of exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, Seyoum reaffirmed the stand of
Ethiopia of the "one China" policy.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged their views on other
international affairs.

<HEADLINE> EU to Stress Financial Services at ASEM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) is
to push for progress on financial services at the upcoming
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) of economic ministers to be held over
the weekend in Japan.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation union will also call for a speedy completion of a
blueprint for boosting investment between Europe and Asia, and
will urge economic ministers to start thinking constructively
about a new round of world trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, vice-president of EU's executive agency
European Commission, will attend the ASEM meeting at Makuhari near
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is the first for economic ministers from countries
taking part in the ASEM program that comprise the 15 EU countries,
the seven Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries
along with China, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The EU vice-president is also expected to appeal to ASEM
countries to submit improved offers in the World Trade
Organization negotiations on financial services in order to reach
a permanent agreement by December 12 this year.
</P>
<P>
Brittan believes that there is no direct link between the
present financial turbulence in Asian markets and the
liberalization of domestic financial markets in Asia.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he stressed, open financial markets will bring
the kind of financial stability that will encourage investors to
return to and stay in Asia's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The union hopes that the economic ministers will endorse an
investment plan designed to promote investment.
</P>
<P>
The investment plan is likely to include activities relating to
the regulatory and legal framework affecting the investment
climate and would propose a high-level dialogue on specific key
investment issues.
</P>
<P>
The union also hopes that the ASEM economic ministers meeting
will endorse the principles, objectives and priorities of a new
trade plan aimed at reducing non-tariff barriers to trade,
improving customs procedures, testing and certification, public
tendering and other potential obstacles.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Confirms Its Office Chief Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Amman office of the
anti-Israeli Palestinian militant group Hamas today confirmed
that its chief Khalid Mashiel was hospitalized after Thursday's
incident.
</P>
<P>
Under Jordan's King Hussein's order, Mashiel was sent to the
Hussein Medical City, a military hospital in Amman, several hours
after two Canadians attempted to kill him in front of his office
Thursday, Mohamad Nazal, representative of the Hamas office in
Amman, told Xinhua this evening.
</P>
<P>
Nazal explained that because the Hamas was a military
organization, the hospitalization of Mashiel had to be approved
by the king beforehand and be in a military hospital.
</P>
<P>
Mashiel suffered from headache and unstable body conditions
after the attack, so he needed urgent medical care, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government and the Hamas' Amman office
Thursday gave different versions of explanation about the
incident Mashiel encountered.
</P>
<P>
While the government insisted that it was only a quarrel
between Mashiel's driver and two Canadian tourists, the Hamas
said that it was an assassination attempt against Mashiel by
Israeli security departments.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawe told the press Thursday that Mashiel was not present at
the scene of the incident during the quarrel and Mashiel's driver
and the two Canadian tourists were all wounded.
</P>
<P>
A Hamas statement issued Thursday said the incident was an
assassination attempt against Mashiel and that the Israeli
security departments were behind it.
</P>
<P>
Mashiel's hospitalization and Thursday's incident happened
amid increasing Arab-Israeli tension here triggered by an
ambush against Israeli diplomats Monday around the Israeli
Embassy in Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Oppositions Call for End to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Angola's coalition of
oppositions, the Civil Opposition Party, today called for the
government and its opposition, National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to make efforts to end the peace
process as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Pinto Joao, head of the Civil Opposition Party, made the call
at a press conference here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Parties under the coalition were worried about present
military situation in Angola, he said, urging two signatory
parties of the peace accord to take up concrete measures for the
betterment of the national situation.
</P>
<P>
According to the coalition, the Angolan peace process is
facing a difficult time. It hopes that UNITA would disarm the
remainder of its forces and cooperate with the government in
re-establishing national authorities in all UNITA-occupied
regions.
</P>
<P>
The coalition also appealed to the Angolan government to
continue collecting weapons scattered among its citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Opposition Party also called for the international
community to strictly abide by its obligations and persuade
Angola's warring sides to carry out dialogue and resolve issues
through political means.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Opposition Party, the biggest opposition coalition
in Angola, comprises 14 opposition parties including the National
Liberation Front of Angola.

JOHANNESBURG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations

today, South African Press Association reported.

mandate of the United Nations, namely to promote peace and

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects US Demand for Settlement Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today rejected the demand by the United States
for a "time out" in Israel's settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Netanyahu dismissed the
U.S. criticism for his approval of building 300 homes in the Efrat
settlement in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Wednesday night
held a telephone conversation with Netanyahu several hours before
he announced the plan, but was not informed.
</P>
<P>
She said Thursday that the plan was "not at all helpful" to the
efforts to revive the peace process which has been deadlocked
since March when Israel began to build the controversial Har Homa
settlement in Arab East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want as
the capital of their future state.
</P>
<P>
She had requested Israel to suspend settlement activities
during her first trip to the Middle East two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"I think you don't see anyone suggesting that construction be
stopped in Arab communities which have natural growth as well, and
no one will realistically suggest freezing life." Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
He said the construction plan of the Efrat settlement was
approved by the previous government.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing unusual and unreasonable in our policy to
allow natural growth in areas that are as contiguous as possible
to existing constructions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Minister of Higher
Education Hanan Ashrawi said Thursday the plan was "a dangerously
irresponsible position, bordering on a policy of insanity that is
going to turn the whole region into another cycle of conflict and
violence."
</P>
<P>
PNA Cabinet Secretary Ahmed Abdul Rahman denounced the plan as
"a provocation of all the U.S. and European efforts to resume the
peace talks."

<HEADLINE> 8.7 Million Children to Be Vaccinated Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Close to 8.7 million
children under the age of five will be vaccinated against polio
in the campaign to be launched in the last quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Dr. Mekonnen Admasu, an expert in the
Ministry of Health today.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Mekonnen said the two-round nationwide immunization
campaign is going to be launched at over 27,000 stations and
about 85,000 health professionals and voluntary workers will take
part in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
He said the first round of the campaign will be conducted from
Novemebr 5 to 7 and the second round is scheduled for December 2
to 4.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the success of the previous year's anti-polio
immunization campaign, the doctor said that 300,000 children were
inoculated against the disease last year.
</P>
<P>
The number of polio victims in Ethiopia has been reduced by 50
percent over the past ten years, he added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has planned to stamp out polio from the country by
the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> British Government Likely to Shift Towards EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Labor government is
on the point of adopting a much more positive approach to the
European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), according to a
well-placed government source.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed government minister was quoted by today's Financial
Times newspaper as saying that the London government would issue a
statement shortly that sterling is likely to join at an early
opportunity after the launch of the planned single European
currency on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It is now clear that we must indicate our willingness to be in
there," the minister said, adding that there was "still work to do
on how we would word such a declaration of intent."
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that this represents a big shift from
the negative tone of the ruling Labor Party, which snatched a
landslide May 1 general election.
</P>
<P>
"It is no longer ridiculous to suggest we could win a
referendum (which is a pre-condition of British membership). The
climate has changed," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
A statement outlining the conditions for sterling's EMU
membership would probably be made after the Parliament resumes at
the end of October, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Although Downing Street has dismissed the Financial Times
report as pure speculation, local economists said that it had the
ring of the truth.
</P>
<P>
"One suspects the story is well-sourced and markets are quite
rightly taking it at face value," said John Shepperd, chief
economist at Yamaichi International.

LUANDA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The government of the United
States will provide Angola with 200,000 dollars to train the
latter's military personnel.
</P>
<P>
General Jose Maria, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the

The U.S. delegation arrived in Angola on Wednesday.

dollars was given to Angola for the same purpose.

Under an agreement by the two countries on military
cooperation, two officers from Angola's Navy will leave for the

<HEADLINE> WHO to Help Reduce Health Impact of Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) is deeply concerned by the health effects of the forest
fires in Southeast Asia and will provide 200,000 US dollars for
technical advisory services and equipment, the organization said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The air pollution caused by the forest fires in Indonesia is at
emergency levels and serious health problems are affecting and
will continue to affect a large number of people in the region if
the fires are not extinguished very soon and current
meteorological conditions prevail, WHO said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
This particularly serious situation has already persisted for
several weeks and the weather forecasts are not favorable for the
situation to change substantially, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The longer the exposure to the air pollution, which is mainly
caused by the accumulation of fine particles, the more serious the
effects will be, particularly for vulnerable groups of the
population, like people with chronic respiratory problems, infants
and the elderly," WHO said.
</P>
<P>
In September only, the number of additional hospital admissions
in Sarawak, Malaysia, alone were more than 26,000.
</P>
<P>
WHO endorsed the recommendations already made by the
governments concerned to lessen the health effects of air
pollution. They include wearing respiratory masks, staying indoors
as much as possible, keeping windows and doors closed, and seeking
medical advice when called for.
</P>
<P>
However, WHO stressed that it should be noted that in view of
the small size of the particles, home-made or other commonly
available masks do not ensure complete health protection.
</P>
<P>
WHO urged the international community to fully support the
efforts being made by the national authorities of the affected
countries to utilize all possible measures to put out the fires.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from
both China and Uruguay said here today that it was important for
their two countries to keep friendly relations and support each
other in broad fields.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at the United Nations headquarters, Qian Qichen,
vice-premier and foreign minister of China, and Alvaro Ramos,
foreign minister of Uruguay, spoke highly about the development of
relations between their two countries in the past years. They held
that the visit to China by Uruguayan President Julio Maria
Sanguinetti in April has promoted the friendship between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that though China and Uruguay are far from each other
geographically and different in national conditions, the two
countries have frequent contacts and exchanges, and their economic
and trade relations are growing, their technological cooperation
is going well, and their consultations and cooperation in the
international affairs are continuing.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed thanks to Uruguay for its support to China in
the latter's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and
the links with other Latin American organizations, as well as for
Uruguay's understanding of China on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that though his country is small, it observes all
the principles in the international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay hopes to develop friendly cooperation with China and
likes to play a positive role in the promotion of relations
between China and the nations and organizations in Latin
America, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Uruguay will adhere to the "one China"
policy and will continue supporting China on some issues including
its efforts for China's accession to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on the United
Nations and other issues of mutual concern.

<HEADLINE> Cooks Says No Blood Money Deal Done for UK Nurses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook denied today that a deal had been struck in order to
spare the life of a British nurse who is likely to face death
sentence in Saudi Arabia for killing an Australian nurse.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview early today, Cook, who
is attending the UN General Assembly session, said that the
government was trying to persuade through lawyers the victim's
family to waive its right under Saudi law to demand the death
penalty for British nurse Deborah Parry in exchange for a large
amount of so-called "blood money."
</P>
<P>
"That is one of the solutions which we have been encouraging
the lawyers to explore actively for some weeks now," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign secretary made it clear that "there is no
deal done and it would be wrong to assume that one has been
resolved yet." "There is still some distance to go before one can
be confident of agreement there," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cook was expected to meet Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud
al-Faisal in New York later today to discuss the delicate issue.
</P>
<P>
But a British government official said hours before the meeting
that it was unlikely there would be a breakthrough at the talks
between the two foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"I do not expect an outcome in the sense of solving the problem
today," he added.

ADDIS ABABA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian foreign

Saudi Arabia for Umrah pilgrimage to return home upon completing
their religious duties there.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the ministry, quoted by the Ethiopian News

Ethiopians who have been living in Saudi Arabia illegally are
reporting to the Ethiopian consular office in Jeddah to have the

consolidating their military alliance and strengthening means of
war when they recently revised the so-called Security Guidelines,
thus posing the biggest threat to Asia.
</P>
<P>
It also called for the repeal of the Japan-U.S. Treaty of
Mutual Cooperation and Security.
</P>
<P>
The resolution vowed to prevent "any revision to the Japanese
constitution in the wrong direction and to ward off a revival of
militarism."
</P>
<P>
The JCP is committed to building Japan into an independent,
non-nuclear, non-aligned and neutral country conducive to world
peace, the resolution added.
</P>
<P>
At the congress, the party also accepted a report by Presidium
Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa on behalf of the Central Committee, which
urged the Japanese government to refrain from intervening in the
Taiwan issue, stressing that Taiwan is Chinese territory and the
issue is China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The congress elected a new 178-member JCP Central Committee,
which held its first plenary meeting right afterwards to re-elect
Tetsuzo Fuwa as Presidium Chairman.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee made Kenji Miyamoto, 88, its honorary
chairman and reelected Kazuo Shii to head its Secretariat. It
decided to cancel its chairmanship and vice chairmanship.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Developing Nations Calling for More Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- As the general debate
entered its fifth day at the 52nd session of the U.N. General
Assembly, more and more developing nations are calling on the
largest international organization to give priority to the social
and economic development of the developing nations while voicing
their support for the U.N. reform.
</P>
<P>
Without taking due account of the priorities and interests of
developing countries, no reform aimed at restructuring the United
Nations and rationalizing its expenditures was likely to achieve
its purpose, Prime Minister Abdellatif Filali of Morocco said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the General Assembly, Filali said that the U.N.
reform efforts led by Secretary-General Kofi Annan should mainly
address the settlement of developing countries' economic and
social problems through provision of the required material and
technical means.
</P>
<P>
In the same Assembly and on the same day, President of
Colombia Ernesto Smaper Pizano noted that the U.N. reform should
encompass all spheres of the United Nations system, particularly
the economic development sections.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the economic sphere, the Bretton Woods
organizations, the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund, had been progressively separating from the original
direction exercised by the Assembly over their economic and
social policies.
</P>
<P>
They now imposed development models on developing economies
without allowing those economies to participate in any discussions
about their own priorities, he complained.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president asked the Assembly to note the serious
fact that there are some 1.3 billion people surviving on less than
one U.S. dollar a day in the world. He criticized some developed
countries for buying a combat plane at a cost which could feed
57,000 African children.
</P>
<P>
The Columbian leader said that in such a world the United
Nations reform "must give priority" to strengthening social and
economic programs of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They were echoed by many delegates from other developing
nations during the debate which opened Monday and is expected to
last three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral told the U.N. Assembly
Wednesday that promoting sustainable economic development should
become the main objective of the world body.
</P>
<P>
He advised that international peace and stability could not be
achieved and kept unless all of the members of the international
community had reached a basic standard of development and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from Fiji were hopeful that the United Nations would
attach greater importance to the economic and social development
assistance and cooperation in its innovation and restructure.
</P>
<P>
They said that a more active and constructive role of the
United Nations could create more opportunities for developing
nations in catching up the international economic and social
development trend.
</P>
<P>
Even some developed nations expressed identical or similar
views on increasing U.N. social and economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy told the U.N. Assembly
that an effort was required to reform U.N. development funds and
programs. He noted that priority should be placed on improving
coordination within the U.N. system at the country level,
including among the specialized agencies and the Bretton Woods
institutions, in order to maximize the impact of development
measures.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy expressed firm support for Annan's reform measures and
proposals in that area.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, delegates of Japan and Britain also pledged
to increase their economic assistance to developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the commitments made by some leading developed
nations at the current U.N. Assembly session, many delegates from
developing countries expressed their sincere hope that their words
would soon become real actions.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls For Greater Persistence to Remove Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called for greater persistence towards the
removal of the millions of mines that plagued post-conflict
societies from Bosnia to Angola to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony and press conference marking the
handover of the Oslo Treaty, the secretary-general said the
handover of the Oslo Treaty banning anti-personnel mines marked
the last step before the formal signing of the treaty in Ottawa,
and it was a great accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that the Ottawa Treaty would be a momentous
event in the peace-keeping efforts of the present time, and it
would be a landmark in the history of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the treaty would serve not only as a complement but
also as an inspiration for greater and swifter progress in the
Conference on Disarmament's own deliberations towards a total ban
on land-mines.

<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Wednesday announced
that the Jewish presence in the West Bank would grow and 300 new
housing units would be built in a Jewish settlement in Efrat,

<HEADLINE> Algerian Extremist Group Claims Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's Islamic extremist
group, the Islamic Armed Group (GIA), today claimed responsibility
for the massacres of hundreds of civilians and warned France of
new terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
In a communique signed by the emir of the GIA Antar Zouabri and
published in London, the GIA said that all the victims of the
massacres were "sacrifice to God."
</P>
<P>
This communique came days after the Islamic Salvation Army, the
military wing of the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS),
announced a cease-fire with the government.
</P>
<P>
Ending the communique with the words "blood, blood!
Destruction, destruction!" the GIA also warned the United Nations
"not to follow the way of France."
</P>
<P>
Entitled "Repulse the Enemy of Islam," the communique failed to
mention the United States, which has recently expressed support
for the "military measures" of the Algerian government against the
extremists.
</P>
<P>
"The world should know that all the killings, the massacres,
the arsons, the displacement of population, the kidnapping of
women, are the sacrifice to God," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The GIA "considers as impious the tyrants and consider also as
such their relatives, their partisans. It is for this that it
attacks the partisans of the apostates in the cities, the villages
and the deserts, eradicate them, destroy their fields, capture
their women and confiscate their properties, " it said.
</P>
<P>
The GIA also accused France of supporting the Algerian
government and said that it will not "weaken in the fight" against
France, promising the latter of "defeat and destruction."
</P>
<P>
France was struck by a wave of terrorist attacks in 1995
claimed by the GIA, in which eight people were killed and 200
injured. The GIA was also blamed for the terrorist attack on an
underground train in Paris in December 1996, in which four people
were killed.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriot Leaders Discuss Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash had a meeting
here this evening to discuss security issues concerning the
Cyprus problem, but did not reach any agreement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place at the presence of U.N. Resident
Representative Gustave Feissel at his residence in the
U.N.-controlled buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, which lasted about 90 minutes, Feissel
told reporters that "the leaders of the two communities had a
good discussion on the subject of security and the atmosphere
was a friendly one."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said Clerides and Denktash agreed that he
would have separate discussions with them in the coming few
days.
</P>
<P>
"The objective is to try to come up with common views on the
issue of security and also for the two leaders getting back
together to consider this very shortly, in a matter of days
hopefully," he added, but refused to disclose details of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Feissel believed that today's discussions on security matters
between the two leaders is an initial good step in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that a second joint meeting will be
held before Thursday, when President Clerides leaves for New
York to address the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash did not make any statement after the
meeting as they agreed not to make public statements about what
they discussed.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting took place only a month after failed
U.N.-sponsored direct talks between the two leaders in Glion,
Switzerland, which followed their negotiations in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the discussion about security issues was
proposed during the direct talks in Switzerland by Clerides, who
suggested to discuss "reduction of military forces and
equipment, limitation or prohibition to importation of armaments
to Cyprus and demilitarization of the island."
</P>
<P>
But Denktash reportedly rejected discussion of
demilitarization before the solution of the Cyprus
problem. Instead, he preferred to deal with the issue of "S-300
missiles."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government's decision to buy Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles in January has triggered tension between
the small island nation and Turkey, which has threatened to
strike if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Denktash had two meetings in Nicosia in July and
concluded an agreement on humanitarian issues.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unresolved since 1974 when
the island was divided after Turkish troops landed and took over
the northern third following a short-lived pro-Athens coup.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Conflict Should Be Solved by Algerians: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today reiterated that the conflict in Algeria should be solved by
Algerians themselves, contradicting with the renewed appeal by
some French personalities for an "internationalization" of the
Algerian crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said today in Moscow that the task to re-establish order
in Algeria comes above all to Algerian authorities, even though
the international community is ready to bring help, according to
Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
"Only a determined policy in Algiers, with the will to apply it
whatever it is, will allow the advancement toward dialogue,
national reconciliation, respect of human rights and security,"
said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He said that "it is extremely difficult to intervene from
outside" into the Algerian conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We are completely ready to do what concerns us -- it is the
same for other European Union countries, the other countries of
the world -- to help... the Algerian authorities. But it is up to
them to engage in necessary actions to re-establish order and
security," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He also described the latest massacres which took place in
Algeria as "the most horrible thing in the world."
</P>
<P>
Some French leftwing and rightwing personalities, as well as
some French newspapers, have called on the international community
to intervene in Algeria, after more than 200 people were massacred
Monday night in Bentalha, south of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 100,000 people have been killed since 1992, when
Algeria was plunged into violence.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic extremist group Armed Islamic Group today claimed
responsibility for the massacres of the civilians, and threatened
France with new terrorist attacks.

He said that although Zambia has not experienced worst
disasters like earthquakes and severe cyclones the country has
had its share of natural and man-made disasters in the past.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls for Prompt Action to Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said today
that International financial bodies and developed nations should
assist Southeast Asian countries affected by currency turbulences.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly of the
United Nations, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said in an
interdependent world, the situation warrants their prompt action.
</P>
<P>
Their positive response is important because defensive reflex
by developing countries to cope with rampant currency speculation
would be detrimental to free trade.
</P>
<P>
Currencies in some Southeast Asian nations such as Thailand and
Malaysia have recently depreciated and their stock prices plunged
partly because of speculation and manipulation activities.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in Southeast Asia could of course occur in other
parts of the world which are increasingly dependent on capital
flows for economic growth," Abdullah warned.
</P>
<P>
On the role of the U.N., Abdullah said the U.N.'s commitment to
development should remain its most significant role.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. must strongly project the need for higher levels of
growth, accelerated development, and equitable geographical
distribution of growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform of the U.N. Security Council should reflect
current realities particularly the significant role of the
developing countries in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Turning to U.N. financial crisis, he said Malaysia joins the
U.N. Secretary-General in urging member states to fulfil their
obligations towards the U.N..
</P>
<P>
"It is unfair and unethical that the rest of the world is held
to ransom by the few who disregard international treaties and
agreements and (U.N.) Charter provisions for the sake of their
narrow national interests," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
The United States is U.N.'s biggest debtor, owing 1.3 billion
U.S. dollars in membership dues.

TOKYO, SEPTEMBER 27 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Minister Wu Yi said today that Asia and

two regions have great complementarity in economy.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks while addressing a two-day economic session
of the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM), which opened today in the city
of Chiba, near Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
The prospects of cooperation between the two regions are very
bright as long as they make joint efforts in creating a good
environment, cooperate in the fields of economy and technology and
gradually reduce and remove trade and investment barriers, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Briefing on China's opening-up policy and the Chinese
government's stance on Asia-Europe cooperation, Wu said China has
been consistently attaching great importance to strengthening ties
with other countries and regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's opening-up policy has been further confirmed at the
just ended 15th national congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), she said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China's political situation is stable, Wu said the
country will see sustainable economic growth, while the economic
reform will be further deepened.
</P>
<P>
She also called on the Asian countries, most developing ones,
to boost dialogue and coordination, and actively promote
cooperation with the Europe Union (EU) in the field of technology
transfer by taking advantage of the ASEM forum.
</P>
<P>
The two-day session of the ASEM will focus on setting
principles for boosting trade and investment between Asia and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Economic ministers from 25 countries are attending the meeting,
which takes place as the spread of Thai currency crisis to other
parts of Southeast Asia casts doubt on the sustainability of rapid
economic growth in the regin.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are likely to agree that ASEM member countries
must strengthen their economic fundamentals so as to minimize
instability caused by currency fluctuations, sources said.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to reaffirm their cooperation to secure
continued inflows of private funds to Southeast Asia, despite the
disturbances now rocking the region's markets, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
ASEM was created by 25 Asian and European countries at their
summit meeting in Bangkok in March 1996, with the aim of building
closer relations between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The group consists of the 15 member countries of the EU and 10
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Asian members are China, Japan and South Korea, plus seven
of the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
-- Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore,
Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Russia, U.S. Sign Disarmament Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia and the United States
signed a package of disarmament accords here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The accords "should pave the way for the Duma (Russian
parliament) to ratify START II and trigger deep reductions in the
arsenals," said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who
signed them with her Russian counterpart, Yevgeni Primakov.
</P>
<P>
Primakov hailed the agreements as "a new joint success, a
radical success in arms control" which "will determine the course
of arms control for many years to come."
</P>
<P>
The accords include an adaptation of the 1972 anti-ballistic
missile (ABM) treaty that limits the capability of both countries'
anti-missile weapons.
</P>
<P>
They also include an accord that postpones to December 31, 2007
the date at which the START II treaty has to be put into effect,
instead of December 31, 2003.
</P>
<P>
Albright recalled that U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin committed at their Helsinki summit in
March 1997 to begin negotiations on START III as soon as START II
was ratified.
</P>
<P>
START II, signed in January 1993 by Russia and the United
States, is supposed to bring the number of each country's nuclear
warheads to between 3,000-3,500.
</P>
<P>
The future START III is expected to lower that level to between
2,000-2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
START II already has been ratified by the U.S. Senate but not
by the Duma because it fears that Washington would break out of
the ABM pact by deploying multiple anti-missile defensive
systems.

<HEADLINE> PNA-Israeli Talks in Washington Yet to Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
today expressed his reservation about the scheduled talks between
the Palestinian and Israeli negotiating teams who have been in
Washington for days but have not met each other yet.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian team, currently staying in the U.S. capital,
had not held talks so far with the Israeli delegation, Hassan
Abdel Rahman, head of PLO mission in the U.S., said in a telephone
interview with the Cairo-based Voice of Arabs radio.
</P>
<P>
PLO Secretary General Mahmoud Abbas (better known as Abu Mazen)
and Israeli Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh are leading the
Palestinian and Israeli peace teams in Washington respectively.
</P>
<P>
"Talks between Abu Mazen and Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy will take place if the American side persuades the Israelis
of the Palestinian concept based on implementing the previously
signed accords," Abdel Rahman was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli plan of setting up 300 new housing
units in Efrat, south of Jerusalem, is aimed at blowing up the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace moves have been in crisis for six months over
Israeli settlement building in the West Bank, home to more than a
million Arabs, and over Palestinian militants suicide attacks that
have killed 20 Israelis. The Israeli decision on Wednesday to
expand settlement in Efrat fueled the Palestinian fury.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian diplomat denied reports claiming that the
Palestinian-Israeli talks have focused on security issues, noting
that the American side understands the Palestinian viewpoint
regarding the basis of resuming peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. administration officials are currently
holding separate talks with both sides in a bid to reduce the gap
of their differences.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side has insisted on giving a priority to security
matters and blaming the Palestinian National Authority for failure
to fight terrorism, while the Palestinians are adamant on a total
halt of settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The scheduled Palestinian-Israeli meetings are arranged during
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip in the region
earlier this month which has apparently failed to break the peace
stalemate.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Military Leaders Urged to Surrender </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The west African
peacekeeping force (Ecomog) said today that the current military
leaders in Sierra Leone "will not be harmed if they surrender to
Ecomog and end their rebellion."
</P>
<P>
Colonel Max Khobe, ECOMOG task force commander in Sierra
Leone, made the remarks when being interviewed on the Clandestine
Radio FM 98.1 which advocates for military intervention to force
the military regime to hand over power to the civilian government
it overthrew in May.
</P>
<P>
He said, "I shall wholeheartedly receive them and if they
desire to go abroad, I can take them out safely before (ousted)
President Kabbah comes back."
</P>
<P>
"We prefer this framework to avoid any bloodshed. We want to
return power to the legitimate owner. The junta should realize we
have the capacity of using force even right now to kick them out
of Freetown," Khobe said.
</P>
<P>
The Ecomog officer added that "we are only applying sanctions
and embargo to see if they can quickly leave the State House.
Once I am given directive to get into Freetown, I shall be in
Freetown."
</P>
<P>
He said civilians will not be at risk except those who go to
military targets such as the military headquarters of Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the junta leaders can "still play vital
political roles in the future to develop Sierra Leone" after
returning power to President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of Defense Information, Major John Milton
told Xinhua, "people who are naively thinking that ECOMOG can
easily flush out the allied government and rebel forces are
making a sad mistake."
</P>
<P>
"The proliferation of loyal troops in the provinces would pose
a resistance to the Nigerian-led Ecomog troops." he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the event of an Ecomog intervention, the
allied troops will adopt the hit and run tactics which "will
prolong the crisis for ages. There is no where in the world where
a regular force has triumphed over a guerilla movement."

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Turkey to Withdraw Troops from Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Iran today deplored Turkish
army's thrust into northern Iraq and called for their immediate
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said that Turkey's
military offensive would solve no problem but on the contrary
would worsen instability and increase tension in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman termed the Turkish military offensive against
Turkey's outlawed Kurdish rebels based in northern Iraq as
something detrimental to the entire region and he underlined the
need to preserve Iraq's territorial integrity and respect
internationally recognized borders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the English daily Tehran Times today published an
editorial, condemning Turkey's political machinations.
</P>
<P>
The daily noted that the Turkish machinations in northern
Iraq violates the U.N. mandate which seeks to redress grievances
by "peaceful means" before using force.
</P>
<P>
The recent Turkish raid on northern Iraq has been condemned by
the Baghdad regime. It has not only heightened tensions between
Baghdad and Ankara, but also aroused concern of Iranian and Arab
governments, added the editorial.
</P>
<P>
The paper stressed that Iran and its neighbors have doubted
Turkey's motives, adding that it would be childlike to accept
the theory that Turkey is simply in Iraq to turn back a
wave of separatism.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's internal problems cannot be solved by military action
as it only serves to heighten concern from neighboring countries
who see it as a threat to their own security, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
About 7,000 Turkish troops backed by more than 100 tanks
crossed into northern Iraq on September 22 to reinforce the Turkish
forces there in a bid to wipe out guerrillas of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party based in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On May 14, some 50,000 Turkish troops entered northern Iraq in a
cross-border military operation against the Kurdish rebels who had
been fighting for an independent state in southeastern Turkey for
the past 13 years. On June 19, Turkey said that it had pulled
out most of its forces from northern Iraq, but had never announced
a complete withdrawal from the area.

JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Dominique Van Roost
of Belgium advanced into the final of the Wismilak International
tennis tournament after overcoming Australia's Rachel McQuillan
6-2, 7-5 in Surabaya, Indonesia on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Her opponent will be the unseeded Czech Lenka Nemeckova, who
surprised Maria Alejandra of Venezuela 6-4, 6-3 in the other semi.
</P>
<P>
Windy conditions made serving difficult and Van Roost served 14
double-faults, including an embarrassing five in one game. But she
was more consistent that McQuillan with her groundstrokes, and had
a bigger weapon with her powerful forehand.
</P>
<P>
After seemingly coasting to victory with a 4-2 lead in the
second set, Van Roost ran into some stiff opposition as McQuillan
cut her unforced errors to a minimum and threatened to take the
match to a third set. But the Australian Open quarter-finalist
resisted the pressure, saved a game point at 5-5, and then broke
to serve out at love for the victory.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Tells Iran: Release All POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today expressed the hope
that Iran frees all Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) detained
during of 1980-88 war between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the freeing of 46 Iraqi POWs by Iran Thursday,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement that Baghdad
appreciates the Iran's move. However, it said the step is very
limited as the Iraq POWs still being held number some 20,000.
</P>
<P>
If Iran sets free all Iraqi POWs, its position will be
consistent with the international laws including the third Geneva
Convention for 1949 on the treatment of POWs, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Some 75,000 POWs have been exchanged between the two countries
since the end of the Iran-Iraq war. Iran has claimed that Iraq
still holds more than 5,000 Iranian POWs. Each sides rejected the
other's POWs claim.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has said that it has released all the Iranian POWs in 1990
and repatriated them to Iran under the supervision of the
International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Exchange of POWs and the remains of the missing soldiers during
the Iran-Iraq war are still the main obstacles to the
normalization of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf met
with his Iranian counterpart Kamal Kharrazi in New York for the
first time since the latter took office one month ago.
</P>
<P>
Sahhaf and Kharrazi exchanged views on the best ways for
initiating political dialog in a bid to resolve the standing
problems hindering the normalization of the bilateral relations.

<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Xunhai, deputy director
of overseas finances department of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, says the country will continue opening-up its
financial sector and gradually treat overseas financial
institutions like Chinese ones.
</P>
<P>
He said that the number of representative offices of overseas
financial institutions in China had grown to 527 by the end of
last year, 156 of them have started businesses, 131 of which are
overseas banks with local branches, eight insurance companies, and
a jointly-funded investment bank.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks have played an important role in cash flow into
China, he said, and overseas banks have become an important part
of the country's financial system. Their total assets are now 29.9
billion US dollars, accounting for 3.13 percent of China's total.
</P>
<P>
Overseas banks have also helped bring in new financial
services, advanced management expertise and personnel training.
</P>
<P>
However, China is still cautious in opening its financial
sector, Zhang noted, and it will start in pilot areas, and then be
extended from coastal to inland areas, and from commercial banking
to insurance and investment banking. enditem

WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- The United States signed a package of arms control
agreements Friday with Russia that pushed back by five years one
of the major treaties of the cold war, but that could clear the
way for further cuts in nuclear weapons. The agreement would give
Russia until the end of 2007 to dismantle launching systems as
required by the second strategic arms reduction treaty, or Start 2.
</P>
<P>
-- Spurning appeals from the United States, President Boris N.
Yeltsin signed a new law Friday that protects the Russian Orthodox
Church from competition with other Christian faiths. Western
church leaders deplored the law, saying it threatens religious
freedom in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Driven by last year's fund-raising scandals and fears of a
voter backlash, the Senate Friday opened its long-promised debate
over campaign finance reform with rare passion and eloquence,
sharply divided over what to do and sobered by warnings of the
obstacles that lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Times
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno said Friday that 30-day
preliminary investigations of President Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore -- which could lead to the appointment of independent
counsels -- have focused on a 114-year old federal law governing
fund raising on federal property.
</P>
<P>
-- Federal authorities Friday sought the extradition of a
Canadian indicted in August by a federal grand jury in Washington
on 27 counts of conspiracy and illegally exporting U.S. aircraft
parts to Iran. Mehdi Hobby Moghadam, president of Avitor Corp., is
being sought to face charges of conspiring to export the parts
--including gear assemblies, pistons, vales and heaters -- from
Canada to Germany, then to Iran over a five-year period, beginning
in July 1991.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Settlement Possible: UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. envoy said today that
a Cyprus settlement is possible because Cyprus' Greek and Turkish
community leaders are interested in a solution, Cyprus news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Special Advisor to the U.N. Secretary-General on Cyprus Diego
Cordovez made the remark after a meeting in New York with Cypriot
Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides, during which they discussed
the Cyprus problem and Cordovez's possible visit to the island
December.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a security dialog that started Friday in Nicosia
between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash, Cordovez said "I have been saying all the
time that they are basically interested in a settlement. I believe
a settlement is possible."
</P>
<P>
The security dialog between the two Cypriot communities'
leaders took place Friday evening at presence of U.N. Resident
Representative Gustave Feissel, but no agreement was reached
after the 90-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, Cordovez said "to me these are indications that if
they are willing to meet for this it means they are willing to
meet for others."
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said he exchanged views with the U.N. envoy on the
current situation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot minister said he expressed to the U.N. official
the readiness of the Greek Cypriot side to study "in an open
spirit" any suggestions he might make.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has been divided into the Turkish-controlled
north and Greek-dominated south since 1974 when the island was
divided after Turkish troops took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have been trying for
decades to reunite the divided island as a bi-communal, bi-zonal
federation through peace talks, but so far, no tangible results
have been achieved.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Palestinian
demonstrators today clashed with Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
guarding the Far Deron Jewish settlement in Gaza Strip, and two
Palestinians were wounded.
</P>
<P>
The IDF fired rubber bullets at the Palestinians as they
approached the area for protest against Jewish settlement,
Palestine News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Today's demonstration was coincided with the one year
anniversary of the opening of the archaeological tunnel running
alongside the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, for which the
Palestinians and Israelis fought a battle which killed nearly 80
people.
</P>
<P>
The outbreak of unrest also comes following Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement that he would continue
building Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
despite U.S. call for a settlement suspension.
</P>
<P>
The protesters threw stones at the IDF and burned U.S. flags
and Netanyahu's effigies.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police arrived at the scene and formed a human
barrier between the demonstrators and the IDF.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) issued a
statement today, accusing the Islamic resistance group, or Hamas,
of aiming at destroying the Palestinian national aspirations by
attacking Israelis.
</P>
<P>
This accusation is coupled with the ongoing PNA's arrests of
the Hamas activists in the PNA controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
During the last few days, the PNA arrested dozens of Hamas
activists in the West Bank and closed down 17 Hamas institutions,
including its TV station in Nablus.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Encouraged To Focus On Autumn Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The General Office of the
State Council, China's highest administrative body, has issued a
circular calling for a good job in the autumn agricultural work.
</P>
<P>
The circular issued yesterday said that north China was hit by
a severe drought this year and autumn harvesting and sowing are
about to begin, so a new effort must be made to see to it that
there is another harvest next summer.
</P>
<P>
This year's harvests depend on the fall harvest. The country
has gotten in its summer grain and early rice. South China should
improve its field management and fertilizer and water supplies,
while the north should focus on harvesting crops in time for the
autumn planting, and should reduce grain losses in the process,
the circular said.
</P>
<P>
Priority must be given to drought-combatting measures and quick
planting and every possible water source should be made use of for
this effort. Farm machinery should play a major part in planting
quality, the circular noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, greater efforts should be made to spread the
results of agronomy, especially wheat seed coating techniques,
plastic sheeting, and fine seeds, it said.
</P>
<P>
Government departments should provide help with capital, means
of production, and technology, the circular said, and officials
should go to production areas to help farmers solve problems in
fall harvesting and sowing.

<HEADLINE> Life Back to Normal in Sarawak, Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Life in Sarawak which
has been under a state of haze emergency since September 19 was
almost back to normal today with the continuous improvement in
the air quality in this Malaysian state, according to reports from
the state capital Kuching.
</P>
<P>
The air quality in Sarawak is no longer at the hazardous level
with the Air Pollutant Index (API) steadily dropping to 110 by 5
p.m. today from 120 at noon and 183 at 1 a.m., the reports quoted
a statement by the Department of Environment of the state as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the API level is still at the unhealthy level, it was
a big improvement for the state where the API once breached the
800 mark, far beyond the hazardous level of 301-500.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement in air quality, the state's Disaster
Management and Relief committee relaxed the order of closure on
certain sectors of the economy Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although the government and private sector employees were
allowed to stay at home as their offices operate on a minimum
scale, most of them were seen back at their desks.
</P>
<P>
As today is pay-day for most offices, long queues could be seen
at bank counters and Automated Teller Machines, mostly to make
withdrawals, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Random checks in various parts of Kuching showed that the
people appeared to have put behind them the haze emergency
enforced by the government since September 19 under which only the
essential services were allowed to operate.
</P>
<P>
However, the state of haze emergency is still in force, which
is expected to be revoked soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Mike Hakkinen took the pole
position for the Luxembourg Grand Prix on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The flying Finn, who has never won a Formula One race, earned
the first pole of his career by driving his McLaren-Mercedes
around the 4.556km Nurburgring circuit in one minute 16.602
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen will celebrate his 29th birthday on Sunday by being on
pole for the first time in 94 race starts.
</P>
<P>
The Finn driver just missed out on pole to Jacques Villeneueve
in Austria last week. This time he edged the William-Renault
driver by just 0.089 of a second.
</P>
<P>
Villeneuve, who trails two-time champion Michael Schumacher by
one point going into the 15th race of the 17-race season, was
second-fastest at 1:16.691 in his Williams-Renault.
</P>
<P>
Villeneue's teammate Heinz-Harald Frentzen was third-quickest,
ahead of Italian Giancarlo Fisichella who took the other
second-row place on the grid in his Jordan-Puegeot.
</P>
<P>
German ace Schumacher was only fifth-fastest in his Ferrari,
ahead of Hakkinen's Scottish teammate David Coulthard.
</P>
<P>
Schumacher finished three-quarters of a second adrift of pole
and also had to be given a lift back to the pits at the end of
qualifying when his Ferrari seemed to run out of fuel.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Effect Thorough Changes in Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister
Lokendra Bahadur Chand said today that the government is to set up
a high-level national education commission to effect thorough
changes in education under a long-term perspective.
</P>
<P>
When inaugurating a one-day interaction program on basic and
primary education organized here by the Education Ministry, Chand
said the educational sector has seen growth in terms of quantity
but not in quality.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for more effective implementation of
programs being run under the basic and primary education project
and the primary education development scheme, the official RSS
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Education Minister Devi Prasad Ojha disclosed that the
basic and primary education project will be implemented in all the
75 districts in future, the RSS said.
</P>
<P>
The primary education should be developed as a civic right, the
minister was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Though the government has declared free education for all the
children, five million of the eight million children in Nepal are
still devoid of any opportunity to attend schools, local reports
said.
</P>
<P>
And every year some 1.28 million children repeat class one or
drop out.
</P>
<P>
The country's literacy rate stands at a poor 40 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Backs Abacha for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian army said on
Friday it will support any person chosen by Nigerians to contest
the presidency next year, including the current head of state
General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The army headquarters stated that its stand stems from the
support and faith it has in the transition program, according to
which, the military administration is to hand over to an elected
government one year later.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the army said if Abacha is chosen by Nigerians
and expresses his wish to run, he would have the full and
unflinching loyalty of the army.
</P>
<P>
"The Nigerian army wishes to inform the Nigerian people that
there should not be any doubt about its support for General Sani
Abacha. If he declares his intention to stand for the presidency,
the Nigerian army will support him absolutely," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The four-page statement, signed by Lt.-Col. Lima Adelugba, is
seen as a response to a report in a local magazine "Tempo" which
said the officers and men of the army were not favorably disposed
to the transition program.
</P>
<P>
The reaction came one week after Chief of Army Staff Maj.-Gen.
Ishaya Bamaiyi completed a nationwide tour of army units and
formations where he asked officers and men to support the present
administration in its bid to evolve a home-grown democracy
scheduled to come on October 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The army spokesman dispelled insinuations that the Nigerian
army is disloyal to the head of state, adding that there are no
factions in the army.
</P>
<P>
There have been pros and cons for whether Abacha should
contest the election to become a civilian president of the
country, but the head of state himself said earlier this year
that it would be determined by his constituency.

PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The exiled executive organ of
the outlawed Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) of Algeria today called
for a truce between the Algerian government and Islamic groups and
urged the government to declare a general amnesty.
</P>
<P>
In a communique faxed to the Bonn bureau of Agence
France-Presse (AFP), the FIS urged all Algerian parties ``to take
initiative, whatever the position you occupy on the national
territory, to announce a truce even in a unilateral way''.
</P>
<P>
It called for the isolation of those who committed collective
killings and odious massacres of the innocent people and the
exposure of their conspiracies and silent collaborators.
</P>
<P>
The communique, signed on Friday by the president of FIS
executive organ in exile, Rabah Kebir, said a conference of
national reconciliation should be convened to bring together the
government institutions, the FIS and all others ``without
exclusion''.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing of FIS, has
announced a ceasefire with the government as from October 1.
</P>
<P>
But another extremist group, the Islamic Armed Group, has vowed
to carry on the fight against the military-backed government.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti oil exports will
be not affected by an indefinite but partial strike in the Kuwait
National Petroleum Company (KNPC) which began early this morning,
an oil official source said.
</P>
<P>
The company has resorted to alternative plans to maintain oil
export rates unchanged despite the strike by some 100 workers at
the export division of the Ahmadi Refinery, the Official Kuwait
News Agency quoted the unnamed official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hamad Al-Souyan, chairman of the Ahmadi Workers Union, said the
striking workers demand better treatments and improved promotion
principles.
</P>
<P>
He warned of an expanded strike to other refinery divisions if
the demands are ignored.
</P>
<P>
Ahmadi, known as the country's oil city, is located 50
kilometers south of the capital of Kuwait City. It is also a major
export hub of gas, oil and kerosene to Asia and the Indian
sub-continent.
</P>
<P>
The output of Ahmadi Refinery is estimated at about 300,000
barrels per day, company sources said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait exports 2 million barrels of oil per day. Oil and its by
products are the backbone of the economy, generating 80 percent

<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 50,000 local residents
have left their home in Kasese district in western Uganda, The
Crusader reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The exodus occurred since September 23 when the Allied
Democratic Forces (ADF) massacred 20 civilians in Kasese
district, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Crispus Kiyonga, the health minister, confirmed that many
people have fled the town. The official visited the area this
week.
</P>
<P>
The rebels claimed to kill every civilian they meet. The
threat caused a panic among local people. Johnson Kule, a
resident in the district, complained to the paper that he does
not know where to run to. Displaced people filled some places in
Kasese town.
</P>
<P>
But Kiyonga assured that the situation is under control, and
the government will provide assistance to the families of the ADF
victims. He referred ADF rebels as defeated, otherwise ADF would
not slaughter civilians, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Some of ADF leaders are Islamic radicals. But Kiyonga appealed
Muslim community in the district to keep calm. "This is not a
Muslim war," he told a rally in the western town.
</P>
<P>
Lt. colonel Charles Angina, the operation commander in the
west, told the gathering that the Uganda government troops will
cooperate with the government troops of Congo to eradicate ADF
rebellion. If the joint operation failed, Uganda army is ready to
enter Congo to comb hills in eastern Congo, he added. He also
announced that the army farm in Hima near Kasese town is ready to
help settle down the displaced.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a rebel group acting in the west. Recent reports said
ADF remnants entered eastern Congo in the wake of ethnic conflict
there to regroup themselves.

</P>
<P>
Included in EU conditions for renewal of importation are:
building concrete landing, cleaning and weighing facilities, use
of clean boiled and filtered water for washing the fish, proper
latrine at the landing sites, and proper delivery of fish to the
concrete tables.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's fish is mainly consumed in Spain and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Though relatively a new export commodity, fish is Uganda's
second highest export earner after coffee. Official statistics
shows that the country's revenue from fish exports rose to 41.37
million U.S. Dollars in 1996/97 from 11.09 million Dollars in
1993/94.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Parliament Approves New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The two houses of Thai
parliament today approved Thailand's new constitution.
</P>
<P>
In a joint session of parliament, 578 lawmakers approved the
new constitution, the 16th in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
During the vote, 16 lawmakers were against the new charter, and
17 abstained, with seventy-seven not taking part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution enters into force after it is published in
the Royal Gazette. After that, a few months are needed to draft
and approve organic laws.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's first constitution was adopted in 1932, when
Thailand switched to constitutional monarchy from absolute
monarchy.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks most Thai newspapers hailed the charter
drafting process and the expected passage today of the new charter
as historic, as it is the first time in Thai history that the
people have been given the opportunity to become involved.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution is aimed at granting more freedom to Thai
citizens and encouraging their participation in political realms,
making the country's politics and bureaucracy more transparent and
accountable to the citizens, and promoting stability of the
government, as well as restricting the authority of the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The media and a large number of academics see the passage of
the new charter as an important step towards political reform and
reduction of money politics in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, over the past few weeks, there have been hectic
controversies over the 12-chapter, 336-article charter draft.
</P>
<P>
Some articles are unacceptable to some lawmakers and
grass-roots officials.
</P>
<P>
Among the most contentious points are: sovereign power should
"belong to the people" or "come from the people." Some people say
the wording of "belongs to the people" in the draft is imitating
the republican system of the United States, and therefore, is not
suitable to Thailand's constitutional monarchy.
</P>
<P>
There are also different views about the clause which says MPs,
senators and cabinet members "must hold at least a bachelor's
degree."
</P>
<P>
Another point which is hard for politicians to accept is that
MPs who become prime minister and ministers shall lose their
parliamentary status.
</P>
<P>
Grass-roots officials are opposed to the clause in the draft
that members of local councils would be elected, not appointed as
they are now.
</P>
<P>
The new charter had been drafted by a constitution drafting
assembly, which was elected nationwide in last December.
</P>
<P>
The drafting was completed in August this year and was then
submitted to the National Assembly for debate, and for approval or
rejection.
</P>
<P>
Under rules, parliament has no right to amend the draft, but
can make amendments only after its passage.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh recently pledged to
dissolve the House of Representatives in March or April next year
to allow a general election in May, in accordance with the new
constitution.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals staged a bull run this week with September
South ending sharply higher this week to 1,570 Ringgit (about
506.45 U.S. dollars) per ton, up 95 Ringgit (about 30.64 U.S.
dollars) from last week's close.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals may take a breather next week with activities
moderating on lack of fresh leads, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
However, the cash market is expected to trend higher on bullish
fundamentals, but gains will be limited due to profit-taking, they
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) this week, tin price was
lower and thinly traded with European, Japanese and local traders
continuing to be the active market participants.
</P>
<P>
This week's accumulated turnover amounted to 420 tons compared
to 643 tons last week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is expected to continue its rally next week, with
price expected to test its strong resistance at 17.50 Ringgit
(about 5.64 U.S. dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, throughout the week, the Malaysian rubber market's
trend was sluggish, as both buyers and sellers chose to be
sidelined in the wake of the volatility of the Ringgit and other
regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
October RSS one ended the week at 267.00 sen (about 86.1 U.S.
cents) per kg from last week's close at 260.50 sen (about 84 U.S.
cents) per kg, while SMR20 finished at 264.50 sen (about 85.3 U.S.
cents) per kg from 259.50 sen (about 83.7 U.S. cents) per kg last
week.
</P>
<P>
The outlook of the Malaysian rubber market appeared to be
uncertain next week due to the instability of the Ringgit and
other regional concerns such as the worsening "hazy" situation in
key growing areas in Johor, Sabah and Sarawak, and big fires in
Indonesia, which are of major concern to market players, an
industry player said.
</P>
<P>
Some market observers believed that the worsening haze in these
areas may lead plantation workers to avoid working and if this
situation continues, there will be an impact on the supply of
natural rubber and that these factors would relatively make the
market sentiment bullish.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Teachers Reject Government Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya National Union of
Teachers (KNUT) has rejected the new increase in allowances by
the government, saying that the teachers' strike set for
Wednesday is on schedule, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
KNUT Secretary-General Ambrose Adongo said on Friday the
15-to-100 percent hike in allowances announced by Education
Minister Joseph Kamotho on Thursday were unilateral and did not
reflect the recommendations of the Teachers' Service Remuneration
Committee.
</P>
<P>
In response, the government last night said that it was not in
a position to adequately remunerate public employees, including
teachers, due to economic pressures and financial constraints.
</P>
<P>
The 200-percent salary increment demanded by 240,000-member
KNUT would mean that the treasury spends 50 percent of its annual
revenue on salaries for teachers alone, said a governmental
statement.
</P>
<P>
"Currently the government spends over 28 billion Shillings of
its total expenditure of 121 billion Shillings on teachers'
salaries. It is not possible to raise the figure to 60 billion
Shillings as demanded by KNUT," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, KNUT issued a seven-day strike notice, saying that
teachers of the country would down their tools on October 1 if
their demands were not met by September 30.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the government announced to raise
teachers' salaries by 10 and 28 percent, which was immediately
rejected by a furious KNUT, describing the move as "an insult."
</P>
<P>
Teachers are among the lowest paid professionals in the
eastern African country, entering the public services on a lower
scale than their graduate counterparts such as doctors or
engineers.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say that the teachers' strike could hurt the
ruling Kenya African National Union in the critical run-up to a
general election later this year and would seriously disrupt the
education system.
</P>
<P>
Teachers carry considerable political influences especially in
the countryside in Kenya, they say.

<HEADLINE> International Community Urged to Reexamine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister
Kalonzo Musyoka has called on international community to take
urgent comprehensive action to redefine Africa's relationship
with the key players in the current economic world order.
</P>
<P>
According to the "Kenya Times" reported today, the Kenyan
official made the appeal when addressing a Special UN Security
Council Session on the situation in Africa in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the international community, including the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, to reexamine
their policies on Africa.
</P>
<P>
He decried the precarious socio-economic situation in Africa
caused by low commodity prices, a heavy debt burden, declining
resource transfers and unpredictable and conditional relations
with the international financial system.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council which has the primary responsibility
for the maintenance of international peace and security must be
seen to play the leading role in resolving conflicts throughout
the world, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that "we would also like to see the Security
Council adopt the same standards of urgency in reacting to
conflicts in Africa as it does in other parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is expected to unveil a
report by February next year to identify concrete ways of
comprehensively dealing with the conflict and development issues
facing the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council Session was presided over by
the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whose presidency
falls this month.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the session were all 15 foreign ministers of
the council, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and OAU Secretary-General
Salim Ahmed Salim.

Malaysia's currency Ringgit.
</P>
<P>
The Ringgit was traded between a low of 3.1300 and a high of
3.0680/30 throughout the week with sentiment further affected by
the Indonesian rupiah which fell to fresh lows on September 26.
</P>

Engineers, Anson, RHB Capital, MBf Capital, Maybank, Metro Kajang,
Tenaga Nasional, Commerce-Asset and Mancon.

million shares worth 4.089 billion Ringgit (about 1.319 billion
U.S. dollars) from 1.081 billion shares valued at 5.048 billion
Ringgit (about 1.628 billion U.S. dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The Second Board turnover was 120.926 million shares worth

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- French Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry has
proposed her plan to readjust the accounts of social security, two
years after the plan by former Prime Minister Alain Juppe failed to
attain a balance in social security spending. The new measures,
which will be presented in the draft law of financing on October 8,
will raise taxes on cigarette by 2.5 percent and will seek more
taxes from well-off households and investors.
</P>
<P>
-- Algeria's extremist group Islamic Armed Group (GIA) has
claimed responsibility for the massacres of civilians and has
threatened France with new terrorist attacks because of what it
claimed Paris's support to the government of President Liamine
Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
The GIA also warned the United Nations ``not to follow the way of
France'' and targeted the Islamic Salvation Army, the military wing
of the Islamic Salvation Front which has announced a ceasefire with
government, pleading that ``God allow that their heads be chopped.''
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Minister of Employment and Solidarity Martine Aubry plans
to draw 22 billion francs (3.7 billion US dollars) through new taxes
on profits from investments. She also plans to impose restrictions
on some families in obtaining family allowances from February and
set up a new ``public health tax'' on tobacco industry.

<HEADLINE> Cargo Vessels Collide in Malacca Straits, 28 Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Two cargo vessels
collided last night in the Straits of Malacca with 28 crew members
reportedly missing and the search for the missing is continuing
today, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The collision involving vessels -- N.V. Vickraman, registered
in Madras and Mount 1, registered in St Vincent, Caribbean, was
confirmed by Malaysian Deputy Transport Minister Ali Rustam today.
</P>
<P>
The Vickraman was reported to have sunk with 28 of its 33 crew
members missing and the Mount 1 slightly damaged with its crew
members unaffected in the collision which occurred at 11 p.m.
local time, about six nautical miles off Tanjung Tuan in Port
Dickson, about 90 kilometers south of here.
</P>
<P>
Ali Rustam confirmed that five crew members of the Vickraman
were rescued by a Thai merchant vessel, N.V. Laemthong Glory, and
the Royal Malaysian Navy's (RMN's) K.D. Lekir and they were on
board the RMN vessel K.D. Lekir and in good condition.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale search has been mounted for the missing seamen by
the Malaysian navy, the Royal Malaysian Air Force, marine
department and police, and the search is still continuing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the collision could not be ascertained so far, he
said, but he did not dismiss the possibility that the haze which
is enveloping whole Malaysia was a factor.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the haze situation, all vessels plying the Straits
of Malacca should be more cautious," he said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second such haze-related collision in the Straits.
On September 20, two other cargo ships collided off Pintu Gedung,
Port Klang, some 40 kilometers west of here, with minimal damage
to them.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang Condemns New Japan-U.S. Defense Guidelines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) denounced the new Guidelines for
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation as a document meant for war.
</P>
<P>
The Korean Central News Agency said in an article on Friday
that the new Guidelines is a document aimed to reinforce the
activities of aggression of Japan and the United States in the
Asia-Pacific region, with the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea as their main target.
</P>
<P>
Although the new Guidelines contains no explicit definition of
the geographic location of the "areas surrounding Japan", the
agency said, Japan and the United States have set the Korean
peninsula as a target during their 16-month review of the 1978
Guidelines before the new one was published in New York on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new Guidelines is a plot of Japan and the United States
designed to undermine peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific
region and the rest of the world, said the KCNA.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Israeli Tourism Suffers Loss for Security Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli tourism
industry is now suffering loss for worrisome security situation in
the country, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted tourism officials as saying the two suicide
bombing attacks in late July and early this month that killed 25
people have frightened foreign tourists off.
</P>
<P>
They said the number of foreign tourists has dropped this
summer as compared to the same period of last year. But they
stopped short of giving an up-to-date figure.
</P>
<P>
Climate Haze, head of Jerusalem Hotel Association, said "people
hesitate before they book (hotel) at the last minute, waiting to
know whether something is happening or isn't happening in this
part of world."
</P>
<P>
Haze also noted that in the coming Jewish holiday season in
October, only two or three days of full occupancy is expected for
hotels in the country, and the occupancy for other holiday days
may run at a rate of just 35 to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the hotel industry may cut staff members in view
of the difficult financial situation resulted from the lack of
visitors.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace has been in crisis since Israel
began the construction of a new Jewish settlement construction in
east Jerusalem last March. And a serious of bombing attacks
against Israel by Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) deepened
this crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between two sides remain high and Israel security
forces maintain a state of alert for fear of more bombing
attacks.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- About 10,000 workers from
nearly 15 commercial farms in the enterprise farming area, about
35 km east of Harare along Mutoko Road, are striking for higher
wages.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in the history of this country that
farm workers have collectively gone on strike, local daily "The
Herald" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The workers, who are demanding an increase of about 135
percent on their present minimum wage of 359.59 Zimbabwe Dollars
(about 30 U.S. Dollars) a month, yesterday threatened not to
return to work until the minimum wage is hiked to 848 Zimbabwe
Dollars (nearly 80 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Farmers have offered the workers a monthly minimum wage of 460
Dollars (over 40 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The workers downed tools on Thursday morning and formed a
human wall across Mutoko Road, disrupting movement of traffic for
almost six hours.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said traffic queues stretching for more than five
kilometers were formed as the angry farm workers assembled in the
middle of the road singing revolutionary songs and chanting
slogans.
</P>
<P>
The striking workers were still gathered at their respective
farms by yesterday afternoon. At some farms, the riot police were
on guard, the report added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the workers at Budolphia farm, Luckmore
Karombo, said the workers would not be threatened, hence they
would not budge.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has expressed
disappointment over the failure by its business sector to seek
financial support from existing international financial
institutions set up to assist the development of African nations.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Finance Minister of Zimbabwe Misheck Chinamasahe told
delegates to a symposium on the development of the Beira Corridor
on Friday that his government had observed with concern that
Zimbabwe's private sector is reluctant to borrow money from the
Preferential Trade Area (PTA) Bank and the African Development
Bank (ADB).
</P>
<P>
He said what concerned the government most was that the
business sector, which appeared to lack sources of financial
support, is not borrowing money from the PTA bank to which
Zimbabwe is the second largest contributor of financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
"This means we are putting money in the bank for others to
use," said he, adding, "I think there is need to change this
attitude and start considering borrowing money from such
institutions as the ADB and the PTA Bank."

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will hold national
census on August 18, 2000, reported local daily "The New Vision"
today.
</P>
<P>
Francis Mukama, under secretary in the Ministry of Planning
and Economic Development, was quoted as saying that the census
will be a big and lengthy undertaking, requiring 30 million U.S.
Dollars. He called upon donors to finance the exercise.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at the Statistics Department, there
will be no curfew or restriction of movement of people on that
day.
</P>
<P>
They said, "there was no curfew in the last census of 1991 and
the country registered the best performance in sub-Sahara
Africa."
</P>
<P>
The census will be conducted in three major phases, employing
55,000 people in the pre-enumeration, enumeration and post
enumeration phases.
</P>
<P>
The 1991 census measured Uganda's population at 16.67 million.
About half of the population is under 15 years old, leading to a
high demand for social services such as education and health
care.
</P>
<P>
The annual population growth rate had declined from a high of
3.8 percent through the 1960s to an average of 2.5 percent
between 1980 and 1991, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel has asked the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) for help in the search for
seven Israelis who went missing Friday while traveling in the West
Bank, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The seven Israelis traveled in a white car from the Tumon
settlement near the West Bank city of Nablus to another
settlement Friday afternoon, but later were seen heading in the
direction of Jericho. Israeli police suspected the driver of the
car of having lost his way during the trip.
</P>
<P>
Massive Israeli police and border troops dispatched to search
the West Bank found no clues to the whereabouts of them until
midnight.
</P>
<P>
The search was resumed this morning, and Israeli police hoped
to get information about the missing people with the help of the
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
The radio has called on witnesses who had spotted the missing
people and the car to report to the police.
</P>
<P>
One assumption was that they might have been kidnaped by
Islamic militants in retaliation for the recent wave of mass
arrests of Palestinian extremists launched by Israel and the PNA,
although the possibility of an traffic accident has not been
ruled out.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Lands and
Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said on Friday he will lead
a delegation of Zimbabwean farmers to visit Mozambique soon to
examine investment opportunities in the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government indicated there are five districts
in which it could facilitate investment by Zimbabwean farmers
intending to embark on farming businesses individually or in
joint venture with local farmers, Kangai told delegates to a
symposium on developing Beira Corridor in Mutare, east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The invitation the Zimbabwean side received to visit
Mozambique followed a number of protracted discussions between
the Zimbabwean embassy in Mozambique and the Maputo
Administration prompted by complaints by Zimbabwean farmers that
their efforts to invest there were being frustrated by investment
laws of that country.
</P>
<P>
Kangai said an agreement between the Zimbabwean farmers and
the Beira Port Authority on improvement of the bulk grain storage
terminal will soon be signed following a number of negotiations
by the two parties.
</P>
<P>
He allayed fears among white commercial farmers in Zimbabwe
that they might lose their farms as the government strives to
provide land to former freedom fighters and the rural poor.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Claim Gains Near Rivals' Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Islamic Taliban
militia claimed today they had made major gains around the
opposition stronghold of Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 km north of the
Afghan capital of Kabul, Taliban sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces have seized areas within 15 km of
Mazar-e-Sharif, Afghanistan's second largest city and the only
major city not in the hands of the Taliban, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, no independent confirmation of the claim was
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Taliban fighters were reportedly within 35 km north
and east of the city, but there were no reports Saturday on the
whereabouts of those frontlines.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks, Mazar-e-Sharif, the headquarters of
the anti-Taliban northern alliance, has been under Taliban attack.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control two-thirds of the Afghan territory
and the capital of Kabul, briefly controlled Mazar-e-Sharif
airport early this month but were forced to retreat in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Taliban forces are led mainly by ethnic Uzbek warlords
Rashid Dostum and Abdul Malik, Tajik warlord and Afghanistan's
former military chief Ahmad Masood and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat.
</P>
<P>
The alliance, who announced Mazar-e-Sharif as their capital,
has been battling the hard-line militia in northern, central and
western Afghanistan since the Taliban seized Kabul last September.

JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- South African armymen
will go to Saudi Arabia for training, defense minister Joe Modise
said at the weekend after meeting his Saudi counterpart prince
Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Modise said they discussed possible cooperation between the
two countries, covering "exchange of training, exchange of
know-how, and culture, sports and all those things".
</P>
<P>
He said they did not talk about arms sales, saying that "i am
leaving that for the defense companies."
</P>
<P>
South African foreign affairs department officials said last
week that a proposed deal, under which Pretoria will sell long
range artillery to Riyadh, will be discussed during Aziz's visit
to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Local press said Saudi Arabia was negotiating an arms for
petrol deal with South Africa, but neither side has confirmed the
report.
</P>
<P>
South African president Nelson Mandela said on Thursday after
meeting Aziz that he hoped to clinch a deal with Saudi Arabia to
supply oil to South Africa when he visited the gulf state in
November.
</P>
<P>
"Discussions are going on on trade and economic cooperation
and on cultrual cooperation, but ahead of all that is cooperation
in the oil field," Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the discussions between Pretoria and
Riyadh represented a move by the former to lessen dependence on
Iran, which currently supplies more than two-thirds of the
country's imports of crude oil.

MADRID, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Barcelona coach Louis van Gaal
friday said he would not play Bulgarian international striker
Hristo Stoichkov until he changed his attidude, according to
reports from Barcelone.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov has criticised Van Gaal several times for keeping him
on the bench.
</P>
<P>
He has not started a game this season with Van Gaal favouring
his two Brazilian summer signings, Sonny Anderson and Rivaldo.
</P>
<P>
"Stoichkov has abused Barcelona," van Gaal said.
</P>
<P>
The falling out could lead to the departure of the outspoken
Stoichkov from the club he has played for since 1990, apart from
one season with Italian side Parma.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian media said earlier in the week that Stoichkov
wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
Stoichkov's contract in Barcelona ends next year.
</P>
<P>
It is likely there would be plenty of offers for the striker
who has scored 83 goals in the Spanish first division in his six
seasons with Barcelona.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Illiteracy in Dar es
Salaam region of Tanzania has been reduced by 7.3 percent
following this year's Adult Education Examination assessment,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Minister of State in the Prime Minister's
Office, Musa Nkhangaa as saying that in a year the region has
reduced the number of illiterates from 729,058 to 690,131,
leaving 337,285 men and 352,846 women still unable to read and
write.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the climax of the Adult Education Week, this week,
Nkhangaa said, "I am happy that the Dar es Salaam City Commission
is trying its best by using different strategies to reduce the
illiteracy rate in the country."
</P>
<P>
However, he challenged the commission, saying the illiteracy
rate is still high, calling for dire need to reduce it even
further.
</P>
<P>
He noted that bringing about development in a city with such a
big number of illiterates would be difficult, stressing that all
campaigns being made by the Dar es Salaam City Commission towards
development would not succeed if instructions were directed to
the people who could not know how to read, write and count.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that the government will increase the education
budget whenever the budget allows. However, he also urged the
commissions and municipalities in the country to contribute to
the adult education budget because the government alone cannot
bear the burden.

<HEADLINE> Indian Govt Urged to Take Up Subsidy Issue with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Federation of Indian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) has expressed serious
concern about the move of the European Union (EU) taking
unwarranted recourse to treating the country's export oriented
scheme like duty exempted pass book (DEPB) as export subsidy,
FICCI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The reported move of the EU to initiate new trade restrictive
measures against India, either directly or through World Trade
Organization (WTO) mechanism, is very unfortunate and the basis on
which the decision is taken is wrong.
</P>
<P>
This only convincingly proved that non-tariff barriers mostly
in disguised forms like anti-dumping measures, discriminatory
trading policies and marketing and the like are on a constant rise
even after the establishment of WTO, FICCI sources further said.
</P>
<P>
In a communication addressed to the Commerce Ministry, FICCI
has urged the government to take up the issues and make fullest
use of the inter-governmental machinery as of the WTO system to
restrain the European Community's move.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission needs to be first convinced that the
DEPB is in no way a subsidy. It is merely meant to mitigate the
cost inflating burden of various taxes across the production line.
On the contrary, subsidies are more common in developed countries.
Agriculture sector, for instance, even after two years of the
establishment of WTO, is heavily subsidized in the EU, FICCI
sources added.

<P>
BANGKOK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh's government survived a no-confidence vote at
parliament this morning.
</P>
<P>
In the 393-seat House of Representatives, 212 MPs supported the
government, while 170 were against the government.
</P>
<P>
The six-party coalition government commands 221 seats in the
House.
</P>
<P>
The voting took place this morning after a three-day
no-confidence debate, during which opposition MPs focused their
attacks on the government's mismanagement of the economy and
suspected corruption by some Cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Sources of Chart Pattana (national development) Party, the
second largest party in the government, said that after the
survival of the motion, the prime minister is likely to make a
major reshuffle of the government, to bring in more technocrats in
an effort to revive the country's ailing economy, and to improve
the government's image by dismissing some Cabinet members who are
suspected to be involved in corruption or are deemed incompetent.

<HEADLINE> 24 Mafia Members Get Life Sentence for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 26 (Xinhua) - A Sicilian court today sentenced
24 Mafia members to life in prison for the 1992 murder of leading
anti-Mafia prosecutor Giovanni Falcone.
</P>
<P>
Another six mafiosi received prison terms of between 15 to 26
years for the same murder, while nine defendants were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
Falcone, a Sicilian, revolutionized Italy's war on the Mafia by
tracking financial records and persuading captured mafiosi to turn
state's evidence. He was killed with his wife and three bodyguards
outside the Sicilian capital Palermo in May 1992 when their cars
passed a road culvert packed with explosives.
</P>
<P>
The murder sparked a major crackdown against the Mafia, which
eventually led to the arrest of several top Mafia criminals.
</P>
<P>
Today's sentence came after 107 hearings that began on February
21, 1995. About 269 witnesses were called to testify.
</P>
<P>
Giovanni Brusca, the most senior member of the Mafia to be
captured in the past year, received a 26-year sentence instead of
life because he admitted to using the remote control device that
triggered the blast.
</P>
<P>
Giuseppe Agrigento received an 11-year sentence for
transporting the explosives for the murder.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cambodian Economy Suffers in Wake of Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's once-buoyant
economy has been stopped in its tracks by July's violent turmoil
and its aftermath is attracting international attention and
sparking deep worries at home.
</P>
<P>
At the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund in Hong Kong earlier this week, Cambodian Finance
Minister Keat Chhon called for international help to stop his
country from slipping into anarchy or even war again because of
its economic deterioration.
</P>
<P>
After United Nations-run elections in May, 1993, a coalition
government was formed in Cambodia. Prince Norodom Ranariddh and
Hun Sen, representing the Funcinpec Party and the Cambodian
People's Party respectively, became the first and second prime
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Soon the new government began to massage the bruises of the
war-torn country. Foreign aid and investments, accounting for
nearly half of its budget, poured in and served as "first aid" to
the recovery of the ailing economy and the huge reconstruction
effort.
</P>
<P>
However, in early 1996, bitter rivalry over the allegiance of
defecting Khmer Rouge units and rows over power-sharing plagued
their administration and the economy was deeply affected.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of July 1997, troops loyal to these two
parties were involved in a violent clash near the
capital. Ranariddh was accused of importing illegal weapons and
having clandestine contacts with the Khmer Rouge. He was soon
ousted and the post was filled by Foreign Minister Ung Huot.
</P>
<P>
This sparked various responses from the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Most nations regarded it as Cambodia's internal affair and
continued to maintain normal diplomatic and trade relations with
Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
But some other countries, including the United States, claimed
that the ouster of the democratically-elected prime minister by
force was nothing but a coup. They imposed economic sanctions on
Cambodia. The amount of aid withheld amounted to more than 100
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) delayed its
consideration of Cambodia's bid for membership on grounds that
Cambodia in its present condition could not fulfill the duties of
a member state of the regional bloc.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the U.N. decided to leave Cambodia's seat in the
world body vacant during its 52nd General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
All this has exerted a strong negative influence on the
Cambodian economy and influenced foreign investors to reconsider
their investment plans in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Since July, tariffs on exports and imports as well as tourist
earnings, the two key contributors to the country's revenue, fell
to rock bottom. There have been almost no imports since then.
</P>
<P>
Keat Chhon said Cambodia's tourist earnings in 1996 were more
than 100 million dollars. But this year earnings dropped in a free
fall. Many hotels and restaurants have to be closed for lack of
customers.
</P>
<P>
Some economists say Cambodia's economic growth rate decreased
from a projected 7 percent to lower than 3 percent, causing the
unemployment rate, prices and inflation to surge. Riel, the
Cambodian monetary unit, lost value sharply. The exchange rate
between riel and dollar decreased to 3700:1 from the pre-July
level of 2700:1.
</P>
<P>
To reverse the economic decline, the Cambodian government is
taking a series of measures including more favorable investment
policies, simplification of investment application procedures,
deep cuts in government expenditures, a reduction of the financial
deficit, and more tourist privileges.
</P>
<P>
Analysts contend that political stability, a prerequisite for
economic recovery, will be hard to achieve before general
elections next May. And the actual recovery of the Cambodian
economy is unlikely to occur until battered confidence, both at
home and abroad, begins to heal.

<HEADLINE> Italy's GDP to Grow 1.3 Percent This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy's gross domestic product
(GDP) will grow 1.3 percent this year, the Prometeia research
center said today.
</P>
<P>
With 1997, "one of the longest periods of restrained growth in
our economy will end, along with the uncertainties of economic
analysts, " the Bologna-based think tank said in its report.
</P>
<P>
The rosy forecast exceeded the predictions by the Italian
government, employers' association Confindustria, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic forecasts on 1997 growth came from the
government's three-year economic and financial plan and the IMF,
which saw Italy's GDP will increase 1.2 percent in the year.
</P>
<P>
Prometeia said that the trend will continue into 1998 and 1999
which will see Italy's GDP increase 2.3 percent and about three
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The resurgence in the Italian economy will be supported by
similar progress throughout Europe, ushering in an era of low
interest rates, low inflation and stable currencies, it said.
</P>
<P>
Short-term interest rates in Italy will fall to levels not seen
since the 1950s and 1960s, said Prometeia.
</P>
<P>
Italy's discount rate presently stands at 6.25 percent, a 22
year low. Inflation will close 1997 at two percent against the 2.5
percent expected.
</P>
<P>
Prometeia said that to consolidate these levels, the economy
needs more competition and protected sectors need to be opened.
</P>
<P>
Italy will satisfy the three percent deficit-GDP ratio called
for in the Maastricht Treaty for entry into the European monetary
union thanks to lower interest rates and renewed economic growth,
said Prometeia.
</P>
<P>
The ratio will be 2.8 to three percent in 1998-99 because of
difficulties in containing public spending after the restrictions
enacted in 1997-98, it said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rupiah Plunges to Historic Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rupiah fell to a
historic low against the U.S. dollar Friday while share prices
lost 1.6 percent, dealers and brokers here said today.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said the rupiah fell to a new low of 3,125 to
the greenback at midday from an opening of 3,035 before settling
at 3,100/22 at close.
</P>
<P>
This was the lowest level since the rupiah was floated on
August 14. the previous low was 3,070 on August 29.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rupiah's fall was triggered by several
factors, ranging from usual weekend short-covering in dollars to
corporate hedging and fears about possible down-grading in the
country's credit rating outlook.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah's low coincided with the end of five days of gains
on the Jakarta Stock Exchange, which saw the composite index
falling 9.300 to close at 549.920 points Friday.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers attributed the downturn to profit-taking on the
recent gains as the market had been dominated by retail investors.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and nearly 25 percent since January this year following offshore
speculative attacks on the currency and a rush by local companies
to hedge their foreign borrowings.

<HEADLINE> No Proof for Haze to Cause Indonesia's Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- There is still no solid proof
to show that haze coming from forest fires was the cause of
Friday's Garuda plane crash in Sibolangit, Indonesia's North
Sumatra province, Garuda President Director Supandi said here last
night.
</P>
<P>
"The cause of the incident is still being investigated. We have
already sent a team to study it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Airbus A-300s were made to withstand bad weather and
smoke.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the accident was feared to have been
caused by haze coming from forest fires on Sumatra Island.
</P>
<P>
Due to forest and ground fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan,
several parts of the country have been blanketed by haze.
</P>
<P>
The Garuda Airbus A-300 carrying 222 passengers and 12 crew
members crashed at 13:55 Friday, according to Garuda.
</P>
<P>
At 13:18 the pilot asked for guidance to land at Medan's
Polonia Airport but the communication broke off moments before the
plane crashed.
</P>
<P>
The plane left Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta Airport at 11:30 local
time and was scheduled to arrive at Polonia at 13:40.
</P>
<P>
All the passengers and crew members were killed. There are two
Americans and six Japanese among the passengers, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Supandi said this was the worst incident in Garuda's history.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus A-300 was built by six aircraft manufacturers and
went into service in 1974.

JAKARTA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Water shortages have led to
cholera outbreaks in East Kalimantan and West Java, with 32 people
dead and over 8,100 others requiring medical treatment, local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local health officials said the deaths were due to dehydration
caused by cholera-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
Thirty people have died in the East Kalimantan provincial
capital of Samarinda and two others died in Tangerang, West Java,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Cholera is marked by severe gastrointestinal symptoms
especially acute diarrhea and is caused by a comma-shaped
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
Over 270 people have died in Indonesia's Irian Jaya province
from starvation and cholera after the drought has dried up crops
and clear water sources since mid-August.
</P>
<P>
This year's prolonged dry season, which is believed to be
connected to the El Nino phenomenon, has caused forest and brush
fires as well as the ensuing haze in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The number of people seeking treatment for respiratory
infections has sharply increased across the region caused by
increased particles in the air resulting from the thick smoke
emitted by the fires.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladesh's Major Parties in Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's ruling Awami
(People's) League (AL) and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) are now in virtual confrontation as the political
scenario is changing fast.
</P>
<P>
The head-on clash between the two rivals was triggered by
seemingly small, but highly political and sensitive issues -- ban
on street meetings in the capital city of Dhaka and removal of a
floating bridge from the Crescent Lake in Dhaka, which was used to
connect the residence of late president Ziaur Rahman with the
boulevard in front of the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The scale of agitation reached an extent that prompted BNP
Chairperson Khaleda Zia to declare two-day-long hartals (strikes)
-- in Dhaka on September 22 and countrywide on September 25 -- in
order to toughen her current crusade against the government of
Sheikh Hasina, Chairperson of the AL.
</P>
<P>
The AL also flexed its muscle by deploying the police force
while the BNP demonstrated its organizational strength around the
party's central office protesting the removal of the floating
bridge.
</P>
<P>
A violent clash broke out when police obstructed the BNP
activists from holding a protest rally on the street outside the
BNP's central office.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka Mayor Mohammad Hanif earlier banned all kinds of meetings
on the streets in the capital city for the transportation's sake.
But the BNP ignored the order calling it motivated and influenced
by the AL.
</P>
<P>
The violent skirmishes between police and BNP militants began
on September 18 when police used teargas canisters and rubber
bullets to retaliate the cracker- and stone-throwing militants of
BNP. Many were injured and many others arrested.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, mostly around the BNP's central office, dragged on
for five consecutive days up to September 22 as central Dhaka was
actually turned into mini-battlefields.
</P>
<P>
Jatiya (national) Party, the third largest party in the
country, and other political pro-BNP groups took part in the
agitation to establish what they called people's democratic rights
to hold rallies and processions on street.
</P>
<P>
"This autocratic government has crossed all limits... Build up
resistance from your respective positions against the government,"
Zia ordered her party workers and the people after announcing the
dawn-to-dusk hartal on September 22 in Dhaka and on September 25
across the country. Over 1,000 people were injured during the
September 25 hartal, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
A few days before the violent incidents, Zia announced a series
of agitation from a rally in front of the BNP central office to
press for its various demands. The agitation to be held by the BNP
will culminate in the countrywide road and rail blockade on
October 5.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that despite full-scale street agitation,
the BNP is yet to consolidate its own organizational set-up as
well as its partners in the opposition camp on modalities of
anti-government movement.
</P>
<P>
Insiders say the moderates in the BNP prefer a "go slow"
approach and "strike only when the iron is hot". The hardliners,
however, feel that the time is quite appropriate now to launch an
all-out movement against the government.
</P>
<P>
Apart from conflicting views within the BNP, its possible
allies such as Jamaat-e-Islam have not yet made up their minds for
a united movement with the BNP. Besides, there are basic
differences among these parties to determine the common issues on
the basis of which an effective movement could be launched.
</P>
<P>
Although Jamaat-e-Islam and Jatiya Party simultaneously took
part in the hartal in Dhaka on September 22, it appeared that
these two parties had not been effectively consulted by the BNP
before the announcement of the new hartal programs. So the
presence of workers from the two parties in the hartal was
limited.
</P>
<P>
Besides, police also took a lenient view about the Jamaat
allowing it to hold rallies at street.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the BNP leadership has not yet specified its
political program: whether they want ouster of the government or
an early election. It seems that they are now on an uncertain
journey. The present agitation gained momentum on two immediate
issues -- the right to hold meetings on street and the restoration
of the floating bridge.
</P>
<P>
The current agitation on the two issues may not last long as
common people have no direct involvement. People do not like such
activities as hartals held by the BNP because these hartals always
disturb their normal life.
</P>
<P>
Unless demands involving public interests are tagged with
political demands and the BNP's allies are consolidated further,
the agitation may fall flat, observers say.

<HEADLINE> China To Maintain Stable Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese banking
official affirmed that to keep currency values stable remains the
ultimate objective of China's monetary policy, despite the fact
that the country's economy has been softly landed.
</P>
<P>
Shang Fulin, deputy governor of the People's Bank of China, the
central bank, addressed a banking seminar held here Friday that
China will continue its moderately tight monetary policy
throughout the 1996-2000 period and beyond, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the past four years of macro-control, China has
brought down its once-high inflation rate of 21.7 percent to 1.8
percent in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The banker said that China will use both mechanisms-controlling
demand and ensuring total supply to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank will upgrade cash management and
control the total amount of currency in circulation.
</P>
<P>
It is also necessary to properly manage loan increments and
strictly control the scale of credit of State banks
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China will try to ensure that the market is
effectively supplied with currency through proper increases.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will make use of the credit policy to increase
efforts in adjusting supply and demand structures, Shang noted.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will grant loans to the housing projects for
low income families and increase mortgage loans to residents for
house purchase.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also organize syndicate loans to support the
strategic restructuring of large state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Province Caring for Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Local authorities of
northwest China's Qinghai Province have given top priority to
environmental protection, today's China Daily quoted a leading
local party official as saying.
</P>
<P>
This may alleviate widespread worries about possible
deteriorating environmental conditions in the province as a result
of the government's growing interest in developing the rich
mineral and other natural resources in the remote Chinese province
in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
"We should strive for a coordinated and harmonious balance
between environmental preservation and resources exploitation,"
Tian Chengping, secretary of Qinghai Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), said.
</P>
<P>
The ecological balance in the world's highest land is delicate,
and it cannot easily be restored once it is upset. Moreover, the
headwaters of the Yangtze River and Yellow River are in Qinghai,
and it is extremely important to protect the environment in these
source areas, said Tian.
</P>
<P>
Many water conservation and soil erosion-control activities
have been launched by both governmental and non-governmental
organizations in the past few years to protect the environment of
the source region.
</P>
<P>
With support from the China National Environmental Protection
Agency, one of the projects is an ambitious plan drafted in 1994
by Qinghai and Shenzhen environmental protection bureaux as well
as a Shenzhen-based company.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, four scientific surveys of the environment in
the Yangtze and Yellow River source areas have already started and
will be completed by the year 1999. The plan is aimed at setting
up four nature reserves, which will engage in ecological research
in the source region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, Qinghai Province's industrial production has
increased by an annual average of nine percent. The discharge of
industrial wastewater, gas and residues, however, has been kept
back.
</P>
<P>
Some 44 percent of industrial wastewater in the province is now
treated before being discharged into rivers, compared with 16
percent five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 90 percent of the waste gas emissions are filtered to
reduce dust before being released into the atmosphere, compared
with 48 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
And 28 percent of industrial solid wastes are treated
comprehensively to make them as environmentally clean as
possible.

<P>
ROME, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Italy's gross domestic product
(GDP) will grow 1.3 percent this year, the Prometeia research
center said today.
</P>
<P>
With 1997, "one of the longest periods of restrained growth in
our economy will end, along with the uncertainties of economic
analysts, " the Bologna-based think tank said in its report.
</P>
<P>
The rosy forecast exceeded the predictions by the Italian
government, employers' association Confindustria, the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
The most optimistic forecasts on 1997 growth came from the
government's three-year economic and financial plan and the IMF,
which saw Italy's GDP will increase 1.2 percent in the year.

BEIJING, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The first certificate T-bond
issue of this year, totalling 123 billion yuan (14.8 billion US
dollars) has been finished ahead of its last issuing day,
September 20, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
By the date, certificate T-bond worth 128.5 billion yuan had
been sold out, China Daily quoted officials with the central bank,

The additional sales come from the year's second certificate
T-bond issue, started on September 1, which is worth 40 billion
yuan and scheduled to be completed by the year end.
</P>
<P>
China's major commercial banks have been commissioned to sell
nearly 65 percent of the country's total T-bond issue in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Certificate bond, with higher yields than bank deposits, is
expected to serve as instruments to tap into China's colossal
4,000 billion yuan in personal savings.
</P>
<P>
However, many individual investors have become increasingly
active in the country's upsurging stock market and the booming
insurance industry.

BELGRADE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Momcilo Krajisnik, member of
the Presidency of the Republic of Bosnia, said on television
Thursday night that he will go to great lengths to implement the
reconciliation agreement he reached with Biljama Plavsic,
president of the Republic of Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said he believes that Plavsic will also do her utmost
to carry out the agreement. He pointed out, however, that it would
be disastrous if the agreement were torn up.
</P>
<P>
Krajisnik said the Serb parliament should pass a resolution to
dismiss itself, and he and Plavsic should both resign so elections
could proceed smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Under the reconciliation agreement, Krajisnik said, the Bosnian
Serb parliamentary election will be held on November 15, and the
elections of a Srpska president and a Serb member of the Republic
of Bosnia will start on December 7.
</P>
<P>
He added that only timely elections could help overcome the
political crisis and prevent a split-up of the Srpska republic.
</P>
<P>
The two Serb officials, mediated by Yugoslavian President
Slobodan Milosevic, signed the reconciliation agreement Wednesday
to settle the political crisis and implement the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the reconciliation agreement has raised hopes for
an end to the three-month-long escalating political crisis and for
peace in Bosnia.

<P>
NEW YORK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A government report
indicating steady growth without inflation pleased investors on
Wall Street and sent stocks higher again on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 74.17 points to 7,922.18,
barely giving the index a small gain of 4.91 points for the week.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators also showed their best performance in
four sessions as bonds rebounded from Thursday's stumble, sending
interest rates lower.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rose Friday morning after the Commerce Department
reported gross domestic product grew at a 3.3 percent annual rate
in the April-June quarter, down from an estimated 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The revised data proved to be a more substantial drop from the
4.9 percent rate recorded in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Now fewer analysts expect the Federal Reserve to take any
action by raising interest.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 501.69 million
shares, down slightly from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.31 to 945.22, the

<HEADLINE> Israeli Trade Union Threatens to Hold Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli National
Federation of Trade Unions (Histadrut) has threatened to hold a
nationwide general strike Sunday, after its talks with
the government on workers' pension broke up again today.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut Chairman Amir Perez and Israeli Finance Minister
Yaakov Neeman started the talks this morning for the second day,
trying to reach an agreement on the issue, but ended in failure.
</P>
<P>
The government has proposed that pension funds invest in
non-state bonds for those whose monthly income is more than 1,600
U.S. dollars. Moreover, the government prepares to cut the
additional pension from 60 percent to 3-5 percent, due to the
cuts in the 1998 budget of about 657 million dollars, mainly in
the educational and welfare sectors.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut accused the government of violating the 1995
agreement on pension issue reached between itself and the then
Labor government and putting pension funds at risk. It demanded
the agreement continue to be applied.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1995 agreement, people insured in pension funds can
get, apart from the pension, an addition of 60 percent of the
pension, when retired.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister in today's meeting claimed that the
agreement had never been approved by the government and refused
to make any concession. But he agreed to continue the talks
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The trade union Thursday declared it had planned to wage
general strikes. Neeman flew home a day earlier from the annual
meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in Hong
Kong in an attempt to negotiate an agreement with Histadrut
Chairman Perez. Perez decided to postpone the strike until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two held talks for two hours Thursday night, but reached
no agreement.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Perez said that more than half a million of
Histadrut's members in various sectors would participate in
the strikes if the talks failed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his determination that the general strike would
continue until the government meets their demands.
</P>
<P>
Besides the pension issue, disputes between both sides lie in
several other aspects. Histadrut disagreed to some government
policies aimed at promoting competition in economy. It argued
that the policies would lead to job losses and affect workers'
rights.

ANKARA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz is scheduled to pay an official visit to Germany from
September 29 to October 1, according to a statement issued here
today.
</P>
<P>
The statement from the Prime Ministry Press Center said that
Yilmaz will hold talks with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Yilmaz is expected to take up the
issue of Turkey's application for European Union (EU) membership
during his meeting with Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been making efforts for EU membership, but made
little progress.
</P>
<P>
It has complained that Germany takes a negative attitude to its
EU membership campaign. Some Turkish officials even described Bonn
as a major obstacle to Turkey's efforts to become an EU member.

<HEADLINE> Two Unionist Parties Refused to Talk to Sinn Fein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) - The Democratic Unionist and UK
Unionist parties, representing 40% of Unionist vote, accused David
Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party of "surrender" and
rejected an appeal to attend the peace talks on Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The harsh attitude by the two Unionist parties towards Trimble
marred the general atmosphere of the forthcoming talks next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish Prime Ministers expressed delight at
Wednesday night's breakthrough permitting the start of full-scale
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, said he was "delighted"
by the breakthrough, and reiterated his determination to achieve a
settlement by next May.
</P>
<P>
Blair's Irish counterpart Bertie Ahern said, the "historical
agreement" put the island of Ireland "on the threshhold of a new
era of peace and prosperity".
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came when Trimble settled for less than the
absolute guarantee of some Irish Republican Army disarmament
during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Ian Paisley, leader of the rival DUP, said the UUP had
consigned its stand on decommissioning to "the pit of oblivion"
and left the Union in "the hands of a negotiating body with Sinn
Fein at the steering wheel".
</P>
<P>
He emphatically rejected an appeal from Mo Mowlam, the Northern
Ireland Secretary, to rejoin the talks. However, Mowlam urged him
to re-think his decision.
</P>
<P>
Robert McCartney, leader of the UK Unionist Party, likewise
vowed never to rejoin a process which he believes to design "to
achieve Irish unity".

<HEADLINE> Syria Criticizes Convocation of Doha Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Any economic cooperation with
Israel that comes before progress in the peace process is like
placing the cart before the horse, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh said today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian TV program of Beit Al Arab,
Shareh categorically rejected the Israeli attitudes toward the
Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic conference
cannot work positively in light of the current Israeli policy with
its licking of all the signed accords and obligations, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any economic cooperation with Israel should be the result of
real peace, not vice versa," said Shareh.
</P>
<P>
Drawing a line between the Cairo MENA conference held last
November and the upcoming Doha conference, Shareh said advocates
of the former wanted to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu a chance for a probable change of mind from his
policies, specially that he was sworn in just five months at that
time.
</P>
<P>
"But now it has become quite obvious that Israel does not only
disrespect the pacts, but also persist with its anti-peace
schemes that materialize in many forms," said the Syrian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The Arabs should show the world their actual desire for peace
in order to expose the Israeli policies, he said, warning that
otherwise they would give Netanyahu a pretext capitalizing on Arab
differences.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, informed sources said today Qatar will host the
fourth MENA summit as scheduled on November 16-18 despite a
possible boycott by some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
A recent decision by the Arab League kept the possibility even
much bigger and left Qatar determined to host the conference.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the Arab League during an Arab foreign
ministers' meeting held last week here, granted Arab countries
rights of making free choices, instead of a concerted boycott.
</P>
<P>
Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
have announced their boycott of the summit due to Israeli
participation. Many Arab states would most likely send businessmen
instead of governmental delegations to Doha.
</P>
<P>
Most of other Arab states adopt a wait-and-see stance toward
the summit. Qatar officials said they have not received any
refusal from these countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- President of Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat today Condemned Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's policies on peace process and
sanctions against the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian TV program "Beit Al Arab"
broadcast today, Arafat said Netanyahu does not want peace or
respect the signed agreements, adding that Netanyahu has admitted
that he ignores the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
His criticism came two days after the Israeli government has
decided to build more homes in Efrat settlement in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu announced Wednesday night that his government will
continue to bolster the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
plans to build 300 homes in the Efrat settlement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat slammed Israel's economic sanctions against the
Palestinian self-rule areas, which has caused many Palestinians
vulnerable to starvation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Palestinians lose 9 to 10 million U.S. dollars
every day due to the closure imposed by Israel after two multiple
suicide bombings hit Jerusalem on July 30 and September 4.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of the United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to the PNA-ruled areas, Arafat said
that Albright has reaffirmed the principles based on the United
Nations Security Council resolutions, the land for peace formula,
and the peace accords signed between the PNA and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. stance is positive, yet it needs practical
steps to confront the Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Following Israeli decision to expand the Efrat settlement,
Albright criticized it as inconsistent to the kind of climate for
negotiations that she wanted to create.
