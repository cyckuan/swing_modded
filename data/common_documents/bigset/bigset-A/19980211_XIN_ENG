MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia reiterated its stance
for a peaceful settlement to the crisis over weapons inspections
in Iraq, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Tarasov said
Tuesday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Group Denies Turkish Incursion in Northern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP), one of the major northern Iraqi warring parties, denied on
Tuesday that Turkish troops crossed the border to establish a
security zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A press release faxed to Xinhua by the KDP Ankara Office said
that Turkish media reports regarding the so-called Turkish
incursion are "baseless and inaccurate."
</P>
<P>
"We have not seen any Turkish military movement or any unusual
troop buildup inside northern Iraq. We are also not aware of any
intentions by the Turkish government to establish a security zone
inside Iraq," it said.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that the Iraqi side of the
Turkish-Iraqi border is now under the control of the KDP troops
and the Khabour border crossing point remains open for normal
traffic.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said that several thousand Turkish government
troops have entered northern Iraq in an effort to establish a
buffer zone there.
</P>
<P>
The KDP, which maintains a closer relationship with Ankara,
has been engaging the pro-Iranian Patriotic Union of Kurdistan
(PUK) in fighting since the Iraqi government lost the effective
control of northern Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
They said that the buffer zone is mainly designed to prevent
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) from launching
hit-and-run attacks on southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old war against the
Turkish government for the establishment of an independent Kurdish
state in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Monday, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman
Necati Utkan admitted that Turkey has prepared a contingency
scheme for a possible flood of Iraqi Kurds into Turkey in case the
United States resorts to force to settle its standoff with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he stressed that this does not mean that Turkey
will establish a buffer zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly don't call it a buffer zone. If something
happens, the operation will be more humanitarian and civilian
than a military one," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this operation is aimed at providing food,
medicine, shelter and other daily necessities to the Iraqi
Kurdish refugees if Iraq is hit by the U.S. forces.

<HEADLINE> ITU Agrees on 56K Modem Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Geneva-based International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) has agreed on the technical
specifications for 56K modems and has initiated the formal
approval process.
</P>
<P>
The new recommendation, designated V.90, is expected to be
widely used for applications such as Internet and on-line service
access, the ITU said over the weekend in a press release sent by
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
V.90 modems are designed for connections which are digital at
one end and have only one digital-to-analogue conversion, said the
United Nations agency, which coordinates global communications
standards.
</P>
<P>
According to industry analysts, the ITU agreement will boost
modem sales significantly. VisionQuest 2000, a market researcher,
estimates the number of modems shipped each year likely will rise
to 75 million by the year 2000 from 50 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The V.90 modem harmonizes the two competing proposals submitted
last year. Customers who have purchased 56kbps modems based on
either technology may be able to get software to make their
devices compatible with the new ones developed on the V.90
standard.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa Tuesday
called on local voters to exercise their rights and obligations as
a citizen and cast their vote at HKSAR's first Legislative Council
election in May.
</P>
<P>
Tung raised the appeal when speaking at a Spring reception held
by the Home Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said the year 1998 is important for Hong
Kong as the first Legislative Council election since Hong Kong's
reunification with the motherland will be held.
</P>
<P>
"This election is not only testimony to the progressive
development of Hong Kong's political system, but also an opportune
moment for us to demonstrate to the whole world that we are fully
committed to implementing successfully the concept of 'Hong Kong
people running Hong Kong'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that you will all keep up the enthusiasm and vigor that
 have motivated you in the recent voter registration exercise and
devote your efforts, through you connections with a wide
cross-section of the community, to raising the awareness of Hong
Kong citizens as to their rights and obligations and encouraging
them to turn up at the polls," Tung said.

<HEADLINE> Ogata Appeals for Release of UNHCR Regional Head in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees Mrs Sadako Ogata today appealed for the
immediate release of Vincent Cochetel, UNHCR's head of office in
Vladikavkaz, Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I am profoundly concerned and preoccupied by his continued
detention," Ogata said in a statement. "Mr Cochetel has now been
held for 12 days. His abduction is an attack not only on UNHCR but
on humanitarian organizations world-wide."
</P>
<P>
"The increasing threats to aid workers, whose only aim is to
alleviate the suffering of innocent people, puts the very
foundation of humanitarian work at risk," Ogata said. "To all of
us whose work is based on the principles of neutrality,
impartiality and humanity, this act is an outrage and I condemn it
in the strongest possible terms."
</P>
<P>
"I call on whoever is holding Mr Cochetel to release him
immediately unharmed, and I count on the fullest cooperation of
the authorities in pursuit of this aim," she said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that Cochetel was abducted by three armed men on the
night of January 29. Investigations are underway by authorities
involving federal and local teams in the region. No one has yet
claimed responsibility for his abduction.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR office in Vladikavkaz assists some 100,000 refugees
and displaced people in the region (from Georgia, Chechnya,
Ingushetia and North Ossetia) with a 1998 budget of five million
US dollars. UNHCR has temporarily suspended field operations from
Vladikavkaz due to security concerns.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Unveils Reform Plan for Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday launched a
social and economic reform plan "Program 2010", which is aimed at
creating a new society and a new economy by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The program is described as a "call to all Pakistanis" to join
in the effort to transform the country into a model of economic
and social success.
</P>
<P>
The primary goal of this detailed program, unfolded by Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif here, is to raise income per capita to 1,000
U.S. dollars by the year 2010, which means an average annual
growth of 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on strategic interventions in five
distinct areas, namely, industry and agriculture, exports, science
and technology, social service provision and good governance.
</P>
<P>
An export-led industrialization, especially technology based
industries will be built under the interventions.
</P>
<P>
As a result, manufacturing will play a leading role with its
share in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rising from the current
level of 17 percent to 22 percent by the end of the period, as
industrial output grows at an average rate of 9 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, employment in the industrial sector is expected to
rise from 1 percent to 26 percent of the total labor force.
</P>
<P>
The program also underlines good governance as one of the areas
which need strategic intervention to make the entire program
achieve its goals.
</P>
<P>
Besides the specific measures described in the areas identified
above, the program underlines across the board reforms needed for
the restoration of governance in the country.

<HEADLINE> Italy and Russia Sign Action Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Russia on Tuesday
signed a wide-ranging action plan to shape bilateral relations
for decades, and as Russian President Boris Yeltsin said, "to
boost trade between the two countries one-and-a-half times."
</P>
<P>
The plan of action, was signed by Yeltsin and Italian Premier
Romano Prodi at the beginning of the second day of the Russian
president's state visit here.
</P>
<P>
It is described as the document completing the bilateral
friendship treaty signed here in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The new plan covers such specific sectors as cooperation in
the economic and commercial fields, in cultural affairs and on
technical and scientific matters.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on what he said were "extremely constructive"
consultations with Yeltsin, Prodi said "privileged relations
between Italy and Russia" had been installed.
</P>
<P>
"(Russia) is not only a friendly country, (but) is an integral
part of the reality of Europe," the Italian Premier affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Also today, Italian foreign minister Lamberto Dini and his
Russia counterpart signed a memorandom of understanding on
technical cooperation and a cooperation accord on culture affairs

<HEADLINE> China Lifts Lid on Bank Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The recent lifting of limits
on the scale of loans offered by commercial banks and the adoption
of controls over the debt ratios of the banks will have no
negative effects on activities of the nation's commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the actions will in no way hamper implementation
of the country's key projects and the development of the backward
central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
An official with the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the
country's central bank, made the remark today during an interview
with Xinhua reporters. The official stressed the necessity to
properly address the possible reluctance of banks to grant loans
to enterprises in need.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, the central bank removed limits on the scale of
commercial bank loans. The move, which was widely hailed as a
major reform measure for the banking sector, has drawn wide-spread
attention both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Removing limitations represents a major change in approaches to
conducting macroeconomic controls and will not alter the basic
tasks of commercial banks, said the official, adding that the only
way for banks to survive increasingly fierce competition is to
improve services.
</P>
<P>
Reform has provided commercial banks with a greater say in
matters related to granting loans, and the central bank will
introduce timely readjustments to regulate currency in circulation
in order to ensure the money supply meets the requirements of the
economy, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the country's three policy banks established in
1994, will continue to bear responsibility for major investments in
key state infrastructure projects, foreign trade, grain purchases,
poverty eradication and agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will guide commercial banks in accordance with
state policies for industrial and regional development in order to
ensure implementation of related policies and help provide
financing for otherwise financilly strapped the central and
western areas.
</P>
<P>
Main offices of all commercial banks have the final say
regarding major loans, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit on Conflict Handling Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Lack of quorum has forced the
cancellation of an OAU two-day summit on conflict handling which
was scheduled to open here a Zimbabwean Foreign Ministry official
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conflict Resolution Council of the Organization of African
Unity, which comprises 16 African heads of states, had called for the
meeting amid increasing signs that the west wanted to reduce its
involvement in peacekeeping operations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
''That has been cancelled. I understand that they cancelled
the meeting for lack of quorum as they could not raise the
required eight heads of states,'' said the official confirming
the cancellation.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was to host the summit in
his capacity as OAU Chairman and Head of the Southern African
Development Community Organ on Politics, Defence and Security.
</P>
<P>
The aborted summit would have been a follow-up to last
November's foreign ministers meeting of the OAU organ on Conflict
Management, Prevention and Resolution.
</P>
<P>
The November meeting endorsed Africa's commitment to securing
the continent's peace, security and stability within the
framework of the OAU and U.N. charters.
</P>
<P>
Against that background, the Harare summit was to have
examined the United States, French and British initiatives to
help Africa set up its own peacekeeping operations through
financial assistance and training programes.
</P>
<P>
Since the collapse of the U.N mission in war-ravaged Somalia
in 1993, the U.S. in particular, has been reluctant to engage in
peacekeeping missions in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Kemet Cooperates With Chinese Smeltery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- US-based Kemet Electronics
Corporation, the world's largest manufacturer of tantalum capacitors,
today issued a certificate exempting examinations of products from
a nonferrous metals smeltery in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia Nonferrous Metals Smeletry, located in Shizuishan
in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is China's major tantalum
smeltery and one of the top three producers of its kind in the
world. The smeltery produced 30 percent of the world's total supply
of tantalum wire in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The smeltery began supplying wire to Kemet in 1996
and has since won high praise for the quality of its products.
</P>
<P>
The smeltery will provide some 50 percent of the American
company's tantalum during 1998, according to Kemet Vice President
Charles Culbertsor.
</P>
<P>
The smeltery's foreign exchange earnings by exporting products
to the United States, Germany, England and Japan in 1997 reached
29 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation will help both the smeltery and Kemet reinforce
their competitiveness in the international market, according to
Culbertsor.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Well-Positioned to Deal With Asian Crisis: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy is
well-positioned to handle impact coming from Asia's financial
crisis, the Clinton administration said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The economy is in fundamentally sound shape and well-equipped
to handle any unexpected bouts of rougher weather," it was noted
in President Clinton's annual economic report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
The country's economic growth in 1997, 3.9 percent, was the
strongest in nine years. The unemployment rate, 4.9 percent, was
the lowest in 24 years. And inflation, 1.7 percent, was the best
in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy is strong, our prosperity is deep, our prospects
are bright," Clinton said in releasing the report at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said his economic report projects continued economic
growth through at least the next year. "That would mark the
longest peacetime expansion in the history of the United States,"
the president said.
</P>
<P>
While opposing Republican-initiated tax cuts, Clinton said,
"Let me be clear: fiscal irresponsibility gave us 12 years of
exploding deficits, division, declining wages. Fiscal
responsibility has given us the strongest economy in a generation.
I will not allow a return to the policies that have failed us in
the past."
</P>
<P>
For 1998, the administration expects growth to slow to a 2
percent rate, and it expects unemployment to remain about the same
and inflation to edge up to 2.2 percent. It is widely expected
that Asia's financial problems probably will depress U.S. export
sales and trigger increased imports from the region. But on the
other hand, the crisis has helped stimulate the U.S. economy by
increasing the flow of international money into the United States
and by bringing down U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth, which will begin its eighth year next
month, has created what the Clinton report termed a
"high-employment economy." And that may be starting to reverse a
trend toward greater income inequality that began in the early
1980s, it said.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate has fallen from 15.1 percent in 1993 to 13.7
percent in 1996. It's at a historical low for blacks. And income
growth since 1993 has been strongest for the one-fifth of American
households with the lowest incomes. Nevertheless, one in five
children still lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the poverty rates for blacks and Hispanics remains
nearly triple those of non-Hispanic whites. And the median wealth
of white families, which includes stock market holdings and home
equity, is by some measures 10 times that of black and Hispanic
families.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Reveals Outside Support to S. Leone Junta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said Tuesday that
soliders of the defunct National Patriotic Front of Liberia
(NPFL) had gone to Sierra Leone to support the military junta in
the capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
"Seven truckloads of NPFL soliders were seen moving toward
Freetown Monday to support the junta," Nigeria's defense
spokesman Godwin Ugbo said at a news briefing here Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
NPFL was formerly the largest warring faction led by Liberia's
current president Charles Taylor.
</P>
<P>
But it is yet to be confirmed whether Taylor has any
connection with the latest move of the former fighters.
</P>
<P>
The alleged NPFL enforcement came at the heat of heavy
fighting between the junta forces and the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people, including civilians, have been reportedly
killed in the fighting which broke out last Thursday when ECOMOG
said its soldiers were attacked by soldiers loyal to the junta
led by Johnny Paul Koroma.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG then rose to launch offensive to protect itself and the
push on Freetown by ECOMOG "is still going on", said the
spokesman, adding that "militarily, we want to achieve peace in
Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
He also rejected Koroma's claim that ECOMOG provoked the
attack on the junta forces, saying that it was a propaganda.
</P>
<P>
According to Col. Ugbo, the junta on Saturday put civilian
clothes on their casualties to show news organizations that
ECOMOG killed civilians.
</P>
<P>
The junta also used school children as shield and asked them
to go to the war front, he claimed.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Sierra Leone to enforce sanctions and
embargo imposed by west African countries and the United Nations
on the junta which ousted the legitimate government in a coup
last May.

<HEADLINE> Military Strikes on Iraq Could be Avoidable: Cook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here today the approaching military strikes against Iraq
are not inevitable but he urged Iraq to comply fully with U.N.
Security Council resolutions concerned.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC radio interview today, Cook dismissed press
speculations that the use of force over the U.N.-Iraq standoff was
inevitable by saying: "That's not the case. Military action is not
inevitable. It can be prevented."
</P>
<P>
"What it takes to prevent it is for us to achieve an agreement
from Saddam Hussein that UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission) can go
back to carrying out effective inspections in the way that they
have done for a number of years," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
However, the British Foreign Secretary made it clear that there
is no question of watering down U.N. Security Council Resolutions
on inspection for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"If the Security Council backs off on this occasion, it will
have no credibility the next time," Cook said.

<HEADLINE> OAU, UNICEF Urges Ratification of Landmine Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) Tuesday called for the earlier ratification of
the Ottawa treaty on the banning of anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a joint statement issued at the end
of the talks held at the OAU headquarters here between OAU
Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim and visiting UNICEF Executive
Director Carol Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement said that the OAU and UNICEF had been
working tirelessly to achieve the total ban of anti-personnel
landmines and had made significant contribution in the global
campaign to raise awareness on the issue and to mobilize public
support towards that objective.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed the need to "sustain the momentum and
the political will" generated by the signing in Ottawa, Canada, in
December 1997 of the Convention on the Prohibition of the
Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines
and on Their Destruction.
</P>
<P>
The OAU and UNICEF pledged to work closely to this objective
and "to work together to support efforts aimed at freeing Africa
from this terrible scourge and ensuring that the continent
becomes a 'mine free zone'."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy left here for Angola Tuesday after concluding her
four-day visit to Ethiopia.

JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Black farmers in South
Africa will receive water at a lower rate than commercial
farmers, Minister of Water Affairs Kader Asmal announced Tuesday
in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the parliament that the new legislation
abolished the old relationship between lad ownership and water.
The new change aims to improve the lives of all South Africans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the infant mortality rate is higher in water-deprived
areas than in privileged regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Water supply for South Africa's black majority is one of the
top priorities of the government's Reconstruction and Development
Program.

<P>
The plan aims to correct injustices the new democratic
government inherited from the apartheid regime.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Edges 1.7 Pct in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. productivity
picked up a healthy 1.7 percent in 1997 following a little higher
of 1.9 percent rise the year before, the Labor Department reported
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The growth was double the lackluster 0.8 percent average annual
productivity increase from 1990 through 1995. However, it was a
far cry from the nearly 3 percent a year advances from after World
War II through the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Productivity measures output per hour of work. Its sluggish
growth from the mid 1970s through the mid 1990s is regarded as the
major cause for some economic problems, including sluggish income
growth and widening economic inequality.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew 3.8 percent last year, the best in nine years.
Unemployment fell to a 24-year low of 4.9 percent and inflation
subsided to 1.7 percent, the best in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Last year's gain in nonfarm business productivity came as
output rose 4.5 percent and hours worked increased 2.7 percent.
Compensation per hour rose 3.8 percent, the same as 1997. But,
because inflation was lower, inflation-adjusted compensation
improved, from a 0.8 percent increase in 1996 to a 1.5 percent
gain in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Unit labor costs, a key barometer of inflation pressures, were
up 2.1 percent in 1997, compared with 1.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
In manufacturing alone, productivity increased 4.4 percent, the
best gain in 11 years. Unit labor costs fell 0.9 percent, the
third consecutive annual decline. That partly explains why U.S.
manufacturers have maintained strong profits while holding the
line on prices.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of 1997, productivity grew at a 2 percent
annual rate. That's much better than predicted by economists but
slower than the 3.6 percent rate in the third quarter, the best in
nearly five years.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the 19th
anniversary of the Islamic Revolution, Iranian supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Tuesday granted amnesty for prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA reported the amnesty
covers those prisoners having no previous criminal record in the
past for the same offense and those involved in armed robbery,
theft, kidnaping, raping, setting up corruption centers,
espionage, smuggling of arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners sentenced to two-year prison term will be freed
if they have passed one-fourth of the prison terms until
Wednesday, which marks the victory of the Islamic Revolution in
1979, the report said, and the prisoners who have passed two-third
of their prison terms will be freed.
</P>
<P>
The leader also pardoned the male prisoners aged 65 and above
and the female prisoners aged 55 and above or those whose husbands
have been imprisoned or died and whose minor children have been
left without guardians.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty was approved by the leader in response to a
proposal made by the head of the Judiciary Ayatollah Mohammad
Yazdi, IRNA said, but without mentioning how many prisoners would
be involved in the amnesty.

RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians will
continue to push forward the Middle East peace process despite the
difficulties they are facing, the top Palestinian lawmaker said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Qureia (Abu Ala), speaker of the Palestinian National
Council (PNC), made the remark while discussing with Chinese
Representative to Palestine Liu Zhihai on the new developments in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the Palestinian people's struggle is to
establish their own country on the Palestinian territories and
this goal will be eventually realized, the speaker said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Chinese government and people for their support

<HEADLINE> U.S Tire Giant to Boost Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 10 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. No.1 tire maker
Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. has pledged to add 10 billion U.S.
dollars in new tire sales within five years with a slew of
manufacturing and product improvements, reports from Akron, Ohio
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Samir Gibara, Chairman of the Akron-based corporation,
acknowledged Monday at a press conference that Goodyear took a
"big hit" in Asia from the continuing economic turmoil there. For
1997, the Goodyear reported flat revenue of 13.16 billion U.S.
dollars and noted that a strong U.S. dollar reduced sales by 380
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But Gibara said that he was not "overly concerned" about the
rest of 1998, adding that although the Asian economies "will not
be much better than they are today, we are converting our Asian
Plants to be exporters of tires (to North America and Europe)."
</P>
<P>
The chairman also previewed several technological advances that
he said would eventually help Goodyear surpass France's Group
Michelin and Japan's Bridgestone Cor. in global market share.
</P>
<P>
In a related move, Goodyear is also ready to gradually
introduce a manufacturing process to its 85 factories world-wide
that is expected to cut production times 70 percent, and use 15
percent less material and 35 percent less labor.

<HEADLINE> IEA Cuts Forecast for Non-OPEC Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Energy Agency
(IEA) Tuesday cut its forecast for non-OPEC oil supply increase
for this year but noted that there would still be too much oil on
the world markets.
</P>
<P>
The IEA, the West's Paris-based energy watchdog, slashed its
forecast for oil supply increase from non-OPEC countries this year
by almost a third to 1.34 million barrels per day from 1.86
million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The agency said in its monthly report that the main reason for
the slowdown in supply growth is oil companies could not bring new
crude supplies on stream as quickly as previously thought due to a
lack of drilling equipment and personnel.
</P>
<P>
The report said that "new fields have been delayed, production
at new fields has grown more slowly and decline rates at older
fields have been steeper than expected".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the agency said that non-OPEC oil supply would
exceed demand for at least the upper half of this year, adding
more oil to storage facilities and further pressure on oil prices
which have slided 30 percent since last November.
</P>
<P>
The IEA pointed out that its cutback could offer no help to a
world oil market which is already over-supplied due to a series of
factors, including reduced Asian oil demand and warm Winter
weather in the Northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
It forecast that world oil demand will rise 2.3 percent this
year to 75.34 million bpd, compared with last year's 2.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> PNA Orders Ban on Pro-Iraqi Demonstrations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has issued a ban on future demonstrations in the
territories to support Iraq, Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali as
saying that the PNA has ordered an end to any future
demonstrations in violation of signed peace agreements with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PNA took the action apparently under the pressure from
Israel, which has blasted it for failing to rein in the pro-Iraqi
protests. Palestinian protesters usually burned Israeli and
American flags and clashed with Israeli border soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Palestinians held demonstrations and clashed
with Israeli soldiers to show support to Iraq in the current
crisis over United Nations weapon inspection.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen of Palestinian protesters were wounded in the
West Bank city of Bethlehem by Israeli soldiers who fired tear gas
and rubber bullets to disperse them. On Monday, pro-Iraqi
demonstrations were held in Gaza and the West Bank cities of
Ramallah and Jenin. One protester was injured in Ramallah during
clashes with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In these demonstrations, Palestinian teenagers held pictures of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Protesters chanted anti-Israeli
and anti-American slogans, calling on Iraq to fire missiles
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestine Liberation Organization led by Yasser Arafat
strongly supported Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War, thus damaging
relations with most of the Arab world. This time although the PNA
still supports Iraq, it has called on Baghdad to comply with the
United Nations Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli leaders have strongly condemned the pro-Iraqi protests,
warning they would prevent the peace process from advancing. Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Monday urged the PNA to complete
revising the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israeli destruction
and to accept the existence of Israel.
</P>
<P>
While the Palestinian protests seemed to calm down Tuesday,
there was another pro-Iraqi demonstration on the Israeli-occupied
Golan Heights held by the pro-Syrian Druze and Arab residents. A
general strike was observed among the Druze communities in order
to protest the U.S. threat of using force against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Clinton "Pleased" for Canada, Australia's Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Tuesday that he was "very pleased" to win Canada and
Australia's support in a possible military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony to comment on his annual economic report, Clinton
said he was "very pleased" for "the support we are receiving from
all around the world for our stand against (Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Canada and Australia said on Monday they would offer military
support if diplomatic efforts to settle the stand-off failed and
the United States, unleashes the powerful force it has assembled
in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, Britain, Germany, Canada and Australia expressed
their support to a U.S. military action against Iraq once
diplomacy fails to defuse the current crisis over weapons
inspections. But the Clinton administration has been unable to
draw the same kind of support as in 1991 when the Bush
administration launched "Desert Storm" operation to punish Iraq
for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton said the United States has drawn more and more
allies and friends for its side on the issue of the weapons
inspections crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Friends and allies share our conviction that Saddam must not
be allowed to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons or
the missiles to deliver them," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president repeated his determination to launch an attack if
Baghdad does not back down.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we can avoid the use of force," he said. "But if Saddam
Hussein will not comply with the will of the international
community we must be prepared to act."

LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A man was shot dead in
Dunmurry, southwest Belfast, on Tuesday in what was thought to be
a sectarian attack, police said.
</P>
<P>
The victim, believed to be a Protestant, was sitting in his car
outside a factory in the commuter village of Dunmurry when he was
shot by a man who ran away.
</P>
<P>
A friend said he had been shot and wounded a year ago in an
attack blamed on republicans.
</P>
<P>
Police said the midday attack had all the hallmarks of a
politically-motivated shooting.
</P>
<P>
The man had been waiting for his girlfriend outside the factory
where she worked when the gunman appeared and opened fire.
</P>
<P>
More than 10 people have been killed since Christmas in

<HEADLINE> Iraq Invites Foreign Politicians to Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Tuesday invited foreign
politicians to visit the country to get acquainted with the
standoff with the United Nations over the arms inspections, the
Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Affairs Office of Iraq's ruling Arab Baath
Socialist Party (ABSP) sent out invitations to leading figures of
Arab and foreign countries and political parties to visit Iraq,
ABSP sources told the INA.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Speaker of the Iraqi Parliament Saadoun Hammadi has
invited eight British members of parliament to visit Iraq because
of their positive attitudes towards Iraq and opposition to U.S.
threat to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
To invite foreign politicians to Iraq is aimed at informing
them about Iraq's stance on the crisis "fabricated by the United
States" and the sufferings of the Iraqi people caused by the
"unjust" international sanctions, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred arms inspectors of the United Nations charged
with eliminating its weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential palaces for reasons of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to take military actions to force Iraqi
compliance with the arms inspections if diplomatic efforts
fail. It is stepping up military build-up in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> UK Judge Clears Docklands Bombing Accused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- One of two men accused in
connection with the London Docklands bombing was cleared on the
judge's direction on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The London's Old Bailey court ruled there was insufficient
evidence against Patrick McKinley from Newry, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He was alleged to have converted a lorry into a transporter
which was then used as a mobile bomb.
</P>
<P>
But he had denied conspiring to cause the explosion, which
killed two people, injured 100 and caused extensive damage to the
showcase business district that is the focal point for the
redevelopment of disused docklands to the east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The bomb ended a 17-month ceasefire by the Irish Republican
Army (IRA) in its long-running campaign to gain Northern Ireland's
independence from Britain.
</P>
<P>
The IRA restored its truce last July to win a seat for its
political wing, Sinn Fein, at multi-party talks aimed at producing
a settlement to three decades of conflict that have claimed more
than 3,200 lives.

<HEADLINE> UK Govt to Stand Firm Despite Lords Press Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- A Lords amendment aimed at
outlawing cut-price newspaper campaigns will not pass into law,
Prime Minister Tony Blair's official spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Britain's unelected upper house voted on Monday -- by 121 votes
to 93 -- for a Liberal Democratic amendment to the Competition
Bill.
</P>
<P>
The debate centered around the tactics used by newspaper magnet
Rupert Modoch, who controls 40 percent of the British national
newspaper market, to double the circulation of the Times over the
last five years.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said at a press briefing: "This amendment will
not become law. It doesn't add to the effectiveness of the bill
and singles out one company in a way that is unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
He said the government believed in competition and believed its
bill adequately addressed the problem of predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that Labor government's attitude had anything to
do with Blair's relationship with Murdoch who supported Blair
during last May's election.
</P>
<P>
For a period in 1993 the Times dropped its price to 10 pence
(16 cents) compared with the 40-45 pence charged by its rivals. It
is still charging only 20 pence for its Monday edition. The paper
is owned by News International, part of Murdoch's News Corp Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Survey Says More Europeans Fear Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- More than half of all
Europeans fear a single currency, although 75 percent expect the
new currency named euro to be launched in early 1999, according to
a survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, published by the British Demos think-tank on
Monday, said that the planned single currency and the admission of
more member states will make the European Union (EU) more powerful
than ever before, yet throughout Europe support for the EU is in
decline.
</P>
<P>
Only 46 percent of Europeans support their country's membership
of the EU and just 41 percent think their country benefits from
membership, the lowest levels ever, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that the EU was unpopular because it
had spent 40 years getting bogged down in bureaucratic details and
lost track of its original mission.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said that people mostly wanted the EU to do
things individual governments cannot easily do, such as create
jobs, tackle international crime and terrorism, protect the
environment and thrash out a common defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the EU devotes more time and money to the Common
Agricultural Policy and European Monetary Union than to anything
else -- priorities for just nine percent of Europeans, the Demos
poll said.

ATHENS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday condemned the
assassination attempt against Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze, saying that it was unacceptable for disputes to be
resolved in "such a manner."
</P>

Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Shevardnadze was a figure who ensured
stability in Georgia and played "a positive role" in international
developments.
</P>
<P>
Gunmen reportedly opened fire on Shevardnadze's car Monday
night as he returned to his residence in southern Tbilisi, killing
one of his bodyguards, but the president himself survived the
attack.
</P>
<P>
It was the second attempt to kill the Georgian president since
August 29, 1995, when he suffered minor injuries in a bomb
explosion in his motorcade.

<HEADLINE> Ice Storm Causes Severe Damage in Northeastern U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 10 (Xinhua)-- The Severe ice storm which hit
northeastern part of the United States caused some one billion
U.S. dollars in damage to the forest in the region, the USA Today
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The damage will leave behind long-term hazards for hikers and
the potential for severe forest fires over the next few Summers,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
State and federal officials in New England said that about 18
million acres--half of the region's forest land, were damaged
when the five days of freezing rain across New York, New
Hampshire, Vermont and Maine coated trees with as much as 4 inches
of ice.
</P>
<P>
More than five million acres in the region are listed as
severely damaged, according to the report. In hard-hit areas, the
equivalent of 1,000 feet of lumber was destroyed on each acre.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these areas look like they were ripped apart by
bombs," a local forest service official said.
</P>
<P>
Shattered limbs dangling in trees and fallen debris are of
immediate concern to officials, who fear for the safety of
lumbermen, cross-country skiers and snowmobilers. Hikers will face
dangers for years to come, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Oman Agrees to Be Used as Base Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Oman has agreed to allow
U.S. warplanes to be positioned in the country as part of the
U.S.-British military buildup to launch a possible strike on Iraq,
the Omani News Agency monitored here reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted informed sources in Oman's capital Muscat as
saying that five U.S. KC-10 tankers will be sent to the Gulf
country "in the next week" to beef up U.S. airforces based in the
Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
The refuelers will be used to air refuel B-52 bombers flying
from Diego Garcia, an island in Indian Ocean, the sources said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said that he has obtained
Oman's pledge to back the military action against Iraq during his
visit to Muscat Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is to fly to Russia after ending his tour to all the
capitals of the six Gulf Arab states, namely, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit to the UAE Tuesday afternoon, Cohen said
his tour was aimed at rallying Gulf support for the U.S.-British
military action against Baghdad, which will take place if
diplomatic efforts fail to get Iraq to allow U.N. arms inspectors
access to suspected chemical or biological weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
He said he was expecting more offers of support from both
inside and outside the Gulf for the use of force against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
So far, of the Gulf states, Kuwait and Bahrain have reportedly
agreed to allow U.S. warplanes to hit Iraq from their soil, while
Saudi Arabia has refused to do so. The stances of the UAE and
Qatar were unclear.
</P>
<P>
The six Gulf Arab states are to hold a meeting of foreign
ministers in Kuwait Wednesday to discuss the Iraq-U.S. crisis
triggered off by Iraq's denial of U.N. arms inspectors access to
its presidential sites suspected of hiding weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said there is "a real coalition" against Iraq now and
he cited Canada, Australia, Germany, Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman as
nations who back the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"This is a real coalition. These are countries who are
pledging their assistance and material support," he said during
his visit to the UAE.
</P>
<P>
U.S. military officials in the Gulf said that 3,000 ground
troops are being sent to Kuwait as part of contingency plans and
all U.S. forces would be in place in the Gulf within a week or 10
days.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Forces Tanzania to Cut Down Expenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has announced that the government will take
drastic measures to cut down expenses following devastating
floods caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly Tuesday in the new capital of
Dodoma, he said the use of vehicles by state officials in
Tanzania, one of the poorest countries in the world, was not
understood by common people and donors.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who came to Dodoma to brief the legislators on the
grave impact of El Nino on the national economy, said the
government will curb the rampant use of public vehicles by
officials for private purposes.
</P>
<P>
The country needs as much as 70.4 billion shillings (about 110
million U.S. Dollars) to restore infrastructures and services
damaged by floods since last December, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president expressed disappointment that a number of
officials turn a deaf ear to the directive that after 6:00 p.m.
government-owned vehicles are prohibited to go out unless
authorized. He said many vehicles continue to roam around
especially during weekends.
</P>
<P>
He also lashed out at the excessive use of telephones and
electricity.
</P>
<P>
Seminars, workshops and symposiums should be cancelled unless
they are sponsored by donors, said Mkapa, who at the same time
appealed to the donors to direct the funds for workshops to other
core sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The president announced that local and overseas trips should
be drastically reduced. When necessary, the government should
take advantage of foreign ambassadors instead of dispatching
officials for trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to members of parliament to bring less technical
experts with them to Dodoma, where parliament is based, so that
expenses for trips could be saved.

KUWAIT CITY, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Canadian envoy Mark Byron
arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit to discuss with Kuwaiti
officials the crisis over arms inspection in Iraq, the Kuwaiti
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Byron said Canada will side with the United
States in a possible attack on Iraq to force it to grant free
access to U.N. arms inspectors its presidential palaces suspected
of hiding weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He said he came here also to discuss the issue with the Kuwaiti
side and "lay our support to our Kuwaiti partners."
</P>
<P>
The crisis was triggered by Iraq's denial of the access to the
U.N. arms inspectors in charge of eliminating its weapons of mass
destruction to 68 sites, including presidential palaces, for
reasons of national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to resort to force against
Iraq if diplomatic efforts of the international community fail to
end the standoff.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said last week that
Canada will provide military support to any possible U.S. attacks
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Byron will hold talks with Kuwaiti
officials on ways of promoting bilateral relations and other
issues of common concern, the news agency said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Revenue 9 Percent Up in 5 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The government Tuesday
said it has collected 3,104.6 million Birr (449 million U.S.
Dollars) in revenue over the past five months of the current
fiscal year, 9 percent more than the same period of last fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the House of People's Representatives, Girma
Biru, Minister of Economic Development and Cooperation, said the
5-month performance accounts for 44 percent of the total 7.01
billion Birr (1,016 million Dollars) planned to be collected
through the fiscal year, the Ethiopian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Biru said, the nation has secured 1,177.5 million Birr (170
million Dollars) from the export trade over the same period which
shows a 25 percent increase compared to the income generated
during the same period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A budget surplus of 500.3 million Birr (72.5 million Dollars)
was registered over the past five months starting July 8, owing
to low spending against the revenue earned and the government was
in a position to effect payments amounting to 735 million Birr
(106.5 million Dollars) to government banks and other financial
institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said that gross national product will
increase by 2.8 percent backed with the boost expected from the
industry and service sectors although agricultural production could
fall by 2.4 percent against the produce obtained last year.

<P>
LUANDA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government and the
former rebel UNITA movement Tuesday agreed to reduce the guards
for UNITA chairman Jonas Savimbi from 400 to 150 within nine
months.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had differed on the deadline set for the
reducement of Savimbi's guards, with the government saying the
task should be completed in three to four months and the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) arguing for 18
months.
</P>
<P>
Finally, under the coordination of Behrroz Sadry, U.N. deputy
representative in Angola, and representatives from the peace
process observer nations, the two sides reached agreement on the
issue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the UNITA have been making efforts to
ensure the end of the peace process as scheduled on February 28,
said Higino Carneiro, government spokesman in the Joint Committee
for the Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
According to Carneiro, the government is determined to
implement all terms in the 1994 Lusaka Peace Accord before the
prescribed date. However, he said he hoped the UNITA should also
have the determination to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Donald Steinberg, the U.S. ambassador to Angola who was
present at the meeting, expressed satisfaction over the
agreement, saying that given the speed of development such as
Tuesday's, the peace process would surely end before the
prescribed date.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, the government side said the meeting between
President Eduardo dos Santos and Savimbi will be held in the near
future, but no date was given.

<HEADLINE> French National Assembly Adopts Shorter Work Week Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The French National Assembly
adopted Tuesday afternoon a law on shorter work week which was one
of the most controversial laws presented by the Socialist
government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, all French enterprises with more than 20
workers will reduce weekly working time from 39 hours to 35 hours
from the year 2000, and those with fewer than 20 workers will
implement the law from 2002.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the leftwing majority, including Socialists,
Communists and members of Green Party and some other left groups,
voted for the law with 316 votes for, while the deputies of
rightwing oppositions cast 254 votes against.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist government regards the shorter work week plan as
one way to create more jobs for cutting the 12.2 percent
unemployment rate of the country.
</P>
<P>
But the plan was rejected by the leaders of the opposition
Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy and some of
the country's business leaders.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac also expressed his reserve over the
law several times and once described it as "hazardous
experiment."

<HEADLINE> Floods Kill 87 in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Devastating floods in
Tanzania have killed 87 people and injured 118 others, President
Benjamin Mkapa said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly in the new capital of Dodoma
in central Tanzania, the president said by January 28, the floods
caused by the El Nino phenomenon since last December had also
rendered 155,000 people homeless.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 128,000 hectares of farmland in 13 regions cannot
be cultivated, which means 1998/1999 will experience a severe
shortage of food, Mkapa said while briefing the members of
parliament on the grave problems of the floods.
</P>
<P>
He said the country needs as much as 70.4 billion Shillings
(about 110 million U.S. Dollars) to restore infrastructures and
services damaged.
</P>
<P>
According to him, parts of the strategic central railway used
to haul goods have been submerged especially in the Kilosa
District. Repair work will take more than six months.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 tons of cargo destined for neighboring
landlocked countries are stranded at the Dar es Salaam port due
to the disrupted railway sections. Transportation of passengers
have also been seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
The rains have also fueled the outbreak of cholera which
claimed 76 lives this year, Mkapa noted.
</P>
<P>
The president said several donors have promised to provide
assistance to repair the essential facilities with the World Bank
pledging a grant of 12.6 billion Shillings (19.7 million US
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mkapa urged members of parliament to team up with the people
in mobilizing local resources to restore damaged services.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China is making efforts
towards a diplomatic solution to the issue of Iraq, Qin Huasun,
Chinese Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks following the announcement by the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations on the forthcoming visit to China by
its Envoy Bill Richardson.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Richardson will be visiting China on February 15 as
a special envoy of President Bill Clinton. The two sides will
mainly exchange views on the issue of Iraq," Qin told reporters at
the lobby of the U.N. Security Council Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to stress here that China always believes that
international disputes should be resolved by peaceful means and is
not in favor of resolving the current crisis by force.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the use of force will not be conducive to the
promotion of cooperation between Iraq and the UNSCOM, nor to the
final settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM is a U.N. special inspection commission in charge of
dismantling arms of mass destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, it will result in heavy human casualties, heighten
regional tensions and even trigger more serious conflicts,"
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, China is now making efforts towards a
diplomatic solution, and remains in full contacts with all the
parties concerned," he added.

<HEADLINE> Shevardnadze: Russian Bases in Georgia not Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian military bases on
Georgian territory will not be blocked as long as Eduard
Shevardnadze remains the president of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
This remark made by Shevardnadze on Tuesday in a "Hero of the
Day" live program of the Russian NTV television company was in
view of a proposal to hold an investigation at the Russian
military bases, which was put forward at a meeting of the Georgian
parliament on Tuesday in connection with the attempt on the
president's life.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that some Georgian deputies think of "the hand of
Moscow" in the tragic event. The allegation provoked
dissatisfaction from the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
Concerning over the friendship with Russia, Shevardnadze,
however, said "if the result of the investigation shows that the
traces are on the Russian military bases, we will check it up."
</P>
<P>
Georgian parliament demanded on Tuesday an inquiry at Russian
military bases and airports in the republic, following the attempt
on president's life.
</P>
<P>
A number of lawmakers believed that "the act of terrorism has
been planned by outside forces" and that its organizers and
contractors are outside Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Some deputies of the parliament claimed that "the order to
carry out an act of terrorism against Shevardnadze emanated from
Russia". It was then that deputy speaker Georgy Kobakhidze
submitted his proposal to inspect the Russian military bases.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Moscow said any probes and checkups by
Georgian police at the Russian military bases in Georgia are only
possible on condition of preliminary accord and approval by
competent Russian bodies.
</P>
<P>
So far, there was no agreement between Russia and Georgia on
working procedure for Georgian police on the Russian military
bases.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: US Determined to Eliminate Iraq's Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said in the Omani capital Muscat Tuesday that
Washington is "determined" to eliminate Iraq's threat against the
world.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Cohen as saying in a statement
issued after his two-day visit to Oman that the U.S. would not
give up "any other option" although it "prefers a diplomatic
settlement" to the current Iraq-U.S. crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to oppose and destroy Iraq's capability of
producing, proliferating weapons of mass destruction, and
(Iraq's) potential position of threatening its neighbors,
especially all the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states," Cohen
said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
To avert a U.S.-led possible military strike, Cohen said, Iraq
must implement all the U.N. resolutions related to dismantling its
weapons of mass destruction and allow U.N. arms inspectors access
to 68 suspected chemical or biological weapons sites.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense secretary is currently on a tour to the GCC
states to muster support for the possible military action against
Baghdad. Oman was the third leg of his tour.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Cohen disclosed that he has obtained the sultanate's support
for the strike against Baghdad and was expecting more from both
inside and outside of the Gulf if diplomatic efforts fail to
defuse the Iraq-U.S. crisis.
</P>
<P>
Oman has agreed to host five U.S. KC-10 tankers as part of the
U.S.-British military buildup to launch strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Bahrain also reportedly promised to allow
U.S. forces hit Iraq from their soil, while Saudi Arabia refused
to do so.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said during his brief visit to the UAE Tuesday afternoon
that in addition to support from Canada, Australia and Germany,
there is "a real coalition" against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
"This is a real coalition. These are countries who are
pledging their assistance and material support," he said.

<HEADLINE> London Ready For The Euro: Clementi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The City of London will be
ready for the introduction of the single European currency, and
will offer the full range of Eruo services from January 1, 1999,
David Clementi, Bank of England's Deputy Governor, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Emphasising London's strengths as a financial center, he
predicted, "London will act as a link between New York and the
Euro."
</P>
<P>
And London will also offer the full range of Euro services in
wholesale financial markets, efficiently and competitively, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Clementi was speaking on the first day of the Bank of England's
international roadshow in New York to underline London's
preparations for EMU, and to highlight the services available in
London following the introduction of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Although Britain will not adopt the Euro as its domestic
currency at the start, Clementi said, financial institutions based
in London see the single European currency as a "major
opportunity" for Europe's leading financial center.
</P>
<P>
Alongside New York and Tokyo, London is one of the world's
three great financial centers. Its strength is built on the
liquidity of its markets and the size of its international
financial business, neither of which are related to the UK's
domestic currency.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Clementi acknowledged the contribution of
American firms such as JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley,
Merrill Lynch, Citibank and Chase, to London's success.

<HEADLINE> US Senate Confirms Satcher as Surgeon General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Senate Tuesday voted
63-35 to confirmed Dr. David Satcher of Tennessee as surgeon
general of the United States, despite objections from mostly
conservative senators who opposed his support for some late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the vote, the White House issued a statement from
President Bill Clinton saying, "No one is better qualified than
Dr. Satcher to be America's doctor."
</P>
<P>
The surgeon general acts as the nation's chief medical officer.
</P>
<P>
Satcher, 56, shares Clinton's view that late-term abortions
should be used in the rare cases when a woman's health is
threatened.
</P>
<P>
One conservative Republican who supported Satcher was fellow
Tennessean Senator Bill Frist, who is the Senate's only medical
doctor.
</P>
<P>
Frist called Satcher "the best man for the job," and his plans
to campaign against smoking, teen sex and for healthy diet and
exercise "issues that unite Americans, not divide them."
</P>
<P>
The vote's breakdown was 44 Democrats and 19 Republicans for
Satcher, and 35 Republicans opposed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton nominated Satcher on September 12, 1997, and the Senate
Committee on Labor and Human Resources approved the nomination on
October 8.
</P>
<P>
The surgeon general's job has been open since late 1994, when
Dr. Joycelyn Elders was forced to resign.
</P>
<P>
The Senate rejected Clinton's first choice to replace her, Dr.
Henry W. Foster Jr., in June 1995 over questions about how many
abortions he had performed.

The trend of Uganda's increasing coffee export will continue

<HEADLINE> China, EU Should Develop Long-Term Ties: Li Lanqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 10 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to develop a
long-term and stable relationship with the European Union (EU) and
its 15 member countries, Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark during talks in Brussels with Sir Leon
Brittan, vice president of the European Commission, the EU's
executive body. Li arrived in Brussels Sunday with a delegation
of around 50 people.
</P>
<P>
He said China attached much importance to the EU's role in
international affairs and hoped to further develop its relations
with the 15-member-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
Li pointed out that the world was going in the direction of
multipolarization which would help with international political
and economic stability.
</P>
<P>
He added that under the new circumstances, China and Europe
should strengthen their cooperation and deepen their dialogue in
order to promote the further development of the Sino-EU
relationship.
</P>
<P>
Li welcomed the EU-proposed dialogue between China and Great
Britain, the EU presidency country for the first half of 1998, at
the Asia-Europe summit scheduled for early April in London. The
first Asia-Europe summit was held in Bangkok of Thailand in March
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice premier also expressed his support for launch
of euro, which he believes will be of great significance to the
health of the world's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, also the European trade commissioner, said the EU
would make active efforts in order to enhance its ties with China
in the fields of politics and economy.
</P>
<P>
He told Li that the EU supported China in its application for
membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), adding that a
WTO without China was incomplete.
</P>
<P>
Li said China's accession to the WTO would help it play a
better role in the world trade. "China needs the WTO and the WTO
also needs China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed Sir Leon on China's current economic situation
and his opinions on the financial crisis in east Asia. Brittan
praised China's efforts in stabilizing its currency Renminbi and
ensuring the rapid development of its economy.
</P>
<P>
Li also met with European Commissioners Yves-Thibault de Silguy
and Mario Monti Tuesday. Li is scheduled to leave for Denmark
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Congolese (B) Leader to Hold Talks With Mandela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Self-styled leader of
the Republic of Congo, Denis Sassou Nguesso, whose cobra militia
ousted President Pascal Lissouba last October, will hold talks
with South African President Nelson Mandela Wednesday, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
On whether the meeting meant that the South African government
now officially recognized Sassou Nguesso's government,
presidential aide Parks Mankahlana said, "We are not interested
in recognizing or not recognizing him; our interest is in finding
a solution to the problems of Africa."
</P>
<P>
He added that the South African government did not approve of
the undemocratic acquisition of power, more especially when a
democratically-elected government was removed from power.
</P>
<P>
He described Nguesso's visit to South Africa as unofficial.
</P>
<P>
"The president has an interest in understanding Mr. Nguesso's
plans for the future, and to acquaint himself with the situation
in Congo," said Mankahlana.
</P>
<P>
Nguesso's overthrowing of Lissouba, only months after Laurent
Kabila ousted Mobutu Sese Seko in the then neighboring Zaire, has
resulted in some changes in regional politics, especially for the
former Angolan rebel movement UNITA.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), which once counted on Lissouba's support, is at odds
with Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos' government,
despite a 1994 Lusaka peace pact.
</P>
<P>
Nguesso, in turn, is a close friend of dos Santos, who sent
troops across the border to help him drive out Lissouba.

<HEADLINE> IDB Borrows Record 5.6 Billion US Dollars in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) Tuesday announced that it has raised 5.642
billion U.S. dollars equivalent in international capital markets
during 1997, the largest total in its history.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the bank had borrowed 4.25 billion dollars equivalent.
</P>
<P>
During 1998, the IDB expects to borrow between 4 billion to 5
billion dollars, according to the chief of its Capital Markets
division, Stephen L. Abrahams. The largest portion will probably
be the U.S. dollars, although the IDB will also look at the
possibility of issuing Japanese yen-and German mark-denominated
paper.
</P>
<P>
Last year's 28 borrowing operations had a weighted average
maturity of 9.27 years, with maturities ranging from one year to
30 years. The fixed rate funding for the currency pool system had
a weighted average cost of 6.43 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year's borrowing operations brought the IDB's outstanding
debt, after swaps, to an estimated 28.6 billion dollars, up from
26.6 billion dollars at the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The IDB's total approved capital stands at 101 billion dollars,
which should be sufficient to make its lending program self-
sustainable for the indefinite future.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Iran Concerned Over Fallout of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran is seriously concerned
about a possible attack on Iraq by the United States as the
impacts upon Iran, although indirect as they would be, are
believed to be serious.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is keeping a close and cautious eye on the developments
in the Gulf as the U.S. and Britain step up military build-up in
the region following a standoff between Iraq and the United
Nations over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have expressed the fear that when the attack
takes place, hundreds of thousands of displaced Iraqis will flood
into Iran, nullifying Iran's years of efforts to repatriate 1
million Iraqi refugees.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the officials have warned, members of the
Mujahideen Khalg Organization (MKO), Iran's major opposition
group, will miss no opportunities to make an infiltration into
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Since it was outlawed in the early 1980s, the MKO has been
fighting the Tehran authorities. It even resorted to terrorist
means against Iran's interests throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
"The MKO can not pose a serious threat to the Iranian security
and stability," foreign diplomats here noted. "Tehran's worries
are the possibility of disintegration of Iraq and a change of
power in the country following the possible U.S. military strike."
</P>
<P>
Possible Iraqi disintegration would cause insecurity to Iran's
western borders with Iraq, the diplomats added, the Iraqi Kurdish
factional fighting and the Turkish military incursion into
northern Iraq during the past years have aroused Iran's concern.
</P>
<P>
With millions of Iranian Kurds living in the border areas, Iran
can not tolerate a chaotic situation on the other side of the
border.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have stressed that the Iraqi sovereignty and
territorial integrity should be fully maintained.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Tehran feels uneasy about U.S. and British military
presence in the Gulf. Three aircraft carriers, hundreds of fighter
jets and thousands of troops have been deployed in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. accuses Iran of sponsoring terrorism, undermining the
Mideast peace process and seeking weapons of mass destruction. It
has been striving to isolate Iran for years through economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of tension between Washington and Baghdad will
only strengthen U.S. military buildup in the region, keeping
Iran's armed forces "on alert against any possible aggression,"
Iranian officials have said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to restore peace and stability in the region is
the unconditional withdrawal of U.S. military forces from the
Persian Gulf region," Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials have stepped up diplomatic efforts to help
avert a possible U.S. military attack on Iraq by calling on the
U.N. Security Council, the Organization of the Islamic Conference
and regional countries to use their influence.
</P>
<P>
Tehran also has urged Baghdad to implement the U.N. Security
Council resolutions, "giving no excuses" to the U.S. to launch
military attacks.
</P>
<P>
"Military operations will only escalate tensions in the whole
region and worsen the situation," the Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi has said, stressing that the Iraq
crisis should be resolved peacefully through continued diplomatic
efforts.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Bilateral Agreement on Caspian Sea: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has rejected any bilateral agreement signed between the
Caspian Sea littoral states on the exploration of natural
resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
Local evening daily Etelaat Tuesday quoted Kharrazi as saying
that Iran considers any bilateral agreement on exploration of
natural resources in the Caspian Sea as "invalid."
</P>
<P>
However, the paper did not mention when and where Kharrazi made
the remarks.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi stressed that any decision on the legal regime of the
Caspian Sea should be made by all of the five littoral states,
saying that none of the Caspian Sea littoral states has the right
to damage the interests of others.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan recently
reached an agreement on ways to explore natural resources in the
Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister also rejected any involvement of
foreign companies in the Caspian Sea, saying that no foreign
companies "have the right to take any action contrary to the
interests of the five littoral states."
</P>
<P>
In order to develop the Caspian Sea and maintain a lasting
security in the region, the Caspian Sea should be announced as
"non-military and non-political region," Kharrazi said, adding
that the region should be developed without any unilateral action
and foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian Sea is estimated to have proven reserves of 16
billion barrels of crude oil and 8.3 trillion cubic meters of
natural gas. Since the huge oil and gas reserves were found in the
Caspian Sea region, disputes over the rights to exploit the
resources erupted among the five littoral states, namely, Iran,
Azerbaijan, Russia, Turkmenistan and Khazakstan.
</P>
<P>
Iran has announced that the legal regime governing the Caspian
Sea should be based on the Treaty of Amity signed by Iran and
Russia in 1921 and the Iran-USSR Commerce and Navigation Agreement
in 1940.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has repeatedly announced its opposition to any
unilateral exploitation of the natural resources in the Caspian
Sea, urging the littoral states to speed up their negotiations to
determine the legal regime.

CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are the business
briefs from countries of the Middle East:
</P>
<P>

years, Egypt found oil and gas resources in 104 sites.
</P>
<P>

a number of foreign companies, which pledged to invest 730 million
U.S. dollars in digging 208 exploratory oil wells in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The total investments of foreign companies in Egypt to explore
and produce oil under 82 agreements from 1982 to 1997 amounted to
18 billion dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri told the
People's Assembly Tuesday that Egypt's unemployment rate is lower
than 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is working hard to promote investment
and set up projects to provide job opportunities.
</P>

<HEADLINE> EU to Open Wireless Access to Multi-media Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission on
Wednesday adopted a proposal for the introduction of mobile and
wireless communications, or the Universal Mobile
Telecommunications System (UMTS).
</P>
<P>
This new system, apart from providing a mobile telephone and
messaging service, also offers wireless access to the Internet and
other multi-media services.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, to become a decision by the European Parliament
and the European Council of Ministers, aims at assisting in the
development of the next generation of mobile services in the
European Union, as a follow-up to the current worldwide Global
Service for Mobile Communications (GSM) services.
</P>
<P>
The proposed decision will stimulate the early licensing of
UMTS services in the European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
It ensures that users can use their UMTS telephones, personal
computers or other hand-held devices anywhere in the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
This pan-European mobility will result from licenses being
based on the co-ordinated allocation of frequencies and the use of
European Telecommunications Standards Institute's (ETSI) standards.
</P>
<P>
The harmonized licensing environment is expected to be in place
by the year 2000 at the latest, allowing the UMTS services to be
offered from 2002 onwards.
</P>
<P>
A Europe-wide availability of future mobile multi-media
services, according to European Commission officials, will play a
key role in ensuring broader access to new services in a "wireless
Information Society."

<HEADLINE> Kinkel Says Germany not to Participate in Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel said Wednesday that Germany would not participate in a
potential U.S. military strike against Iraq though Bonn would
support such an action if diplomacy failed to make Iraq to comply
with UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel was quoted by parliamentary group leader of his Free
Democratic Party (FDP), Hermann Otto Solms, as saying in Bonn that
Germany would not make financial or material contributions to a
possible military attack on Iraq, nor would Bonn send any troops
to participate in such operations.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the offer made last weekend by German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl to allow U.S. troops to use German air bases in case
of a military strike, Solms explained that what Kohl meant was the
U.S. bases in Germany, not the German ones.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in separate statement issued later today, Kinkel
also noted that the international community, including the United
States, had come to agree that all possibilities must be tried to
find a diplomatic solution to the current crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
However, if all diplomatic efforts failed, it would lead to a
military action, Kinkel said, adding that in such case, Washington
could count on Germany's "absolute solidarity".

<HEADLINE> Euro Gaining Credibility: EU Commissioner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Brushing aside simmering
opposition to European monetary union, a senior executive of the
European Union claimed Wednesday that the single currency is
gaining credibility.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the credibility of the euro is being
undermined, but it is gaining credibility all the time,"
Yves-Thibault de Silguy, European commissioner for economic,
monetary and financial affairs, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He was explaining a commission report published Wednesday on
the practical aspects of the introduction of the single currency,
to be known as the euro.
</P>
<P>
The report covered three areas where decisions are expected to
be made during a February 26 round-table conference by
representatives of professional and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
It also summarized the conclusions of the five working groups
established to examine specific aspects of the transition to the
euro following an earlier round-table meeting last May.
</P>
<P>
The undecided areas are how long parallel circulation is to
last with euro notes and coins alongside national currencies, how
dual pricing would affect display of values in euros and national
currencies and how much banks should charge converting national
currencies into euros.
</P>
<P>
De Silguy said the key to these decisions is transparency and
competition.
</P>
<P>
Taking account of the conclusions of the February 26
round-table meeting, the European Commission intends to make
recommendations to the Council of Ministers with a view to
securing final conclusions on all outstanding issues by May 2. On
that date the initial list of countries to participate in the
European Monetary Union (EMU) will be announced, he said.
</P>
<P>
"May 2 will be the decision day when all practical instructions
on the euro will be published," said de Silguy.
</P>
<P>
Asked about opposition to the EMU raised by 155 German
economics scholars, the commissionor said people should not be
carried away by opposing opinions.
</P>
<P>
There were always pros and cons and that was the way life was
supposed to be, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German group of economists has written a letter to the
European Commission opposing the launch on January 1, next year,
of the single currency, arguing that the conditions are simply not
right.
</P>
<P>
In another development, 130 Dutch scholars also appealed for a
postponement of the euro launch.
</P>
<P>
But de Silguy said one thing was certain and that was the
single currency would be inaugurated on time.
</P>
<P>
What was uncertain now, however, was how many countries would
be in the first wave joining the single currency mechanism, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Former presidents Jimmy
Carter and Gerald Ford of the United States have called on U.S.
Congress to help resolve the financial difficulties some Asian
countries are now facing.
</P>
<P>
A kind of U.S. "modern isolationism" towards the situation
"seriously damages American interests", said the presidents and
over a hundred former senior government officials and corporate
leaders in an open letter to Congress, which was carried on the
New York Times today.
</P>
<P>
In the last four years, nearly one third of U.S. economic
growth has been due to exports and nearly one third of U.S.
exports go to Asia, they said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Should the current problems in Asia intensify, "U.S.
protectionist pressures may grow and recent improvements in
competitiveness and job growth could be reversed," the letter
warned, terming the financial problems in Asia as "the most urgent
case in point".
</P>
<P>
Noting that the letter was signed by both Republicans and
Democrats, it said in order for the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) to have the resources to respond to the Asian woes, "the
U.S. needs to meet its commitment of financial resources to the
IMF".

although Persian Gulf nations supported United States efforts to
force Iraq to cooperate with United Nations weapons inspectors, he
had failed to win new support for military strikes. Members of a

Iraqi weapons site.

<P>
MACAO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals to Macao this
year is expected to remain at seven million despite the
difficulties in the wake of the Asian currency crisis, a senior
Macao tourism official said.
</P>
<P>
Joao Mannuel Antunes, director of the Macao Tourism Office,

<HEADLINE> Renminbi Not to Devalue: Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Xiaohua, former deputy
governor of China's central bank who now leads a Hong Kong-based
red-chip company, Wednesday ruled out the possibility that
Renminbi will devalue soon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, chairman of China Everbright Holdings Co. Ltd. and China
Everbright Group Ltd., said in a luncheon speech: "Renminbi will
keep its stable position in the next two to three years and the
Chinese government has strong resolve to keep the currency
stable."
</P>
<P>
His speech "The Future of the Renminbi: Devaluation or Not?"
kicked off a series of economic forums jointly organized by
Salomon Smith Barney and China Everbright.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who was deputy governor of the People's Bank of China
between 1993 and 1996, said that it was a logical analysis that
the currency depreciation in southeast Asian countries could put
pressure on China's export this year.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, many people ignored the big disparity between
the coastal regions and the west hinterland, which gives China's
economy enough room to adjust to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
"The shift of factories from east to west, from booming towns
to underdeveloped areas, can reduce costs of production and help
maintain the competitiveness of export," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, external trade only accounts for 35 percent of China's
GDP, and China still has a large domestic market with mixed
demand, said Zhu, who took the current post in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
He added that China has no reason to devalue its currency when
the national economy performed so well over the past year, with
GDP growth at 8.8 percent, inflation as low as 3.2 percent, and
foreign reserves rising to nearly 140 billion U.S. dollars as of
December 1997.

<HEADLINE> SKorean President Blames Crisis on Flawed System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam on Wednesday blamed a flawed financial system for the
present financial crisis plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
"We triggered the crisis by failing to overcome our chronic
structural weaknesses of high cost and low efficiency, and to cope
effectively with an environmental change in the international
economy," Kim said in a speech to the National Assembly
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
His remark is seen as a refutation of claims that his
government should take responsibility for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Kim defended his former economic aides who were
identified as the main culprits behind the crisis. He said he
himself was solely responsible.
</P>
<P>
President-elected Kim Dae-jung, who will be sworn in as the
head of state later this month, has vowed to hold parliamentary
hearings to bring to light the whole truth behind the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The nation's top inspector, the Board of Audit and Inspection,
is investigating the outgoing government's handling of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the world's 11th largest economy, has been in
serious financial crisis caused by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions in late 1997. It has seen the
nation's per capita income down to 9,400 U.S. dollars from the
previous year's 10,548 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached last December with the International
Monetary Fund for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South
Korea has to restructure its economy, completely open its market
and legalize mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country, one of the "Four Dragons in Asia," has
to pay back a large part of its debts totalling 154 billion
dollars this year.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, Anchor in Asian Financial Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong monetary
official said here Wednesday that Hong Kong will play a positive
role in the Asian financial market when the regional currency
turmoil calms down.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sheng, deputy chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA), told a seminar Wednesday that Hong Kong remains
the most free and transparent market in Asia with the highest
liquidity and based on the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
In his hour-long presentation at the seminar organized by the
Hong Kong China Enterprises Association, Sheng said: "Hong Kong
will be the first to recover from the Asian financial crisis, and
is best positioned to help the whole region deepen the function of
financial market,"
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has taken the linked exchange rate as the core of
its financial stability," said Sheng, "and till now the Hong Kong
dollar remains stable."
</P>
<P>
He cited a string of figures -- when the financial crisis broke
out in Thailand on July 2, 1997, the peg was at 7.748 HK dollars
to one U.S. dollar, and last Tuesday the exchange rate stood
firmly at 7.737 HK dollars to one U.S. dollar, slightly up by 0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, other Asian currencies depreciated between 12 and
67 percent during the seven-month period.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the pain brought about by rising interest
rates is the price Asia has to pay for its economic adjustment,
and Hong Kong cannot be excluded.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has a sound currency board regime, hefty foreign
reserves, healthy fiscal condition, and a well-capitalized banking
system -- all lay a solid foundation for maintaining the Hong Kong
dollar's peg to the greenback, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He expected the battered Asian economies to recover from the
crisis within the year if the political situation does not worsen.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong official said that some elements are vital to the
recovery, such as improving trade balance and constraining the
flight of capital out of these countries.
</P>
<P>
Sheng pointed out that both China's pledge to keep Renminbi
stable and Hong Kong's resolve to keep the Hong Kong dollar stable
provide an anchor in the Asian crisis.

<P>
SEOUL, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
warned on Wednesday it would take hard measures over strikes
staged by trade unions which were aimed at boycotting the layoff
agreement reached by labor, capital and the government.
</P>
<P>
"If, unfortunately, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions
stages illegal strikes, the government will have no choice but to
take all steps according to the law," a government statement
issued here said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU)
said a general strike could not be averted unless the government
went back to the negotiation table for another round of talks to
hammer out a new layoff accord.
</P>
<P>
Confederation leaders responsible for signing the accord were
ejected and a new leadership was formed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new leadership said the signed agreement, which will make
layoffs easier, had been vetoed by the majority of members.
</P>
<P>
The government has refused any form of renegotiation.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, representatives from labor, business and
government reached an agreement, after hard negotiations, to
legalize mass layoffs in return for more labor freedom.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, businesses could lay off workers when they
face "emergency situations" such as financial trouble, merger, or
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
About one million people might lose their jobs after the
country's national assembly (parliament) passes the bill
legalizing the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, the ministry of finance and economy cited the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) as saying that large-scale
strikes in the course of corporate restructuring would immediately
hurt foreign investment sentiments, and would likely bring a new
round of financial turmoil to the country.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed last December with the IMF for a
rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars, South Korea has to
restructure its economy, open its financial market and legalize
mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
The country remains in a serious financial crisis caused by
corporate failures and bad loans by financial institutions in late
1997,
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of riot police were already deployed on streets in
central Seoul on Wednesday to block the KCTU leaders from sit-ins
to prepare for the strike.

<HEADLINE> China to Advance Health Care Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's public health sector
will deepen reforms in the medical care system in urban and
rural areas of China in a bid to improve services for 1.2 billion
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Chen Minzhang, Chinese minister of
health, at a national conference of directors of public health
departments held here today.
</P>
<P>
Reforms of health care for urbanites will underline the
expansion and improvement of the medical insurance system which
will collects funds from individuals and units to cover
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
"The major goal for this year centers on formulating standards
to provide basic medical care for all the people covered by the
system," said Chen Minzhang.
</P>
<P>
The new system, which was introduced three years ago in some
cities, will phase out China's decade-old system of free medical
services. The old system has been blamed for burdening the
government with excessive medical expenditures.
</P>
<P>
Under the cooperative medical care system in the vast rural
areas of China, funds will be raised from governments at all
levels, township businesses and rural residents to provide
financial aid for qualified individuals.
</P>
<P>
"Health care departments must improve management in order to
ensure the system operates smoothly," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
The minister called on hospitals and other medical organization
to improve medical care, disease prevention and healthy lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
"A group of community medical service centers will be
established this year. The centers will provide comprehensive
health care services, including basic medical care, health
education and family planning," according to Chen.

KIEV, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Minister of Education,
Mikhail Zgurovsky, said on Monday that the idea of establishing
unified education among the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) would never work.
</P>
<P>
Zgurovsky made the remarks at a CIS education ministers'
meeting at Commonwealth's Minsk headquarter, reported the

</P>
<P>
Zgurovsky stressed that every nation has the right to define
and develop an educational system based on its concrete material
and spiritual conditions, as well as its national characteristics
and cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine stands for having educational cooperation on a

recognizing each other's education-related documents, and jointly
holding seminars to resolve problems in education, he said.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Averting US Military Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami Wednesday called on the international community and
regional countries to spare no efforts to prevent the United
States from launching military strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"As chairman of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC), I called on all Muslim nations and governments, and all
international bodies and freedom lovers of the world to spare no
efforts to avoid a big human calamity in Iraq and a serious threat
to the regional security," he told a crowd at a ceremony here to
mark the 19th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that any act of aggression against Iraq would
aggravate the sufferings and pains of the oppressed Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn any aggression against the oppressed Iraqi people
while urging Iraq to respect all international laws and
resolutions and avoid providing a pretext for aggression of
foreign powers," he said.
</P>
<P>
With an increasingly possible U.S. military attack on Iraq,
Iranian leaders expressed great concern, particularly over the
possible impacts, such as an Iraqi disintegration, a change of
power in Baghdad and a permanent presence of foreign military
forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the Persian Gulf has become a place for maneuvers
of foreign fleets, and urged all regional nations to join hands in
order to establish security in the region by themselves.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran stands for justice and freedom not only
for the people of Iran but for people throughout the world. "Our
message to the world...is that we want peace for all, a true
peace, a peace under which all are respected and rights of all the
oppressed are recognized," he said.
</P>
<P>
He deplored war, fratricide and massacres in Muslim countries,
in Afghanistan, Algeria in particular, calling for joint efforts
to solve the problems.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday evening, Khatami also urged the United States to
drop its planned military strike on Iraq and conform to call of
the world against military actions.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Environmental Body Needs Changes: UNEP Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Environment Program
(UNEP) needs to make a series of changes and seek more financial
backing so as to have its role enhanced as the global voice for
the environment, new UNEP boss Klaus Topfer said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Taking his office on Monday, Topfer said he will try his
most with an "open mind" to head the organization to take
"extraordinary, dedicated efforts to bring environmental issues
back to the center of global political activity."
</P>
<P>
In a time of increasing globalization, the UNEP has more
responsibility to ensure that "economic growth must be
accompanied by environmental and social developments which in
turn can make economic achievements sustainable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently available water and land are worldwide decreasing,
making it far more difficult to get all human beings to "have
access to water, to housing and to land," he said.
</P>
<P>
To meet such challenges, the improvement of current UNEP
financial situation and hence getting stronger links with donors
as "the most important thing" he should do first although they
are "very difficult tasks" for him, Topfer noted.
</P>
<P>
"There are many more necessities in developing the UNEP
system" and explore possible fields of cooperation with donors,
governments and environment-related agencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he cleared clouds of doubts by confirming that the
UNEP headquarters will remain operating in Nairobi as the sole
U.N. organization based in a developing country.
</P>
<P>
Rumors are heard for times that the U.N. intends to move the
UNEP headquarters into a certain advanced nation especially
following a row between the UNEP and the Kenyan government over
telecommunication problems last year.
</P>
<P>
"We will not move the UNEP but just stablize it in a
constructive way", the UNEP chief claimed.
</P>
<P>
Also with the titles of U.N. Under-Secretary General, the head
of U.N. office in Nairobi and the U.N. Center for Human
Settlements (Habitat), Topfer is expected to better enhance the
coherence of U.N. activities in the related fields.
</P>
<P>
He will prepare proposals on reforming and strengthening
U.N.'s role in environmental and human settlements areas to the
U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Topfer, 60 and with a doctorate of philosophy, had been a
member of the German cabinet for 12 years, including seven years
as Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and
Nuclear Safety.
</P>
<P>
He was unanimously elected the UNEP boss by the U.N. General
Assembly on 3 December, 1997.

<HEADLINE> PNA Prevents Pro-Iraqi Demonstration in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) prevented a pro-Iraqi demonstration scheduled for
Wednesday in the West Bank city of Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ban was ordered apparently under the
pressure of the United States, who has reportedly sent protests
to PNA President Yasser Arafat requesting him to end such
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
If the Hebron demonstration was held, violent clashes would
have erupted between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers,
who are guarding about 500 Jewish settlers remaining in the mostly
Arab city. In the past, Hebron was often at the center of
Israeli-Palestinian clashes.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Palestinian police chief Ghazi Jabali said the
Palestinian police would prevent any demonstrations that would
lead to violence and violate the peace agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The PNA ban also came following Israeli warning that
failure to halt such protests, during which Israeli and American
flags were burned, could block the peace process from advancing.
</P>
<P>
In the past week, Palestinians have been holding
demonstrations in several Palestinian cities and clashing with
Israeli soldiers to show support to Iraq in the current crisis
over United Nations weapon inspection.
</P>
<P>
In these demonstrations, Palestinian teenagers always held
pictures of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and Iraqi flags,
while burning Israeli and American flags and calling on Iraq
to fire missiles against Israel.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Chairman Meets New Zealand Guests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, met with New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister Winston
Peters and a friendship delegation from the city of Taurange this
afternoon in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand delegation arrived here this morning at the
invitation of the government of Yantai in east China's Shandong
Province. Yantai and Taurange established sister-city ties in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Li said his December visit to New Zealand convinced him that the
two countries have a solid social foundation and favourable
conditions for developing relations. He said that China can learn
a great deal from New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Peters shows that the government of New Zealand
attaches great importance to the development of friendly relations
between the two cities, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation and growth of friendly ties between the two
cities requires the injection of substantial contents, such as
exchanges and cooperation in the economic, trade, scientific and
technological, and cultural fields, said Li.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two cities should take full advantage of
their friendship to promote the development of friendly ties and
cooperation between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Peters said the New Zealand government treasures its relations
with China and hopes to increase exchanges and expand cooperation
in various areas, including trade.
</P>
<P>
He said the coastal city of Taurange hopes to learn
from China's experience in administering coastal ports.
</P>
<P>
He said the friendship between Taurange and Yantai will
undoubtedly advance.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand delegation left for Yantai this evening.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Balances Proportional Gender Births </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of male and female
births in Shanghai has remained relatively balanced over the past
two years at 104:100, according to a survey in today's
Shanghai-based "Wen Hui Bao."
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by two local health care centers for
women and children, showed 1997 births of 929 males and 919
females in one center, a ratio of 102:100.
</P>
<P>
A second center reported 158 male and 150 female births in
December, a ratio of 105:100.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that the normal proportion of births according to
gender is 106 males to 100 females, with the mortality rate for
the former higher than that for the latter.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, experts added, the misuse of advanced scanning
techniques to determine the sex of a fetus leads to a greater
number of abortions for female fetuses.
</P>
<P>
Most young couples in Shanghai, China's leading industrial
city, accept the equality of male and female children.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey indicates that 80 percent of women have no
gender preference for newborns, with some educated couples even
preferring female children.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai municipal government has adopted regulations
banning prenatal examinations in order to maintain a proportional
gender birth ratio. Endiem

<HEADLINE> Surveys Show Mixed Business Expectations for S'pore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The major economic sectors
of Singapore are having mixed business expectations for the first
half of 1998, while the commerce sector is anticipating a
slowdown, surveys conducted by government agencies showed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A survey of business expectations of the commerce and services
sectors, conducted by the Department of Statistics of Singapore
(DOS) in December 1997, showed that the commerce sector was
anticipating a business slowdown for the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Wholesalers and retailers expect lower sales for the period
between January and June 1998, while catering trade establishments
and hoteliers are optimistic about their business situation, the
DOS survey revealed.
</P>
<P>
Publishing the survey, the DOS said that firms engaged in
transport and storage and real estate services predicted a
downturn in business activity for the first six months of the
year.
</P>
<P>
However, sentiments in the business services industry are mixed
while most financial institutions foresee a downward trend in
their business activity.
</P>
<P>
A survey on the business expectations by the manufacturing
sector, which was conducted and published Wednesday by the
Economic Development Board (EDB), showed that a majority of the
industrialists expected their business situation to remain the
same.
</P>
<P>
The EDB said that a weighted 55 percent of the industrialists
expect the business situation to remain the same, a weighted 16
percent anticipate improvement, while a weighted 29 percent
predict a weakening.
</P>
<P>
The transport equipment industry anticipated an improved
business situation in the first half of the year. The improvement
is said to be mainly led by the aviation industry, on the back of
firm demand for aircraft maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Industrialists in the electronics industry had varied business
outlook for the first six months of 1998. The computer, computer
peripherals and telecommunication segments are optimistic as they
expect to obtain more export orders.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor manufacturers are more conservative in their
outlook.
</P>
<P>
For the first quarter of 1998, the industrialists generally
expect lower level of output, export orders and overseas
deliveries compared with the fourth quarter of 1997. "This is due
in part to seasonal variation, as the first quarter usually has
fewer production days due to festive holidays," the EDB explained.
</P>
<P>
It said that investors will continue to invest in productive
capacity in the next 12 months. The majority, or a weighted 69
percent, of the manufacturing establishments plan to invest in
plant and machinery in the next 12 months, while a weighted 31
percent of the establishments plan to invest in buildings.

<HEADLINE> HK Sports Circles Pay Tribute to Asian Games Heroes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Sports
Development Board (SDB) held a New Year reception here on
Wednesday to celebrate the Year of the Tiger and round off a
successful year of Hong Kong sports in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reception attended by over 200 guests from the local sports
community while Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa also paid tribute
to members of the Hong Kong teams who won medals in previous
Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Local sports community is now gearing up for the 13th Asian
Games this December in Bangkok. Hong Kong athletes will compete
in Bangkok under the flag of the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong first participated in the Second Asian Games in
Manila in 1954 and has since snatched a total of 37 medals in 11
outings.
</P>
<P>
An eight-minute video highlighting Hong Kong's performance in
the Games was presented at the reception and some of the Asian
Games medalists were called up to the stage for a group photo with
the chief executive and other guests.
</P>
<P>
The gold medal won by tenpin bowler Catherine Che in the
ladies' singles in Seoul in 1986, stands as the only Hong Kong
gold in the Asian Games. In 1994, Hong Kong took 13 medals in
Hiroshima, the most number of medals collected in one single
Asiad.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message to the sports fraternity, John Hung,
chairman of the SDB, wished Hong Kong athletes to do well in the
coming Bangkok Asian Games and bring honor to the people of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Hung also congratulated Hong Kong athletes for their
outstanding achievements in both national and international
competitions in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Among the outstanding athletes of the year are cyclist Wong
Kam-po, who won a gold medal in the individual road race at the
Eighth National Games in Shanghai, windsurfer Lee Lai-shan, who
regained her world title in Perth, and Ng Siu-ching, who collected
two gold and one silver medals at the World Wushu Championships.
</P>
<P>
All these achievements demonstrated a spirit of team effort
among all stakeholders in the local sports community including
athletes, coaches, sports associations, Hong Kong Sports
Institute, SDB and the SAR government, Hung said.
</P>
<P>
The SDB chief also praised the SAR government for all the work
it had done to help develop Hong Kong sports. "The set-up of the
Art and Sports Development Fund, an increase of 20 million HK
dollars (2.56 million U.S. dollars) subversion to the SDB,
together with a seat for sports, performing arts, culture and
publication in the functional constituency in the new Legislature,
proves the government's strong commitment to Hong Kong sports," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hung also took the opportunity to bid farewell to A de O Sales,
president of the Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee
of Hong Kong, China, who recently decided to step down after more
than 40 years in office. A new leader is to be elected by the
local sports governing body in March.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Would Like to Support War Crimes Tribunal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government would
like to support and cooperate with the Hague-based International
Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia over war crime issues, a
senior Yugoslav official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
When meeting Louise Arbour, the court's chief prosecutor who
arrived here Monday for a five-day visit, Yugoslav Minister of
Justice Zoran Knezevic reiterated his government's refusal to
extradite war crimes suspects to the court. He said the country's
constitution forbade it.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, they could expel those indicted by the court for
alleged war crimes in the former Yugoslav conflict.
</P>
<P>
The justice minister also stressed that the court should treat
all the suspects equally.
</P>
<P>
A total of 74 people have been indicted by the court and the
majority of them are Bosnian Serbs. But of the 19 already in
custody, only two are Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Three former officers in the Yugoslav National Army wanted for
allegedly organizing a 1991 massacre of 200 Croats are believed to
still be living inside Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Israel Trade Up by 40 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The trade volume between
Cyprus and Israel increased by some 40 percent in 1997 over a year
earlier, according to official figures released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The trade figures show the trade volume between the two
countries stood at 158 million U.S. dollars in 1997, compared
with 111.8 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' exports to Israel rose to 46.83 million dollars in 1997
from 40.15 million in the previous year, while Israeli exports to
Cyprus boomed by 54.9 percent to 111.15 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figures show the greatest success for Cyprus was the
export of precious stones and precious metals to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus exports of livestock and animal products also enjoyed a
record increase, rising by 157 percent to 817,000 dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
Rubber and plastics exports to Israel were the next best
performers that saw a 75 percent rise last year to 1.7 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Ambassador to Cyprus Shemi Tzur was quoted as saying
that he was very pleased with the performance of the rise in
bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in trade is a result of the efforts of some
Cypriots who had established certain big businesses and large
deals with Israel last year," Tzur said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Israel signed in 1994 a general trade agreement to
promote bilateral trade and facilitate participation in each
other's fairs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli exports to Cyprus mainly cover petroleums, chemicals,
machinery and plastics.

<HEADLINE> Diplomatic Solution to Iraqi Crisis Taking Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Wednesday that Iraq has agreed to an
proposal to open suspected sites to international arms inspectors
appointed by the U.N. Secretary General.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from an hour-long meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, al-Sahhaf told reporters that the sites, numbered
at 68, include eight presidential sites allegedly holding
prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Those sites, scattered across Iraq, will be inspected by the
UNSCOM (U.N. Special Commission overseeing elimination of Iraqi
weapons of destruction) appointed by the U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan, who are nationals of the five permanent members of the
Security Council, according to the top Iraqi diplomat.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal enables the inspection to proceed "during
a period that will allow it enough time to complete the job."
Baghdad had insisted the presidential palaced can only be
"visited" once and for all.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, first made public by AL Secretary-General Ahmed
Esmat Abdel-Meguid, is taking shape after intense consultations
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Arab leaders, Russian and
French envoys, as well as British and American diplomats in the
past few days.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, in the form of a draft resolution, will be
forwarded to the U.N. Security Council soon, al-Sahhaf said. It
apparently has had Arab, Russian and French endorsement, but there
is so far no comment from the British and Americans.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's advisor, told reporters later that "the
inspection team will be composed of five Security Council
permanent member states as well as the 21 members of UNSCOM."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the proposed inspections will be made with all
technical means and facilities and will take place in "a month or
two."
</P>
<P>
He said "more visits and discussions are needed to define the
date" of the inspections which, according to him, will be carried
out "with a time limit."
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the press conference, al-Sahhaf said "Iraq
supports Mubarak's proposal, Arab League chief's efforts and
Russian and French endeavors."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq supports their efforts toward a political, diplomatic
solution to the crisis, because military strikes will harm
everybody," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who was present at
al-Sahhaf's talks with Mubarak, appeared with the Iraqi official
but did not talk to reporters.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf will hold talks with Moussa at noon and with the AL
chief Thursday. He is on a regional tour to drum up support for
averting an imminent U.S. military strike as the standoff comes to
a showdown with the U.S. over arms inspections.

</P>
<P>
The monastery is the site of China's Advanced Buddhist College
for the Tibetan Language, the most prestigious academy of Tibetan
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Personnel from the Buddhist College and a group of living
buddhas and believers warmly welcomed the Panchen Lama. The 11th
Panchen ascended the sacred throne in the monastery's main hall
amidst solemn Buddhist music and presided over the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Students and teachers at the Buddhist College, as well as a
dozen living buddhas from the Tibet and Inner Mongolia autonomous
regions and the provinces of Sichuan, Qinghai, Gansu and Yunnan,
paid their respects to the religious leader.
</P>
<P>
The Xihuang Monastery was built in 1652 by Qing Dynasty
(1644-1911) Emperor Shunzhi to accommodate the Fifth Dalai Lama who
traveled from Tibet to pay homage to the emperor. In 1780, the
monastery served as the residence of the Sixth Panchen Lama who
visited Beijing to celebrate the birthday of Qing Emperor Qianlong.
</P>
<P>
The Advanced Buddhist College for the Tibetan Language was
found at the behest of the 10th Panchen Lama.

<HEADLINE> More New Zealanders Settle in Australia: Statistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of New
Zealanders flock to neighboring Australia, according to official
figures released here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
New Zealanders were the largest group to settle permanently in
Australia in the past fiscal year of 1996-1997, the second year in
a row.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13,100 New Zealanders, or one in every six new
arrivals in Australia, moved to Australia permanently last
financial year, the only country to have recorded an increase, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Migration Report said.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealanders were followed by those from the United
Kingdom and those from China.
</P>
<P>
Australia now has 1.2 million migrants who were born in the UK,
seven percent of the country's 18 million population.
</P>
<P>
New Zealanders make up two percent of the population, followed
by Italians and Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
The report found, however, that a tight immigration program
resulted in a 14 percent drop in new settlers from the previous
year with 85,800 people making Australia home.
</P>
<P>
And almost 30,000 Australians left home for good, an increase
of four percent.
</P>
<P>
A further 73,800 people decided to leave Australia on a
long-term basis to find employment or holiday fun in other
countries or regions with the UK, the United States and Hong Kong
the major ports of call.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said a 20 percent cut in the annual immigration intake
since the fiscal year of 1995-1996 and low birth rates were the
major reasons for the decline.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Australian Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock said
the government might consider taking in more migrants after
surveys showed Australia's population could decline in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Ruddock is currently holding public consultations to formulate
next year's program which he said would continue to favor skilled
migrants over the family reunion program.

<HEADLINE>   Indonesia Finalizing Plans on Currency Board System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
finalizing plans to implement the currency board system (CBS) that
will peg the exchange rate of the rupiah against the U.S. dollar,
a senior official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"What we are preparing is included in the draft bills that we
will soon submit to the House of Representatives," Finance
Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said during the House's plenary session.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's monetary and financial policy will be
made in line with the economic reforms aimed at restoring public
confidence in the rupiah and the country's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a balance should be struck between the need
to control the growth of money in circulation to check inflation
and maintain a stable capital market, and the need for liquidity
to keep production activities going.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie also disclosed that the government will loosen the tight
liquidity to ease pressure on the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah traded Wednesday morning at 7,300/7,500 to a dollar,
compared with Tuesday's close of 7,400/7,750 per dollar in
Jakarta's interbank spot market. Early in July last year when the
monetary crisis started in Southeast Asian region, the rupiah
traded at 2,400 to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources said the House has expressed support for the
government plan to implement the CBS.

<HEADLINE> Bank Official Explains Credit Principles, Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- State-owned commercial banks
should abide by related credit principles and regulations after
the abandonment of the credit quota ceiling system, a senior
official from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China lifted the limits on the scale of loans from state-owned
commercial banks starting January 1, giving the banks the right to
make decisions in granting loans.
</P>
<P>
When granting loans banks should keep to the principles of
safety, fluidity and profitability, the official said, enterprises
applying for loans must be qualified in aspects such as product
sales, operating profits and credit.
</P>
<P>
He added that unsecured loans will be strictly controlled while
guaranteed loans will be actively promoted.
</P>
<P>
The banks should also pursue the state's industrial, regional
development policies and credit policies. Lifting of limits on the
scale of loans should not affect the banks' support to
enterprises' rational loan demand.
</P>
<P>
While giving key support to the state-owned large- and
medium-size enterprises, state-owned commercial banks should give
consideration to medium- and small-size enterprises and
financially troubled enterprises which have great development
potential and are able to repay the loans and interests.
</P>
<P>
The banks should play an active role in creating new jobs,
support the country's residential housing project and individual
residential credit to develop new areas for the economic growth,
he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, loans from commercial banks must be in
line with related regulations of asset-to-liability management.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Calls for Final Arms Tenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has decided
to invite a second round of proposals on a best and final offer
basis from the shortlist of international companies bidding to
supply it with new military equipment.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Press Association Wednesday, the
Defense Ministry last month approved the shortlist of products
and supplies for a proposed 10-billion-Rand (2.02-billion-U.S.
Dollar) arms deal, which included corvettes, submarines, fighter
aircraft and tanks.
</P>
<P>
Six countries -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and
Spain -- had reportedly made the cut.
</P>
<P>
The formal requests for final proposals contained explicit
statements on South Africa's requirements in terms of technical
aspects and counter-trade measures, Deputy Defense Minister
Ronnie Kasrils said.
</P>
<P>
Bidders would have three months to respond to the full extent
of specifications covering this second round of offers, Kasrils
said at a counter-trade conference on the defense package deals
in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"We are therefore looking to the end of May 1998 as our
deadline and the climax of this process."
</P>
<P>
He said Defense Minister Joe Modise was satisfied with the
short-listing process and evaluation so far.
</P>
<P>
Progress was now needed and final decisions, at cabinet level,
if the evaluation went to schedule, could be expected by
mid-1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We see this procurement process as providing a promising
future for our defense industry, a major boost to our economy,
and developing strong and beneficial ties with our business
partners and their governments," Kasrils said.
</P>
<P>
The program requires the equipment suppliers to invest a
portion of the value of the contracts in civilian and military
production in South Africa to create jobs.
</P>
<P>
The procurement process began after South African parliament
okayed a plan to re-equip the National Defense Force in August
1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The national tourism authorities
of Laos and Thailand have agreed to continue a tourism
cooperation plan for the 1998-1999 period, the Lao News Agency KPL
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The plan is part of an agreement on Lao-Thai tourism
cooperation signed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
For 1998-1999, the two sides agreed to co-operate in exchanging
delegations of executive committees on tourism, training tourism
personnel, and promoting investment and marketing.
</P>
<P>
A Thai tourist official said Thailand needed the understanding
and co-operation of Laos because of the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Because of a shortfall in cash, some projects have to be
postponed. The two sides will meet to discuss and co-ordinate
the projects affected by budget problems.
</P>
<P>
The official said one project to be implemented immediately was
the training of hotel people in Laos.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM to Face Censure Motion Next Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa will stand the test of a no-confidence motion next
Tuesday in parliament, Speaker Ram Chandra Poudyal announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the censure motion will begin next Tuesday and
voting next Friday, the speaker told a special session of the
Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The special session was called as directed by King Birendra,
who on February 4 decided to accept the petition of 96 MPs to
convene a special parliament session to discuss their
no-confidence motion against the present coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On February 6, 89 MPs from the main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and former prime
minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand registered a censure motion in the
Parliament Secretariat. Chand and his supporters have broken away
from the National Democratic Party (RPP) led by Prime Minister
Thapa.
</P>
<P>
However, Wednesday's special session cannot discuss the censure
motion, as under Nepal's laws, discussions and voting on the
motion can take place 10 days after it is registered.
</P>
<P>
The King's decision to summon a House session, taken on advice
of the Supreme Court, has come under strong criticism from the
ruling Nepali Congress and Prime Minister Thapa, whose
recommendation to dissolve parliament for mid-term polls was
turned down by the King.
</P>
<P>
Thapa, who came to power last October, is the most short-lived
prime minister to face a censure motion.

setting up a program with Unesco's coordination to provide
cultural awareness, and making a detailed map which takes the
historical and tourist perspective into consideration," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said a small amount of money had been allocated in
the 1998 state budget, but most of the money would come from
prospective local and international donations.

listed as a world cultural site since 1993.

NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
appealed Wednesday for 17 million U.S. Dollars to maintain
deliveries of food and other relief supplies to more than one
million flood victims in Kenya and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
In a news release, WFP said that funds for airlifts and
airdrops into the flood areas were almost exhausted, adding that
WFP was forced to borrow one million dollars from its immediate
response account for emergencies.

The new appeal covers the most of food aid as well as the air
delivery of food, materials for shelter, medicines, water
purifying substances and other relief assistance for 657,500
Somalis and 390,700 Kenyans.

WFP initially predicted that the heavy rains caused by the El
Nino phenomenon which began in mid-October would stop in December
but actually continue until now.
</P>
<P>
According to WFP, the hardest hit areas in Somalia are Middle
and Lower Juba, Lower Shabelle, Gedo Bay and Bakool districts
where 2,000 people have been reported dead, 33,500 livestock

<HEADLINE> China to Enhance Research on "Rule by Law" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide seminar will be
held this year as part of the efforts of the China Law Society
(CLS) to enhance research on the "rule by law" principle.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun Wanzhong, deputy president of the
100,000-member CLS, the aim of research on the "rule by law" is to
find the contents, characters, goals, tasks and means for the
socialist legal system.
</P>
<P>
The studies were also aimed at finding concrete measures and
steps for judicial reform and improving China's legal system, Sun
said.
</P>
<P>
"Rule by law" was one of the principles clearly put forward at
the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
late last year.
</P>
<P>
"We will arrange specific studies of how to change the CPC's
way of ruling, avoid the abuse of power by the government,
and better protect citizens' rights," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The society this year will also conduct research on China's
current and future law framework to propose new laws and revisions
to the existing ones to devise a complete socialist legal system
with Chinese characteristics by 2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Sun, the CLS will also focus on such legal areas
as joint-stock companies, contracts, securities, social security,
marriage and family.
</P>
<P>
The CLS, headed by Ren Jianxin, president of China's Supreme
People's Count, has played an important role in improving China's
legal system. Its work has been praised by Deng Xiaoping, Jiang
Zemin and other Chinese leaders.

nationalization, repatriation of profits in terms of free transfer
of income accruing to investment, and settlement of investment

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Stronger as Asia Shadow Fades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar gained
close to three quarters of a U.S. cent Wednesday as the shadow
cast by Asia faded.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished at 68.28, up from 67.60 late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the jump in the unit was led by buyers out of
Asia, following on from strengthening Tuesday in Asian currencies
and the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"Asia itself has strengthened as a bloc," said Macquarie Bank
Ltd. foreign exchange manager Mark O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
Stronger Asian currencies are helping to support perceptions in
financial markets that the crisis in the region is finally
stabilizing.
</P>
<P>
The Australian markets have been affected because of concerns
that economic growth would be dampened due to weaker demand from
the nation's Asian trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Helping Asian currencies was ongoing talk of the possible
establishment in Indonesia of a so-called currency board to fix
the rupiah against the U.S. dollar, and of a stimulus package in
Japan to boost its flagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 84.34 Japanese yen, from 83.59
Tuesday, and at 1.2336 German marks, from 1.2264.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Customs Start 24-Hour Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Customs Services at
Apapa Port, Lagos, has started a 24-hour service, in accordance
with an instruction of the government in the 1998 budget.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this Tuesday in Lagos, the customs' public
relations officer, Barisua Wilcox said the new move is aimed at
decongesting the port, one of the most important in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The new around-the-clock service marks the latest drive by the
Nigerian government to improve the west African country's port
and customs services.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the government announced the removal of
the ban of night navigation in Nigerian ports. The ban was
imposed during the Nigerian civil war in late 1960s and has been
drawing criticism for many years.
</P>
<P>
In its 1998 budget, the government announced a phased
cancellation of pre-shipment inspections, which had been required
for imports from all countries.
</P>
<P>
As the first step, pre-shipment inspections are no longer
necessary for imports from all African countries and 15 other
countries in Asia, Europe and other regions.
</P>
<P>
The government also announced that it will install more x-ray
machines and a computer system at Nigerian ports, to accelerate
customs inspection and clearance.
</P>
<P>
In fact, it said all customs clearances could be finished
within 48 hours by the end of year, when the computer system is
expected to be operational.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman on Arrest of Chinese-American Scholar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Zhu Bangzao remarked here Tuesday at a routine news
conference on the open letter released by prominent Chinese
academicians on the arrest of a Chinese-American scholar.
</P>
<P>
Peter H. Lee, a Taiwan-born Chinese-American, was arrested
recently in the United States by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
Seven Chinese academicians with the Chinese Academy of Sciences
on Tuesday published an open letter in which they expressed their
shock over the accusation against Lee. They urged American
scientists to uphold justice and help free Lee from persecution.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Lee since the 1980s had visited and lectured at
several Chinese institutions of higher learning and participated
in international academic meetings in China. "All these are normal
academic exchange activities and all contents of his lectures are
only related to basic studies," Zhu said, adding that other
explanations of these activities are "groundless and with ulterior
motives."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the Sino-U.S. relations are in the process of
improvement and "we do not hope to see the attempt of a few people
who tried to use this matter to damage the normal exchanges
between Chinese and American scientists and interfere in the
improvement and development of overall Sino-U.S. relations."

Angola faces problems of child education, the welfare of war
orphans, the abuse of children and eliminating child labor.

In 1998, she said, UNICEF should concentrate its efforts on
consolidating the achievements it made during the last few years
in helping the children there; help repairing the basic
infrastructures in the country for the health and education of
children; and strengthen the health care for the pregnant women.
</P>

</P>
<P>
-- The 16 NATO countries participating in the Stabilization
Force (SFOR) in Bosnia agreed on Tuesday in Brussels to the
make-up of a new international force to replace SFOR from July 1.
The new ``Dissuasion Force'' will be slightly reduced in manpower
and will stay in Bosnia until the elections in September. After

</P>
<P>
-- While Washington reaffirmed Tuesday that it would not accept
any compromise on the access to the presidential sites in Iraq by
U.N. inspectors, France, Russia and Arab countries are pushing the
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to help end the crisis
by evaluating the stand of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The
truce during the Nagano Winter Olympic Games, granted by Washington
because it needs at least a dozen days to complete its troop
deployment in the Gulf, gives a new chance for diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>

-- Investigation on the murder of Corsica prefect Claude
Erignac is going on and police are increasing searches in the
homes and offices of nationalist militants of the island. Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin Tuesday urged the island to restore as
quickly as possible the rule of law and appointed a new prefect
to it.

States agreed to give a truce at the demand of the United Nations

Tuesday again called on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to let
U.N. inspectors work in Iraq and said that he hopes a use of force

</P>
<P>
Henderson Charlton Jones stockbroker Stuart Smith noted the
National Foundation Day Holiday in Japan had left the market with

In Australia, the all industrials index finished the day up

<HEADLINE> China Reduces Death Penalty Sentences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China has greatly reduced
death sentences since adopting the newly revised criminal law last
October, said a top Chinese judge here today.
</P>
<P>
"The greater restriction on capital punishment shows that China
cherishes the lives of criminals," said judge Zhang Jun from
the Supreme People's Court, adding that the revised criminal law
asks courts to be more prudent with the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
China always limits the use of the cruelest punishment, said He
Bingsong, a law professor at China University of Political Science
and Law.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the law has reserved the provision of execution
suspension, minimizing the practice of immediate executions, said
He, who had joined the law revision group. In China, probational
criminals might often have their punishment commuted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the new law will still severely punish bank robbers
and criminals who steal valuable cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Before the adoption of the revised law, many criminals were
sentenced to death because of indecent activities or speculation
and profiteering, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In practice, larceny accounts for a high rate of capital
prisoners. But the new criminal law exempts pregnant women and
offenders under 18 years old from the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
Kui Xiujuan, who was convicted of murdering an 8-year-old boy
in central China's Hubei Province, has been saved by the new
criminal law. After finding that she was pregnant during the
judicial procedure, the local court changed the sentence from
capital punishment to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Because of the limitations on the death penalty, the number of
felonies have increased in the past four months in prison, said
Yin Shiyong, an official in Tianjin Prison.
</P>
<P>
The state, however, will not revoke the death penalty at
present, said Yang Runshi with the Supreme People's Court.

<HEADLINE> Ethnic Artists Give Concert of Ancient Music in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 elderly artists
from the Naxi ethnic nationality in southwest China's Yunnan Province
gave a performance of 1,000-year-old Taoism music in Beijing
Concert Hall last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ranging in age from 60 to 80, the artists came from a 443-year-
old troupe in the town of Lijiang in northwestern Yunnan. They
played ancient music pieces and songs which had been performed at
Taoist religious ceremonies in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and Song
Dynasty (960-1279).
</P>
<P>
In traditional dress, the musicians started with a famous
melody composed by an emperor in the Tang Dynasty. They also
performed a number of ancient compositions which previously had
been regarded as lost musical works.
</P>
<P>
In their hometown, the musicians perform the traditional music
nightly for domestic audiences and foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
To date, the art troupe has received invitations to play
concerts from several European countries such as France and
Norway.

<HEADLINE> Nile Perth Harmful for Lake Ecology Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Introduction of Nile perth, a
predator, has led to disruption of ecological balance in Lake
Victoria, said a local environment report.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 species, including 170 local fishes, are feared
extincted, "The State of the Environment Report" on uganda
estimated.
</P>
<P>
About 98 percent of the 170 local fishes referred are unique
in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Nile perth was introduced in the fifties into Lake Victoria
for commercial purpose.
</P>
<P>
The drastic decline of population of local herbivore-fish,
especially haplochromine, has led to the increase of blue-green
algae by five times within three decades from the sixties.
</P>
<P>
The overgrowing of water plants has consumed most of the
oxygen in the water and led to the decrease of other water
organism and disrupted the food chain in the lake, an earlier
report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region government announced Wednesday the
reorganized institutional framework for information
technology-related matters.
</P>
<P>
Under the rationalization exercise, the Broadcasting, Culture
and Sport Bureau (BCSB) will be restructured as the Information
Technology and Broadcasting Bureau (ITBB).
</P>
<P>
While retaining the policy on broadcasting matters, the
reorganized bureau will take over the responsibility on
telecommunication and information technology applications within
the government from the Economic Services Bureau and the Finance
Bureau respectively.
</P>
<P>
BCSB's current responsibility for arts, culture, sports and
recreation will be transferred to the Home Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
In his policy address last October, Chief Executive Tung Chee
Hwa has committed to re-grouping the responsibilities now divided
among several bureaus relating to information technology-related
matters and commission one bureau secretary to lead and coordinate
the government overall effort in these areas, said a government
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"This is a rationalization exercise which involves portfolio
adjustment of existing bureaus rather than the establishment of an
additional bureau," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Although the precise date of establishing the reorganized
bureau is being worked out, we hope to implement our proposals
around April," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On whether there may be reshuffling of policy secretaries, the
spokesman said that any appointment or posting matters will be
dealt with by the Secretary for the Civil Service in the normal
manner and separate announcements will be made in case of any
changes.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urged US to Drop Planned Attack on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has urged the U.S. to drop planned military strike on Iraq
and conform to the call of the world against use of force, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the foreign diplomatic corps here on the eve of the
19th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution Tuesday night, Khatami
said that those who intend to attack Iraq "should come to their
senses."
</P>
<P>
He advised them to "for once listen to the call of the
conscience minds...in order to prevent a calamity from taking
place."
</P>
<P>
The critical situation and the prevailing atmosphere in the
region is not pleasant at all and "we all are witness to the
threats against Iraq," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Iraq must definitely comply with
international regulations, but any attack on Iraq is not
acceptable to us because the oppressed Iraqi people will suffer
the consequences and Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity
should be highly respected," he added.
</P>
<P>
Khatami termed the presence of foreign fleets in the Persian
Gulf as "an insult to regional nations," saying people in the
region are capable of preserving security.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed that Iran has been pursuing an active
diplomacy for peace and detente, and proposed a dialogue among
civilizations and cultures instead of confrontation.
</P>
<P>
He said "our nation seeks relations with the world on the basis
of reciprocal respect and mutual interests, but we are a
dignified nation and expect others who wish to have relations
with us not to expect us to abandon our independence and dignity."
</P>
<P>
He seemed referring to the effort to facilitate exchanges
between Iranian and U.S. peoples after nearly two decades of
isolation since the two countries severed diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Khatami has called for a resumption of people-to-people
relationship with the U.S.. Washington responded by emphasizing
government-to-government contacts, but set a string of
pre-conditions for a thaw in bilateral ties.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A high ranking
delegation from India's Electronics and Computer Software Export
Promotion Council arrived here Wednesday for a seven-day visit to
explore trade and investment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Their arrival coincides with a four-day Made in India
Exbition, which also begins Wednesday in Johannesburg. The
delegation and the exhibition were organised by India's ministry
of commerce.
</P>
<P>
Indian Counsul General S. Tayal said the delegation, with
interest in areas such as consumer electronics,
telecommunications and computer software, is keen to conclude
business opportunity contracts and joint venture partnership with
their South African counterparts.
</P>
<P>
India's total exports of electronics goods and computer
software between April last year and March this year amount to
2.74 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Export of these items between India and South Africa amounts
only to 5.4 million U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Alert to Impact of Regional Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The regional financial crisis
that has rocked East and Southeast Asia is now a cause of worry
for Vietnam, the official "Vietnam News" said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The consequences of the monetary illness on Vietnam's economy
will increase during 1998, a year thought of as the key to the
five-year plan that will take the country into the 21st century,
the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The weaknesses which brought several countries into financial
crises are also to be found in the Vietnamese economy, some
economists said.
</P>
<P>
These include an imbalance of development, an improper
investment structure, too much dependence on foreign capital in
particular, a high rate of foreign debt and a weak finance and
banking system.
</P>
<P>
Although some factors helped Vietnam escape the worst of the
crisis, but the fall in the value of regional currencies has put
the Vietnamese dong under great pressure.
</P>
<P>
The black-market price of the U.S. dollar has increased,
creating a great difference between the exchange rate paid by
commercial banks and the street.
</P>
<P>
It also adversely affected a low-interest rate policy aimed at
encouraging national investment and commercial banks found it
difficult to mobilize capital that would ensure their international
and domestic payment capability.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said all these factors will affect Vietnam's
socio-economic targets for 1998. the plan is to maintain the gross
domestic product at 9 percent and ensure the other goals set
for the country.
</P>
<P>
To counter the impact of the Asian financial crisis, the
Vietnamese government has taken macro-micro measures including the
adjustment of the investment structure.
</P>
<P>
Investment will be channeled mainly into production, commerce
and key infrastructure projects other than real estate such as
hotels and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Proper foreign currency policy and the flexible adjustment of
exchange rates are crucial to limiting the impact of the crisis,
it said.

<HEADLINE> German Speed Skaters Make Clean Sweep in Women's 3,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Gunda Ninmann-Stirnemann led
Germany to make a clean sweep of the gold, silver and bronze medals in
the women's 3,000-meter speed skating at the Nagano Winter Olympics on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ninmann-Stirnemann and her teammates Claudia Pechstein and Anna
Friesinger all broke the Games record on their way to skating a 1-2-3
Olympic speed skating history victory for the third time.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Ninmann-Stirnemann, 31, set the new Games record of four
minutes and 07.29 seconds for the gold medal, 1.18 seconds ahead of
the world record holder Pechstein.
</P>
<P>
Friesinger took the bronze with a time of 4:09.77.
</P>
<P>
It was also in the 3,000 meter event of the Sarejevo Games in 1984
that the women's East German team swept to victory, taking all three
medals.
</P>
<P>
The German women's speed skating team sent to the Albvertille Games
in 1992 was equally vitorious in a clean sweep of the 5,000m event,
where Niemann-Stirnemann and Pechstein took gold and bronze
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The only other speed skating team to sweep up all three medals was
a team from the former Soviet Union in the 500m event at the Insbruck
Games in 1964.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very nice day for me," said Niemann-Stirnemann, who was
at that stage unbeaten in her favorite event for more than three years.
"I'm so happy to be here, and I'm very happy with this medal."
</P>
<P>
Pechstein, who set the world record of 4:07.13 in Hamar, Norway, on
December 13 last year, had a slow final lap, and was edged out of a
gold medal by her teammate.
</P>
<P>
"The last two laps were very hard, so I'm very happy with my silver
medal," Pechstein said. "I still have my world record, too. I knew I
had a good chance at a gold medal, and I had a good race, but Gunda
had a very strong race.
</P>
<P>
"In the 3,000, all of the German skaters are very close. It's a
good competition, because we are all together."
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Friesinger is making her Olympics debut and
surpassed her former best record of 4:15.99 this time.
</P>
<P>
"It looks nice, first, second and third, doesn't it. I wasn't doing
well at the beginning of the year, because I was ill. But now I'm in
good shape."

<HEADLINE> Uganda Applies for Loan for Road Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has applied to the
World Bank (WB) for a 30 million U.S. dollars soft loan for
emergency repairs of over 5,400 kilometers of major roads.
</P>
<P>
Wanjusi Wasieba, the state minister for works, transport and
communications, handed the loan application Tuesday to Randolph
Harris, the WB resident representative in the country.
</P>
<P>
Wasieba said 60 percent of total 90,000 kilometers of its
major roads had been damaged by heavy rains in recent months and
are in need for repairs.
</P>
<P>
Harris said a WB mission had been in the country to assess the
condition of the roads. Some 30 million U.S. dollars would be
required to repair the damaged roads, the mission estimated.
Harris said Uganda will receive the loan by May 30 after WB and
international development agency have discussed the terms of
credit and experts have studied the request.
</P>
<P>
The WB is also considering providing some 6 million U.S.
dollars as "retroactive financing" for emergency road repairs to
begin ahead of the date the loan will be received, The New Vision
reported.

<HEADLINE> European Lawmakers to Vet Use of EU Funds in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- European legislators are
going on a site-inspection tour of Bosnia later this month before
deciding on the release of a third of this year's financial
assistance from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc delegation from the European Parliament is due to
visit Bosnia from February 21 to 24 to survey the use of the
financial assistance the European Union has provided for the
reconstruction process in the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament has voted to salt away 30 percent of
this year's financial resources of 30 million ECU (33 million
U.S. dollars) designated for Bosnia and other former Yugoslavian
republics, claiming that Sarajevo had mal-administered last year's
funds from the European community.
</P>
<P>
The fund on hold will be released only when there is a
guarantee that the aid management system has been improved.
</P>
<P>
Tom Spencer, head of the investigation team, described the trip
as "a delicate assignment at a delicate time."
</P>
<P>
"We are going to verify that European funds for the Bosnian
reconstruction programs are being correctly used," said Spencer
who added that it is a politically complicated time for his
delegation to pay the visit in that it coincides with the EU's
plan to extend the reconstruction and refugee resettlement
programs to Bosnia's Serb areas.
</P>
<P>
One of the problems related to mal-administration, according to
European Parliament sources, was rail transport. Problems impeding
free movement in Bosnia have so far prevented the resumption of
traffic between the two Bosnian entities -- the Croat-Muslim
Federation and the Republika Srpska.

<HEADLINE> New Regulations Aim to Control Tarim River Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Management regulations have
recently been established to rationally develop the water
resources of the Tarim River, China's longest inland river in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
This first set of regional regulations ever enacted to
strengthen the management of water resources is concerned with the
rational development, utilization, protection and mangement of the
river valley's water resources, environmental experts said.
</P>
<P>
The 2,176-kilometer Tarim River flows across southern Xinjiang,
with a drainage area of 500,000 square kilometers. As one of
China's important cotton production bases, the valley's land in
cotton cultivation increases more than 40,000 hectares every year.
</P>
<P>
Its total area of cotton cultivation reached more than 600,000
hectares in 1997. The estimated production of 900,000 tons for
1997 would be one-fifth of the country's total cotton output.
</P>
<P>
Land in cotton cultivation will be enlarged to 800,000 hectares
in the valley by the end of the century to meet the country's goal
of building Xinjiang into a mega-sized cotton production base, one
local official said.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region established a management
organization in 1992 to cope with the environmental problems of
the Tarim River valley arising from irrational development of the
wasteland which has led to an ecological imbalance causing a lower
volume of water, loss of large forested areas, and further
encroachment by drifting sand.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Explain Bollworm Infestation In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Scientists are blaming the
arid climate and overuse of nitrogenous fertilizer and agriculture
chemicals for an outbreak of bollworm in China.
</P>
<P>
The cotton crop has suffered heavily from similar outbreaks in
many parts of China in recent years, and a group of agronomists
led by Guo Yuyuan from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural
Sciences have been studying the problem since 1994. Lab
experiments and studies of historical records led them to conclude
that the arid climate is the main environmental reason.
</P>
<P>
Research showed that the higher the moisture content in the
soil, the fewer bollworms there are. Guo said that outbreaks
have occurred more frequently in the Yellow River Valley, and when
there is more rain the situation will improve.
</P>
<P>
He also says that nitrogenous fertilizer causes the situation
to worsen because it provides conditions suitable for the
propagation of bollworms.
</P>
<P>
The overuse of chemicals was cited as another reason, but their
effect has been reduced in valleys of the Yellow, Yangtze, and
Liaohe rivers.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are looking for more effective ways to control the
bollworms and plant diseases through bio-engineering.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israeli President Weizman Heading for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Despite the opposition of
the ruling Likud party, Israeli President Ezer Weizman seems to
be heading steadily for reelection in next month's presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
At the Tuesday Knesset (Parliament) faction meeting, the
Likud party finally chose Tuesday Likud lawmaker Shaul Amor as
its candidate for the presidential race to compete against
Weizman.
</P>
<P>
But immediately following the Likud's endorsement of Amor,
Weizman told a group of the opposition Labor Party's lawmakers
that he was confident that he would win the reelection in
the March 4 vote in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Weizman based his confidence on the fact that about 70
members of the 120-member Knesset have expressed support to him.
In addition to the Labor Party, another opposition party Meretz
and two major coalition parties, The Third Way and Yisrael
Baaliya, have also stated their support to Weizman.
</P>
<P>
Even two members of the Likud, Jerusalem Major Ehud Olmert
and Reuven Rivlin, have decided to cross the party line to
support Weizman. The Likud has agreed not to impose party
discipline on its lawmakers in the vote for president.
</P>
<P>
Amor is expected to be endorsed by the religious parties, such
as Shas and National Religious Party, as well as some Arab
lawmakers. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly had to
acknowledge that Weizman would win the reelection. And some of
his aides have expressed concern about the future relations
between the outspoken president and the prime minister, who have
never been at good terms in the past.
</P>
<P>
For Netanyahu, the Likud's endorsement of Amor was a somewhat
reluctant choice. Because the coalition only has the minimal 61
majority in the Knesset, Netanyahu dared not to risk antagonizing
Amor who could defect if he was not endorsed.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, 74, is a veteran politician. who has served in
many important positions for the country in the past, including
Air Force Commander, ministers of defense, of science and of
Arab affairs.
</P>
<P>
A man of strong personality and unique manner, Weizman has
endowed the presidency with new dimensions, despite it is only
a ceremonious post without executive powers under Israeli laws.
Since his election as the seventh President of Israel in 1993,
Weizman has gained more popularity than any of his predecessors
by being active in both politics and in tackling social
issues.
</P>
<P>
He often demonstrated his solidarity with the citizens during
difficult times by conducting visits to war-torn border towns,
soldiers wounded in South Lebanon fightings, and victims of
terror attacks and disasters.
</P>
<P>
Most notably, Weizman has increased his involvement in the
peace process which has been in deep trouble since the Likud's
access to power in 1996. He has openly criticized the Likud's
hardline policies and repeatedly pressured the government to
push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Weizman's active political role has also become a
source of public controversy, as the rightist camp criticizes
him for transcending the laws by interfering in the government
functions.
</P>
<P>
For example, a big controversy was created last September
when press reports revealed that Weizman urged visiting U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to pressure Netanyahu to
break the deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of Weizman's reelection has led Netanyahu's
aides to fear that the rocky relations between the president
and the prime minister could worsen in the future. They
expected Weizman to become more outspoken in criticizing the
government since he will be serving his second and last term.
</P>
<P>
However, some Likud lawmakers still pin their hope on the
defection of some members from the Labor and Yisrael Baaliya.
Noting the ballot will be a secret one, they insisted that
the Knesset vote is not a walkover for Weizman yet and Amor
could have with him a good fight.

<HEADLINE> Qiao Shi on "One Country, Two System" Principle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao
Shi said here Wednesday that China would unswervingly carry out
the principle of "one country, two systems" over a long period of
time, so as to maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and development.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), made the remarks when he met with Hong
Kong deputies to the eighth NPC and deputies-elect to the ninth
NPC here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
He attributed Hong Kong's smooth return to China and continued
prosperity and stability to the implementation of the principles
of "one country, two systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong" with a high degree of autonomy put forward by Deng Xiaoping,
and to the fruitful work of the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) government and the concerted efforts of more than six
million Hong Kong compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He quoted Deng as saying that China's policy toward Hong Kong
will not change 50 years after it returns to the motherland in
1997; the Basic Law should be in effect for at least 50 years, and
afterwards there will be no reason for change at all. Hong Kong's
status will not change, nor will China's policies toward Hong Kong
and Macao; the policy toward Taiwan will not change either 50
years after the issue of reunification is resolved in accordance
with the principle of "one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi stressed that these "are the principles we must
unswervingly follow in our work, and point to the direction of our
continuous efforts."
</P>
<P>
"As long as we work unremittingly in this way," he said, "we
can certainly maintain Hong Kong's prosperity, promote its
development, and eventually fulfill the great cause of reunifying
the motherland."
</P>
<P>
Qiao noted that the successful settlement of the Hong Kong
issue was closely related to the tremendous achievements made in
China's reform, opening and modernization, and Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability are likewise closely linked to
the development of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Reform and opening have taken deep roots in the hearts of the
Chinese people after 20 years of practice, he said. China can
thrive and realize modernization only by going along the road of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and engaging in
economic construction with one mind and one heart.
</P>
<P>
"This is the consensus and firm belief of the people all over
the country," said Qiao.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Hong Kong NPC deputies and compatriots to
continue to support the country's reform, opening and
modernization drive and make their contributions to the
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.

modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He also extended warm congratulations to the newly-elected
deputies of the SAR to the Ninth NPC.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the Ninth NPC will hold its first session in
Beijing on March 5, when the deputies to the Eighth NPC will end
their historical mission and the deputies to the Ninth NPC will
begin performing their duties.

"The system of the People's Congress is the fundamental
political system practiced in our country," Qiao Shi noted.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution stipulates that all powers of the state belong
to the people and the NPC is the organ for the people to exercise
state powers, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution, the People's Congress is elected in a
democratic way, is answerable to the people and is subject to
supervision by the people, while the state's administrative,
judicial and procuratorial organs are produced by the People's
Congress and are answerable to the People's Congress and
supervised by it.
</P>
<P>
Qiao pointed out: "The core of the system of the People's
Congress is that the people are the masters of the house."
</P>
<P>
NPC Deputies, he said, are members of the supreme organ of
state power, and they shoulder sacred and honored mission of
legislation and supervision.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the "one country, two systems" principle, he
emphasized, the SAR deputies are not entitled to supervise the SAR
government and should neither interfere in the work of the SAR
government nor interfere in the affairs which are within the
framework of the autonomy of the SAR.

HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said
here Wednesday evening that it is China's resolute policy to
govern the country according to law.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Hong Kong deputies to the Eighth and Ninth
NPC, Qiao said that further efforts should be made to strengthen
the legal system and guarantee orderly progress of the whole
society with a perfect legal system.
</P>
<P>
He said it is imperative to work for and safeguard the
authority and dignity of the constitution and laws, and implement
the Basic Law to the letter with regard to the issue of Hong Kong.
"All people are equal before the law," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that no individual or organization has privileges
beyond laws, adding that all customs and practices which do not
conform to laws must be firmly corrected and all acts in violation
of laws must be firmly looked into.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to carry out political restructuring in
China, develop socialist democracy and improve the socialist
legal system in a down-to-earth manner.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that it is necessary to turn democracy into systems
and laws which will not change because of change in the leadership
or in the views or focus of attention on the part of the leaders.
</P>
<P>
This will provide an important guarantee for lasting stability
and steady development of the whole country including Hong Kong,
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has made remarkable progress in developing
democracy and the legal system, but "more tasks are awaiting us to
do and some are very arduous."
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "We can surely turn China into a socialist
country under rule of law through our unremitting efforts."

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Stock Market to Develop Steadily Amid Continued Expansion (2) By Xinhua Writer Qian Yuhong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After three rounds of interest rate cuts since May 1996,
Chinese people have become increasingly ready to diversify their
investment, a tendency that has been reinforced by the improved
policies governing market regulation.
</P>
<P>
The new developments mean that the number of Chinese stock
investors will continue to go up and become more sensible.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Chinese economy and financial sector have not, by
and large, been affected by the Southeast Asian financial crisis
that has snarled Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia,
the Republic of Korea, Japan and the Hong Kong region. The
national economy, meanwhile, is expected to maintain a pattern of
"high growth and low inflation". The two will combine to create a
favorable external environment for the steady and continued
expansion.
</P>
<P>
A new and small stock market like China's badly needs to
expand, something that has become increasingly apparent in the
last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, more than 200 companies were listed on
Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges respectively, raising to 745
the number of China's listed companies.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, the number of A shares, those designed for
trading by domestic investors, increased by more than 2.6 million
shares to over 4.4 billion shares.
</P>
<P>
However, Xiao Zhuoji noted that as the market continues to
expand, the authorities should be more flexible in regulating the
expansion process to ensure balance of supply and demand and
stable development of the market.
</P>
<P>
"Expansion is not an end and we must not pursue quantity
blindly," Xiao said, adding that "The key lies in improving the
quality of listed companies."
</P>
<P>
Similar views have been expressed by Zhou Zhengqing, chairman
of the China Securities Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
"We should take advantage of the special functions of the stock
market to foster a number of large, competitive listed companies
with the State holding a majority stake," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
For all this, China will take measures to increase market
demand while rigidly selecting companies for listing, financial
experts say.

<HEADLINE> Europe to Contribute Economically to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer said here Wednesday that Europe has been exerting
efforts in the economic fields to help save the stalled Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Santer, on the fourth leg of his week-long tour to the region,
said Europe is now the largest donor to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA), contributing 1.8 billion U.S. dollars in the
forms of grant or loan since 1993.
</P>
<P>
"We are the biggest donor of aid to the PNA, and with this
economic cooperation, we also want complete results. That is the
best guarantee for the security in Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see this peace process succeed on the basis of the
Oslo Agreement," Santer said, adding that Israel's hardline
policies were affecting economic development throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a press release issued by Santer's delegation said
Europe has provided a total of 5 billion dollars through various
aid packages to such regional economies as Egypt, Jordan, Syria,
Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian-self rule areas, all on
Santer's itinerary this time.
</P>
<P>
Santer emphasized that Europe intended to promote the economy
in the region with such aid packages, so as to contribute to peace
process on all tracks, including the Palestinian-Israeli one.
</P>
<P>
However, he said Europe did not want to compete with the U.S.,
but wanted to play a complimentary role.
</P>
<P>
Santer arrived here Tuesday morning. He met King Hussein,
Crown Prince Hassan, Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali, Minister
of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh and other senior officials
during his 24-hour stay here.
</P>
<P>
He left here Wednesday morning to continue his trip to Lebanon
and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Animal Embryos Found in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-U.S. team of scientists
has found in rocks the fossils of complex animal embryos dating
back to nearly 600 million years in southwestern China.
</P>
<P>
The embryos, no bigger than grains of sand, lived in shallow
sea water in present-day Wengan County in Guizhou Province, which
later became phosphate-rich rocks.
</P>
<P>
The discovery, considered one of the most important
evolutionary developments of this century, has rewritten the
history of animal origins, according to comments from the
international scientific community.
</P>
<P>
Previously fossil records showed that life on Earth first
appeared as bacteria almost four billion years ago, remained
single-celled until 540 million years ago when various
multicellular plants and animals mushroomed in what is known as
the Cambrian explosion.
</P>
<P>
Although scientists thought that complex life must have existed
before 540 million years ago, they had found no clear fossil
evidence to support their theory.
</P>
<P>
The discovery of the oldest animal embryos have shed light on
the "long and lightless" period before the Cambrian explosion,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
"There may be no explosion at all according to our research, "
said Professor Zhang Yun of Beijing University, one of the
scientists on the three-member team. "We put ahead the time of
origin of animals on Earth, which suggests that animals did not
occur in a sudden explosion but experienced a long period of
evolution," he said.

<HEADLINE> Oldest Animal Embryos Found in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhang began to look for life traces in the phosphate-rich rock
in Doushantuo in Wengan County in the late 1980s and found fossils
of multicellular marine algae. The find led him to think that there
might be traces of multicellular animals among the prehistoric sea
weeds.
</P>
<P>
His study attracted the attention of Andrew Knoll, a Harvard
University professor. In 1994 Zhang and Knoll, along with Zhang's
student Xiao Shuhai, went to Doushantuo and took the pieces of
rock which are now identified as containing the first animal
embryos.
</P>
<P>
Xiao, who is now pursuing a doctoral degree under Knoll at
Harvard, discovered that the prehistoric shapes in the fossils,
measuring 0.02 inch in diameter each, represent a progression from
fertilized eggs to two-, four-, eight-cell and later-stage
embryos.
</P>
<P>
"Once the embryos grew into adults, they would have a size
between one millimeter to one centimeter," Zhang Yun estimated. He
said that it is impossible to tell what kind of adult the embryos
would have grown into, yet he extrapolated that the embryos may be
"bilaterians."
</P>
<P>
Bilaterians, with a head and rear and near-symmetrical left and
right sides, represent a more complex life form which includes
everything from flatworms to human beings.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the three scientists appeared in the latest
issue of Britain-based "Nature" magazine. Coincidentally, the
latest issue of the U.S. "Science" magazine which was published
almost at the same time as "Nature," carried an essay written by
another team of scientists who have also conducted research on the
Doushantuo fossils and described similar discoveries.
</P>
<P>
The second team includes Chia-Wei Li, of the National Tsing Hua
University, Taiwan; and Chen Junyuan, of the Nanjing Institute of
Geology and Paleontology in Nanjing, capital of east China's
Jiangsu Province.

<HEADLINE> Casinos to Be Closed Wednesday Midnight in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- All the casinos in Turkey have
to switch off their tempting lights as of midnight on Wednesday as
the Constitutional Court refused to repeal the law ordering the
closure of these controversial places.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Tourism Ministry has instructed relevant provincial
governor's offices to supervise the closure of the 79 casinos
scattered in hotels and holiday resorts, local newspaper Daily
News said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A commission composed of officials from the Ministries of
Tourism, Finance and Internal Affairs will record the number and
type of all the tables and machines in the casinos, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
Some 20,000 casino employees are expected to lose their jobs as
a result of the closure. They, however, have claimed that they
will file compensation case with the courts.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Turkey's Constitutional Court, supreme judicial
body of the country, turned down an application, filed by some
civil courts, which demanded the cancellation of the
casino-closure law.
</P>
<P>
Under this law, which was officially published on August 10,
1997, all the activities of the casinos in Turkey have to come to
a halt in a six-month period after the law's publication.
</P>
<P>
Local public have held that the existence of casinos would
corrupt social values and seduce people into unlawful
activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates said Wednesday that the advent of the personal computer has
made it possible for governments to set up services in a matter of
weeks that previously took months or a year or more to build.
</P>
<P>
Gates made the remarks at a company-sponsored conference in
Seattle which ended Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 foreign delegates attended the conference, called
"Empowerment 2001," where they shared ideas and learned how
Microsoft products can aid their administration.
</P>
<P>
The officials were shown Microsoft and other software products
designed to help governments contact and communicate with citizens
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Software designed to smooth data exchange and communications
among government agencies also was demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
A Microsoft executive told the officials that the company wants
to spread the word about its network servers to help governments
install e-mail, publishing, security and database software.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft, largely known for its desktop software, is
undertaking a pilot project involving six European cities that are
constructing Web sites to provide new services and communications.
</P>
<P>
In a reference to the U.S. Justice Department's investigation
of Microsoft's business practices, Gates assured the delegates
that his company would continue to add features that make software
more powerful and easier to use.
</P>
<P>
The development of Windows 98 or Windows NT 5.0, which are
expected to be released later this year with built-in Internet
access capability and features, will not be affected, he said.

<HEADLINE> China to Speed up Industrialization of Patent Techniques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- To promote the
industrialization of patented techniques, the Patent Office of
China will choose 100 key patents every two years as "pilot
projects" for industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Each of the candidate techniques applying for the "pilot
project" should have an enterprise as its supporter which would
base its production on the patent, said Gao Lulin, director of the
Patent Office of China.
</P>
<P>
The sales volume of such patent products for each enterprise is
estimated at 10 million yuan (1.2 million U.S. dollars) in the
first year of production and 100 million yuan (12 million
U.S. dollars) after five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Many high-tech patents in China cannot produce good economic
and social benefits soon after they are innovated because of the
slow process of industrialization, he said. The "pilot project"
will coordinate major state actions to develop the high-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
The Patent Office of China will help the pilot enterprises be
listed among state projects and provide consultation services and
personnel training, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
He said that patent departments at all levels should try to
encourage banks and taxation departments to give support for the
industrialization of patent techniques.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Calls for Lower Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos Wednesday called on the participants of a national economic
meeting to map out new strategies to reduce interest rates which
he said are killing the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Ramos made the call in his keynote speech at the one-day
national economic meeting held here. Some 350 participants from
all walks of life are expected to draw up new measures to surmount
the current financial crisis at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We uphold the importance of downing inflation. We underscore
the importance of minimizing exchange rate fluctuations. But even
as we do so, let us not kill the economic recovery with high
interest rates," Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the currency crisis, prime lending rates soared
to between 28 and 32 percent in the Philippines, dealing a heavy
blow to the business sector and the manufacturing industry.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos also stressed the importance of raising
national savings, the rate of which stood at a low 19 percent
compared to 39 percent in neighboring countries at present.
</P>
<P>
A sharp increase in the national savings would reduce the
country's dependence on foreign funds whose withdrawal had
dampened the peso and the economy amid the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said capital market reforms were in the right direction
and "new saving instruments are emerging in the financial and
equity markets to supplement bank deposits and pieces of real
estate, along with the traditional choices of individual and
household savers."
</P>
<P>
At the one-day conference, the delegates discussed currency and
interest rate problems, the country's fiscal discipline and
savings policy, enhancement of productivity and the protection of
jobs and vulnerable sectors.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Cabinet Minister Leaves for Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Kuwaiti official
left here Wednesday for Cairo, Egypt on a regional tour to deliver
letters from the Kuwaiti leadership to other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Cabinet Affairs Abdel Aziz Dakhil Al-Dakhil
will also proceed to Syria and Morocco to convey the messages of
Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah on developments of the current
crisis.
</P>
<P>
This tour came amid increasing tension in the region stemming
from a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq over the
stand-off on arms inspections, and Kuwait's concern about a
retaliatory attack from Iraq in case the U.S. strike come true.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, Al-Dakhil is scheduled to meet Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad and King
Hassan II of Morocco, the Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Dakhil toured the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states
earlier this month to deliver messages to the GCC leaders
informing them of Kuwait's stand in the current stand-off and in
efforts to coordinate its position with its allied members.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the six member states - Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain - have
gathered in Kuwait Wednesday to hold an extraordinary meeting to
discuss the developments of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The six GCC members have different views on how to force Iraq
to meet all U.N. arms inspection demands.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Qatar have expressed support for a military action
if diplomacy fails to bring the current crisis to an end.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwait also repeatedly expressed its support for a
diplomatic solution for the Iraq-U.N. stand-off.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Stock Market to Develop Steadily Amid Continued Expansion (1) By Xinhua Writer Qian Yuhong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's stock market is
expected to develop steadily in the "Year of Tiger" as departments
concerned will take more flexible measures to regulate the market
expansion process.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is made on the basis of taking into account of
both the need of enterprise reform and the central government's
determination to develop the capital market, said Xiao Zhuoji, a
noted professor and economist of the prestigious Beijing
University.
</P>
<P>
The central government has decided to actively develop the
capital market and allow enterprises to raise funds directly from
the market on a greater basis, such as selecting more
well-performing enterprises for listing on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
"Based on this understanding, I will say that continued
expansion will be a keynote in the development of the stock market
this year," Xiao said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
With regard to market supply, the country's 15 billion-yuan quota
for share issues had not been used up by the end of last year,
while the use of the 30 billion-yuan quota for 1997 has not even
been started.
</P>
<P>
In terms of market demand, economists say China needs to inject
up to one trillion yuan into enterprise property rights reform and
asset restructuring and one-third of the amount is expected to
have to be raised from the stock market.
</P>
<P>
All these facts indicate that there exist great potentials in
both supply and demand and the stock market has much space for
further expansion.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, expansion of the Chinese stock market has
strong resources of financial support. Statistics of the People's
Bank of China, the country's central bank, show that Chinese
residents had a total of 4.6 trillion yuan in savings deposits by
the end of last year.

Handicrafts were also developed in Loulan and there were
workshops for woolen blankets, pottery, and bows and arrows around
the city.
</P>
<P>
Relics unearthed at the Loulan site suggested that the city
reached its peak during the Later Han Dynasty (25-220), He
said. At that time, the city had become a hub on the Silk Road,
trading mainly in silk from inland areas, glass from Fergana, and
perfume from Parthia, both of which were Central Asian countries
whose coins could be used in Loulan.
</P>
<P>
People at the bottom of the social scale inherited the burden
of forced labor, and served as guides for envoys, businessmen, and
monks traveling to the kingdom and provided them with camels,
water, and food.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom was buried by desert during the fourth century and
disappeared from historical documents until it was rediscovered at
the beginning of this century by a Swedish explorer, near Lop Nur
Lake.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists disagree on the reason for the city's
disappearance. He Dexiu suggests that after the mid-third century,
the city's water source dried up and its citizens fled.
</P>
<P>
He said that the offsprings of the earliest citizens now live in
Xinjiang's Hotan Prefecture and along the middle reaches of the
Tarim River, and are part of the Uygur national minority. But, in
their buildings and handicrafts, one can still find traces of
their ancestors.

<P>
DHAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and Indonesia have
agreed to remove constrains for wider cooperation in textiles, oil
and gas, aviation, shipping and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached during a four-day official visit to
Bangladesh by Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas.
</P>
<P>
Alatas told reporters at the end of his visit Tuesday that
during his visit, the two sides signed an agreement on the
promotion and protection of investment.

<P>
Alatas, who arrived here last Saturday, said another one on
avoiding double taxation would be signed "very soon".
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the two accords, trade and economic
cooperation between Bangladesh and Indonesia would increase
tremendously, as trade between the two countries had been
conducted through third countries due to such obstacles as double
taxation, payment arrangement and lack of knowledge, according to
Alatas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Condemns U.S. Isolating Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian foreign minister Tom
Ikimi has condemned the U.S. government's policy of isolating
Nigeria, saying that it had served neither its economic nor
political interests.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi made the remarks Tuesday in an interview with the News
Agency of Nigeria in New York, where he was leading a delegation
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in New
York to brief the United Nations on the situation in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the hostile policy of the U.S., he said, many
Americans continued to do business with Nigeria, as exemplified
by increased U.S. investment in Nigeria from about four billion
U.S. dollars to over seven billion dollars in the past four
years.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the U.S. and other west countries of ignoring
Nigeria's progress in solving its political, economic and social
problems, saying that their policy towards Nigeria is based on
pre-conceived notions.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi, however, assured that the Nigerian government would not
be deterred in its pursuit of policies of nation interest,
especially the transition to civil rule program.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and other west countries have been taking a hard line
towards the Nigerian military government led by general Sani
Abacha. Their policies include economic sanctions, banning of
military co-operation and restrictions of visas to government
officials.

<HEADLINE> NPC Chairman Qiao Shi Meets Hong Kong SAR Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao
Shi said here Wednesday that the central government was satisfied
with the overall situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) and the international community also spoke highly of
this.
</P>
<P>
Over the several months after the establishment of the SAR, the
overall situation in Hong Kong has been good, the Basic Law has
been well implemented and economic prosperity and social stability
have been maintained in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), made these remarks when he met with SAR
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, principal government officials,
members of the Executive Council and of the Provisional
Legislative Council (PLC) here Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
He praised Tung, the first chief executive of the SAR, for
having done a huge amount of work with good results.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government has upheld Hong Kong's effective economic
operations and fiscal management and made great efforts to explore
and work for enhanced economic competitiveness, Qiao said, adding
that some major and sensitive political and social issues have
been dealt with properly.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Tung, the SAR government has
demonstrated its strong ability to control the situation as a
whole and its management and organizational capabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiao recalled last December's election of Hong Kong deputies to
the Ninth NPC, describing it as "successful and satisfactory".
</P>
<P>
He thanked Tung and the SAR government for their help in the
course of the election.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi said that the recent financial turmoil in Southeast
Asia has affected the whole world. The resolve and measures of the
SAR government to maintain the linked exchange rate between the HK
dollar and the U.S. dollar have stabilized the confidence of
investors and Hong Kong people and maintained the stability of
Hong Kong's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The turmoil may still have some effects on Hong Kong's economy
and people's life, but I believe Hong Kong is fully able to
overcome the difficulties, maintain its prosperity and continue to
develop," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Tung Chee Hwa said that Hong Kong citizens
are familiar with Qiao. That is because the NPC and its Standing
Committee did a lot for Hong Kong's return to China, and impressed
Hong Kong citizens with its endeavors to strengthen China's legal
system, to bring the role of the NPC to fuller play and to promote
the country's reform, opening up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong returned to the motherland, the concept of "one
country, two systems" has been implemented, Tung added.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee, taking Hong Kong SAR's particular
situation into consideration, made special arrangements in the
assignment of the number of deputies to the NPC, the form of
election and the work pattern of the HK deputies in an effort to
ensure the implementation of the concept of "one country, two
systems", Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The smooth election of the SAR deputies to the Ninth NPC
demonstrated that these arrangements won support from Hong Kong
citizens, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were also Ann Tse-kai and Henry Fok
Ying-tung, vice chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference; Jiang Enzhu, director
of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch; and Ma Yuzhen,
commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
On hand were Betty Tung, Administrative Secretary Anson Chan,
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang, Secretary for Justice Elsie
Leung, convenor of the Executive Council Chung Sze-yuen and
President of the Provisional Legislative Council Rita Fan.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Qiao and his wife Yu Wen attended a luncheon
hosted by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi arrived in Hong Kong Tuesday in the company of Liu
Zhen, deputy secretary general of the NPC Standing Committee; Liu
Mingqi, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office
of the State Council; and Zhou Chengkui, deputy secretary general
of the NPC Standing Committee.

<HEADLINE> Nepali PM to Face Censure Motion Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Surya
Bahadur Thapa will stand the test of a no-confidence motion next
Monday in parliament, Speaker Ram Chandra Poudyal announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the censure motion will begin next Monday and
voting on next Wednesday, the speaker told a special session of
the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The special session was called as directed by King Birendra,
who on February 4 decided to accept the petition of 96 MPs to
convene a special parliament session to discuss their
no-confidence motion against the present coalition government.
</P>
<P>
On February 6, 89 MPs from the main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML) and former prime
minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand registered a censure motion in the
Parliament Secretariat. Chand and his supporters have broken away
from the National Democratic Party (RPP) led by Prime Minister
Thapa.
</P>
<P>
However, Wednesday's special session cannot discuss the censure
motion, as under Nepal's laws, discussions and voting on the
motion can take place 10 days after it is registered.
</P>
<P>
The King's decision to summon a House session, taken on advice
of the Supreme Court, has come under strong criticism from the
ruling Nepali Congress and Prime Minister Thapa, whose
recommendation to dissolve parliament for mid-term polls was
turned down by the King.
</P>
<P>
Thapa, who came to power last October, is the most short-lived
prime minister in Nepal to face a censure motion.

<HEADLINE> SADC Institutional Reforms Face Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of
institutional reforms by the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) could be delayed until next January to allow
member sates to prepare for the change.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's state-owned newspaper Times of Zambia Wednesday
quoted Lengolo Monyake, deputy executive secretary of the 14
member regional body, as saying at the weekend the restructuring
study would not be ready for discussion by ministers of the
member states until this September.
</P>
<P>
The delay will allow members time to formulate national
positions. A number of countries has yet to begin internal
consultation which could have been completed before a regional
workshop is organised.
</P>
<P>
In accodance with an initiative, there will be a creation of a
number of commissions in key sectors over the next two years. And
deeper reforms should be carried out over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The initiative which was raised last year in a consultant's
report will result in the introduction of strong centralisation
of SADC institutions, removing them from member states.
</P>
<P>
Although the report was completed in 1997, said the paper, its
recommendations including streamlining the secretariat's
activities and reforming the formula for determining
contributions have yet to be implemented.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Airlines to Delay Delivery of Boeing Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Airlines, the
country's largest airlines, wants to delay delivery of several
Boeing planes it has ordered for the next two years, the Seattle
Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A vice president of the airlines was quoted as saying that
officials are discussing delivery dates with Boeing and talking
with other airlines that might be interested in moving up
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
The delay was prompted by a Malaysian government decision to
trim imports to stem the outflow of the weakened Malaysian
currency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the delivery of five Boeing 777s and
possibly several 747-400s would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Airlines ordered 15 Boeing 777s and 10 Boeing 747s
worth 4 billion U.S. dollars two years ago. All these planes were
to be delivered within five years starting from May 1997.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said that as many as 60 deliveries could be jeopardized
over the next two years by the currency crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that delayed orders from Asia will not hurt Boeing
unless the delays turn into cancellations.
</P>
<P>
Other Asian carriers facing financial problems include Asiana of
South Korea, Grauda of Indonesia, Cathay of Kong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, Airbus said Wednesday that it is delaying a
potential launch date for its 550-seat superjumbo jet by at least
nine months, pushing the first delivery off until 2004.
</P>
<P>
Airbus had planned to launch the A3XX this year, the delivery
of which was set to start 2003. Potential buyers of the aircraft
are mostly from Asia.

<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin, general secretary

years. He praised China for its rapid economic development and
stability.

difficulties through its own effort and with the help of the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Kim thanked China for the understanding it showed and the
support it gave to the ROK after the financial crisis took place.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Exports to Remain Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- When Asian currencies started
crashing last summer, executives, economists and politicians
expressed their hope that the devaluation, though hurting economic
growth, would greatly boost the region's exports and stimulate an
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, that has yet to happen. Instead, Asia's exports
are weak and the growth prospects may remain dim in the months
ahead.
</P>
<P>
Asia's exports began to slow down in 1996, when the world
electronic market saw a cyclical downturn. The weaker demand of
electronic products, the major export products of some Asian
countries, badly affected economies of the region and their growth
rates were 2-3 percent lower in the year than the previous ones.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of last year, the world electronic market
has been recovering. However, a financial crisis sweeping Asia has
defeated hopes of stronger economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Currencies of most Southeast Asian countries and South Korea
have lost 40 to 60 percent of their value against the greenback in
the past seven months, higher interest rates imposed by central
banks to defend currencies have hindered economic expansion, and
bad bank loans and huge corporate debts have weakened investors'
confidence in the Asian market.
</P>
<P>
Facing the financial market turmoil, company executives,
economists and government officials predicted that the currency
devaluation would make export products more competitive on the
world market and an export boom could promote an earlier economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
However, such predictions may prove to be correct only in
theory. During the past few months, Asian exports have continued
to suffer as cash for raw materials has dried up and prices of raw
materials become much higher due to currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
In Southeast Asia, as producers buy most of their raw materials
and components from abroad, the advantages of devaluation have
been offset by higher prices of imported raw materials. In the
Philippines, of one dollar earned from electronic exports, 60
cents would pay for imported materials and components.
</P>
<P>
As the value of Asian currencies has shrunk, so has the ability
of exporters in the region to borrow U.S. dollars to pay for
imported raw materials. In Thailand, where the baht has dropped
about 50 percent since last July, exporters need double the
collateral they offered in the past to finance dollar purchases.
</P>
<P>
After being hit severely by non-performing loans, which have
amounted to 1,000 billion dollars in East Asia, banks are pulling
back on credit. It is nearly impossible for many normally sound
exporters to get financing from shell-shocked banks.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that many garment factories in Thailand,
Malaysia and Indonesia cannot pay for fabrics these days.
</P>
<P>
Since local banks have to set aside huge sums to write off bad
loans and do not want to risk another currency plunge or a
borrower going bankrupt, they are reluctant to lend. The situation
may continue for some time, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
A slump in the intra-Asia trade is another big problem
affecting export performance in the region, where one third of
exports revenues come from intra-regional trade. At present, most
East Asian countries are cutting imports to save money for
financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in imports could help improve trade balance of
Asian countries and stabilize the financial markets, but would
impede export surges this year, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sharp currency devaluation in some East Asian
countries has imposed great pressures on export performance of
other Asian countries, which have to reduce prices of export
products and improve product quality to compete on the world
market. But their export growth is almost certain to slow down
this year.
</P>
<P>
All these factors would affect Asia's export growth this year,
and Asian governments should not pin their hopes on exports for a
quick recovery, economists said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Passes Amended Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan parliament passed a
new anti-corruption bill Wednesday empowering a court to fine
corruption officials up to seven million shillings (some 7,000
U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The amendment to the prevention of corruption bill passed in
1970 was presented by Emmanuel Kirenga, the State Minister for
Justice and Constitutional Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The main amendment in the provision concerning corruption is
the maximum fine raised from 20,000 fixed in 1970 to 7 million
Ugandan Shillings due to devaluation of Ugandan currency.
</P>
<P>
A person convicted of the offence of soliciting, receiving or
giving gratification to civil servant could be jailed for a
maximum of ten years and made to pay a fine of seven million
shillings, local paper, The New Vision reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill also empowers the court, on the application of
director of public prosecution, to freeze a bank account or
restrict disposal of property belonging to a person on charges
related to corruption.
</P>
<P>
The provisions concerning the fine can be altered without
seeking any amending legislation if shilling devaluated, The
Monitor quoted the State Minister as saying, but the paper did
not give the details concerned.
</P>
<P>
Uganda authorities reaffirmed its decision to fight against
corruption repeatedly. Any suspected official has an obligation
to provide his or her explanation concerning such a case to court
or legislation.
</P>
<P>
But some legislators said the bill will not tackle corruption
effectively.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologists Shed More Light On Life In Early China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists are
looking at the lives of people in Loulan, an ancient kingdom that
existed along the Silk Road about 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
After a thorough study of tombs and corpses found there, He
Dexiu, a leading archaeologist in China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region, has suggested that animal husbandry was a major
part of Loulan's economy, and that the kingdom had the world's
first forest protection law.
</P>
<P>
As early as 4,000 years ago, the people of that area knew about
the use of fire, and were using stone tools. They lived in houses
made of wood and earth, and the men hunted and fished, while the
women stayed at home weaving. Yet, they did not know how to make
pottery and clothing, and they wore sheepskin, He, who has studied
thew culture for more than two decades, explained.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, the Loulan Kingdom was
founded nearly 2,300 years ago. It had various officials who were
in charge of law enforcement, settling disputes, taxation, and
other social affairs.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom had a comprehensive legal system dealing with
crimes, heritage, taxes, land, hunting, and forest protection. The
forest protection law stipulated that anyone who felled a tree
would pay a penalty of one horse, and that anyone who cut off a
branch of a tree would pay with a cow.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that this was the world's first law of its
kind, and that people there desperately needed the forest to stop
the fierce wind and sand.
</P>
<P>
The city at Loulan city grew with the exchanges of goods, but
most people still lived on animal husbandry, and agriculture
developed around the outskirts of the city. Some of their major
products were cheese, butter, meat, and wheat, and they grew
grapes and made wine, which became one of the main taxable items
in the kingdom. There were departments in charge of collecting
wine for tributes and officials whose wine tributes were in
arrears could lose their jobs.

<HEADLINE> More Big People in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Today's "Health News" reports
that more of the citizens of Shanghai are becoming obese and that
preventive measures are desperately needed because of the health
risks it imposes.
</P>
<P>
The news comes from Prof. Jiao Donghai of Shanghai's Xiangshan
College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, who drew this conclusion
from a study of obesity done among 4,895 adults and 9,093
teenagers in the city.
</P>
<P>
The study revealed that 12.69 percent of the adults surveyed
were overweight, and 11.35 percent of the teenagers. Also, 15
percent of the males were overweight, but only 10 percent of the
females, and among teenagers, 14.7 percent and 7.9 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The study found that people generally become fat between the
ages of 7 and 12, and from 60 to 70.
</P>
<P>
It also found that illiterate people or those with only a
primary school education get fat easier, and the higher the
education the better shape they are in.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Jiao, who is one of the sponsors of the survey, said that
obesity can affect appearance and become a psychological burden
for fat people, and affects the quality of life as a major cause
of chronic illnesses and can shorten a person's life span.
</P>
<P>
He points out that fairly good dietary habits and a good
lifestyle are important in preventing obesity.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Sri Lankans Fond of Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Imagine what would happen if
there were a halt of sugar production in the world. It might be OK
for you but not the Sri Lankans.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, sugar is so popularly served that the country
needs more than half a million tons of sugar annually to meet its
market demands.
</P>
<P>
"Most of Sri Lanka's 18.6 million people have a sweet tooth.
They like to have large quantities of sugar in their food and
drinks," said B. H. S. Jayawardene, a retired local journalist.
</P>
<P>
The few who desist from consuming sugar are mostly those
suffering from diabetes or who have been advised not to take much
sugar for other medical reasons.
</P>
<P>
Captain A. V. Rajendra of the Ceylon Ocean Lines Ltd. rarely
drinks his tea without sugar. Usually he puts four pieces of cube
sugar to flavor his pure Ceylon tea. He said many of his fellow
countrymen do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, sugar availability
in Sri Lanka in 1996, including human consumption and industrial
consumption, was 563,275 metric tons, or an annual per capita
consumption of 31.5 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
A local research institute says the average direct sugar
consumption for one person each month is around 1.2 kilograms, or
14.4 kilograms a year.
</P>
<P>
Many poor people eat sugar as frequently as those middle class
families, for they believe sugar is a substitute for other
nourishment such as meat and fish, which they could ill afford,
local experts said.
</P>
<P>
A great quantity of sugar is consumed while drinking tea. Tea
is seldom drunk without sugar and Sri Lankans at all levels of
society are voracious tea consumers, who drink tea about four or
five times a day.
</P>
<P>
For each cup of tea, they usually put in two to three
teaspoonfuls of sugar. The same goes for coffee and fruit drinks,
which are usually laced with a generous serving of sugar.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a variety of sweets, cakes and sweet meat are
readily available in Sri Lankan households. During festive
seasons, the consumption of such foods are almost limitless.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is also used in Sri Lanka in making liquors, such as
brandy, rum, gin, vodka and the local brand of arrack.
</P>
<P>
The zeal for sugar has proven to be costly for the government
as the country has to rely heavily on imports to meet the huge
market demands.
</P>
<P>
Due to bad weather conditions, domestic production last year
dropped to 65,087 tons, or 11 percent of the total demands. The
output in 1996 was 72,274 tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Sri Lanka imported about 491,000 tons of sugar worth
8.875 billion rupees (about 143 million U.S. dollars), inclusive
of the cost of freight. About 380,740 tons of the imported sugar
went for direct human consumption.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government holds the monopoly for the import of
sugar, which is currently retailed at 30 rupees (less than half a
dollar). Production cost of local sugar is estimated at between 20
to 25 rupees per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
To maintain an affordable price level, the government controls
prices and has on occasion subsidized the sugar industry.
</P>
<P>
Only three of the country's four sugar factories are in
operation at present. The factory at Kantalai in the northeast is
out of production because of the ongoing ethnic war between the
majority Sinhalese people and the minority Tamils in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is extracted here only from cane, which is harvested from
about 8,845 hectares of land, though the country boasts to have a
total of 12,535 hectares of land under sugar cane cultivation.

AUCKLAND, New Zealand, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Defense

official good-will visit to New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
Chi is the first Chinese Defense Minister to visit the country

<P>
He noted that "the further development of China-New Zealand
relations serves the fundamental interests and common aspiration

development and stability as well."
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that his visit will help deepen the
understanding and trust between the two countries, facilitate
their cooperation and exchange, and promote their bilateral
relations and military-to-military relations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Food Prices Likely to Rise in Kenya: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Food prices are likely to
rise as shortages in the coming months become a reality by the
day, the Central Bank of Kenya has warned.
</P>
<P>
The bank further says that after the current El Nino rains,
food shortages will be complicated by the already widely forecast
La Nina weather phenomenon which is expected to usher in a spell
of drought.
</P>
<P>
The drought to follow the rains is likely to cause price
increases which if not preempted will undermine price stability
in the months ahead, according to the February edition of the
bank's Monthly Economic Review.
</P>
<P>
The review also reveals that the overall inflation rose to
19.9 percent last month from 2.7 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
The upturn in inflation was as a result of the rise in the
cost of inputs attributed to the rapidly deteriorating
infrastructure and the inadequate supply of basic foods in many
parts of the country, it says.
</P>
<P>
The inevitable food deficit caused by the heavy El Nino rains
will have to be met by imports which will require foreign
exchange and budgetary allocation, it noted.
</P>
<P>
The review suggests the authorities build up foreign exchange
reserves to meet extra demand for food and other imports.
</P>
<P>
The current budget allocations should be reviewed to urgently
accommodate the unexpected expenditures on road repairs, it
urges.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Exports $3M Flower, Fruit in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia earned 3 million U.S.
dollars in 1997 from exports of floricultural and horticultural
products, English-language newspaper Times of Zambia reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report released last week by the
Lusaka-based Barclays Bank of Zambia as saying that the figure
could have been much higher had it not been for last October's
abortive military coup in the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that since the state of emergency imposed
following the coup for security reasons, air freighters had to
depart the Lusaka international airport before 18:00 hours and
could only land after 06:00 hours local time, the products were
affected.
</P>
<P>
The products had to wait long hours at either Harare or
Nairobi airports before they could reach their destinations.
</P>
<P>
This, according to the report, led to buyers offering to buy
the products at an auction sale price.
</P>
<P>
But the report said the floricultural and horticultural
markets which are largely dominated by European markets, would
pick up this year after the freight restrictions are lifted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has a great potential of floricultural growing and it
is largely dominated by rose flowers.

BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China published 7.1 billion
books with 120,000 titles in 1997, a moderate increase over 1996,
the Press and Publications Administration said today.
</P>
<P>
The industry earned 36 billion yuan (some four billion US
dollars), a 30 percent increase over 1996, and showed a profit for
the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China is becoming the world's biggest
potential book market, in spite of the fact that Chinese generally
own very few books.
</P>
<P>
China is planning to import more books to increase the market,
administration officials say, and they attribute the increase to
policies meant to improve efficiency and quality, and to the
crackdown on illegal book licenses and piracy.
</P>
<P>
They say that the sector, which was affected by the planned
economy, is bracing itself for industrialization by establishing
publishing conglomerates.

<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
reported significant growth in its stock market last year, with
funds raised through annual share issues totaling 7.25 billion
yuan (873 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Companies in Hebei issued 880 million yuan worth of A-shares
(shares for domestic investors) in 1997, about 5.87 percent of the
national total. For the first time ever, the proportion was higher
than Hebei's share in the gross domestic product, which
stood at 5.1 percent last year, today's Shanghai Securities News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The share issues by listed companies of Hebei have raised 7.25
billion yuan in funds last year, about 3.35 times the figure for
the 1993-1996 period.
</P>
<P>
Fund-raising in the stock market has played an increasingly
important role in Hebei's economic growth, the daily newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Currently Hebei has 18 listed companies, which had a combined
asset value of 24 billion yuan by the end of last June, and 47
securities trading operations. Investors in Hebei had opened a
total of 541,600 stock trading accounts by the end of

<HEADLINE> Unemployment In Kenya Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment in Kenya has
been aggravated partly due to a rise in the output from
educational and training institutions which did not correspond
with job creation, a veteran local scholar says.
</P>
<P>
Currently more than 2.7 million Kenyans are unemployed, the
Daily Nation newspaper Wednesday quoted Prof Raphael Munavu of
the University of Nairobi as saying. Munavu is also the
university's deputy vice-chancellor.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the annual output into the labor market
has risen to half a million while only 240,000 opportunities are
available, 90 percent of them offered by the private sector, the
scholar said in a seminar in Nyahururu, near Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
It is critical for the public universities of the eastern
African country to diversify their approach and take
consideration of skilled manpower requirement in the private
sector, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The teaching sector in the universities has been largely
ignored, he lamented.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 17,685 public university staff in Kenya,
only 3,678 or nearly 21 percent are involved in academic work.
The rest are administrative and support staff, according to him.
</P>
<P>
The five-day seminar, due to end later this week, aims at
improving current public university policies and programs to meet
the country's industrialization demands.

LHASA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The market economy in the Tibet
Autonomous Region of China has kept the economy growing for four
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
The region's GDP for 1997 is estimated at 7.35 billion yuan, an
increase of 10 percent from the previous year.
</P>

Yang Chuantang, executive vice-chairman of the region, says

controls, and has removed price controls from some major
commodities like grain and tea. Now prices of most commodities are
now regulated by the market.
</P>
<P>
Tibet also adopted a series of policies to promote the private
economy and share-issuing companies.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, there were 41,000 households involved
in business, with 240 million yuan in funds. There were about 200
private businesses in Tibet with 83 million yuan in funds, 396
companies issuing shares, with 1.47 billion yuan in registered

<HEADLINE> Oil Inventory Normalizes in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Petroleum products and crude
oil inventory of major oil companies have normalized to 41 days
from the critical level of about 31 days, the Philippine News
Agency reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting data from the Energy Industry
Administration Bureau, said the improvement can be attributed to
the increase in the inventory of crude oil from an average low of
17 days to the current 27.5 days.
</P>
<P>
The current 41-day inventory of crude oil and finished products
is equivalent to about 7.3 million barrels, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Industry leaders are optimistic that the new oil deregulation
law signed Tuesday by President Fidel Ramos will further boost the
supply of oil products in the country.
</P>
<P>
The new law provides a minimum inventory for the players in the
oil industry to ensure security and continuity of domestic oil
supply, taking into account total stocks on hands, stocks en route
to other stock points and importation in-transit to the country.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts predicted that oil prices in the country will
go up as the results of the oil deregulation law and the current
currency crisis sweeping the country.
</P>
<P>
The hike of oil prices will lead to price increases of basic
commodities, therefore pushing up the country's inflation.

JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's Home Affairs
Minister Yogie S. Memet warned Tuesday that there have been signs
of difficulty ahead of a meeting of the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) next March to decide on the country's next
president.
</P>

The minister urged a closer watch on the signs, saying, "Unless
the indications of problems are watched closely and preventive
measures taken, it is possible that wider problems could occur,"
the official Antara News Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
One thousand people's representatives will gather here from
March 1 to 11 and their agenda includes selecting the next
president and vice president for the country.
</P>
<P>
Yogie said practical political activities of the people have
grown "sharper" and more critical, transparent, aggressive and
explosive. Frequently they have a tendency to violate the law, he
declared.
</P>
<P>
He said there has also been an increase in defiance against the
government and security personnel.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the next MPR meeting will be an important
event that will determine the progress of the government for the
next five years. Therefore, the MPR requires a secure, conducive
and disturbance-free atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Measures have been taken to anticipate socio-political
situations before the meeting, he noted, adding that the
authorities have asked the public and security personnel to be
more alert to difficulties.

<HEADLINE> China to Ease Students' Burden by Canceling Teaching Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China's State Education
Commission announced today that it is planning to ease the burden
on students by changing the contents of their textbooks.
</P>
<P>
Chinese, mathematics, foreign languages, physics, and chemistry
textbooks used in primary and middle schools are the target, a
spokesman says, explaining that some of the materials are too
complicated and extensive for youngsters, and others are still
being debated by academics.
</P>
<P>
The changes will not be applied to senior middle schools this
year.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, Chinese students who want to enter college have a
heavy study load, and feel that it is a mental and physical
burden. Many complain about too much homework, the increased
tension between students and teachers, and the pressure from their
families.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been criticized by the public and the
government is urging that the system of education with core exams
be abandoned, and that students' be better developed overall and
be given more time for extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
China introduces a nine-year compulsory education system that
requires students to have six years of primary school and three
years of middle school.
</P>
<P>
The goal of education is to provide students with basic study
skills for their lifetime and an ability to survive in
society. But, this system has not been implemented effectively in
many regions.
</P>
<P>
The commission will also introduce subjects like population,
health, national defense, and traffic safety to primary and middle
schools, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 700,000 primary and middle schools and more
than 200 million students.

<HEADLINE> SAARC Countries Lack Doctors for ENT Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Member countries of the South
Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) are in need of
surgeons and equipment to deal with the increasing ear, nose and
throat (ENT) diseases, an expert said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is one surgeon for every 300,000 people in the SAARC
countries, against one surgeon for every 19,000 in Japan,"
Professor P. W. Alberti, general secretary of the International
Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies, told the
inaugural session of the first SAARC ENT conference.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has a high incidence of cancer, of which almost 60
percent relates to head, neck and throat, and the incidence of
throat carcinoma is about 10 times higher than that in Western
countries, according to Professor M. A. Majed.
</P>
<P>
"But we are unable to deal with them adequately and
scientifically due to limited manpower and resources constraint,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the four-day conference,
Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus Samad Azad hoped that doctors
both inside and outside the SAARC would share their knowledge and
expertise and cement professional ties.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Another Hung Parliament Possible in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- All the three major
political forces in India have claimed that they and their allies
could win a majority in the parliamentary elections to start on
February 16, despite opinion polls showing that India is expecting
another hung parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress and the United
Front (UF) have said repeatedly in their election campaigns that
they and their allies could gain a majority in the Lower House of
the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, India's weekly magazine Outlook in its first published
survey conducted by A. C. Nielson, a market research agency, on
January 18 said, "The country is all set for another hung
parliament with the BJP and the Congress increasing their tallies
at the expense of the UF in the elections."
</P>
<P>
The BJP and its allies are likely to get 238 seats out of all
the elected 543 seats in the lower house, followed by the Congress
and its partners with 149 seats and the UF with 123 seats.
</P>
<P>
In its second survey published on February 8, the same magazine
said that although the campaign of Sonia Gandhi, widow of former
Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, for the Congress appeared to have
halted the BJP on its track, Sonia's efforts "will still not
prevent a hung parliament."
</P>
<P>
The survey predicts that the BJP and its allies will end up
with 231 seats. But the Congress might notch up more than 172
seats as Sonia steps on the pedal in the final days of the
campaign. The UF will get 118 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Media Studies (CMS) in its poll published on
January 19 said that despite an over 9-percent swing in their
favor, the BJP and its allies are unlikely to get an absolute
majority in the coming elections. The BJP is likely to get
235-245 seats while the Congress and UF could get 140-150 and
110-120 seats respectively.
</P>
<P>
Other surveys like those conducted by the TIMESPOLL and Arun
Nehru have given a similar picture.
</P>
<P>
"Mrs. Sonia Gandhi's whirlwind campaign is impacting public
opinion in this election in more than just numbers: Most ominously
for the BJP, Sonia seems to be swinging public opinion in favor of
a Congress-led alliance with the UF in case of a hung parliament;
43 percent want a Congress-led government against 38 percent for
the BJP; two-fifths want the UF to extend support to the
Congress," Outlook magazine said on February 8 in its second
survey.

<HEADLINE> Currency Peg Reports Cause Indonesian Rupiah to Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian rupiah surged
against the U.S. dollar Tuesday on reports that the government
might peg the currency to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah closed at 7,400/7,600 against the dollar from its
opening of 8,700/8,900 in the morning trading session, the local
press Wednesday quoted currency dealers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's close was far higher than the previous day's close of
9,600.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said foreign market players were reluctant to take any
long position on the dollar on reports that the government would
peg the rupiah to the greenback.
</P>
<P>
"Some Japanese banks sold large amounts of dollars to buy the
rupiah in the foreign exchange market. They wanted to unwind their
long position on the dollar," the dealers said.
</P>
<P>
"The rupiah was able to quickly gain ground against the dollar
because the trading volume was thin," they added.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto said on Monday that the government would
soon announce new steps for the foreign exchange system to
stabilize the country's battered currency.
</P>
<P>
The president's statement gave rise to speculation that the
government would establish a currency board system, which pegs the
rupiah to the dollar at the 5,000 level, one dealer said. "This
prompted massive selling of American dollars."
</P>
<P>
The government's revised budget fro fiscal year 1998/99 assumes
an average exchange rate of 5,000 rupiah to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Bank Indonesia Governor Soedradjad Djiwandono said
the government was still studying the currency board system.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials at the Ministry of Finance, however, said it
would be difficult for Indonesia to peg the rupiah to a foreign
currency, given the poor performance of its commercial banks and
the limited amount of its foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
As the rupiah gained a better footing against the dollar, stock
prices in the Jakarta Stock Exchange fell 2.18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The composite index slid 11.55 points to 517.7 from 529.25 on
the previous day.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force on
Tuesday announced cuts and consolidations at domestic bases to
shrink the size of the armed forces and save money for weapons'
modernization.
</P>
<P>
California, Texas and Nebraska are among the states that will
lose thousands of military and civilian jobs.
</P>
<P>
Changes at McClellan in California will result in a loss of
1,494 military and 3,596 civilian jobs; the state's Onizuka Air
Station will lose 257 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Offutt Air Force Base in Nebraska will cut 623 jobs, while
in Texas Kelly Air Force Base will lose 290 military and 24
civilian jobs. Kelly's loss of C-5 depot maintenance work will
cost 1,057 civilian jobs. Further reductions in work at Kelly
through fiscal year 2001 will result in a loss of 4,160 military
and 6,500 civilian jobs.
</P>
<P>
Tinker Air Force Base in Oklahoma will undergo a series of
adjustments and cuts that will trim 358 military jobs but will
create 1,096 civilian jobs.

<HEADLINE> Drug Abuse Constitutes a Widespread Problem in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Drug smuggling and abuse, and
drug related crimes are on the rise in major Vietnamese
cities, Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister was quoted by the Vietnam Investment
Review as saying that despite a five-year nationwide anti-drug
drive, drug abuse are still widespread in the country specially in
big cities.
</P>
<P>
Official reports said since the anti-drug campaign launched in
January 1993, opium cultivation had been curbed, but drug
smuggling and abuse had increased and resulted in the increase of
drug-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister admitted, "despite the fact that we
have tougher regulations, the number of drug-related crimes has
been increasing and has not been effectively controlled."

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Municipal authorities in
Hanoi have decided to freeze construction of new hotels and
offices throughout 1998 following a sharp drop in the number of
tourists and commercial visitors to the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the Vietnam Investment Review,
there are about 72 projects already licensed in the capital city's
residential and commercial property market; nearly 80 percent are
funded by Asian investors.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese officials predict that in 1998 the capital's real
estate market will experience a sluggish year with modest growth
due to the current financial crisis in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"Supply is exceeding demand and at the same time there has been
a sharp drop in the number of travelers and commercial visitors to
Vietnam," said an official.
</P>
<P>
The official said local authorities have no plans to approve
additional investment this year in the hotel and office market
while current operating projects are being re-evaluated.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian snowboarder Ross
Rebagliati, gold medalist of the men's giant slalom, was disqualified
from the Winter Olympics on Wednesday after testing positive for
marijuana and will be striped of the gold medal, the IOC announced.
</P>
<P>
IOC Director-General Francois Carrard, who made the announcement
at a press conference, said Canada was appealing against the decision
to disqualify Rebagliati.
</P>
<P>
He said a ruling would be made within 24 hours on the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Marijuana is commonly used as a recreational drug rather than
performance-enhancing substance, but the International Olympic
Committee listed it in the banned substances.
</P>
<P>
Carrard said that metabolized marijuana was detected in an "A"
sample, and then a "B" sample confirmed 17.8 nanograms per
milliliter of the substance.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has no minimum amounts set for substance infractions, but
the International Ski Federation to which Rebagliati is a member sets
15 nanogram limit.
</P>
<P>
Deciding between issuing a warning or sanctions to the snowboarder,
both the medical commission and the IOC Executive Board voted in
favour of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The medical commission voted 13-12 to recommend sanctioning the
snowboarder to the IOC which takes the action. The IOC executive
board voted 3-2 with 2 abstentions on the matter, Carrard said.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Thomas Prugger won the silver medal behind Rebagliati on
Sunday, with Ueli Kestenholz of Switzerland taking bronze and Austrian
Dieter Krassnig finishing fourth. They would move up if the
disqualification is confirmed.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Italy Call for Diplomatic Solution to Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi Tuesday appealed for
a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Prodi made a statement after their talks claiming
that the situation in Iraq is growing more serious and that it is
necessary to intensify diplomatic efforts to resolve the dangerous
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The statement said there are reasons to believe the United
Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan can resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference after their meeting, Yeltsin who is
on a two-day visit, said: "What is essential is that we avoid an
inferno, that we should do everything to resolve this
confrontation peacefully through diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
Prodi said, "We are at a delicate moment for world peace," and
added that Italy and Russia "must make their joint position
known. I believe that our plea will not go unanswered."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Yeltsin met with Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, who pledged Italy's support in seeking a diplomatic
solution to the standoff over the issue of U.N. arms inspections
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, Prodi and the Russian president, who is on his
first overseas trip since last December, signed a "plan of action"
to boost bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The plan is the culmination of efforts to put into play the
peace treaty signed by the two countries in 1994.
</P>
<P>
They also signed accords for cooperation in the fields of
technology, education and culture, energy, and peaceful uses for
space.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses to Move up Jones Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. District Judge Susan
Webber Wright in Little Rock, Arkansas, Tuesday refused to
expedite the trial of Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit
against U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
In her decision Wright said that she understands the concerns
of the president's lawyer, Robert Bennett, to have a speedy trial,
but she also has to consider the plaintiff's interests.
</P>
<P>
The trial is scheduled to begin May 27.
</P>
<P>
Jones' lawyers are seeking additional discovery time, alleging
that some witnesses dodged subpoena servers before the January 31
deadline. Wright has not ruled on that issue yet.
</P>
<P>
Jones' lawyers are also asking Wright to reconsider her
decision to exclude evidence discovered in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation from the Jones' case. Clinton is accused of urging
Lewinsky to lie about an alleged sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
In his request on January 26, Bennett asked that the trial be
moved up because of the sensational nature of the Lewinsky news
coverage, saying the allegations should be immediately addressed
in court.
</P>
<P>
News reports quote Bennett as saying, "We are anxious to start
trial, because loose journalistic practices fed by improper leaks
and a near-hysterical media frenzy to beat the competition will be
left on the sidewalk and not allowed in Judge Wright's courtroom."
</P>
<P>
Jones alleges in her lawsuit that when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas in 1991, he propositioned her in a Little Rock hotel room.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has denied the allegation and refused to apologize,
claiming he does not recall ever meeting Jones.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and the United States later this year are expected to
conclude negotiations on developing a satellite-guided version of
the Multiple Launch Rocket System, a U.S. magazine reported.
</P>
<P>
The weekly magazine, the Defense News, said in its latest
edition that the five countries have been negotiating for several
months a memorandum of understanding that would lead to contracts
worth nearly 200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expects to invest nearly 100 million U.S. dollars in
the program, with the other four collectively contributing the
other half.
</P>
<P>
Partners to participate in the program include big companies
like Lockheed Martin of the U.S., Diehl Stiftung of Germany,
Aerospatiale of France and the British Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
Between 1994 and 1996, Germany tested the feasibility of a
rocket guided by the Global Positioning System satellite
navigation network.
</P>
<P>
The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System represents a
considerable system performance improvement over the original
unguided rocket.
</P>
<P>
The system increased accuracy means fewer missiles would be
needed to demolish the same high-value targets, such as forward
refueling sites, communications centers, radar systems and enemy
air defenses.

YANGON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A newly-built container wharf
at the Yangon Port was inaugurated here Wednesday to help enhance
the capacity of the port.
</P>
<P>
The 183-meter Bo Aung Kyaw container wharf is able to
accommodate 167-meter container ships.
</P>
<P>
The Yangon Port handles all of Myanmar's imports and more than
90 percent of its exports. Its container services increased by 60
to 80 percent during the last Four-Year Economic Plan period
(1992-96) and conventional freight handling rose by 20 to 40
percent in the same period due to rapid growth in exports and
imports.
</P>
<P>
The port also handled 87.2 percent of the 7 million tons of
seaborne goods passing through various ports of Myanmar in
1996-97, the first fiscal year of the present Five-Year Plan
(1996-2001).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is also implementing another development
project at Thilawa Port, which is located next to the Yangon Port,
building 17 container wharves mainly with investment from
Singapore and Malaysian companies.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serbs Start Building "Berlin Wall" in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 10 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Serbs started
building a wall between the Muslim-Croat Federation and
Serb-controlled parts of Sarajevo on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to Hina, the Croatian News Agency from Sarajevo, the
Serbs built a five meter-long and almost two two meter-high wall,
threatening to continue building the wall unless Goran Vasic is
immediately released.
</P>
<P>
Vasic was arrested at the end of last week on Federation
territory as the main suspect in the 1993 killing of war-time
Bosnian vice Premier Hakija Turajlic.
</P>
<P>
However, circumstances of his arrest have not been established
yet and the International Police Task Force (IPTF) is conducting
an investigation into the case.
</P>
<P>
UN spokesman in Sarajevo Alexander Ivanko said Tuesday that the
evidence concerning the case had been sent to the International
Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia (ICTY), so that it could
be established whether a trial based on a war crimes indictment
was justified.
</P>
<P>
According to Ivanko, the ICTY can decide to ask that Vasic be
handed over and be tried in The Hague for a war crime, or it can
confirm that there is a basis for instigating a legal procedure
against him in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
However, The Hague Tribunal can also decide that there is no
sufficient evidence for any procedure against Vasic.
</P>
<P>
The organizer of Tuesday's protest meeting, Dragan Savic, asked
that Vasic be taken over from Sarajevo police "at least by the
IPTF".
</P>
<P>
The protesters also demanded the replacement of Sarajevo Canton
Interior Minister Ismet Dahic.
</P>
<P>
Stabilization Force (SFOR) members watched the building of the
wall from a distance. At one moment, the IPTF deputy commissioner
Werner Schumm arrived at the site.
</P>
<P>
UN spokesman Ivanko told Hina that the IPTF would ask local
Serb police to secure freedom of movement on the road between
Sarajevo and the suburb of Lukavica.
</P>
<P>
If this is not done, the request will be furthered to SFOR,
Ivanko said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, Feb 10 (Xinhua) -- Slovenian Foreign Minister Boris
Frlec said Tuesday that Slovenian-Albanian relations are excellent
and there are many investment opportunities in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Frlec made the remark in a meeting with his Albanian
counterpart Paskal Milo, who is currently on a two-day visit to
Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed a variety of bilateral issues and
exchanged views on Ethnic Albanians in Macedonia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Slovenian News Agency (STA) reported that Frlec expressed
satisfaction over the development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Frlec said Slovenia is glad that Albania has stabilized
following last year's crisis, and his country supports Albania's
efforts to join Euro-Atlantic organizations.
</P>
<P>
As a country undergoing a process of privatization, Albania
offers possibilities for investment in power industry, tourism,
transport and mining, he said, adding that Slovenian enterprises
are strongly interested in doing business with Albania.
</P>
<P>
Despite an upward trend, trade between the two nations has been
scarce, amounting to only 10 U.S. million dollars in 1996. Albania
needs investments particularly in its infrastructure and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Albanian prime minister Milo thanked the Slovenian police for
helping solve the crisis in Albania, underlining Albania's desire
to receive more assistance, particularly in trying to bring its
police force into line with EU standards.
</P>
<P>
On ethnic Albanians in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, Milo
said Albania is against an outburst of violence in the region as
it could have disastrous consequences. The Albanian government is
making an effort to settle the issue through dialogue, Milo said.
</P>
<P>
Milo denied all allegations about Albania's cooperation with
armed groups in Kosovo and condemned terrorism in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, he is also scheduled to meet Slovenian
president Milan Kucan and Deputy Prime Minister Marijan
Podobniks.

<HEADLINE> Crippling Estate Strike Drags On in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 11 (Xinhua) -- A crippling estate strike in
Sri Lanka entered its seventh day Wednesday as President Chandrika
Kumaratunga is to mediate in another round of talks Friday between
trade unions and management companies.
</P>
<P>
The strike by some 600,000 estate workers in tea and rubber
plantations started last Thursday, only one day after the country
celebrated its 50th anniversary of independence. Strikers are
asking for a wage hike from the current 83 rupees (1.34 U.S.
dollars) per day to 105 rupees (1.69 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga intervened and convened a meeting Tuesday in an
effort to end the strike. Earlier, discussions between the
interested parties and Labor Minister John Seneviratne had failed
to produce positive results.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said Wednesday that the talks between the
president and 23 management companies under the Ceylon Planters'
Association (CPA) started at about 11 a.m. Tuesday and ended
around midnight.
</P>
<P>
The companies explained to the president the possible impact
the wage hike demanded by the unions would have on the estate
sector.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga also made some proposals, the details of which were
withheld.
</P>
<P>
The CPA said the management companies agree to increase the
daily wage to 95 rupees (1.53 dollars) and give a fixed price wage
bonus of 5 rupees for the next 24 months. The proposal was
rejected by the unions.
</P>
<P>
The strike has brought tea picking and rubber tapping in Sri
Lanka to a virtual halt. Many shops in tea production areas have
been closed in support of the strikers.
</P>
<P>
The last strike by estate workers in April 1996, which lasted
for one week, was estimated to have cost the government 500
million rupees (8.1 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Brazil Gives Priority to Cotton Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian government decided
to give priority to cotton cultivation in order to reduce
importation of this raw material and has taken several measures.
</P>
<P>
This was declared Tuesday by the Minister of Agriculture,
Arlindo Porto.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with cotton producers and traders, the Minister
explained that last year, Brazil spent 800 million dollars to
import around 500 thousand tons of cotton to meet domestic market
demands.
</P>
<P>
This figure, he stated, propitiated that the government of
President Fernando Enrique Cardoso decided to take the necessary
measures to encourage domestic production of this raw material.
</P>
<P>
Porto declared that on one hand the government is asking that
each state devotes proper lands for cotton cultivation and offers
</P>
<P>
A line of credit for 400 million dollars through the Central
Bank, thus enabling textile industry to buy Brazilian cotton.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government agreed to eliminate the
taxation imposed to circulation of goods and services for cotton
exports in order to avoid detachment of external and internal
prices, as well as increasing the common external rate from three
percent to six percent.

<HEADLINE> New Basic Wage Guarantees in Southeastern Chinese Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Labor, finance, and civil
affairs departments, and trade unions in China's Fujian Province
are developing a social welfare network to guarantee a minimum
wage and living arrangements for unemployed workers and urban
residents.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 140,000 laid-off workers and 1,815
enterprises, employing 177,000 people, which are in trouble. There
are also 32,000 needy urbanites and 100,000 impoverished farmers.

based on the level of economic development level and standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
Another regulation required companies that declared bankruptcy
or suspended production to contribute not less than 60 percent of
a minimum cost of living. The funds were expected to come from a
part of the employees' salary that was kept in banks, unemployment
insurance, or by government.
</P>
<P>
The province now has more than 80 million yuan (9.6 million US
dollars) in poverty-relief funds and has used 10 million yuan to
help 639 troubled enterprises and 72,400 employees in need.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Former White House Intern's Mother Called to Testify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Monica Lewinsky's mother
was called to testify on Tuesday before the grand jury probing the
former White House intern's alleged relationship with U.S.
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Appearing briefly before reporters after the testimony, Marcia
Lewis declined to speak to reporters. Her lawyer, Billy Martin,
said she would not comment.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky reportedly confided to her mother about her alleged
relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
Lewis is expected to return to the U.S. District Court here on
Wednesday for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, lawyers for Lewinsky plan to file a motion asking a
judge to quash a subpoena requiring the former White House intern
to testify before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's attorney, William Ginsburg, confirmed his client
will appear before the federal grand jury investigating her
alleged relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Without specifying whether she would invoke her Fifth Amendment
right to avoid self-incrimination, Ginsburg Tuesday reportedly
told reporters in Los Angeles "she will not defy either a federal
court order or a subpoena" when she appears in U.S. District Court
later this week.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky and Ginsburg are set to return to Washington later
this week for the legal showdown. Ginsburg is said to be fighting
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's subpoena for Lewinsky's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ginsburg said he would advise Lewinsky to invoke her
Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself if she is forced
to testify without a grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
However, she could still be compelled to testify before the
grand jury under a grant of limited immunity or face a contempt
citation from a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
Limited immunity would protect Lewinsky against prosecution
arising from her truthful testimony, but it would not protect her
from a perjury charge if Starr decided she was being less than
truthful.
</P>
<P>
And it would not protect her from charges arising from other
evidence besides her grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
Starr is investigating allegations that President Clinton urged
Lewinsky to lie under oath about an affair.

<HEADLINE> ICG Proposes Solution to Settle Dispute Over Brcko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The International Crisis Group(ICG)
on Tuesday proposed a compromise solution to resolve the dispute
over Brcko, the contested northern Bosnian town whose status is
currently being discussed before an Arbitral Tribunal in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
According to Hina, the Croatian News Agency from Sarajevo, the
ICG has proposed that the whole of the pre-war municipality of
Brcko, currently divided between the Muslim-Croat Federation and
the Bosnian Serb republic, be put under the joint authority of the
two entities.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, the new Brcko municipal council would have
wider powers that would prevent the direct influence of entity
governments.
</P>
<P>
The Brcko municipality would have autonomy in exercising the
cultural, educational and religious rights of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the international supervision mandate of the town
would be extended for another two years, while the whole
municipality would be demilitarized, except for NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
The dispute over who should control Brcko, a six-kilometer-wide
land corridor linking the eastern and western halves of
Serb-controlled territory in northern Bosnia, was left unsettled
from the Dayton agreement of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ICG, a non-government organization formed in 1995, has also
proposed that greater powers be given to the International Police
Task Force (IPTF).

Dong says that, out of 26,000 technological developments, 25
percent are being applied to the manufacturing industry, 16
percent to agriculture and 17 percent are used in the public
health, sports, and welfare sectors. A third of the developments
came from scientific institutes and 28 percent from enterprises.
</P>
<P>
From now on, China's major scientific findings will be
announced annually by the SSTC to push for their commercial

<P>
Large-scale farming and breeding also qualify for easier bank
loans, and technicians from cities are providing assistance.
Because there is at least 10 million mu (666,000 hectares) of
wasteland in Ningxia, tax exemptions are given for ten years for
land reclamation.
</P>
<P>
The policies have gotten more than 30,000 transient workers
back to Ningxia, which has just over five million people. They've
put more than 30 million yuan into agriculture and have built 200
orchards.
</P>
<P>
Stopping this flow of farmers to cities and keeping them in
agriculture are significant for social and economic development,
particularly for ensuring a sustained growth of grain production
in China, one analyst says.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, some 400 million
Chinese rural residents are engaged in farming. Cities employ an
estimated 50 to 60 million farmers, but urban job opportunities
are limited and the solution to the surplus labor question lies in
expanding agriculture, says the ministry's Wang Zhonghai, a
division chief.
</P>
<P>
Rural workers returning home will become a major item in 21st
century China, analysts predict. Indications are that 36 percent
of rural workers in Anhui, Hubei, Sichuan, and Jiangxi provinces
have returned to their home villages.

<P>
YINCHUAN, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in the Ningxia
Autonomous Region, in the northwestern part of China, have
voluntarily given up their transient work in cities elsewhere in
China to return to agricultural work.
</P>
<P>
One of them, 40-year-old Li Juzhen, left home several years
ago and made a small fortune by working as a construction foreman
in various cities. But, this winter, he stayed in Ningxia to look
after milk cows, and made a good profit as a result. He decided to
return home when he heard that many people were benefitting from
"high-yield agriculture" that emphasizes the use of science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he used 1.6 million yuan of his own savings plus
bank loans to build 110 heated sheds for the 175 milk cows he raises,
which brought him a profit of 600,000 yuan (72,000 US dollars) by
January of this year.
</P>
<P>
During the long cold winter, idle land used to force many
farmers to go to cities to look for work. Cities are attractive,
Li admits, but incomes are not stable, and now, farming is less
risky and can also be profitable. He even hired 10 temporary
workers.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have pointed to Li's story as a sign of
successful government policies for rural laborers.
</P>
<P>
The Ningxia regional government has set up high-yield
agriculture demonstration centers to show farmers how it works,
says Cui Yongqing, the director of the Regional Agriculture
Department.

<P>
BUDAPEST, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States has written
an official letter to Hungary, asking for military support once it
carries out military strikes against Iraq, Hungary's Magyar
Televizio reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Hungary understands differently about the forms of
support Washington asks for, the station said.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian Foreign Ministry said earlier Tuesday that the
U.S. requires logistic, medical and antichemical warfare support,
but later, the ministry's State Secretary of Political Affairs
Eorsi Matyas said that Washington only hopes Hungary to offer
political and moral support in its possible strikes against Iraq
over the U.N. weapons inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
The defense ministry simply expressed that it is thinking
nothing more than the possibility of providing "technical and
medical support" to the U.S. military action.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991 gulf war, apart from medical support, Hungary
allowed the U.S. transport airplanes to fly over its air space to
the great pleasure of the U.S. side.

SAN JOSE, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Government leaders from
European Union countries and Central-America inaugurated a
multilateral meeting Tuesday aimed at analyzing the European
process of integration and cooperation between E.U. and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the meeting, Costa Rican President Jose Maria

undergone in the last 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Figueres analyzed the cooperative perspectives between the
European Union and Central American countries saying that "Today
we are partners working towards an extraordinary mission of hope."
</P>
<P>
Figueres said the meeting will have a tremendous impact in the
geo-politics of Central America and is essential for the
settlement of peace in the region, which was torn by conflicts in
1980s.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President of the European Union Manuel Marin outlined the
success of cooperation between Europe and Central America.
</P>

He was pleased to see that the armed political conflicts that
scourged the region were settled, and the dialogue between the
European Union and Central America was looking for new targets, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Marin said the European Union should contribute to Central
American integration, which is necessary for Central America in
the process of globalization.
</P>

Representatives from 15 countries are attending the meeting.
Government leaders from six Central American countries, including
the Dominican Republic and a representative from the government of
Belize, are also at the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel will host the 1999
UEFA Cup final, a senior local soccer official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ya'akov Erel, chief executive of the Israel Football
Association (IFA), Monday said that the "heads of UEFA" had
approved having Israel host the one-match final set for May 12,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Israel had sought to hold a cup final in the year 2000 but
he said UEFA had informed the IFA that it could host the match a
year earlier.
</P>
<P>
"This is a great honour for us," said IFA Chairman Gavri
Levy. "It shows that we are regarded as equals in Europe, it is
time that we hosted a European final," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel, situated in Asia, has been a fully-fledged member of
UEFA since 1992 because its Arab neighbours did not want to play
against it.
</P>
<P>
Erel said that a UEFA fact-finding mission had recently
visited Israel and had granted the National Stadium in Tel Aviv
a rating of four stars out of five.
</P>
<P>
Another UEFA event scheduled for Israel is the convening of
the UEFA executive committee in December.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Textile Industry Coming to Terms with Overproduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 11 (Xinhua) -- China has started a three-year
textile reform program to help its textile industry get out of red.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, a total of 10 million spindles are expected
to be eliminated in cotton mills in north, east, northwest,
southwest, central south and northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai held a grand spindle eliminating ceremony recently
that marked the start of the program, which will cut production to
increase efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to turn China's bulky textile industry,
which had 46 million spindles in 1997, into a leaner one by the
end of the century, when the number of spindles will be reduced by
10 million to 36 million and the number of textile workers cut by
1.2 million to 1 million.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, Jiangsu, Hunan, and Hubei provinces have followed
Shanghai's lead in responding to the State Council's call for a
leaner textile industry. Shanghai's Vice Mayor Jiang Yiren, who is
heading a team that oversees local textile reforms, promised that
Shanghai will get rid of 682,000 spindles by the end of this year,
and reduce the number of workers to 271,600, half the number when
it was at its peak.
</P>
<P>
Shandong was second in the move to cut production capacity by
640,000 spindles this year and 170,000 next year. The province
will have 4.5 million spindles by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, which is another major textile base, has set out to
cut the number of spindles by 1.01 million by the next century.
</P>
<P>
Hubei, which is one of China's major cotton producers, has said
it will eliminate 400,000 spindles and improve textile production
by renovating small spinning plants.
</P>
<P>
Nearby Hunan has also instituted a three-year reform to cut
366,000 spindles, with 155,000 to be removed this year.
</P>
<P>
Hebei, to the north, and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
in the northwest are also reported to be making similar
moves.

YANGON, February 11 (Xinhua) -- An Australian company has
reached a contract with Myanmar to jointly conduct pearl culture
and production on a profit-sharing basis.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed here Tuesday between the Atlantic Co.
Ltd. of Australia and the state-run Myanmar Pearl Enterprise, the
proposed pearl culture and production will be carried out in
Myanmar's Tanintharyi Division in the southern part of the
country, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported

</P>
<P>
The Atlantic Co. Ltd. is the second foreign company to have

initiated an agreement in March last year to carry out similar
undertakings on the Myeik Archipelago in the same division.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's cultured pearl
production in the 1996-97 fiscal year reached 7,332 momme (27.49
kilograms), while its highest record was 17,840 momme (66.9
kilograms) in 1983-84.

LIMA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Peru`s Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) increased 7.4 percent in 1997 over 1996, Felix Murillo, head
of the National Institute of Statistics and Information, declared
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Murillo said that for the last five years Peru's GDP
accumulated a total growth of 41.9 percent, making Peru one of the
Latin American countries with the fastest economical growth.
</P>
<P>
All sectors, except the fishery which was affected by El Nino,
contributed to the overall increase.
</P>
<P>
As a result of strong expansion in building highways, local
roads, dwellings and huge shopping malls, the construction sector
registered an increase of 21.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The sector of utility grew 11.2 percent due to the increment of
electricity generation.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a greater flow of domestic and imported products to
different wholesalers and retailers, the commercial sector also
increased 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing activity increased 6.5 percent due to the
increment on fabrication of consumer, intermediate and capital
goods.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Review Air Safety Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Transportation
Secretary Josefina Lichauco has ordered a review of the country's
air routes and regulatory standards in the wake of the February 2
crash of Cebu Pacific Flight 387.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported on Wednesday that Lichauco has issued
the order to Air Transportation Office (ATO) chief Carlos Tanega,
asking him to re-examine the country's air routes and regulatory
standards, strictly reassess the safety standards of all domestic
airports with emphasis on navigational requirements.
</P>
<P>
The report said Lichauco made the decision after the ATO was
criticized for clearing the ill-fated Cebu Pacific jet plane to
fly to Cagayan de Oro, the southern Philippines, on a seldom-used
route.
</P>
<P>
The route entails flying over several high mountain peaks and
the peril heightens when thick clouds are blanketing the area,
just as what had happened to Flight 387 which slammed onto a steep
mountain ridge.
</P>
<P>
All 99 passengers and five crew members aboard the jet were
feared dead. Forensic experts have identified at least six bodies
from the mangled body parts brought down by helicopters from the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
Before Flight 387's tragedy, at least three other air accidents
had happened on the route.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Gives Priority to Cotton Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZILIA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian government decided
to give priority to cotton cultivation in order to reduce
importation of this raw material and has taken several measures.
</P>
<P>
This was declared Tuesday by the Minister of Agriculture,
Arlindo Porto.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with cotton producers and traders, the Minister
explained that last year, Brazil spent 800 million dollars to
import around 500 thousand tons of cotton to meet domestic market
demands.
</P>
<P>
This figure, he stated, propitiated that the government of
President Fernando Enrique Cardoso decided to take the necessary
measures to encourage domestic production of this raw material.
</P>
<P>
Porto declared that on one hand the government is asking that
each state devotes proper lands for cotton cultivation and offers
</P>
<P>
A line of credit for 400 million dollars through the Central
Bank, thus enabling textile industry to buy Brazilian cotton.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the government agreed to eliminate the
taxation imposed to circulation of goods and services for cotton
exports in order to avoid detachment of external and internal
prices, as well as increasing the common external rate from three
percent to six percent.

<HEADLINE> Canada Sends Ship, Planes to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Tuesday that
it will send a frigate and two transport planes to the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
After a Cabinet meeting Tuesday, Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said Canada wanted to demonstrate its compliance with the
international community in ending the Iraqi arms inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also noted that military action is not yet
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has resisted giving unlimited access to U.N arms
inspection teams, which are often led by the United States. Now
the U.S. and other members of the United Nations are threatening
to use force to make the Arab country comply.
</P>
<P>
Canadian military officials said the HMCS Toronto, a heavily
armed patrol frigate, would be available for duty in the Gulf
within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
It will also send two C-130 Hercules transport planes to the
region. The planes could be used for tactical supply missions and
inflight refueling of other aircraft.
</P>
<P>
A total of 400 Canadian military personnel will be involved in
the military buildup in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Yet, compared with its effort during the Gulf War of 1990-91,
Canada's contribution is quite modest this time.
</P>
<P>
The country just wants to show that it stands alongside the
United States, some analysts have said.
</P>
<P>
In the Gulf War in 1991, Canada sent two destroyers, a supply
ship, 24 CF-18 fighter bombers and a field hospital.
</P>
<P>
Canadians will not in the event of conflict, participate in
fighting, Defense Minister Art Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
"They are not going to be directly involved in an aggressive,
combatant-type role; that will be carried out by the United States
and the UK," the minister said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Finances Private Industry Project in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Tuesday a 10.25 million U.S. dollar equivalent credit for a
private industry recovery project in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The project will help foster a speedy revival of the private
manufacturing sector, which was badly affected by the crisis in
the country last year, by reducing the risk to potential investors
in the Albanian economy, and by reestablishing investor confidence
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The project sets up the Political Risk Guarantee Facility
(PRGF) which will provide guarantees against political risks to
enterprises and their financiers that intend to engage in
commercial activities in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government has established an independent
corporation -- the Albanian Guarantee Agency (AGA) -- to manage
the PRGF. The AGA is responsible for marketing the facility,
receiving and reviewing applications for guarantees, issuing
guarantees, and monitoring overall activity.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be channeled through the International
Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's concessionary
lending wing for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Since Albania joined the IDA in 1991, 25 projects have gone
forward with commitments totaling some 313 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Hartford Students Fall Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The students' symptoms included nausea, dizziness and vomiting.
The complaints began last week when students started turning up at
the campus health center and local hospitals by the dozens, the
United Press International said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a spokesman for the university as saying that
university investigators had checked everything, but it was still
not clear what was causing the discomfort.
</P>
<P>
After interviewing the sick students, school and medical
officials have found neither common threat nor common denominator.
</P>
<P>
One of the possible causes being investigated is contaminated
food, but officials said some of the sick students cooked in their
dormitory rooms while others ate in the cafeteria, and others ate
off-campus.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman David Isgur said that it might be a simple case of
the flu as 3000 students were living on campus.
</P>
<P>
The students in the university remained in session while
investigation was continuing.

<HEADLINE> Four Customs Officials Shot Dead at German Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Three German and one Swiss
customs officials were shot dead at two crossing points on the
German border on Tuesday, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
At one incident, two German customs guards were shot dead by a
Kazakh national, who appeared to be mentally disturbed, at the
Ludwigsburg crossing point on the border with Poland.
</P>
<P>
The shooting occurred when the two guards wanted to check a
tour coach from Kazakhstan with 22 travellers on board. The
attacker suddenly snatched the weapon from one of the two customs
officials and opened fire on them, killing one instantly with
another dying of his injuries 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh man tried to flee but was detained and sent to a
Leipzig prison hospital for medical treatment. No smuggled goods
were found in the coach.
</P>
<P>
Seven hours later at a small crossing point near Konstanz on
the German-Swiss border, one German customs official and one of
his Swiss colleagues were shot dead by a suspected arms smuggler
during a routine customs check.
</P>
<P>
The attacker, an Italian national who lived in Switzerland,
then shot dead himself. Explosives, several pistols and munition
were found in his car.
</P>
<P>
The killings were described as the most serious incident in the
German customs history after World War II.

<HEADLINE> Output Inflation Rate in UK Sinks to 12-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Prices of goods leaving factory
gates in Britain rose by just 0.7 percent in the year to January,
their lowest level for 12 years, according to official figures
released today.
</P>
<P>
The figures by the Office for National Statistics are regarded
here as a message that inflation pressures remain almost entirely
absent.
</P>
<P>
They showed that output prices have stayed unchanged on the
month, undercutting economists' expectations for a modest rate
increase.
</P>
<P>
On top of the lowest rate of output price inflation since July
1986, input price fell by 9.7 percent year-on-year. The fall
represents the biggest drop since April last year.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long time since there was any sign of price
pressures at the factory gate," said David Coleman, the chief
economist at CIBC Wood Gundy.
</P>
<P>
The double pressures of the strong pound and the Asian
financial crisis have slashed the cost of imported raw materials
and ensured that input price inflation stays well in negative
ground.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil prices, which make up a large chunk of the input
price series, dropped a staggering 32.7 percent in the year to
January, the biggest drop in four years.
</P>
<P>
"Going forward, it is going to be the labor market and the
service sector that are of more concern to the Bank of England,"
said Ciaran Barr, a senior economist at the merchant bank Deutsche
Morgan Grenfell.

<HEADLINE> London, Paris Shares up on Wall Street Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe
ended mixed Tuesday, with London and Paris surging higher while
Frankfurt closing weaker.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE 100 index on leading shares in London climbed 27
points earlier in the morning, boosted by today's figures showing
that the 2.5 percent official inflation target was hit for the
first time in eight months, which means that there will be no need
of recent interest rate rise.
</P>
<P>
Strong gains in New York also gave the market a late boost but
the upside was limited by sell programs, with the index ending at
a near record close at 5,613.3, up only 12.4 points.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, French shares hit another record closing high, with
the CAC-40 index 14.82 points firmer at 3,235.76, also supported
by Wall Street's strong gains.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said that volume was low compared with last
week's record level of liquidity.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index in Frankfurt finished the session down 39.80
points at 4,523.75 after overnight declines on Wall Street profit
taking, albeit on low volume and with support feeding through from
the dollar.

WASHINGTON, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from
Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, three invitees to join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), are making efforts for
quick Senate approval of the alliance's expansion.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers Bronislaw Geremek of Poland, Lazlo Kovacs of
Hungary and Jaroslav Sedivy of the Czech Republic planned talks
with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Senate
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
They were also scheduled to meet with the 28-member NATO
observer group in the Senate, chaired by Sen. William Roth, R-Del.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the 16-member NATO decided last July to admit the
three countries in 1999. But the decision needs to be ratified by
legislation of each NATO member.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration planned to submit documents to the
Senate Wednesday for a vote.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged the
Senate to vote for the expansion, which has so far been approved
by Canada and Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, EU Oppose Possible Attacks on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan
Ibn Talal and European Commission President Jacques Santer Tuesday
expressed their opposition to the use of force against Iraq over
the crisis of the U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will never, under any conditions, support a possible
attack on Iraq, which will cause large losses of human lives and
economic resources, Hassan said at a joint press conference with
Santer.
</P>
<P>
He called on Iraq to comply with United Nations Security
Council resolutions, stressing that Jordan is firmly opposed to
any existence of weapons of mass destruction in the region.
</P>
<P>
Santer voiced similar worries about U.S. threat to use force
against Iraq, adding that military actions in the region will
damage the Middle East peace process, in which the European Union
is intended to play "a stronger role."
</P>
<P>
He urged Iraq to coordinate with international efforts to find
a peaceful solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has barred the U.N. arms inspectors in charge of
eliminating its weapons of mass destruction from searching
presidential palaces suspected of hiding the banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has threatened to force Iraqi compliance with
U.N. arms inspections through military attacks.
</P>
<P>
Both Hassan and Santer expressed their hope that the efforts
made by Russia, France and the Arab League will lead to a peaceful
solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Santer is currently on a trip to the region, which has taken
him to Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria,
Lebanon to promote Europe's political and economic role in the
Middle East.
