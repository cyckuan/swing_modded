ARIZONA DISPUTES HIGHWAY POTHOLE REPORT CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Pity the poor Phoenix highway pothole.
</P>
<P>
   It gets neglected while state highway officials pour concrete _
and dollars _ into new freeways, laments a national report released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To which the Arizona Department of Transportation says, Show me
the potholes!
</P>
<P>
   ``How many highways do you drive on that are in bad condition?''
ADOT spokesman Bill Rawson asked. ``I don't remember the last time
I saw a pothole on the highway.''
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Phoenix ranked second-worst in the nation on the
``Pothole Index,'' issued Thursday by the Surface Transportation
Policy Project. The Washington, D.C.-based non-profit group pushes
for transportation policies that conserve energy and make
communities more livable.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group reported that some stretches of freeway in
Phoenix were in bad shape, it did not identify them.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking was based on ADOT's own classification of freeways
that were in ``mediocre or poor'' condition, combined with the
amount of money spent to repair those roads.
</P>
<P>
   ADOT spent only $12,645 per mile on road repair in Phoenix, when
the national average was $105,000 per mile. It can cost up to
$750,000 to properly resurface a mile of freeway.
</P>
<P>
   As a whole, Arizona's freeways fared better than most states',
ranking in the top third of the 32 states surveyed. The report
ranked 39 metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors said many states and metro areas are
diverting federal freeway dollars to new roads at the urban fringe
instead of spending the money on proper repairs. This promotes
sprawl and deepens the maintenance hole that highway departments
eventually must climb out of, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Potholes &AMP; Politics Report 1998'' was based on 1995 road
conditions as reported by state highway departments to the U.S.
Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ADOT officials say they have dealt with the more troublesome
spots on Valley freeways, specifically Interstate 10 south of
Baseline and the Black Canyon Freeway. The freeways have been
repaired or are being resurfaced, Rawson said.
</P>
<P>
   ADOT officials said they can't make sense of the report's dollar
figures or its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What roads are not going to be built?'' Rawson asked
rhetorically. ``Are we going to delay the Squaw Peak another year
so we can spend money on maintenance?''
</P>
<P>
   In the Valley, with its relatively young freeway system,
maintenance takes a back seat to building out the 150-mile freeway
network that Maricopa County voters approved in 1985. But
maintenance isn't ignored, Rawson said.
</P>
<P>
   ADOT spent $86 million on Valley freeway maintenance in 1996-97,
Rawson said. That money came from a mix of sources, but he wasn't
sure whether it included the federal dollars targeted by the
group's report. &QL;

   NICARAGUA-MUDSLIDES (Posoltega, Nicaragua) _ Where just a week
ago there were fertile fields of corn, beans and peanuts almost

grotesquely in the sun. For Central America, Hurricane Mitch and
the floods and landslides that followed in the storm's wake have
been a catastrophe. But no place has been harder hit than this
collection of humble agricultural settlements, where at least 1,500
people, and perhaps many many more, perished when a series of
landslides swept down upon them over a four-day period ending
Monday. By Larry Rohter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In assessing why their party did worse than anticipated last
Tuesday, many Republican leaders are grudgingly giving a lot of
credit to their longtime nemesis: the labor movement.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to get union members to vote, unions mailed 9.5
million pieces of literature, registered more than 500,000 union
members and, on Election Day alone, made hundreds of thousands of
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans acknowledged that because of such efforts, unions
played a pivotal role in re-electing embattled Democrats, like Sen.
Harry Reid of Nevada, and in defeating the Republicans who lost
House seats, including Rep. Jon Fox of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a huge turnout with phone banks in regions across the
country, and I've got to congratulate them,'' said Rep. John Linder
of Georgia, chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Boasting about their political muscle, labor leaders said that
surveys of voters leaving the polls on Tuesday found that 24
percent came from union households, a big jump from the 1994
elections, when 14 percent of voters came from union households and
when Republicans made major gains in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor did a tremendous job,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas,
chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders pointed to their efforts in the Wisconsin Senate
race as an example of how they made a difference when Republicans
greatly outspent a Democratic candidate. According to polls of
voters leaving the polling places, 31 percent of Wisconsin voters
came from union households, and 63 percent of these voters backed
Democratic Sen. Russell Feingold, who many pollsters predicted was
going to lose. In contrast, 44 percent of nonunion voters supported
Feingold.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday in Washington, John Sweeney,
president of the AFL-CIO, said, ``They've got the money, but we've
got something money can't buy. We've got the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement changed its strategy from 1996, when it spent
$25 million on broadcast spots. This year, it focused on getting
out the vote, spending about $5 million on broadcast spots and $15
million on leaflets, phone banks, and paying nearly 400
coordinators to work full time for more than a month in
congressional districts nationwide. In several states, union
members visited the homes of other members or talked to them at
work, urging them to back labor-endorsed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In a year when turnout was weak and many voters were turned off
to politics, these efforts helped account for labor's
disproportionately large share of voters _ 24 percent of voters
came from union households, while 18 percent of Americans live in
households where at least one person belongs to a union. But Voter
News Service, which conducted polls at the voting places to
calculate the number of union voters, said the increase from 14
percent in 1994 might be exaggerated because of a change in how the
polls were done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went on all across the country, knocking on union members'
doors, talking to them one by one,'' said Steven Rosenthal,
political director for the AFL-CIO. ``Since most voters are getting
their information these days off of television, and don't like it,
because it's just a barrage of negative TV ads, it seemed like it
made sense to go back to the process of people talking to each
other again''
</P>
<P>
   At the Wednesday news conference, Rosenthal noted that 76.2
million people voted this year nationwide, up 1.2 million from
1994. But he said the number of votes from union households jumped
by 6.7 million, to 16.8 million this year from 10.1 million in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``In what labor focused on in this election cycle, which turned
out to be turnout, it was exactly what the Democrats needed, given
the political environment,'' said Neil Newhouse, a Republican
pollster.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders did send some contradictory messages, saying on
one hand that they were taking a less partisan approach than in
1996, and noting that this year they endorsed 27 labor-friendly
Republican House candidates, more than twice the number endorsed
two years ago. But labor leaders also boast that a higher
percentage of union members voted for Democrats this year than in
recent elections. According to a survey of 807 union members by
Peter Hart Research Associates, 71 percent of union members voted
for the Democratic candidate in congressional races this year and
29 percent voted for Republicans. That was down from 1994 when
nearly 40 percent of union members supported Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor movement is supporting candidates in both parties
who support working families and who support the issues that our
members are concerned about,'' Sweeney said. ``There are more
Democrats than Republicans who are on that side. But those
Republicans who speak out, and who help achieve legislation that
satisfies our members' agenda, we're going to support them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hart poll found that the main issues for union members were
preserving Social Security, supporting public education, and
protecting patients in health maintenance organizations. The poll
also found that 75 percent of union members considered it very
important that Congress ``focus on problems, not impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Union members said they wanted to elect people who would focus
on solving the country's problems, instead of wasting time trying
to impeach Bill Clinton,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a pollster for the
AFL-CIO.

TOO MANY GUESTS, TOO LITTLE SPACE  
 DISSONANT NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY JAMES BARRON WITH JOAN NASSIVERA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mrs. Astor had her 400. The rap impresario SEAN
(PUFFY) COMBS had his 1,000. That was 200 fewer than he had
invited, and unlike Mrs. Astor's guests, his had to fight the
barricades on the way to his 29th-birthday party on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was theater of the absurd,'' said one woman in the crowd.
``It was like Studio 54 all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   What the unlucky ones _ like the British actress MINNIE DRIVER,
who never got in _ missed was an evening of dancing to ultraloud
music in an incongruously classical setting, the 30,000-square-foot
rotunda of Cipriani Wall Street, a catering hall that was built as
a bank in the days when banks were temples to money.
</P>
<P>
   But money, in the form of a $600,000 budget for the party, could
not buy everything. ``The fire marshals came at 4 o'clock, and
because we had built a dance floor, put the room capacity at
1,000,'' said DAVID WATKINS, the president of Icon Lifestyle
Marketing, the party planning company that Combs had hired. ``We
were expecting 1,200. Our hands were pretty much tied at the
door.''
</P>
<P>
   And so celebrities accustomed to breezing past security guards
with only a cursory nod were made to stand and wait. Combs' fellow
rap entrepreneur, RUSSELL SIMMONS, talked his way in, leaving _ on
the wrong side of the barricade _ the head of Arista Records
screaming, ``I'm CLIVE DAVIS.!'' Someone explained what happened
next: ``Russell turns around and says, `That's Puffy's boss; let
him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so fortunate _ or so patient. The songwriter
DENISE RICH left after 90 minutes. HARVEY WEINSTEIN, the Miramax
film titan, had a somewhat shorter wait.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, people from Combs' Bad Boy Records mingled with
Manhattan party-circuit regulars like DONALD J. TRUMP; SARAH
FERGUSON, the Duchess of York; IVANA TRUMP, Donald's former wife,
LAUREN HUTTON; and KEVIN COSTNER.
</P>
<P>
   Combs sent flowers to Ms. Driver Thursday. ``When you're Puffy
and you're from urban hip-hop,'' Watkins said, ``people have a
tendency to focus on the negative instead of talking about the
fabulous thing you did by bringing all these people together.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet that the Revlon titan RONALD O. PERELMAN waits
behind few velvet ropes. But he did, on Tuesday night, after
showing up after the lights had gone down in the Oak Room at the
Algonquin Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Perelman had wanted to catch the opening of the singer TOM
POSTILLIO. Waiting for him at a ringside table were LINDA J.
WACHNER, chief executive of the Warnaco Group, and the newlyweds
COLIN CALLENDER, an HBO executive, and ELIZABETH GAINE, just back
from a Paris honeymoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oak Room's maitre d'hotel, ARTHUR POMPESELLO, laid down
the law: no one was to walk in front of the tiny floodlighted stage
while Postillio performed.
</P>
<P>
   Standoff, followed _ it seemed _ by compromise. Pompesello would
lead Perelman through the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But Pompesello had second thoughts. He snapped open two folding
chairs and set them up at the back of the Oak Room, next to a
banquette. It was hard to tell who was more startled, Perelman or
the fellow from New Jersey he was suddenly pressed against.
</P>
<P>
   Dissonant Notes
</P>
<P>
   The Eos Orchestra, a New York chamber group, had its rehearsal
time for a White House performance cut short Thursday. ``We hit a
loud passage and were informed that we had disrupted a meeting in
the Oval Office,'' said STEPHEN VANN, the orchestra's executive
director. . . . Even though he slammed his hand into his music
stand last week, SEIJI OZAWA conducted the Boston Symphony
Orchestra at Carnegie Hall Thursday night and said he would keep a
midday book-signing date at the Barnes &AMP; Noble store on Columbus
Avenue at 66th Street Friday. ``He thought he broke his hand,''
said CAROLINE SMEDVIG, a spokeswoman for the orchestra, ``but in
fact it's not broken. The signing will hurt more than the
conducting,'' she added, but the main thing is, he can't use
chopsticks, so he's had to use a fork.'

CALIFORNIA COUNTY WEIGH VEHICLES FOR WELFARE-TO-WORK PARTICIPANTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY DAVID GREENBERG  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ventura County, Calif., officials want to buy as
many as 50 new vehicles for welfare-to-work program members clients
who are in career-training classes or have just gotten new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Ventura County Transportation Commission, modeling its Car
Share effort on successful European programs, wants to buy a fleet
of cars, vans and pickup trucks so people going from welfare to the
work force will have a flexible way to get to their jobs until they
can afford their own vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transportation is one of the larger problems in the
welfare-to-work arena,'' said Steven De George, the commission's
technology manager. ``We have a large segment of welfare recipients
in the west county and a large number of jobs in the east county.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the county's 7,000 California Work Opportunity and
Responsibility to Kids clients are single mothers, and 50 percent
of all recipients live in the city of Oxnard area, records show.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the program, clients must have a driver's
license, no drunk-driving convictions or other serious traffic
offenses, and no other means of getting to a job or class.
</P>
<P>
   Seven stations would be created near county Human Service Agency
centers to house some of the vehicles. Daily users living in remote
areas might be allowed to take the vehicles home.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles could be reserved on a regular basis or on short notice
_ free of charge at first and later for a nominal fee once users
have a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might be increased as they ease out of the program,''
said Ginger Gherardi, the commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Users who pick up other recipients along the route to their jobs
would be offered discount rates, she said. No time limit has been
set on how long a client could stay in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Several transit options are available to county residents, but
Gherardi said vehicle sharing is needed for recipients who live or
want to work in remote locations, as well as those working after
bus and train lines stop for the day. Welfare-reform laws allow
clients to refuse a job and continue to receive services if they
have to travel more than an hour from their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bus routes are only effective when you have a number of people
coming from one area,'' Gherardi said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, critics said, clients would be stranded at
their jobs because other users would not return the vehicles on
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In (European) countries, if someone doesn't return a car,
you'd have an opportunity to get home by getting on the
mass-transit system,'' county Supervisor Frank Schillo said. ``In
Ventura County, you'd be stuck in a parking lot. Our transit system
does not adequately cover people getting to and from jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Gherardi pointed out, however, that her office's ``guaranteed
ride home'' program would be available for public transit users in
need of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the backup, so there's no risk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. Department of Labor has already refused to
fund the program, the commission is expected to approve an
application of up to three years at $500,000 annually to the U.S.
Department of Transportation for matching funds to cover the costs
of vehicles, maintenance and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The commission would seek additional funds through other federal
sources, as well as donations of vehicles from manufacturers and
dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of exploring I have to do,'' Gherardi said,
adding that the program would begin six months after funding is
secured.

LABOR FIGHT BECOMING FALK-STERN STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Keith Glass recalled the time a few years ago when
David Falk was talking about how Michael Jordan needed to be
financially rewarded by the Chicago Bulls. As a low-profile agent
who represents a much more modest clientele than the agent Falk,
Glass finally interjected.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while I couldn't take it,'' Glass said. ``I mean, I'm
the anti-David. I represent different kinds of players. He was
talking about Michael getting paid. I told him I have a Michael,
too. Michael Peplowski. That's the player I'm worried about.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that David Stern, the National Basketball Association
commissioner, has accused Falk of trying to detonate a potential
agreement between owners and players that would end the league's
lockout, many observers are wondering how much power and influence
Falk actually has on the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's claim _ that Falk is looking out for his prominent
clients while ignoring the NBA's eroding middle class _ was seen by
the union as an attempt to form a chasm between the Jordans and,
well, the Peplowskis.
</P>
<P>
   After saying he did not take Stern's comments personally on
Wednesday, Falk shot back Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wake-up call for the players, because this is
exactly what the league did three years ago and the players fell
for it three years ago,'' Falk said. ``They fell for the fact that
the league was saying the agents were only trying to protect the
top 30 or 40 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the mass of players listens to that tired saw David Stern
is using again, they're going to be even more disadvantaged than
they were three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Replied Stern: ``There is a deal on the table, and David Falk is
trying to kill it. Is that for the betterment for mankind? I don't
think so.''
</P>
<P>
   The salvos fired back and forth between the game's most powerful
agent and its omnipotent commissioner have been indicative of
recent negotiations: a lot of posturing and little progress. A
union official said a meeting between the chief negotiators on both
sides is scheduled for Friday in Manhattan; the union has told the
NBA it hopes to forward a new proposal to the league office by
early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Other than those developments, however, nothing will prevent the
league from losing its fifth week of games _ the first week of
December _ to labor strife; after canceling the rest of November
last week, league officials said that every week a deal was not
signed would mean another week of games canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Until headway is made through a bargaining session, the season
is on hold. At the center of the talks is an escrow system proposed
by the owners that would give money back to the teams if the
players' share of income reached an agreed-upon threshold. Economic
divide is regarded as the main issue. But there are egos involved,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't run the union, but I certainly want to have influence
because of my clients,'' Falk said. ``I'm like a congressman. And
my district is Ewing, Jordan, etc. But I also have people in my
district named Jaren Jackson and Rex Chapman, and I have to make
sure the rules protect all of them. Ewing and Jordan are paying me
enough lobbying fees to make sure the less-advantaged people in my
district are taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern said in response: ``If David has suddenly became a man of
the people, then he should love the NBA owners' proposal. I'll
assume he will join me in applauding the proposal that benefits 80
percent of the constituents that he says he represents.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass and Falk, along with Mark Bartelstein and Arn Tellem, whom
Stern also mentioned by name as being a divisive force in
negotiations, met Thursday with the union's executive director,
Billy Hunter. Also present were Patrick Ewing of the Knicks, the
players' association president, and union lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   A union official said the meeting was planned before the week's
charges and countercharges developed, but nonetheless it made for
interesting subject matter beyond the economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception Billy and Patrick are orchestrated by Arn and
David is laughable,'' Glass said. ``I don't agree with a lot of
what David Falk believes, but this is clearly a campaign to drive a
wedge between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the league's 400-plus players have been unified and
have repeated the same mantra over and over: ``We won't accept a
bad deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet with the two parties trading words and sounding as far apart
as they have been since the summer, there is a feeling of angst
developing on both sides.

ON UPSTATE TOUR, SCHUMER VOWS TO HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. _ Bearing a post-election message of gratitude
and state unity, Rep. Charles Schumer hopscotched triumphantly
across upstate New York Thursday, outlining priorities for his
first year in the U.S. Senate that include cutting electric rates,
property taxes and air fares.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn congressman also promised to ``erase the
skepticism'' of upstate voters, telling them, ``I am going to be
here repeatedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer carried only 6 of the 52 counties north and west of the
New York City metropolitan region in his defeat of Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato on Tuesday night. Conducting a swing of news conferences
Thursday at the airports here and in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse
and Albany, he sought to use the momentum of victory to help him
undertake the difficult task of gaining the trust of his new
upstate constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some may have some skepticism: They say, `Well, here's a guy
from New York City. Maybe he is not going to remember the upstate
area; maybe he will forget the Capital District region,'' Schumer
said in Albany. A crowd of more than 50 supporters who had been
applauding throughout the news conference became hushed. ``I will
not,'' Schumer said. ``In the next two months I will be spending a
great deal of my time upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, he pledged to use the next two months to learn
about upstate issues, needs and concerns. ``I will be talking to
our leaders, our leaders in government, our leaders in labor,''
said Schumer, who has served 18 years as the representative from
Brooklyn. ``I will be meeting with business leaders and labor
leaders and elected officials. I will be holding town meetings with
average citizens to find out what's on their minds and what I can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   He also outlined several issues that he said would be among the
first he addresses when he enters the Senate in January. Near the
top of the list, he said, will be deregulation of the power
industry in New York to reduce electric costs; he said the step is
needed to encourage businesses to relocate to western New York.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's victory lap, an 840-mile circuit, began and ended at
the Marine Air Terminal at New York City's La Guardia Airport.
Traveling in a chartered turboprop airplane, Schumer, who is 47,
appeared drained after the most momentous week in a political
career that began when he was elected to the N.Y. state Assembly in
1974, at the age of 23.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite the evidence of fatigue, he also appeared exhilarated,
even giddy, as if the reality of his victory was still just setting
in. Arriving Thursday morning in Buffalo, where he had closed his
campaign with an exuberant rally on Monday night, Schumer waved at
supporters from inside his airplane, then emerged blushing with
excitement, his eyes crinkling, the corners of his mouth stretched
into a wide smile.
</P>
<P>
   At every turn, he thanked voters for supporting him and boasted
of having had better success among upstate voters, even in counties
where he did not win a majority, than any of D'Amato's previous
Democratic challengers. ``I want to thank the voters of western New
York,'' he said. ``We carried Erie County, and we didn't just
squeak by; we got 56 percent of the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who thanked voters in his home neighborhood of Park
Slope, Brooklyn, on Wednesday, was scheduled to visit White Plains
and Mineola on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As Schumer spoke in Buffalo, he stood next to Steven Pigeon, the
Democratic Party chairman in Erie County, who was one of his
earlier supporters and who many Democrats speculate may become the
next state party chairman, particularly if Schumer assumes a
prominent role in the state party. Questioned by local reporters
about the possibility, Schumer offered high praise of Pigeon but no
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Along the trip, Schumer received several gifts. Supporters in
Buffalo gave the senator-elect, who is known to enjoy a late-night
bowl of cold cereal, a box of Flutie's Flakes, a cereal brand named
for the Buffalo Bills star quarterback. In Syracuse, he received a
gift pack filled with foods, beverages and other items made in the
Mohawk Valley area. And Tony Nesci of the United Auto Workers gave
him sausage-and-pepper sandwiches, which he had for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, Schumer appeared to be still on the stump. As he
outlined his views on gun control, he spoke of several objectives
he hoped to pursue, including the limits on the number of guns an
individual can buy each year. He spoke as enthusiastically as he
had in the final days of plying for votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so I want to push that very very hard as one of my highest
priorities,'' he said. Then he paused, a puzzled look spreading
across his face. ``I was going to say, if, God willing, if I get to
the Senate,'' he said, laughing at himself. ``I guess I should
still say that but I am a lot closer than when I last came here.''

HURRICANES DEFEAT ISLANDERS, 6-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The New York Islanders' biggest problems this
season have been inconsistency and costly mistakes. They can't seem
to play mistake free for 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly satisfied with a 3-0 first-period lead on Thursday
night, the Islanders let up and their offense and defense
disappeared. The Carolina Hurricanes scored six straight goals,
three in 3 minutes 20 seconds of the third period, to skate away
with an improbable 6-3 victory at Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought a three-goal lead was very, very deceptive,'' said
Coach Mike Milbury, whose team lost for the second time in six
games and fell to 6-6. ``It came far too easily. Carolina dominated
the game after we took the three-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a tourniquet of some kind, but we couldn't even find
a Band-Aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff O'Neill's second goal of the game at 2:59 of the third
period gave the Hurricanes a 3-3 tie. One and a half minutes later,
Martin Gelinas scored to give Carolina (5-4-3) its first lead, 4-3.
Kent Manderville then secured the victory at 6:19, beating goalie
Tommy Salo with a slap shot from the top of the slot. Paul Ranheim
scored Carolina's sixth goal late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Tempers flared on the ice and on the Islanders' bench in the
final two minutes. The Islanders tough guy Ken Belanger
cross-checked Carolina's Sean Hill in the back and picked a fight
with Keith Primeau, the Hurricanes' captain. Then, Gino Odjick, the
Islanders' other enforcer, tried to instigate a melee from the
bench, taunting the Hurricanes through the glass that separates the
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of frustration in me, after watching them score
six straight goals,'' said Belanger, who was assessed penalties for
roughing, cross checking, instigating, fighting and a game
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes out-shot the Islanders by 31-19, 13-3 in the
final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good start,'' Salo said, ``but they came back and we
quit. We have to learn to win when we're up, 3-0.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fast-paced first period, the Islanders took a 3-1 lead. The
three goals was a departure for the Islanders, who have had
difficulty scoring in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Brewer, a rookie defenseman, opened the scoring with his
first National Hockey League goal; Mike Watt, another rookie, gave
the Islanders a 2-0 advantage, and Kenny Jonsson capped the burst
with a goal at 11:59.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders avoided the league's hottest goalie, Arturs Irbe,
who was given the night off. Irbe had stopped 197 of 206 shots,
with a .970 save percentage over his last seven games. His
replacement, Trevor Kidd, played for the first time in eight days,
and his lack of playing time showed early.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the third period, however, the Hurricanes stormed
back, scoring two straight goals to cut the Islanders' lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to forget this game,'' said Salo, who pointed out this
was the Islanders' first major collapse this season.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A struggle for control of the House is under way,
with Rep. Robert Livingston conducting a telephone campaign that
could lead to him running against Newt Gingrich as speaker. But in
a counter-campaign, Gingrich is trying to make members think twice
about ousting him.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a small band of Republicans vowed on Thursday
that they would not vote to re-elect Gingrich under any
circumstances, a move that, because of the Republicans' shrunken
House majority, could tie the party in knots for months.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said: ``I personally have made the
decision that I cannot vote for Newt Gingrich for speaker in
January, and there are six others who have told me they feel the
same way, seven people who just will not, and it takes six to
deadlock the vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Fury at the speaker has boiled over since Tuesday's elections,
when Republicans suffered a net loss of five seats in the House.
They blamed Gingrich, the party's chief strategist. But many were
already angry at him for what they said was his failure to
articulate a clear message for the party going into the elections
and for a messy budget process that gave President Clinton a
political edge and contradicted Republican principles of fiscal
conservativism by containing massive amounts of spending for local
projects.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are to meet Nov. 18 to vote by secret ballot
for their leaders. Whoever wins the Republican nomination for
speaker must stand for election by the full House in January. Even
if Gingrich wins the secret ballot, he could be denied re-election
as speaker in January if Salmon and at least five others refuse to
vote for him. Because the Republicans now control the House by only
12 seats, it would take just six votes against Gingrich to deny him
a majority.
</P>
<P>
   If that happened, more votes would be taken until someone
received a majority. The possibility of enough turncoat Republicans
siding with Democrats to elect a Democrat as speaker seems remote,
since that has not happened in the modern two-party era.
</P>
<P>
   With such a chaotic and unacceptable prospect looming,
Livingston told Gingrich that he should step aside for the good of
the party, Republican officials said. The officials said that
Livingston spoke to Gingrich shortly after the election returns but
also before the election, reflecting Livingston's earlier
displeasure with the speaker over the budget process.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said that both Livingston, the chairman of
the Appropriations Committee and one of the few members with the
stature to stand for speaker, and Gingrich were working the phones
on Thursday in a struggle for votes. Livingston has said nothing
publicly about a challenge to Gingrich, but several members and
aides said on Thursday that he would announce his intentions,
possibly as soon as Friday, only after he had determined if he
could win.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., was one of several members who spoke
with Livingston on Thursday. ``He told me he's making a number of
phone calls, that he's gotten a very positive response about
running for speaker, and he'll decide within the next 48 hours,''
King said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't do it till he has his ducks in a row, and right now a
lot of people are still loyal to the speaker,'' said an aide to a
Republican who, like many others, is trying to straddle the line
between fealty to a speaker who may retain power and encouragement
to a challenger who offers a salve to an embattled party.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans immediately blamed Gingrich for the party's
losses on Tuesday. Talk quickly emerged the next day of a slate of
candidates to oppose Gingrich and his lieutenants. The list of
possible candidates for leadership positions included Rep.e Steve
Largent of Oklahoma, who talked with Livingston on Thursday about
challenging Gingrich, Republican officials said, speaking on the
condition that their names not be reported.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials said that Largent told Livingston that he wanted
to run with him on a ticket and that he would challenge Rep. Dick
Armey, the majority leader. But, these officials said that if
Livingston did not challenge Gingrich, Largent would run for
speaker instead.
</P>
<P>
   Other names were floated Wednesday for leadership posts. They
included Reps. David McIntosh of Indiana for speaker and Jennifer
Dunn of Washington as conference chairman. Added to the mix on
Thursday was the name of Rep. Christopher Cox, a California
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of the uncertainty prevailing among House members on
Thursday, Rep. Henry Hyde, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee
and one of the House's most venerable members, rebuffed a chance to
endorse Gingrich as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said that Gingrich bore responsibility for the party's
losses Tuesday. ``Leadership takes credit when things go right,''
he said. ``They ought to take the blame when things go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Gingrich should remain speaker, Hyde said: ``I rather
think he will, but that remains to be seen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The energy that many vented publicly on Wednesday as anger
toward Gingrich seemed devoted on Thursday to intense internal
political calculations about whether Livingston could succeed in
toppling Gingrich and whether he should succeed.
</P>
<P>
   While many support him as a veteran who understands the House
and has shown shrewd political skills in determining how billions
of federal dollars are sent, others are reviving images of the
Louisianan as a hot-head who gave the party a bad name during the
government shutdown two years ago and who tends toward arm-flailing
in heated moments.
</P>
<P>
   One conservative leader said that he and his allies had
reservations about Livingston because he was ``obsessed'' about
trying to keep social issues out of the budget process. The budget,
he said, ``has been a vehicle for conservatives over the years to
add restrictions on federal money for abortion and other things you
can't get through the Senate or past a presidential veto. If
Livingston is the challenger, I doubt that will cause a rallying of
the real conservatives in Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Some moderates said they were prepared to support him. Rep.
Marge Roukema, R-N.J., said, ``I would be amenable to Livingston.''
Still, she cautioned, ``I'm not after Newt. But it's wrong not to
sit down and seriously look at our options.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Johnson, an aide to Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., said
that his boss was ``emblematic'' of the confusion among the broad
base of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy has been loyal to both Speaker Gingrich and Dick Armey,
and he's still loyal to them, but he also wants to hear what they
have to say before committing to them in the next election,''
Johnson said. ``Everyone is asking the same question: Can we
refocus the message and re-energize our base without re-aligning
the leadership?''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said his refusal to support Gingrich no matter what was
based on Gingrich's track record of ``one failed strategy after
another,'' including the impeachment process and the pork-laden
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon estimated that 30 to 40 Republicans will vote against
Gingrich, and said the seven who have already said they will try to
oust him are not an organized group, and include moderates as well
as conservatives like Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   With the challenge under way, Gingrich has been trying to show
members that he is responsive to their concerns. After an election
night in which he portrayed the Republicans as victorious even as
they lost seats, the next day he took ``responsibility'' for the
losses. In another move, Gingrich has indicated that he is willing
to cede control over the party's congressional campaign committee,
allowing the whole House to select its members.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is also making strong personal appeals to Republicans.
Said one top House aide: ``He'll get support. How much? Only his
own vote-counters know.''

LARRY ELLIS, 70, OLYMPIC TRACK COACH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry Ellis, head coach of the 1984 U.S. Olympic men's track and
field team, the first African-American head coach in any Ivy League
sport and the former president of track and field's national
governing body, died Wednesday at his home in Skillman, N.J. He was
70.
</P>
<P>
   He had been in good health since receiving a heart transplant in
1995. The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism, his daughter
Joanne Glenn said. She said he had not felt well since returning
Monday from Virginia, where he had given the eulogy at the funeral
of an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 years, Ellis coached at Jamaica High School in Queens,
where his best athlete was Bob Beamon, a future Olympic champion
and world record-holder in the long jump. Then, from 1970 to 1992,
he coached the men's teams at Princeton _ outdoor and indoor track
and field for the first 20 years and cross-country for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton competed in the Heptagonal League, which is made up of
the eight Ivy League colleges plus Army and Navy. Until Ellis
arrived, Princeton had not won a Heptagonal team title since 1938
and had never won a Heptagonal cross-country title, but under his
leadership it won 11 titles in track and eight in cross-country.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis' best athlete at Princeton was Craig Masback, a
world-class miler and now the chief executive officer of USA Track
and Field, the national governing body. Ellis was the president of
that organization from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was dignified but with an active sense of fun. When he was
elected Olympic coach, he once recalled, ``I didn't jump up and
down, but a little guy inside me jumped up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   In those Los Angeles Games, his team won gold medals from such
athletes as Carl Lewis and Edwin Moses. But he was disappointed by
the Cold War boycott of the Olympics by almost all of the
Soviet-bloc nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``God knows, we need an opportunity to meet our fellow men on a
common ground and break down some of these barriers,'' he said.
``We can have a common understanding of what we're doing and an
appreciation for each other that will defuse some of the myths that
we have about other people. If we let other people see us, they may
say, `Hey, you know, you're not really so bad after all.'''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Thomas Ellis was born Sept. 29, 1928, in Englewood, N.J.,
and was reared in the Bronx. During his high school days, he
delivered milk on a horse and buggy _ ``A nice horse,'' he recalled
_ from 4:30 to 6:30 a.m., then took a bus home to get ready for
school. The bus did not run often, so he started running the two
and a half miles home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I decided to wait for the bus and race it home,'' he
said. ``I would beat the bus because it had to stop for lights and
to pick up passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   That speed earned him a tryout for the DeWitt Clinton High
School cross-country team. He ran his first timed mile in 5 minutes
15 seconds, and a career was born. It continued at New York
University, where he was a 1:51.3 half-miler and 4:14 miler and
earned a bachelor's degree in physical education and a master's in
secondary-school administration.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, he was head coach of the U.S. men's team in the
World Cup competition in Johannesburg, South Africa. He also
coached U.S. international teams in 1973, '78 and '81. In 1966, a
cousin, Stan Wright, became the first African-American head coach
of a U.S. international track and field team.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, at the Heptagonal cross-country championships at
Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, Fred Samara, Ellis' long-time
assistant and successor as Princeton coach, said Ellis looked so
good that ``I told him he should run the course himself.'' Ellis
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On spring trips,'' Samara said, ``we would always go to
all-you-can-eat places. His appetite was legendary and insatiable,
like his appetite for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is survived by his wife of 45 years, the former Shirley
Beard; a son, Larry Jr. of Oakland, Calif.; three daughters, Lesley
Smalls of Skillman, Robin Williams of New York and Ms. Glenn of
Montclair, N.J.; six grandsons and a sister, Ginger Robinson of the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Masback said Ellis was ``far more than my college coach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a mentor, an inspiration, a leader and someone who very
substantially shaped my whole life by his guidance and example,''
Masback said. ``He gave me the belief that I should pursue my
dreams. I'll forever thank him for that.''

DISCOVERY ASTRONAUT FOUND HIGH-SPEED ADVENTURE ON EARTH: THE LUGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AIMEE BERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the space shuttle Discovery touches down Saturday, the
tallest astronaut, Scott Parazynski, a strapping, 6-foot-1-inch
blond who looks like an actor and is a doctor, will have completed
his third mission in space. But for all his achievements,
Parazynski will land with his greatest dream still unfulfilled: to
be a U.S. Olympic luger.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have followed John Glenn's latest space odyssey have
heard of Parazynski, the mission specialist and the doctor
responsible for drawing most of Glenn's blood samples during
Discovery's nine-day orbit of Earth.
</P>
<P>
   But few people know that before earning his Stanford medical
degree, before his first launch, before his spacewalk outside the
Russian space station Mir, he discovered luge.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the greatest adventures of my life,'' Parazynski has
called it.
</P>
<P>
   He said his introduction to the sport was ``a total fluke,'' but
it was more like the natural course of events: In the mid-'80s if
you lived anywhere near Stanford, Bonny Warner, a member of the
1984 Olympic luge team, was there recruiting ambitiously for her
sport. Warner, then a Stanford student, conducted one-day summer
clinics hoping to woo college-age athletes to the sport's Olympic
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonny had these crude training sleds with shopping-cart
wheels,'' said Jason Curliano, then a collegiate cyclist. ``She'd
take all of us up a hill behind Stanford and, with helmets on, let
us try out the pylon course.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Parazynski spent his 24th birthday in 1985 with 75 strangers
_ including Curliano _ dodging cones on a black road under the
summer sun and falling in love with the supine slalom. At the time,
Parazynski was an M.D./Ph.D. candidate in cancer biology at
Stanford; on that day he became _ and remains _ a self-described
``luge junkie.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner did not know in 1985 that Parazynski intended to be an
astronaut, a doctor and an Olympian. When she found out, ``I
laughed to myself,'' she said recently. ``He honestly thought he
could do it. I remember thinking, `How dare you think you could do
all three?'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, she selected him to represent the Western States Luge
Club and train in Lake Placid, N.Y., that winter. Curliano was also
chosen, and he and Parazynski became roommates at the Olympic
Training Center. They would share practice sessions from 7 p.m. to
10 p.m. in the icy trough at the bottom of the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night, Scott and I were out there in the dark, freezing
on our sleds,'' Curliano recalled, ``but we decided to stay the
whole season, thinking the more the coaches see us, the more likely
we'd be picked for the team.''
</P>
<P>
   It was too risky for novices to start at the top of the course.
As they improved, they started their runs higher. ``Our first goal
was to make it up to the women's start house _ which was heated,''
Curliano said. ``Goal 2 was the men's start house _ the next warm
building.''
</P>
<P>
   But what lurked in the 200 yards between the start houses made
the men's track ``the most difficult course in the world at the
time,'' said Dmitri Feld, a former U.S. team coach. ``At Curve 3,
instead of looking forward, you were looking into the eyes of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1987 _ within a year of the Winter Games in Calgary _
Parazynski was so determined to earn an Olympic berth that he was
not only entering singles races on the treacherous Lake Placid
course, but he was also attempting doubles.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 1987 national doubles championship heat, Parazynski
``found his destiny,'' as Feld put it. Coming out of the
omega-shaped Turn 11, the rider on top, Parazynski, became the
bottom. ``For one eternal moment we stared straight down at solid
ice four feet below while strapped onto a speeding bullet,'' he
wrote that year in the Stanford alumni magazine. ``Somehow we
managed to land on our side and keep going, actually finishing the
race. We were greeted with a tumultuous standing ovation when we
regained `full, upright and locked' position.''
</P>
<P>
   Parazynski never made the Olympic cut, however. He finished
ninth in the men's singles at the 1988 U.S. trials; only the top
three in each event competed in Calgary. At 26, his dream of
participating in the Olympics seemed over.
</P>
<P>
   However, Parazynski did get to Calgary. He was the coach of
another Camp Warner veteran, Raymond Ocampo, whose dual
U.S.-Philippines citizenship allowed him into the Olympic luge,
where he finished 35th out of 36.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, Parazynski has gone on to become the astronaut and doctor
he said he would be. He did not become an Olympian, but he will
never forget his adventures on ice. He takes U.S. luge team shirts
and patches to space and back. He invites his former teammates to
launches. And after the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan, he
congratulated the U.S. team on bringing home a silver and a bronze
_ America's first Olympic luge medals. Sometimes, the dream
unfulfilled is the one that remains in the heart.

EVEN WITHOUT MAJOR, SORENSTAM MAKES RUN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam enjoys Las Vegas, but when it comes to golf,
she leaves very little to chance.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA season will conclude with the Pagenet Tour Championship
later this month at the Desert Inn Golf Club in Las Vegas, Nev. And
Sorenstam, who won last year's tour championship, is in excellent
position to clinch her third money title in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam leads the LPGA money list ($1,077,498), more than
$215,000 ahead of Se Ri Pak, who is in second place.
</P>
<P>
   A strong work ethic, coolness under pressure and meticulous
preparation have made Sorenstam the most consistent player, and she
is still looking to improve. In college, Sorenstam began analyzing
her rounds, feeding data into a computer to chart her tendencies,
which helps her avoid slumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a perfectionist when it comes to my golf game,'' said
Sorenstam, who turned 28 last month, leaving her with many strong
years ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But Sorenstam has not won a major since 1996, when she won her
second consecutive U.S. Women's Open. That gives Sorenstam another
goal in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Team Ready for Australia
</P>
<P>
   With the additions of the captain's picks on Tuesday, the teams
are complete for next month's President's Cup in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, captained by Jack Nicklaus, will include Tiger
Woods, Mark O'Meara, Davis Love 3rd, David Duval, Phil Mickelson,
Jim Furyk, Justin Leonard, Mark Calcavecchia, Scott Hoch and Hal
Sutton, plus the captain's picks, Fred Couples and John Huston. The
international team, captained by Peter Thomson, will include Ernie
Els, Nick Price, Vijay Singh, Greg Norman, Steve Elkington, Stuart
Appleby, Carlos Franco, Shigeki Maruyama, Craig Parry and Joe
Ozaki, plus the captain's picks, Frank Nobilo and Greg Turner.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers Still Unhappy
</P>
<P>
   This week's announcement that the U.S. Golf Association would
adopt a test for golf clubs came as no surprise to manufacturers,
who remained unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have been putting forth the idea that new
technology in clubs has made the game too easy, said Ely Callaway,
chairman of Callaway Golf. ``Nothing could be further from the
truth, as shown by the scores this past weekend at the tour
championship.''
</P>
<P>
   David Fay, the USGA's executive director, said that no current
clubs would be banned, but the time had come to closely examine
future products. ``If you can hit the ball farther because of
strength or skill, that's fine, but we've always frowned on
distance added solely by equipment,'' Fay said.

   DETROIT _ What's on the minds of the people who will design the
cars of the next century? In projects developed in internships this
year, they balanced the promise of high technology against a desire
for environmental awareness and a quest for cars with personal
style.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, dozens of college students majoring in automotive
design spend their summers sketching and ultimately creating models
of vehicles that they think represent a direction for the future.
The internships give students real-world experience in their chosen
field, and they offer the automakers a look at what young designers
are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicles conceived over the summer at Chrysler Corp., General
Motors Corp. and the Center for Creative Studies in Detroit
illustrate how different from the present the automotive future may
be. Many of the student designs would use fuels other than gasoline
and power sources other than the internal-combustion engine. Some
were intended to be built of lightweight, recyclable materials. A
few were planned to travel on ``smart' highway systems that don't
even require a driver.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the environmental sensibility exhibited in the designs,
the students also stressed the qualities of fun and personality.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler took in a half-dozen design interns, as well as three
engineering students. Each student designer was asked to develop a
concept vehicle, and the engineering interns helped to determine
the appropriate powertrains and materials for each vehicle. For the
first time in the summer design program, students built full-scale
replicas of futuristic cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles.
They used computers to sketch their ideas and generate the models
in three dimensions. And they produced full-size interiors separate
from the scale-model exteriors _ so someone could sit in the mockup
and have a sense of what it would be like to drive the car. In the
past, students were limited to creating miniature clay models.
</P>
<P>
   Directions for their assignments were simple: ``Do whatever,''
said Chrysler's chief designer, Neil Walling.
</P>
<P>
   David Miglia, the design studio engineering adviser who helped
to coordinate the interns' work, said the intent was for the
students to ``break the paradigm of conventional thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever'' resulted in these six distinctive vehicles:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jeep Centaur, a cross between a midsized truck and a sport
utility vehicle that rides high and digs deep with a retractable
plow that folds into the grille.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cyclos, a sporty car for first-time buyers, designed to
travel on intelligent highway systems in which vehicles respond to
centralized commands relayed through devices placed in or along the
road. The Cyclos would be fitted with exercise machines to allow
the ``driver'' to have an aerobic workout while commuting.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jeep Orienteer, a new type of race car with electric power
running all four wheels, intended for a new, theoretical
electric-car competition that the designer called ``Rally Cross
2.'' An adjustable suspension would allow the Orienteer to climb
steep grades and sand dunes but also adapt to highways.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Dodge Shield, a personal protection vehicle with
bulletproof doors and windows and a skeleton-like frame that is
visible from the outside _ playing out a design trend in which
mechanical components are exposed, not hidden behind body panels.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jeep Terrain, a sporty camping vehicle with a fold-out
tent in the rear and hot and cold storage compartments in the
console, aimed at first-time vehicle buyers who are environmentally
aware. It would run on fuel cells, a promising technology that uses
hydrogen to generate electricity to power motors without producing
emissions. Water generated as a byproduct could even be consumed by
the campers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Ohmega, a sleek, fast commuter car half as wide as the
automobiles of today, that would position the passenger behind the
driver. It would travel automated smart highways at speeds of up to
200 miles an hour using wheel-mounted electric motors.
</P>
<P>
   At General Motors, 30 students from 18 schools in the United
States and Australia created vehicles from sketch to scale model.
The students worked in eight teams _ each including a student
designer, sculptor and engineer _ with GM designers as mentors.
</P>
<P>
   Each team was asked to create a vehicle for one of GM's
marketing divisions that addressed future trends but also fit with
the division's brand identity. The students used computers to
sketch their designs and generate one-third-scale models, as well
as mock vehicle interiors.
</P>
<P>
   The results were the GMC Kodiak, a full-size luxury utility
vehicle; the Oldsmobile Cygnus, a midsize sport sedan; the Saturn
Modulus, a reconfigurable commuter car; the Chevrolet E3, a
new-generation multi-purpose vehicle; the Cadillac Barcelona, a
six-passenger luxury sedan, and a four-door luxury convertible for
Buick.
</P>
<P>
   At the Center for Creative Studies, one of the nation's top
schools for automotive design, three interns participated in the
10th annual internship program sponsored by the American Iron and
Steel Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The three were assigned to create a concept proposal for a
vehicle that would appeal to young, first-time car buyers and cost
less than $16,000. Their proposals included sketches as well as
scale models.
</P>
<P>
   The Luna, based on a Saturn coupe that is popular among
first-time buyers, had a lunar theme. The front and rear hoods bear
lines resembling a crescent moon, giving the car personality, a key
consideration of young buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Photon, a highly efficient performance vehicle, would
combine the best attributes of hot rods and hatchbacks to recreate
a retro-style Pontiac. The low-slung profile and stocky back end
were reminiscent of hot rods and muscle cars of the 1960s. But the
hatchback would have practical cargo space. The doors are hinged to
open like a clam shell, allowing easier entry and exit than the hot
rods of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Halo was a sport utility that caters to drivers who actively
participate in a variety of sports. The two-door vehicle would
carry four passengers, four sets of golf clubs and their camping
gear.

open like a clam shell, allowing easier entry and exit than the hot
rods of the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Halo was a sport utility that caters to drivers who actively
participate in a variety of sports. The two-door vehicle would
carry four passengers, four sets of golf clubs and their camping
gear.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE Astros and general manager Gerry Hunsicker knocked on Door No.
1 a few days ago _ Randy Johnson's place _ and handed over a
contract offer of three years and roughly $33 million.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows if it will be enough? Who knows how much tweaking and
sweetening the Astros must do if they really, truly want Johnson in
an Astros uniform next season?
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's not so much Johnson's house anymore but a
Publishers Clearing House commercial, with so many Astros, Rangers,
Indians, Dodgers and Yankees knocking on Johnson's door every day
and offering fat checks to the big lefty.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Astros made the offer, they had to make it,
they wanted to make it, and it was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   Then Thursday, Hunsicker slid a few more dollars under Door No.
2 _ outfielder Moises Alou's place _ and had to feel confident Mo
Baseball would indeed provide much, much Mo to the Astros for the
next three years. Instead of exercising his right to demand a
trade, Alou received a raise for the remaining three years of what
was a $5 million-a-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Which leaves Door No. 3, the booby prize. Derek Bell.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the solid offer to Johnson and the legitimate if
begrudging show of faith in Alou, it must be believed Bell will be
offered to other teams like so many hanging curveballs.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only way the Astros will have even a remote chance of
signing Johnson, while keeping a Most Valuable Player candidate
(Alou) or three (Jeff Bagwell, Craig Biggio) and fielding a solid
every-day outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Bell has been considered quite the odd man in the Astros' mighty
every-day lineup, with his baggy pants, his baggy eyes, his awkward
batting style, his occasional brain-lock defense and generally a
git-jiggy-wid-it reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But today, he is only the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there are no guarantees the Astros will come close to
bringing Johnson back to Houston. Several teams are serious about
signing Johnson, and the price to play the game could push as high
as $13 million a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   It could be way too much for an Astros team that hopes to keep
its 1999 budget at $50 million or less.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much deeper the Astros will dig in hopes of signing
Johnson is a simple matter of risk/reward. They must weigh
Johnson's high asking price against the rock-solid attraction he
has become.
</P>
<P>
   They must stay in the bidding until it no longer makes fiscal
sense. They must write a fat check, toss it onto Johnson's kitchen
table and hope he feels a certain bond with this city and this
team, as he has said he does.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no way any of it happens with Bell and his $5.2
million next year still in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Do the math. OK, I will.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose Johnson agrees to a contract of $11.5 million a year.
Bagwell is scheduled to make $8 million. Alou will earn upwards of
$5 million, Biggio will be at $7 million, Shane Reynolds will make
$4 million, and Mike Hampton will earn $3.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   That's nearly $39 million for six players. That's not counting
the big money Carl Everett, Ricky Gutierrez and Jose Lima will earn
after arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows the situation and price at third base? Sean Berry
is a free agent, and former MVP and Astro Ken Caminiti has been
mentioned. Neither will come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Johnson does not sign, the risky and costly nature of
Bell's play and contract will be too much for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   With the young and comparatively inexpensive Richard Hidalgo,
Everett and Alou available to start in the outfield, the Astros
should use the money to find another No. 1 starter and would.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is easy, whether or not Johnson signs.
</P>
<P>
   Holy Moises, Alou is good. The Astros simply had to up his
contract and find a way to keep him. Up until Mo Baseball tired and
could not continue his torrid 1998 pace into September, he was a
legitimate MVP candidate and the biggest reason this side of Biggio
the Astros won.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if it's not Johnson splitting the strike zone like
he's parting the waters next year, guaranteeing 18 to 20 wins, then
big money should go to a Kevin Brown remember him? or a Curt
Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Bell did for this team this past season, the Astros
need an ace on the hill more than they need Bell. They need Alou in
the outfield more than they need Bell. It's as simple as that. They
need Johnson's marquee power. They need his marketing lure and
national appeal.
</P>
<P>
   They need Alou's sure thing. It's tough to replace an ace or an
MVP candidate. It might not be so tough replacing Bell.

<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Victory Gallop finished his workout Thursday
and took a sponge bath in front of his barn at Churchill Downs. He
looked happy, flicking his tail and nodding his head as the water
splashed over him.
</P>
<P>
   Then, dry and blanketed in the autumn chill, he was led to his
stall, where he started nudging a plastic ball that hangs from a
rope for him to play with.
</P>
<P>
   Fully recovered from September throat surgery, the sleek bay
colt is breathing easier these days. So are his owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's frisky and on the muscle right now,'' said a beaming Jack
Preston, who shares ownership with his brothers Art and J.R., all
of whom live in The Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   But Victory Gallop is rated only 15-1 in the morning line for
Saturday's Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs. He's the
youngest horse in the field. Most of his foes are more than a year
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize we're a sophomore playing against seniors,'' said
his trainer, Elliott Walden, who still limps slightly from a broken
ankle suffered when he was playing basketball prior to the
Preakness Stakes last May.
</P>
<P>
   Walden said this Classic ``is probably the toughest race of all
time, as far as depth goes. But I'd say we've got a real chance.''
</P>
<P>
   While older horses are thought to be stronger, 3-year-olds have
won the Classic four of the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
   And Victory Gallop does have a few factors in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   As Walden pointed out, ``He gets a weight advantage of four
pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   He also gets the No. 1 post position _ far more favorable than
the 13 hole, where he started the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to lose five or six lengths like we did in the
Derby,'' Preston said. ``We'll be right on the rail, saving ground.
Some horses get intimidated being in that spot, but with his style
of running, it's great for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop's style is to stay back and wait for the other
horses to tire. Saturday's race, 1\ miles and loaded with early
speed, is the kind he likes. And the Churchill Downs track, with
its tiring surface and long stretch, is ideal for a closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we don't get too far back, but it should be a real
torrid pace,'' Preston said, ``and I'm fairly confident we'll be
right there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the age issue, well, Victory Gallop has always had to
deal with that. He was a late foal _ born May 30, 1995 _ so he was
late developing as a 2-year-old, failing to win a graded stakes.
</P>
<P>
   He made his first national impression by upsetting Favorite
Trick, the 1997 Horse of the Year, in the Arkansas Derby last
April. Then, he sparkled in the Triple Crown, with seconds in the
Kentucky Derby and Preakness before winning the 1{-mile Belmont
Stakes by gaining four lengths in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Prestons, who operate an oil company in The Woodlands, were
figuring Victory Gallop could be 3-year-old champion with a win in
the Aug. 29 Travers Stakes, America's oldest horse race.
</P>
<P>
   But he lacked his usual finishing touch in placing second to
Coronado's Quest in both the Grade I Haskell Invitational (Aug. 9)
and the Travers.
</P>
<P>
   A medical examination showed Victory Gallop had an entrapped
epiglottis _ the same problem that earlier had restricted the
breathing of Coronado's Quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appeared to have been chronic,'' Preston said. ``We don't
know how long it was bothering him. In the Travers, he didn't make
his run. And then, he completely entrapped it when he was working
out after the Travers; he started making a real bad noise.''
</P>
<P>
   So now, after surgery and a 10-week layoff from racing, the
long-running son of Cryptoclearance is ready to compete again.
</P>
<P>
   Preston admitted the long rest ``concerns me. But Elliott feels
the way he's been working, he's up to it. He never got really out
of condition. He worked a few days before the operation, and then
he had the operation, and then three weeks later he worked again.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop has been training here for the last six weeks. On
Oct. 25, he drilled six furlongs in a bullet 1:12, breezing, and he
followed that with another quick breeze _ five furlongs Sunday in
1:01.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just what I was looking for,'' said Walden, who
believes his program of brisk five- and six-furlong works and
lengthy gallops (1{ miles on Thursday) has him properly tuned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a race four weeks ago would have made him any
tighter,'' Walden said. ``I feel like we're right on schedule
without the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop is also on schedule to be 3-year-old champion if
he can run at least fourth and end up in front of Coronado's Quest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win or finish close,'' Preston said, ``I think we'd have
to be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place would add $286,720 to Victory Gallop's earnings and
would raise his yearly total to $1.98 million. That would put him
well ahead of Derby/Preakness champion Real Quiet, who is resting
for the remainder of the year _ worn down by the Triple Crown
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Coronado's Quest, who is partially owned by Bob and Janice
McNair of Houston and has earned $1.62 million, showed signs of
weariness in his last race, September's Woodward Stakes in New
York. He finished fifth, 17 lengths out.
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop, on the other hand, has not finished worse than
second in 11 consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really an honest horse,'' Preston said. ``He tries his
best every time. He's very agile and smart; he'll pick out an
opening himself and go right through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching him prance in the barn area, it was easy to think he's
refreshed and eager to make another thrilling charge to the wire.
Perhaps there's something to be said, after all, for young legs.

<P>
   AUSTIN _ In recent years, the Texas football program has teased
its fans, hinting that it was traveling fast on the road to
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   But every time, a major setback has slowed the trip.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns once again are in the midst of a winning streak,
and happy days are here again.
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing Longhorns fans want to know. Is the team
really on the road to recovery?
</P>
<P>
   Ella Fitzgerald stepped to the mike as only she could and
delivered a glass-shattering note.
</P>
<P>
   People across the country wondered if they heard what they
heard, saw what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   Was it her voice or Hollywood magic? Was it live or was it
Memorex?
</P>
<P>
   When Texas beat Nebraska 20-16 last Saturday, it ended the
Cornhuskers' 47-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   From El Paso to Nacogdoches, Longhorns fans adjusted the volume
on their television sets. From Abilene to Corpus Christi,
bespectacled Texas backers reached for their glasses.
</P>
<P>
   They were sure it was not television magic that allowed Texas to
beat Nebraska _ after all, April Fools' Day is five months away,
and their beloved 'Horns had burst the Cornhuskers' bubble less
than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But they still wondered if they heard what they heard, saw what
they saw _ not just Texas beating Nebraska, mind you, but Texas
retaking its proper place among the country's elite programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, those glasses may be Tyler-rose-colored, but we are
talking Texas Longhorns fans.
</P>
<P>
   These fans will deliver in unison a heart-rending chorus of
Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen after one of those
once-every-25-years-or-so losses to Rice or TCU.
</P>
<P>
   But they also will gladly join hands on Sixth Street to sing a
Puff Daddy remixed combination of The Eyes of Texas and Happy Days
Are Here Again after an impressive win over those same Owls or
Horned Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Being overzealous is better than being apathetic, and in the
fans' defense, the standard of excellence has been established. The
question is, are the Longhorns on the road to achieving it again?
</P>
<P>
   With Texas on a roll of five straight victories, it looks like
the 'Horns are.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, is it for real?
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns say yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this program is definitely rising,'' senior linebacker
Dusty Renfro said. ``You can see all of the positive signs, and
this coaching staff has everything headed in the right direction.
The confidence is there, and everybody walks with a certain swagger
that we didn't use to have.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could turn out to be the year it turned around and stayed
turned around. This is an important season.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 1990s are viewed as an important decade to the school's
football future because of the difficult finish to the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which began playing football in 1898, did not have its
first losing season until 1933 (4-5-2).
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s, the Longhorns suffered no losing seasons
and claimed three national championships. There was a 30-year run
of non-losing campaigns until a stretch of three losing seasons in
four years from 1986-89.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Texas has looked like it has been climbing up the
down escalator.
</P>
<P>
   Under first-year coach Mack Brown, the Longhorns have fashioned
their fifth winning streak of five or more games this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The last of those streaks was in 1996, and like the current run
of victories, No. 5 was an upset win against Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Texas followed that victory over the Cornhuskers in the Big 12
Championship Game with a disappointing effort against Penn State in
the Fiesta Bowl that resulted in a 38-15 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different then, because we had a run of five games
where we played so well, then we had almost a month off before we
played again, so it was tough,'' running back Ricky Williams said.
``But (this time) we have a game in (seven) days, so we have to get
back on our horse and get ready for Oklahoma State.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' roll will not be interrupted by a long layoff
before a bowl game, as it has been in three of the other four
streaks since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech stopped Texas' six-game winning streak in 1995
with an upset of the John Mackovic-coached team in the Sugar Bowl,
and Miami walloped David McWilliams' Longhorns on New Year's Day to
close out the 1990 season.
</P>
<P>
   In Mackovic's first year at the helm (1992), Texas reeled off
six straight wins before a painful loss to TCU ended its 25-year
dominance of the Horned Frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Up, up, up, and back down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see the team hitting valleys anymore,'' senior
center Russell Gaskamp said. ``I think after this year there is
going to be a precedent set on how we play.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which ends its season against Texas Tech and Texas A&AMP;M,
seems primed to extended its current streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have three more games, and the team wants to finish
9-2,'' Williams said. ``The team is playing so well, there's no way
there's going to be a letdown. We go out and practice every week
and have fun, and we just keep on getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Longhorns expressed similar sentiments after the win
over Nebraska two years ago, and it did not help against Penn
State.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the win had no carryover, as Texas fell to 4-7 last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 difference is that team that beat Nebraska sent a
lot of people to the NFL,'' Gaskamp said. ``We lost a lot of
players off that team, especially defensively, and that is why our
defense was so young last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll lose some good players on the offensive side of the ball
after this season, but I think for the Texas tradition to come back
and to drive toward winning championships, it has to start with
defense. That's where you build the foundation of a good team _ on
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas defense, which Brown described as the worst he had
ever seen when spring practice began, has steadily improved, and
there is reason to believe it will continue to do so.
</P>
<P>
   An almost unheard-of 15 freshmen and sophomores are listed on
the team's 22-man defensive depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see how young we are, you know how good it can get,''
Renfro said. ``These guys and the recruits over the next couple of
years are here at the right time, because Texas football is on its
way back, and they'll be right in the middle of it.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ The Wrecking Crew.
<TEXT>
<P>
   People at Texas A&AMP;M don't say that as much as they used to,
maybe because this defensive unit doesn't have as many big names as
some of the teams in the past. But the moniker applies.
</P>
<P>
   This A&AMP;M defense has proved it can wreck with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have been as consistent as any defense we've ever
had,'' A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``The group may not have as many
stars as some of the others, but the overall ability is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few statistics that prove the Wrecking Crew tradition
continues for the A&AMP;M defense:
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M has allowed only 13 points per game, which ranks No. 7 in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Dat Nguyen tops the school's career list with 460
tackles, surpassing the 455 by Johnny Holland (1983-86).
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies allow only 99.6 rushing yards per game, only 2.8
yards per attempt. The defense has allowed only three runs of more
than 20 yards this season.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M allows only 98.6 yards passing per game. The team has 11
interceptions and has given up only six passing TDs.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies have 83 tackles for losses, including 20 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M has held its opponents scoreless in the second half of the
past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this defense is as good as any we've had since I've
been here,'' senior safety Rich Coady said. ``It doesn't have the
star quality as others had in the past, but for some reason we have
jelled together. We are better as a team, and we help each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a unique fit that works. In the past, we would
have two or three All-Americans but we would be weak in other
areas. This defense doesn't have any big holes.''
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-ranked Aggies have shown their defensive skills
against some of the best offensive players in the nation. Only two
weeks after Louisiana Tech receiver Troy Edwards set an NCAA record
of 405 yards receiving against Nebraska, the Aggies held him to 67
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech tailback Ricky Williams averages 157 rushing yards
per game, but A&AMP;M held him to a season-low 94 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma State game in Stillwater this past weekend was the
best of the season for the Wrecking Crew. The Cowboys were 0-for-12
on third-down conversions and made only two first downs in the
second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like no matter what they ran, they couldn't do
anything,'' A&AMP;M linebacker Roylin Bradley said. ``Sometimes I feel
like we're having too much fun out there, but we're doing what
we're supposed to do. We just have to stay focused and not get
complacent. We can't get the big head.''
</P>
<P>
   The one star on the defense is Nguyen, who is a strong candidate
for the Dick Butkus Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pumps us up to see how hard Dat works on every play,''
Bradley said. ``We don't want to look bad by having Dat make all
the tackles, so we are determined to get our share of tackles,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most encouraging aspects of the 1998 defense is that
it has only three senior starters _ Nguyen, Coady and linebacker
Warrick Holdman. The top six defensive linemen for A&AMP;M include four
sophomores and two redshirt freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still a young defense with a lot of sophomores,'' said
Bradley, a sophomore from La Marque. ``But everyone is doing his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Defensive end) Rocky Bernard and I were looking at film the
other day. I made a couple of tackles, he made a couple, (defensive
end) Ron Flemons made two, and (linebacker) Cornelius Anthony made
two. That all happened within about 10 plays. It isn't just one
person. If you watch the films, you see four or five guys in on
almost every tackle.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley gives a lot of the credit to A&AMP;M defensive coordinator
Mike Hankwitz, who came to College Station last season after two
years at Kansas and 10 at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Hankwitz really knows his X's and O's,'' Bradley said.
``He always puts us in the right situation, which is why we're
having more fun this year. When someone makes a big play, we all
get excited and celebrate.''
</P>
<P>
   In past years, the Wrecking Crew intimidated opponents with a
relentless, attacking style. The Aggies dominated offenses and made
opponents fear them. Is this group getting to that level?
</P>
<P>

are starting to respect us,'' Bradley said. ``As long as we keep
improving, I think we might get to that point.

Auburn (in the 1986 Cotton Bowl) when Bo Jackson was there. Auburn
had first down at the five, but they stopped Jackson four straight
times and Auburn couldn't get it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's dominating. We would like to get to that point.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
After almost a week of threats and intense negotiations, the Astros
and Moises Alou reached a resolution that will keep the All-Star
left fielder in an Astros uniform.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alou, who had threatened to exercise his right to demand a trade
if the Astros didn't enhance his contract, got his wish just a few
hours before Thursday's 11 p.m. CST deadline when he and his agent
convinced the Astros to improve his deal.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the agreement have not been released. Alou, who hit
.312 with 38 homers and 124 RBIs in his first season with the
Astros, has three years remaining on his current contract.
</P>
<P>
   The original deal guaranteed Alou $5 million in each of the next
three seasons. It's uncertain how Thursday's agreement will affect
the player's annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say how it was resolved, but I will say we
are delighted that we were able to work something out,'' Astros
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``Moises is an important part
of this club, and it would have been a big blow if we would have
lost him for the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a situation where both sides really wanted to get
something done, and ultimately I think that's why we were able to
work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hunsicker thought there was a possibility Alou, 32,
might follow through with his trade demand, Alou's agent, Bob
Gilhooly, said he and his client never thought it would reach that
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole purpose was to try to work something out, and we're
glad we were able to do that,'' Gilhooly said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought the Astros had given in to Alou, Hunsicker
said: ``This was a very fair and equitable agreement, and it's
something both sides feel very good about.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Astros traded for Alou the first year after he had
signed a multiyear contract with the Marlins, Alou had the right to
demand a trade, but he had to do so by 11 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Alou had gone through with his trade request, the two
sides could have continued to negotiate, although it's reasonable
to assume the Astros might have granted his request considering
their outfield depth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, today is the first day teams other than the Astros
can make an offer to free-agent pitcher Randy Johnson, although
Hunsicker and the player's agents believe it could be two or three
weeks before Johnson decides where he wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros also are free to pursue free agents from other teams,
including third baseman Ken Caminiti, in whom the club has
expressed interest. Caminiti, the National League's Most Valuable
Player in 1996, has indicated a desire to return to the Astros,
with whom he began his major-league career.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker has said a lefthanded contact and/or power hitter and
a righthanded reliever are the club's primary offseason needs;
Johnson remains the club's No. 1 offseason priority.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker, who is part of a group that owns racehorses, is
attending the Breeders' Cup in Louisville, Ky., this weekend, so
the Astros should be fairly quiet until next week, when the general
managers meetings commence in Naples, Fla.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE remark was not meant to be a wisecrack. It was merely the gut
reaction of a humble former heavyweight champion, describing his
resentment of his critics in the media and the boxing community.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were scrutinizing with my mind,'' complained Mike Tyson,
using the pluperfect subjunctive of the phrase ``to scrute,''
meaning to toy or jack around with another's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   So partly out of spite, one suspects, partly out of pride and,
to a huge degree, out of personal and financial need, Tyson is
back, cleared for action by a team of shrinks and the Nevada State
Athletic Commission. Once again, you try to imagine Mike's mental
state, and it is like trying to get a grip on a rolling ball of
barbed wire.
</P>
<P>
   But the ironies abound. A year ago, who would have guessed Tyson
might return to the ring before the first elbow is thrown in the
new NBA season? He is expected to begin the third comeback of his
volatile career in January, possibly against Francois Botha of
South Africa, or Germany's Axel Schulz.
</P>
<P>
   In the same month, George Foreman and Larry Holmes are expected
to slug it out in Houston for the senior heavyweight title, 49
years and over. If all goes according to plan, the fight is
expected to be the last for both of these remarkable gents.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, you pause to reflect on Tyson's place in
the galaxy. Normally, no true sports fan wants to see an old geezer
of 32 hanging on, a shell of his former great self, grinding it out
for the next payday. But the truth is, the public will take
whatever it can get. In the parlance of the whiskey business, the
typical boxing fan accepts what they are pouring from the well and
doesn't call for name brands.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this picture so foggy are the strange, hairpin turns
Tyson's career has taken. In his prime, at the peak of his earning
power, Iron Mike gave a great deal of thought to retiring. He had
made his pro debut in 1985, during the Reagan presidency, won the
title at 19 and, in three years, all but wiped out the heavyweight
division.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing had been good to him, he conceded, but he wanted to spend
more time with his wife, actress Robin Givens, and his fleet of
luxury automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having spent four years in exile because of popular demand,
he begged and groveled for the chance to prove he can play by the
rules. This means society's rules, as well as the somewhat lesser
standards of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the one-time Brooklyn street wolf surprises us with
his introspection. When a reporter asked him if he had demeaned
himself by refereeing a pro wrestling match during his suspension,
Tyson arched an eyebrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a guy who served three years in prison for rape. I was
suspended for a year for trying to bite off someone's ear.'' With a
quizzical look, he said, ``Do you think I have an image problem?''
</P>
<P>
   You doubt Tyson will be with us at 50, tossing off one-liners,
plugging his favorite burger chain and setting an example for the
geriatric set. But he will have a place in boxing lore, among those
who lost it all in the high noon of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   All you need to know about the health of boxing today is that
promoters are drooling over the prospect of Tyson putting himself
on display against Botha or Schulz. If Evander Holyfield is willing
to give Mike a third match, with all the dreadful puns that would
be inspired, the pay-TV sales are going to be off the charts. Like
a crazed matador, Tyson tried to award himself two ears. What next?
Don't even think about it.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't easy, of course, to explain how championship matches
are made. When Joe Louis ruled the division, his opponents were
lumped for convenience under the heading of ``Bums of the Month.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali made a fortune fighting the likes of Chuck Wepner,
whose underdog status inspired Sylvester Stallone to write a
screenplay called Rocky. Wepner's one claim to fame was his
incredible capacity for bleeding in public.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his more notable matches, Wepner fought the late Sonny
Liston _ before he became the late Sonny Liston, of course _ and
afterward Chuck was virtually unmarked, except for the 75 stitches
in his face.
</P>
<P>
   You reflect that the sports fans of America won't go hungry,
even without pro basketball. Golf, tennis, car races and boxing
matches go on around the clock. You can sometimes watch an aerobics
class for 15 minutes before you realize it is not a team
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, a karate match was carried on TV in which a male
champion fought a woman who was 100 pounds lighter. In the true
Olympic spirit, he punched her in the mouth, kicked her in the
stomach and knocked her out cold.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy your comeback, Iron Mike. Ticket sales at the circus can
use the boost.

QUICK START WOULD HELP BOOST REIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For a team that needs a good start to erase the past
and fuel future ticket sales, the Reign probably would have picked
a place other than Denver for their opening game. This is where
they have gone to die in their first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's American Basketball League team is 0-8 in Colorado,
losing by an average of 11.3 points. But if the Reign are going to
prosper this season, they might as well try to turn pessimism into
optimism at McNichols Arena Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big hurdle but not an impossible one for the Reign, who
seem to be more determined and talented this year.
</P>
<P>
   New coach Tammy Holder brings enthusiasm and organization. New
point guard Niesa Johnson brings a dynamic floor game. The team has
a new attitude. The returners should be improved. Shalonda Enis and
Val Whiting are proven players.
</P>
<P>
   Holder is confident that this team will make the playoffs. (That
limb she's on won't break unless the Reign finish last in the
Western Conference _ the top three teams in each conference qualify
for the postseason.)
</P>
<P>
   Last is where the Reign finished last year, a 15-29 team that
was starting to come around in the second half of the season after
Jacquie Hullah was replaced by Holder following a winless December.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson believes in the Reign. She played for Long Beach last
year, helping the StingRays advance to the ABL Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not much difference between this team and the Long
Beach team,'' Johnson said. ``I'm not sure if anybody believes me,
but we're a more well-balanced team.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson likes the potential. But she wants the Reign to develop
an attention to detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effort is here. It's not a lack of trying. And we've got
the enthusiasm,'' Johnson said. ``But we need to learn
communication and fundamentals. It's a little frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody beats you off the dribble, you say `Help.' You
talk on defense. All great teams do that. It's coming, but I
thought it was something everybody did.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they will play as a team. And again on Sunday when they
face San Jose in their home opener at Mercer Arena. If not, an 0-2
start is possible, and the perception will be that they are the
same old Reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing for our reputations this year,'' said reserve
guard Christy Hedgpeth, entering her third year with the Reign.
``We have a reputation that isn't flattering. We have to be
determined that it is not going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Holder is somewhat concerned about her team's condition for the
opening weekend. Enis missed two days of practice and Johnson,
Naomi Mulitauaopele and Angela Aycock one each with stomach flu
this week.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term, Holder is excited. The team is playing better defense
and running through its options on offense. She thinks the Reign's
0-3 preseason record is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ``People probably saw the exhibition games and said, `Is this
team any different?' We are. We're a much different team. We want
people to come out and see that we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Bryant is the team's new general manager, replacing Jim
Weyermann, now the ABL's chief operating officer. Earlier this week
ticket sales were lagging for the opener, and Bryant related how
important it is for the team to be successful early this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in a desperate way,'' Bryant said. ``I hate to add to
that pressure, but it's reality. It affects everyone in the
organization.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: The Reign have added a second date at KeyArena to their
schedule, moving their Nov. 27 game against San Jose out of Mercer
Arena. With the NBA lockout preventing the Sonics from playing at
KeyArena, city and Seattle Center officials have been looking for
alternatives to fill empty dates.

SEAHAWKS NEED TO START PLAYING FOR THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Chiefs will be at the Kingdome Sunday, expecting
to win like they usually do against the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Seahawks visit the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Two AFC West games, home and away. It's a chance for the
Seahawks to prove they are as good as they're supposed to be _ or
they're something worse, which would be impossible to explain.
</P>
<P>
   That is what's on the line for the Seahawks now. Two weeks to
make good on the promise that things were going to be different
around here _ a promise started two years ago, when big, fat checks
went sliding across the table during high-stakes free-agent
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   That was a way to start changing perceptions about the Seahawks,
but it was just a start.
</P>
<P>
   First came Pro Bowl linebacker Chad Brown. Then Willie Williams.
Then Brian Habib and Kevin Glover.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time free-agent running back Ricky Watters was signed
last spring, there wasn't anyone who couldn't see that Seattle was
a player in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Same old Seahawks?
</P>
<P>
   Not on your life. Not when Paul Allen was selling stock and
spending cash and using his image as the great savior of a beloved
Northwest sports franchise to induce taxpayers to build the
Seahawks a new downtown stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Only one problem: Money can't buy you a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   And, money and talent can't overcome a coaching staff that lacks
the necessary vision and toughness to re-invent the Seahawks' image
and, more importantly, reset the Hawks' collective mindset.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that went 2-14 in 1992. This is a team that has
not won 10 games since 1986. This is a team that last made the
playoffs in 1988. It has a lot to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost like a force of nature, all that negative history
and all that losing _ a legacy that would take a very strong leader
to work in conjunction with the big Allen budget to effectively end
a decade of futility.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the cracks started to show. The hard-playing Brown
lashed out Sunday after the frustrating 31-18 loss to the Raiders.
He said he could not be around losers. You felt like he was talking
as much about the longstanding collective soul of this franchise
than he was about its current talent level and potential.
</P>
<P>
   But in response to the cracks, it took a veteran _ one of the
longest-tenured Seahawks _ to insist that Brown and the rest of the
team stick together.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Sinclair has a longer NFL resume than coach Dennis
Erickson. Sinclair has lost more games as a Seahawk than everyone
except Brian Blades and Cortez Kennedy. Sinclair made it a point of
personal pride to stand up and command his team to demonstrate that
it has the soul of a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep saying: `We're not the same team. We're not the same
team.' Yet we keep putting up the same results. What's behind
that?'' Sinclair said.
</P>
<P>
   At best, the job tryout is down to two weeks for Erickson and
his staff. At 4-4, the Seahawks have squandered a 3-0 start. They
are several mistakes from being 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   There were too many fumbles in Pittsburgh, where Kordell Stewart
and the Steelers were ripe for a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, there were too many Warren Moon/Ricky Watters
backfield collisions and a critical blown pass coverage that
allowed Chiefs receiver Andre Rison to make a game-breaking play.
</P>
<P>
   There was a narrow escape out of San Diego, where Ryan Leaf was
driving in the final minutes and might have succeeded in his
unlikely comeback if the Chargers had decided to hand off to
Natrone Means once in that final series instead of letting Leaf
keep passing.
</P>
<P>
   There was a fourth-quarter interception by John Friesz that
killed a Seahawk drive that might have led to an upset vs. Denver.
</P>
<P>
   And against the Raiders, in a game that was a must-win if only
to prove these Seahawks can do what is at least expected, the ball
was dangerously put in the unsure hands of Ahman Green, Ronnie
Harris and Jason McEndoo.
</P>
<P>
   They should be 6-2. They really ought to be, except for the
mistakes and miscues and failures to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if everybody didn't know Erickson's job was on the
line this season. Even some of his players understood, which is why
one insisted the Hawks' level of talent could win games this season
despite the coaching.
</P>
<P>
   But for right now, before anyone starts calling for the simple
solution of firing the coach, it is time to subscribe to a higher
theory about these Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   They don't need to win for their coach, whose future is cloudy
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   They don't need to win for their owner, either, even if the NBA
lockout will give Allen more time to watch over his other pet
business, the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   They don't even need to win for their fans, although it would be
nice since the fans are coming back and the sports landscape is
perfect for a Seahawks' takeover of headlines and emotions.
</P>
<P>
   These 1998 Seahawks must beat the Chiefs and then the Raiders
for one reason only: for themselves. That is ultimately where the
age-old perception about the ``same old Seahawks'' will be changed.
It is not too late. It is time.

INJURED LEG WON'T STOP WATTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND _ Apparently it takes more than having fluid drained
from his bruised right leg to stop Ricky Watters.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' leading rusher emerged from four hours of
extensive treatment Thursday night and declared himself ready to
play in Sunday's game against the Kansas City Chiefs at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I can tell you, I'm going to play on Sunday,''
Watters said. ``I've got to play. I've got to go. I've got to do my
thing. It's too big of a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Watters' status will be re-evaluated Friday, but he did not
practice Thursday after having an ounce of fluid drained from his
right knee Wednesday, and was added to the injury report as
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   With Watters sidelined, rookie Ahman Green and veteran Steve
Broussard split time at running back. But Watters said he plans to
practice Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to practice to be able to play, but I want to practice
to show the team that I'm ready,'' Watters said.
</P>
<P>
   Watters originally bruised his thigh in the Oct. 4 loss at
Kansas City. He took another knee to the thigh in Sunday night's
loss to Oakland. When Watters arrived at the team's headquarters
Monday morning, the leg had stiffened. As fluid began to collect
from the thigh to the calf, the decision was made to drain it
through the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Draining the fluid relieved the pain and Thursday's treatment
session with trainer Jim Whitesel was intended to alleviate the
swelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really good now after all this treatment,'' Watters
said. ``I was like, `I'm not leaving here until I feel a lot
better.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I have absolutely no pain. Hopefully it will feel
the same way, if not better, tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time he ever had fluid drained from his body.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't scare me or nothing. It was painless,'' Watters
said. ``They said I get the tough-guy award.''
</P>
<P>
   The fluid in his leg wasn't the only thing missing. Watters also
has shaved his head after wearing an Afro and corn rows earlier
this season.

MARINERS SHOP FOR BARGAINS IN FREE-AGENT MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Time to throw out the first bid.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of tip-toeing around dollars when talking with
other teams' free agents, baseball clubs Friday can begin serious
negotiations with any player on a star-studded market.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brown, Randy Johnson, Mo Vaughn, Bernie Williams, Albert
Belle and Rafael Palmeiro are among those whose phone lines should
be busy. None of those zillion-dollar offers, though, will come
from the 206 area code.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have been talking with several free agents, and
also are looking for help through trades. But the M's have
maintained all along they don't have the budget to pursue this
winter's most expensive free agents. American League West rivals
Texas and Anaheim do.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle will try to keep up by adding to its talented core, most
likely with veterans whose prices won't push them past their
projected player payroll of roughly $53 million. Pitching, both
starting and relief, is the priority, with a leadoff man also on
the wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Trade scenarios _ possibly involving Russ Davis, David Segui,
Bobby Ayala and others _ also could develop, but those could open
up other holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a reliever that comes up first for us, that's fine,''
said vice president of baseball administration Lee Pelekoudas. ``If
it's a starting pitcher, that's fine, too. But we know those are
the areas we have to concentrate on, and the leadoff hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have 10 players under contract for '99, at a cost
of $36.65 million, plus three more eligible for arbitration and
others under club control. None of their six free agents (Rich
Amaral, John Marzano, Joe Oliver, Heathcliff Slocumb, Bill Swift
and Mike Timlin) is certain to return, and only Timlin will be
pursued immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle would seem to be a natural fit for free-agent
right-hander Todd Stottlemyre, whose two months with the Rangers
this year helped lift Texas to the AL West crown. Stottlemyre is
33, has experience on winning teams and grew up in Yakima, Wash.
The trouble is, he will probably be out of the M's price range.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: The New York Mets just re-signed lefty Al Leiter to a
four-year, $32 million contract. Leiter and Stottlemyre are the
same age, and have nearly identical records since 1995 (Leiter is
55-38, Stottlemyre 54-40). If Stottlemyre asks for Leiter money,
the M's will pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Al Leiter signing, I think, will have a negative effect on
a lot of clubs,'' said Woody Woodward, the Mariners' vice president
of baseball operations. ``It's going to mean there are going to be
pitchers out there who say, `If Leiter gets this, I certainly
should get it, or something close to it.' It makes the decisions
that much tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   If Stottlemyre is out, who is in? The Mariners are not
interested in the Giants' Orel Hershiser or the Cubs' Mark Clark,
but they are talking with at least three other starting pitchers:
the Royals' Tim Belcher, the Dodgers' Brian Bohanon and the Giants'
Mark Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher has won 15, 13 and 14 games for Kansas City since
leaving the M's as a free agent after the '95 season. He ranks
sixth in the majors in innings pitched over the past three years,
hasn't visited the disabled list since 1990 and would join Jeff
Fassero and Jamie Moyer in a solid trio atop the M's rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His market would pretty much be a three-year deal right now,
so Seattle would have to make that commitment,'' said Belcher's
agent, Scott Boras. ``But he's very interested in coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras said the three-year, $12.5 million contract Bret
Saberhagen signed with the Boston Red Sox is a reasonable barometer
for Belcher. Besides Seattle, Boras said, three or four other teams
have shown strong interest.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon was a surprise in Los Angeles, where he came into his
own by posting a 2.40 earned-run average in 14 starts after a
midseason trade from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon is a 30-year-old left-hander with an encouraging upside,
but he also could be this year's version of Willie Blair, who got
$11.5 million for three years from Arizona last winter despite only
one standout season. Bohanon enters free agency with just 25 career
wins, and as recently as 1996, he had a 7.77 ERA in 20 relief
appearances for the Blue Jays. The Dodgers are making a strong push
to retain him, and Bohanon wants to return.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner has been a stalwart of the Giants' staff, winning 12, 12
and 13 games in the past three years. But like Belcher, he will be
37 years old next season, and, like Bohanon, his own team will make
a serious effort to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed relief options include Dennis Cook of the Mets,
Scott Radinsky of the Dodgers and Greg Swindell of the Red Sox. But
the reliever the Mariners most covet is their own, Timlin, who
converted 19 of 20 save opportunities after the All-Star break.
Timlin made $3.025 million last year, and he could stand to make
much more next season.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cubs re-signed Rod Beck and the Dodgers boosted Jeff
Shaw's salary to keep him off the market this week, Timlin emerged
as arguably the best available closer. (Kansas City's Jeff
Montgomery saved 36 games, but his 4.98 ERA was two runs higher
than Timlin's.) Timlin's agent, David Sloane, said he has been in
contact with all but two teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team that's called has had interest in Mike, and that's
unusual,'' Sloane said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Timlin has proven himself to be a dependable
late-inning pitcher, he has been a full-time closer only in 1996
(31 saves for Toronto) and the second half of last year. The
Mariners don't seem concerned about the notion of an all-out
bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timlin has told us he wants to come back, and if we can work
it out, that's what we want to do,'' Woodward said. ``Does it
bother me that he's one of the best out there? No, it doesn't
bother me. That's one reason we have interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's search for a leadoff hitter will include a look at
Kansas City's Jose Offerman, who has hit .306 over the past three
years and stole 45 bases last year. But, at 30, he will be one of
the premier free agents on the market, and might be out of the M's
price range.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are not interested in Minnesota's Otis Nixon, but
are pursuing Oakland's Rickey Henderson, who turns 40 on Christmas
but can still get on base and run. Among Mariners, only Edgar
Martinez had a better on-base percentage than Henderson's .376 last
season, and no player in baseball matched Henderson's 66 stolen
bases.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in Seattle's favor could be Henderson's pursuit of
the all-time record for runs scored. He stands 232 runs behind Ty
Cobb (2,246), and, as agent Jeff Borris said, ``The guys in that
(Mariner) lineup would hit him in a few more times than the guys in
Oakland's lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing Henderson or Offerman, or trading for, say, Tampa Bay's
Quinton McCracken, presents another problem, because all those
players would patrol left field in Seattle. Left field is where
Segui might have to play, in an uncomfortable arrangement
necessitated by Jay Buhner's September elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly something we can deal with,'' Woodward said of
Buhner's situation, ``but it doesn't make it any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Buhner won't be able to play right field at the start of the
season, and the Mariners say they don't know when he will be ready.
But they need his bat in the lineup, and the only place to put him
is first base, where Martinez also will see some time.
</P>
<P>
   That bumps Segui _ the league's best-fielding first baseman _ to
left, and given Segui's solid production and workable '99 salary
($2.5 million), he'd be an attractive trade commodity to a lot of
teams. The M's have been reluctant to discuss a contract extention
with Segui, and if he could bring pitching help in return, the M's
probably would listen.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who led major league third basemen with 32 errors, also
could be dealt for pitching, though that's not a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Russ had defensive problems, but at the same time
he produced a lot of runs for us,'' Pelekoudas said. ``So we have
to weigh what we do there. If we can improve ourselves defensively
without giving up too much run production, that may be a
consideration. But it's not something we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who reasonably say the M's have to trade Ayala,
who went a ghastly 1-10 with a 7.29 ERA. But if the M's were to
deal Ayala, who will make $1.8 million next season, he probably
would have to be exchanged for another team's headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some flexibility,'' Woodward said. ``I don't think
we'll be trading any of the young prospects unless there's a young
player coming back in the deal. We might trade a younger big league
player for an older player to give some experience in a certain
area, but I couldn't see us trading young prospects away.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving Davis would create a hole at third, which the M's could
fill with a free agent like the White Sox's Robin Ventura, to whom
they have talked, or former Mariner Mike Blowers of Oakland, who
has not been contacted. Ventura would match Davis' run production
and dramatically improve the M's defense, but he is seeking a
three- to five-year deal, according to agent John Boggs, and made
$6.1 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is a Type A free agent, like Stottlemyre, Belcher,
Gardner, Cook, Radinsky, Swindell and Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small consolation, but the Mariners' 76-85 finish last
year benefits them in one way. Because they finished in the lower
half of the overall standings, they would not lose a first-round
draft pick by signing a top free agent.

L.A. SCHOOL DELEGATION BLOWS INTO WINDY CITY FOR MANAGEMENT LESSON
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention Chicago editors.) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A delegation from the Los Angeles school district
studying first-hand Chicago's much-touted school reforms got an
earful of advice _ it scared some and exhilarated others.
</P>
<P>
   Given free rein by the Illinois Legislature, Chicago Mayor
Richard Daley shocked the city by ousting the school board and
replacing its members with top business and civic leaders and
putting his own finance director in charge of the school district.
</P>
<P>
   The result: a get-tough accountability plan that has shown
dramatic student improvement, rid the district of debt and launched
a massive capital improvement campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the board members, administrators and parents in the Los
Angeles Unified School District fact-finding group dismissed the
Chicago model and its large-scale political machine as unworkable
and unwise in the City of Angels.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that power in one person scares me,'' said Valerie Fields,
an LAUSD board member. ``It's OK if you have someone dedicated to
the welfare of students. But if you get some slimy politician
interested in passing out goodies, it's disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   But some parents on the trip said it might offer the chance for
a dramatic shake-up of the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the Los Angeles educators were shocked to hear how it
works in Chicago,'' said Bobbi Farrell, a Parent Teacher
Association member. ``I think it would be a good idea to have a mix
of business leaders and educators on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the group met with Chicago school leaders in their
new administrative offices in the city's financial district. Then,
braving icy November winds, they visited a school that has shown
impressive results since Daley's reforms were implemented three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The LAUSD is facing calls for change from the community, plans
to break up the school system and Los Angeles Mayor Richard
Riordan's campaign to unseat a majority of the school board in the
next election, and LAUSD officials know the district can no longer
put off implementing its own accountability plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a choice. We are going to reform ourselves or we
are going to be reformed,'' said LAUSD board president Victoria
Castro in an interview in the Chicago school headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, Superintendent Ruben Zacarias has slowly cobbled
together a plan that first focused on the district's 100 worst
schools and is being broadened to require improvement from each
campus. Zacarias' plan is similar to Chicago's in that it
identifies campuses with dropping test scores and puts them on
probation if they don't improve. In addition, teachers and
principals can face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful United Teachers Los Angeles union, however, opposes
the plan, and it has received lukewarm support from some school
board members.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting between leaders of the Los Angeles &UR;  &LR; school
district, the nation's second largest, and the Chicago &UR;  &LR; district,
the third largest, helped define the hurdles the LAUSD could face.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago in Chicago, the system was on the verge of
collapse: unproductive teachers, plummeting test scores,
dilapidated schools and a population of mostly poor and mostly
minority students.
</P>
<P>
   So the Republican-controlled state Legislature in the summer of
1995 made a crafty political decision _ give Daley total control
and responsibility for the schools, a move many believed would ruin
his political career. Instead, Daley, a Democrat, did what many
thought impossible by moving forward a school system that had been
deteriorating for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Gery Chico, president of the Chicago School Board and Daley's
former chief of staff, said his city's success is possible
elsewhere under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a top leader with people around him who share
the philosophy that government can do a lot better, whether that's
schools or a municipality,'' Chico said. ``In Chicago's case, the
mayor wanted people working in the schools that &UR;  &LR; had an intense
passion for results and knew how to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley made Paul Vallas, his former budget director, chief
executive officer of the schools. Within months, the new vanguard
unapologetically employed a bare-knuckles improvement campaign. A
virtual martial law was imposed, and nearly 1,100 administrators
were sacked at the district's central office.
</P>
<P>
   The board balanced the budget and privatized many services.
</P>
<P>
   Vallas ended the district's policy of social promotion, which
allowed students to advance to the next grade even if they failed
their classes.
</P>
<P>
   He put 109 of the district's 559 schools on probation because
fewer than 15 percent of their students were achieving the national
average for their grade.
</P>
<P>
   There are now 92 schools on probation, and reading and math
scores are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Vallas kept the local school governing councils of parents,
teachers and community leaders that can hire and fire principals
and approve budgets. However, curriculum planning is done at the
district level, to allow for consistent instruction and training.

NORTHRIDGE SENIOR GUARD HAS SEEN CHANGING OF GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The floor was nothing but a concrete slab. During
the heat of two-a-days, David San Vicente joined teammates on the
cool ground between sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years that have passed since San Vicente's freshman
season, scholarships rose from 17 to 50 and three head coaches
moved through Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The school also added carpeting and lockers to the locker room,
put up a scoreboard and spruced up North Campus Stadium with
bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a lot changed on the outside, but inside it's changed a
lot,'' said San Vicente, a senior left guard making, perhaps, his
last home appearance Saturday against Portland State. ``The
recruiting has been awesome. They've been recruiting quality guys,
like they said they would, and the talent has really gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN (5-3, 4-2 Big Sky) could wind up hosting a playoff game
later this month, but it's unlikely. Yet, San Vicente, a Birmingham
High graduate, isn't sad about being in the twilight of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy because not many people get to play four years,''
San Vicente said. ``That's pretty special and that's why I don't
feel sad this is going to be my last game here. I've made this into
my second family.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting his kicks: CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said punter Ethan
Beck is handling kickoff duties against Portland State because
Manny Marquez has a sore leg. However, Marquez, 10 of 11 on
field-goal attempts, will be the place-kicker.
</P>
<P>
   Short yardage: Defensive lineman Jacob Mageo (ankle) and
linebacker Jack Heaslet (ankle) missed practice and aren't expected
to play.... Ponciano said Mike Barnes, who missed the past two
weeks with a shoulder injury, is starting at left tackle, and Julio
Alcala at center, but if need be he'll shift Alcala to left tackle
and Beau Cherry to center.

UCLA'S DAVIS STILL NOT READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA sophomore guard Baron Davis had his
surgically repaired left knee examined Thursday and was not cleared
to return.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be re-evaluated next week by Dr. Steve Lombardo, the
Lakers' physician who reconstructed Davis' torn anterior cruciate
ligament in April.
</P>
<P>
   Davis will continue to participate in conditioning drills and
non-contact work in practice. He has not been ruled out of the Nov.
19 season opener against Santa Clara, but mid-December seems a more
likely window for his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point in the non-conference schedule, I think he'll be
cleared,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. ``When when he comes back,
we'll monitor him closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Top of the heap: Stanford received 36 of 37 first-place votes in
the Pacific-10's preseason media poll announced Thursday. It's the
first time in four years UCLA or Arizona did not top the voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us were aware from the kind of club Stanford had last
year that they'd be in this position,'' Wildcats coach Lute Olson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford made the Final Four last season and has its top eight
scorers back, including preseason All American Arthur Lee, from
North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was picked second, with Washington third and UCLA
fourth. USC was picked eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Collins update: Stanford center Jason Collins is recovering
slowly from a knee injury that required two surgeries last season.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a former Harvard-Westlake star, frayed the meniscus
cartilage in his left knee last November, played in one game and
received a medical redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not 100 percent, but we're encouraged by where he is,''
coach Mike Montgomery said at media day. ``We're trying to find a
(practice) formula so the swelling will not force him to sit for
long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   Ones to watch: USC coach Henry Bibby was asked to name the
pleasant surprises from the early weeks of practice. He mentioned
two players: guard Jeff Trepagnier and forward Greg Lakey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trepagnier has developed a jump shot, and Lakey has been
dominant inside,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back?: Ex-Bruins Charles O'Bannon and Jelani McCoy may
be on the opposing roster when UCLA faces the California All-Stars
in an exhibition game Nov. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Rosters for traveling teams vary from game-to-game, but O'Bannon
and McCoy, searching for competition during the NBA Lockout, were
recently spotted in All-Stars uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Roster stuff: Arizona State forward Mike Batiste will miss the
first eight games to concentrate on academics....
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is expected to rule next week on Cal recruit Solomon
Hughes' eligibility. Hughes signed a letter-of-intent with Tulane
two years, went to a prep school instead, and now wants to play for
Cal. Tulane has refused to release him from his letter-of-intent,
rendering Hughes ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   Quote of the day: Lute Olson joked that the gray hair near
Montgomery's temples is a result of pressure and expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray is all relative,'' Montgomery said to the silver-topped
Olson.

WHO LOOKS OUT FOR COLLEGE ATHLETES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Billy Hunter should climb out of the bunker he is
defending at once. The world will be safe for capitalism whether or
not he lobs one more verbal grenade at wealthy owners. The wealthy
athletes he has gone to war for aren't mistreated, just misguided.
</P>
<P>
   While NBA players cling to the belief that it's their
inalienable right to get ever richer, there exists a group of poor
and disfranchised athletes who really could use someone like the
NBA players' union chief to stick his neck out for them.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about college student-athletes, a woefully
represented constituency. Inasmuch as their interests are
addressed, it is done by the NCAA, which is sort of like installing
NBA commissioner David Stern to serve the best interests of the
league's players in the current standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, no one seemed to be looking out for the Cal State
Northridge women's basketball team two years ago when a couple of
the players went to school officials with their suspicions that
coach Mike Abraham was using drugs. Neither athletic director Paul
Bubb nor associate athletic director Judy Brame took those concerns
to senior university officials. Deaf ears begat red faces last week
when Abraham was arrested on campus and charged with trafficking
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Bubb and Brame were relieved of their duties the other day but
not before university president Blenda Wilson sent a stinging
message to the women's basketball team. By failing to offer a
comment on Abraham's arrest in the hysterical hours immediately
after it happened, she basically told the players that their
comfort was not her concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Auburn University football team also has reason to wonder
who's acting in its best interest in the aftermath of coach Terry
Bowden's abrupt resignation two weeks ago. Bowden walked away from
his football team on the eve of the Eagles' game against Louisiana
Tech because he had it on good authority that he was going to be
fired at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden defended his actions, claiming, ``I felt I left
honorably.'' In that case, we want to be there to hear how he
describes a team of his that quits at halftime of a game it knows
it has no chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   When the going gets tough, the tough are left holding the bag of
manure. It's not exactly the life lesson we want young,
impressionable adults to glean from participation in collegiate
sports. Thankfully, at least one Auburn player cut right through
the hypocrisy of Bowden's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Tigers junior defensive end Leonardo Carson said of Bowden, ``He
left us out in the cold. He quit on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with underage drinking, it's a fact of life on college
campuses everywhere. Give up during a game and your butt will be on
the bench. Give up on a written commitment and your signature
surely will grace another school's contract.
</P>
<P>
   Think about it. If a student-athlete leaves one Division I
university for another, he or she likely will have to sit out a
season. Coaches, on the other hand, can pick up and leave at the
drop of a few hundred thousand dollars for another school _
including Rival U. _ without fear of retribution.
</P>
<P>
   The inequities don't end there. Student-athletes can be told
what brand of sneakers or sweats or singlets or swimsuits to wear
if their NCAA member institution has worked out a cushy endorsement
deal with a certain company. The way the arrangement usually works,
the school pockets millions of dollars and/or a coach gets a
sizable stipend and the student-athletes get the sportswear but not
one red cent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the NCAA's drug-testing policy. It allows an NCAA
representative to pay an unannounced visit to the campus of any
member institution and demand a urine sample from a football player
or track-and-field athlete. The coaches of those teams, however,
need not fret about having to submit to a drug test. The school
might require one of them as part of the job-screening process, but
after they're hired, they're free and clear.
</P>
<P>
   Many NCAA member institution schools have adopted their own
drug-testing procedures. Again, the targets are the student
athletes, not the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Schools presumably test the character of their coaches. The exam
is called a job interview and in an A-plus world it would be done
in tandem with a thorough background check. Obviously, though,
there are coaches who are passing muster, only to fail their
student-athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of pondering how best to crown a national champion in
football, NCAA member institutions ought to concentrate on drafting
a code of conduct for coaches. Demanding nothing less of them than
is asked of their student-athletes would be a start.

VAN RAAPHORST DOESN'T LIKE ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A week into USC's new quarterback system, it's
getting more difficult for designated backup Mike Van Raaphorst to
merely adopt a grin-and-bear-it philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real hard, not getting as many reps,'' Van Raaphorst
said. ``My timing's going (down the tubes).''
</P>
<P>
   As for adjusting his mindset to a reserve role after starting
the first eight games, that hasn't been any easier, even though he
clearly is freshman Carson Palmer's backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that I'll ever get into that mode,'' Van
Raaphorst said.
</P>
<P>
   Morton won't start: Tailback Chad Morton did not practice this
week, but insisted he will play against Stanford. Morton sprained
his left ankle on a run against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good,'' Morton said. ``They're not going to have me
start, but we'll see how much they let me play.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett said Petros Papadakis will make his
fourth start of the season, and Hackett will make a decision before
the game on Morton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through it all year,'' Hackett said. ``I'd like to
tell you I'm nervous but ... he feels like he's going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also said freshman Frank Strong will play on special
teams and at tailback if Morton is unavailable. Strong had dropped
down the depth chart because of problems with fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't lock him out forever,'' Hackett said. ``He's paid
his dues.''
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda out: Fullback Ted Iacenda, who has been bothered by a
shoulder he had surgery on last winter, will not play against
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to rest him,'' Hackett said. ``It's an aggravated
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Powell will remain the starter and be backed up by
Brennan Ochs.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kris Richard, who injured his shoulder against
Washington, will also sit out the game.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Matt Welch (hyperextended shoulder) will be
available.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno makes move: The improved of play of linebacker Zeke
Moreno means Mark Cusano will remain a backup even though he is
fully recovered from his sore thigh injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zeke's one of those guys who was not expected to play other
than a backup role,'' Hackett said. ``He may have played his best
game last week.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for kicking derby: Adam Abrams will handle the kicking
chores against Stanford after some thought had been given to
letting sophomore David Bell get a chance this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adam had a tremendous week of practice,'' special teams coach
Shawn Slocum said. ``It wasn't necessarily a competition. It was
more a point of focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Grain wins back position: Left guard Jason Grain, who lost his
starting position to Donte Kendrick for one game, will start
against Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``That has been a back-and-forth competition,'' Hackett said.
``The play of the left guard is great.''

TOO CLOSE TO CALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For Palmdale's Ron Hornaday Jr. and defending
series champion Jack Sprague, the 1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck title
comes down to one final race _ Sunday's Sam's Town 250 at the Las
Vegas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday, the 1996 series point champ and all-time win leader,
takes a 13-point lead into the confrontation on the 1.5-mile track.
The scant cushion means he must finish no worse than two places
behind Sprague to win the title. And if Sprague wins _ as he has
four times this season _ Hornaday must finish no worse than
runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday has won six times this season and is the series
all-time win leader with 23.
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday said the race will be exciting for fans, but he would
just as soon have the title wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to be a little further ahead in the points,'' he
said. ``But this is what you race for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornaday and Sprague have exchanged the lead several times
during the season, making it fitting that the season end in a
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like whenever he got a little lead, something would
break,'' Hornaday said. ``And it seems like the same thing has
happened to us. It's been a good battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Legend in the making: After all he's accomplished this season,
what could possibly be left for Jeff Gordon in the Winston Cup
finale Sunday at Atlanta?
</P>
<P>
   Well, for one thing, another victory will tie him with Richard
Petty for the most wins in a season in the modern era, 13. And
regardless how he finishes, he will end the season with the largest
point total in the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   Winston West, Featherlite season end: Local drivers cling to
small hope of making big comebacks at this week's season-ending
NASCAR Winston West and Featherlite Southwest tour events in Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia's Sean Woodside trails Palmdale's Kevin Harvick by 63
points and most hope for a bad race from his rival in Saturday's
Sam's Town 125. If Harvick finishes 13th or better, he locks up the
title of the 17-race series.
</P>
<P>
   Granada Hills' M.K. Kanke will be facing worse odds in the Sam's
Town 90 Southwest Tour race Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing leader Steve Portenga by 49 points and runner-up Bryan
Germone by 21, Kanke will be eliminated if Portenga finishes 10th
or better.
</P>
<P>
   Baja bound: After nine seasons driving on the CART and Indy
Racing League circuits, Mike Groff figured he knew as much as
anyone about driving long distances.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he had a dozen or more 500-mile starts under his
belt, including five Indy 500s.
</P>
<P>
   So when friend Marty Fiolka invited him to drive a 300-mile leg
of next week's SCORE Tecate Baja 1000, Groff eagerly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty called me up and said, `Do you want to go do Baja?'''
Groffsaid. ``I said, `That sounds like a deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   After a couple days of pre-race running south of the border,
Groff has a whole new appreciation for off-road racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, that's a man's race,'' said Groff, who drove
300 miles of the race course between the Pacific town of San
Quintin and the Sea of Cortez village of Bahia de Los Angeles.
``That 300 miles felt like about 1,000. It was pretty grueling.''
</P>
<P>
   Other drivers told Groff his portion of the race is the
roughest. The roads wind from San Quintin up into the desert
mountains that divide the Baja peninsula, then down again to Bahia
de Los Angeles, where another driver will take over.
</P>
<P>
   Groff had his Pennzoil racer up around 100 mph at some stretches
of the course. But he averaged only about 35 mph for the trip,
which took about eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some pretty tight turns up there,'' Groff said.
</P>
<P>
   After driving comparatively fragile Indy cars, Groff was
impressed by the durability of the Baja racers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing what those things will go over,'' he said.
``I went head-on into a boulder and then into a cactus and it just
kept on going.''
</P>
<P>
   Two things stopped Groff: a patch of sand he had to dig himself
out of and a flat tire sliced open by a sharp rock.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise he just kept rolling on _ and loving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a trip,'' said Groff, who will join some 300
other racers for the official start of the race next Thursday just
south of Ensenada. ``I tell you, that's really the wild west down
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bandits: The No Fear clothing company is not a sponsor of the
the Baja 1000, but it might want to consider lending its
appropriate moniker to the event in years to come.
</P>
<P>
   It seems participation in the event is up even though two race
teams were robbed and the driver of another team shot in pre-race
incidents before June's Baja 500.
</P>
<P>
   The three teams were confronted by gun-toting men Mexican
authorities say have been caught and are being prosecuted for the
crime, SCORE publicist Dominic Clark said. Driver Randy Ross was
hit by a shot when bandits began firing without warning as his car
came out of a river bed and up on a ridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had apparently tried to stop another team ahead of us and
the driver had outrun them,'' said Ross, who had his mother with
him. ``We came up out of a river bed and they just started
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the first shot went through his shorts and sweat suit
without injuring him. The second went high and the third ricocheted
into his leg after narrowly missing his mother.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he will not be back this year, partly because of the
incident, but does plan to return for other races.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the event has registered 250 racers so far, up from 221
last year. The race begins Thursday, with the fastest drivers
expected to finish on Friday.

BREEDERS' CUP FINE FOR FAVORITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I'm picking Skip Away to win the Breeders' Cup
Classic for a novel reason: He's the best horse.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a non-racegoer will probably ask, ``Don't you always try to
pick the best horse?'' Actually, no.
</P>
<P>
   That's one big difference between the typical day at the track
and the Breeders' Cup, the seven-race championship event that will
be held for the 15th time Saturday, at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   On the typical day at Santa Anita for example, the contenders in
the average race are familiar faces and might even have competed
against each other recently. A regular fan knows how good the
horses are and can compare them readily.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, a handicapper's basic challenge is to
figure out how the outcome of today's race might be different from
last week's race because of changes in track conditions, pace
scenarios, post positions, training patterns, jockey assignments
and other circumstances. The complexity sets racing apart from
other gambling sports.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the Breeders' Cup, finding the ``best horse'' in
each race is the name of the game. Horses arrive from all over the
globe, most to meet for the first time, so identifying the best
beforehand isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   But factors like track biases, tactical changes and starting
spots are even harder to analyze with precision when horses in the
same race come from such different environments as a bone-dry dirt
track at Santa Anita and a rain-softened turf course in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the trainer and jockey factors are diluted because the
handlers of Breeders' Cup horses are almost all competent and
there's no doubt everybody is trying to win since the purses are $1
million or bigger.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no surprise that the races more often go to the swift in
the Breeders' Cup, as reflected by the higher-than-normal 41
percent win rate for post-time favorites and the remarkable fact
that you could have made money in six of the past eight runnings
just by betting on the seven favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, picking the best horses doesn't have to mean going
along with the crowd. My top selections in the Breeders' Cup races
include only two horses who are favored on the Churchill Downs'
shaky morning line.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the races, in the order they'll be run:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Juvenile: &LR;  1. Answer Lively (Jerry Bailey riding), 2. Cat Thief
(Pat Day), 3. The Groom is Red (Corey Nakatani). Long shot: Daring
General (Alex Solis).
</P>
<P>
   The top pick is the only contender who has earned a 100 Beyer
speed figure, the standard for recent winners of this race for
2-year-old colts and geldings. He did it in a sprint at Louisiana
Downs, then came back to lose a photo finish to Cat Thief at
Keeneland in a race at this 11/16-mile distance in which he was the
only pacesetter to keep going.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Juvenile Fillies: &LR;  1. Silverbulletday (Gary Stevens), 2.
Excellent Meeting (Kent Desormeaux), 3. Confessional (Bailey). Long
shot: Emanating (Nakatani).
</P>
<P>
   There might not be much difference between the first and second
picks. But Bob Baffert, the trainer of both, clearly anointed
Silverbulletday his favorite by using Stevens and by sending her to
Kentucky for two summer victories at Churchill and a Breeders' Cup
warmup win at Keeneland.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sprint: &LR;  1. Affirmed Success (Jorge Chavez), 2. Reraise
(Nakatani), 3. Partner's Hero (Calvin Borel). Long shot: Richter
Scale (Shane Sellers).
</P>
<P>
   Voguish handicappers will pick against favored Affirmed Success,
because horses coming out of the 7-furlong Vosburgh Stakes at
Belmont Park usually flop in this 6-furlong race. But he's done
well at 6 furlongs before and he hasn't finished worse than second
this year in a division where such consistency is unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mile: &LR;  1. Desert Prince (Olivier Peslier), 2. Joyeaux Danseur
(Robby Albarado), 3. Labeeb (Desormeaux). Long shot: Among Men
(Stevens).
</P>
<P>
   Three-year-old Irish-bred Desert Prince stands out against his
European brethren, according to England's Timeform ratings. And
that's good enough for me, considering the historical success of
Eurohorses in this turf race.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Distaff: &LR;  1. Escena (Stevens), 2. Banshee Breeze (Bailey), 3.
Keeper Hill (Chris McCarron). Long shot: Kirby's Song (Todd Kabel).
</P>
<P>
   Banshee Breeze might be the day's heaviest favorite and properly
so. But throw out Escena's losses at Saratoga, where she's had
trouble before, and she's as good.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turf: &LR;  1. Daylami (Frankie Dettori), 2. Royal Anthem (Stevens),
3. Chief Bearhart (Jose Santos). Long shot: Caitano (Andrasch
Starke).
</P>
<P>
   A lot of good horses aren't among the four named above. Man o'
War Stakes winner Daylami is as good as anybody in this upset-prone
race if the colt's recent travel schedule _ England to New York to
England to Kentucky _ hasn't knocked him out.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Classic: &LR;  1. Skip Away (Bailey), 2. Silver Charm (Stevens), 3.
Gentlemen (Nakatani). Long shot: Victory Gallop (Solis).
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs oddsmaker Mike Battaglia is regarded as
something of a sage in Kentucky. Well, that's Kentucky for you.
Battaglia is the worst morning-line writer at any major track and
he's raised eyebrows again by making Silver Charm an 8-5 favorite
and Skip Away a 9-5 second choice.
</P>
<P>
   If his reasoning is that Silver Charm (winner of the 1997
Kentucky Derby) likes the Churchill surface better than Skip Away
(12th in the '96 Derby) does, that's overanalysis based on too
little evidence. Look at the past year and you'll pick Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   He's the best horse.
</P>
<P>
   A WEEK AT THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Oak Tree leaders: &LR;  Jockeys (through Wednesday): Alex Solis, 25
winners; Laffit Pincay, 20; Kent Desormeaux and Chris McCarron, 17;
Gary Stevens, 14. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 16; Ron McAnally, 9; Neil
Drysdale, Mike Mitchell and Jenine Sahadi, 8. &UR;  &QL; 
Handicapper helper: &LR;  Churchill Downs' reputation as a fair racing
surface is supported by the results of the Breeders' Cups held at
the Louisville, Ky., track in 1988, '91 and '94. Dirt and turf
races have been won by front-runners and stretch runners, by horses
from inside and outside posts, and by horses who prepped in five
states and three foreign countries. &UR;  &QL; 
Upcoming stakes: &LR;  At Santa Anita: Saturday, $100,000 Morvich
Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 6{ furlongs on turf; Sunday, $500,000
Yellow Ribbon, fillies and mares 3 and up, 1\ miles on turf;
Monday, $100,000 Louis R. Rowan Handicap, fillies and mares 3 and
up, 1 mile on turf. At Hollywood Park: Wednesday, $70,000 Steinlen
Handicap, 3 and up, 11/16 miles. At Churchill Downs: Saturday,
seven Breeders' Cup races, with purses totaling more than $13
million. &UR;  &QL; 
Mileposts: &LR;  The 30th Oak Tree Racing Association season at Santa
Anita wraps up Monday after a weekend headed by the Yellow Ribbon
on Sunday. The 18th Hollywood Park winter meet opens Wednesday at
12:30 p.m. and runs for 31 days through Dec. 21.... The Yellow
Ribbon, one of the biggest races for turf fillies and mares, is
expected to draw a field of 10 that includes division leader
Fiji.... Expelled was assigned top weight of 119 pounds among 10
horses in the Morvich Handicap, the live feature at Santa Anita on
Breeders' Cup day. The track will open its gates Saturday at 7:45
a.m. The first live race is scheduled for 9:25 and the first
Breeders' Cup race at 10:25. Santa Anita won't have a pick-six that
day because the Breeders' Cup features a national pick-six with a
guaranteed $5 million pool.... Laffit Pincay, second in the Oak
Tree jockey standings, has a shot at his first title since the 1991
Hollywood Park summer season. His chances are enhanced by the fact
he'll be riding while the other leaders go out of town for the
Breeders' Cup.... Fellow horsemen will hold a wake for Willard
Proctor at 5:30 p.m. Monday at Santa Anita Golf Course. Proctor,
82, died last week at his Santa Anita barn.... Churchill Downs made
Forbes magazine's list of the ``200 Best Small Companies in
America'' for the second straight year.... Bad economic signs of
the week: Yakima (Wash.) Meadows apparently is going out of
business after 37 years. Its current meeting is closing early this
weekend. And Suffolk Downs, near Boston, is selling an eighth of
its land to a developer.... Unrelated: A Yakima exercise rider,
Hugo D. Rivera, 22, died of head injuries after being thrown from a
horse last weekend.... Maryland trainer Dale Mills was suspended
for 75 days because the prohibited drug clenbuterol showed up in
the post-race test of Testafly after the horse finished third in
the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park.

A LITTLE SOLIS GOES A LONG WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART WILSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ When it comes to riding a thoroughbred, Alex
Solis is as confident as any of the top jockeys. He'll match his
ability atop a horse against any of the bigger-name riders.
</P>
<P>
   Solis has enjoyed more than his share of success. He won the
1986 Preakness aboard Snow Chief, rode Dare and Go to a 35-1 upset
of Cigar in the 1996 Pacific Classic at Del Mar and has won 10
riding titles in Southern California, becoming the first jockey
since Chris McCarron in 1982-83 to win six consecutive riding
championships at local tracks.
</P>
<P>
   And Solis, a 34-year-old native of Panama, leads the current Oak
Tree meeting at Santa Anita going into the final weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all there has been a void, a significant statistic
that Solis would like to erase Saturday when horsemen from around
the world meet at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., for the 15th
running of the Breeders' Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Solis has been aboard 23 Breeders' Cup starters, but he has
never visited the winner's circle, never raised his whip in
celebration or talked about the thrill of winning one of the seven
races. He knows the excitement, the anticipation of riding in the
Breeders' Cup. Now he wants to taste victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day of the races, it's such a great feeling, there's such
a great electricity,'' Solis said. ``You're on cloud nine. And
everybody knows what it takes to win a race like this, everybody's
pushing it to the limit. It's just so prestigious, and the whole
world will be watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Solis has finished second four times, including twice in 1991 at
Churchill Downs. That year he was beaten in the Juvenile Fillies in
a photo finish aboard La Spia, who jumped a shadow while leading.
He ran second in the Juvenile aboard Bertrando, who ran into a
monster named Arazi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing when horses run strong like that and you
still get beat,'' Solis said. ``I really thought I had a big shot
with both of those horses, but it just didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Solis' agent, Scott McClellan, offers a theory on why the rider
has struggled in the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you look back, I doubt he's ridden too many horses
that were the favorites, or the second choice,'' McClellan said.
``He's probably riding the third, fourth, fifth or sixth choice.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the Breeders' Cup is so competitive, so
contentious, that it's difficult for even the talented riders to
secure live mounts. There just are not enough to go around.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, you've got seven races,'' McClellan said.
``Let's say there's an average of 12 horses a race. That's 85
horses riding each day. Of those 85, every jockey in America wants
to ride those horses. And you've got Jerry Bailey, (Gary) Stevens
and McCarron probably riding six or seven of those races. (Corey)
Nakatani rides six or seven. All of a sudden you add it up and
there isn't a lot of choices left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't that he's not capable of winning those races. He's
very capable of winning on any kind of horse anytime.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Solis: ``There are a lot of factors involved. The horse is
80 percent, then you have to factor in the luck, how well the
trainer has prepared the horse and how well I do my job as a
jockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Solis was named on four Breeders' Cup horses when post positions
were drawn Wednesday morning. He'll be aboard Daring General in the
Juvenile, Kona Gold in the Sprint, Hawksley Hill in the Mile and
Victory Gallop in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   There are no morning-line favorites among the group. No second,
third or fourth choices, either. But Solis, sitting in the jockeys'
room between races at Santa Anita, was enthusiastic about his
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Daring General: ``I've worked him twice and I love the way he's
training,'' Solis said. ``He's got such a long stride that I think
he's going to take to the distance (1 1/16 miles). And I have a
good feeling that he will like the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Kona Gold: ``He was so impressive at Del Mar, then he got bumped
around in his last race here (the Ancient Title Breeders' Cup
Handicap). I really think if he had not had trouble in the Ancient
Title, he'd be one of the favorites in the Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawksley Hill: ``He's awesome. He'll be coming from behind, so
it takes a lot of concentration to make the right decisions. That's
my job. If we get a good trip ... he's a nice horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Victory Gallop: ``What can I say? He's one of the best. I won
the Arkansas Derby with him this year and he won the Belmont with
Gary Stevens. He's got a great future and Elliott Walden has done a
great job with the horse. I think he'll be 100 percent ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results, Solis says the sun will still rise the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things will turn for me,'' he said. ``Hopefully I'll get lucky
and do it. Just like anything else in life, you've got to earn
it.''

COURTNALL RETURNS TO SCENE OF THE CRIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Public Enemy No. 1 sat in the Forum stands
Thursday morning, unconcerned by the prospect of facing the victims
of his alleged misdeed of six months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys try to get me every game,'' St. Louis Blues winger Geoff
Courtnall said before Thursday night's game against the Los Angeles
Kings. ``I'm used to it. It's just the way I play. I play to win
every night. It's just something that happened. I don't really look
back on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the first visit to Los Angeles for the Blues
since they swept the Kings in the first round of last season's
playoffs. A big reason for the sweep was a play by Courtnall in the
third period of Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings ahead, 3-0, Courtnall crashed into goalie Jamie
Storr, who suffered a concussion when his head hit the goal post.
No penalty was called, but Kings defenseman Sean O'Donnell pounced
on Courtnall and was assessed a five-minute major. The Blues scored
four goals on the ensuing power play and won Game 3, for all
intents and purposes ending the Kings' season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the replay, Storr stepped in front of me,''
Courtnall said. ``I was trying to get to O'Donnell. If I wanted to
run him over, I would have probably knocked him out cold. I tried
to go around him and he just leaned out in front of me and there
was nothing I could do because I was going so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said he has no regrets about his actions that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long time ago,'' O'Donnell said. ``As far as I'm
concerned, it's over. A lot of times I ask myself, `What could I
have done differently?' I still think it was the right move. It
just didn't turn out right. Jamie set the puck up and (Courtnall)
leaned into him. He hit the goalie. That's part of what makes him
so good. He's not only a scorer. He gets under your skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Glad to be back: Center Ian Laperriere returned to the lineup
after missing nine games with a partially torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings lost winger Steve McKenna indefinitely to an
abdominal strain after he engaged in a first-period tussle with St.
Louis' Tony Twist.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of his recovery period, Laperriere said, came
when the Kings were on their recent five-game trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys were on the road for 11 days and it was the worst 11
days of my life,'' Laperriere said. ``I missed these guys. In the
winter, these guys are my family and I just want to be around them.
I was not a happy camper.''

KINGS TIE BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ On a night when it seemed there were as many
scouts in the Forum as there were fans, the Los Angeles Kings
finally remembered how to score, but gave up twice as many
power-play goals as they had in their first 11 games combined.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 2-2 tie Thursday night with the St. Louis Blues
before an announced crowd of 10,496 that watched 19-year-old center
Olli Jokinen record his first NHL point in his first game with the
Kings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jokinen's promising performance, the Kings' winless
streak reached three, all on their current four-game homestand,
which ends Saturday night against the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The power play continued to struggle, and Manny Legace had to
stop Kings nemesis Geoff Courtnall on a partial breakaway in the
final five seconds of regulation to preserve the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Kings had a number of solid scoring opportunities,
they failed to score more than two goals in a game for the ninth
time in their 12 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder rumors abound of a possible trade to boost the
struggling attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kings management denies a major trade is close, but speculation
is unavoidable given the team's offensive woes and considering the
presence in the stands Thursday of scouts from 13 teams _ about
double the number at a typical game.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, the Kings (4-5-3) didn't have to wait long to
avoid being shut out for the third straight game. A Luc Robitaille
goal 6:16 into the game ended their scoreless drought at 132
minutes, 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And they only had to wait five more minutes for Jokinen to notch
his first NHL point, an assist on a goal by Glen Murray that gave
the Kings a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jokinen carried the puck out of the corner and passed the puck
into the slot to Robitaille, whose shot was deflected by Murray
past St. Louis goalie Jamie McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   But though they had their chances, the Kings would not score
again, and _ for the record _ their current drought stands at
53:31.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues (5-3-3) battled back in the second period, helped by
an ill-advised slashing penalty to Rob Blake at the end of the
first period and an equally undisciplined cross-checking penalty to
Sean O'Donnell early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Pavol Demitra scored with a two-man advantage 41
seconds into the second period, and Al MacInnis scored with a
5-on-4 skating edge 1:39 later, tying the score. Before Demitra's
goal, the Kings had killed 44 consecutive penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Kings management has been steadfast in its insistence that a
trade for a high-scoring forward will not be made at severe cost to
the team's methodical rebuilding project.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a deal we could make that made hockey sense, we'd
go ahead and do it,'' team president Tim Leiweke said. ``Right now,
is there something imminent? No.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the New York Islanders (unsigned winger Zigmund
Palffy), Pittsburgh Penguins (unsigned center Petr Nedved) and
Vancouver Canucks (disgruntled winger Pavel Bure) were all
represented at Thursday's game. The financially strapped Penguins
also are rumored to be considering unloading star forward Jaromir
Jagr's huge contract.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Calgary Flames might trade star forward Theo
Fleury, who will be an unrestricted free agent after the season.
The Flames did not have a scout at Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' need for a marquee offensive player has been a topic
ever since plans to move into a new arena next season were
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Larry Robinson said: ``If you're going into a new
building, it's nice to go into a new building with a marquee
player, no doubt about it. Our plan has always been not to give up
the farm just to get a marquee player. We've worked very, very hard
at building a strong franchise and we've done that through our
drafting and being patient with our young kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of those things have changed. But I think if
the right situation came around where you could get a marquee
player and not hurt your club, you'd be stupid not to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor said: ``I'm not going to make any
comments on potential trades. Like we have been for a long time,
we're always looking to upgrade the team.''

KINGS TIE BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ On a night when it seemed there were as many
scouts in the Forum as there were fans, the Los Angeles Kings
finally remembered how to score, but allowed twice as many
power-play goals as they had in their first 11 games combined.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 2-2 tie Thursday night with the St. Louis Blues
before an announced crowd of 10,496 that watched 19-year-old center
Olli Jokinen record his first NHL point in his first game with the
Kings this season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jokinen's promising performance, the Kings' winless
streak reached three, all on their current four-game homestand,
which ends Saturday night against the Dallas Stars.
</P>
<P>
   The struggling power play went 0 for 6, and Manny Legace had to
stop Kings nemesis Geoff Courtnall on a partial breakaway in the
final five seconds of regulation to preserve the tie.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kings coach Larry Robinson was happier than he's been in
awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played with a lot more emotion,'' he said. ``There was a
lot more traffic in front of the net. Our goals were the result of
having people go to the net. We came out and played physical.
That's our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, rumors abound of a possible trade to boost the struggling
attack, which had failed to produce a goal in three of the previous
four games. Kings management denies a major trade is close, but
speculation is unavoidable given the team's offensive woes and
considering the presence in the stands Thursday of scouts from 13
teams _ about double the number at a typical game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a deal we could make that made hockey sense, we'd
go ahead and do it,'' team president Tim Leiweke said. ``Right now,
is there something imminent? No.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the New York Islanders (unsigned winger Zigmund
Palffy), Pittsburgh Penguins (unsigned center Petr Nedved) and
Vancouver Canucks (disgruntled winger Pavel Bure) were all
represented at Thursday's game. The financially strapped Penguins
also are rumored to be considering unloading star forward Jaromir
Jagr's huge contract.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Calgary Flames might trade star forward Theo
Fleury, who will be an unrestricted free agent after the season.
The Flames did not have a scout at Thursday's game.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dave Taylor said: ``I'm not going to make any
comments on potential trades. Like we have been for a long time,
we're always looking to upgrade the team.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the performance of the Kings (4-5-3) against the Blues
(5-3-3) represented something of an upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   It took only 6:16 for a goal by Luc Robitaille to end the Kings'
scoring drought, which had lasted for 132 minutes, 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   And the Kings only had to wait five more minutes for Jokinen to
notch his first NHL point, an assist on a goal by Glen Murray that
gave the Kings a 2-0 lead. Jokinen, who played 20:42 and had four
shots on goal, carried the puck out of the corner and passed the
puck into the slot to Robitaille, whose shot was deflected by
Murray past St. Louis goalie Jamie McLennan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the game, I was a little nervous,'' said Jokinen, a
native of Finland. ``It's normal. For the first 10 minutes, I was a
little afraid to play my own game. After that, I see those guys and
think, `I can play at that level.' I started skating and hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues battled back in the second period, helped by an
ill-advised slashing penalty to Rob Blake, the team's captain, at
the end of the first period and an equally undisciplined
cross-checking penalty to Sean O'Donnell early in the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your leader,'' Robinson, with a thin smile, said of
Blake. ``And we certainly want him on the ice. You look at the
other side. You don't see a (Al) McInnis or a (Chris) Pronger in
the penalty box. But Blakey is emotional. I'd just like to see him
pick his spots a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis' Pavol Demitra scored with a two-man advantage 41
seconds into the second period, and MacInnis scored with a 5-on-4
skating edge 1:39 later, tying the score.
</P>
<P>
   Before Demitra's goal, the Kings had killed 44 consecutive
penalties, but it was the penalties _ not the penalty killing _
that prevented them from winning Thursday.

HORSES' EARNINGS CAN BE MISLEADING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ If Skip Away finishes third or better in
tomorrow's Breeders' Cup Classic _ a likely occurrence _ he will
become the first racehorse to exceed $10 million in career
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   He will surpass Cigar, and will retire with earnings nearly
twice that of John Henry and Alysheba, and about 10 times that of
Secretariat. His bankroll also will tower over that collected by
legendary geldings Kelso and Forego, who each made slightly less
than $2 million in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But what does that tell us?
</P>
<P>
   ``It obviously doesn't mean anything to the horse,'' said Sonny
Hine, Skip Away's trainer. ``But it means something to us. We've
already known this, but hopefully it will assure `Skippy' a place
in history as one of the best horses of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Hine is correct. However, simply because Skip Away and
Cigar have made more money than any other racehorses doesn't
indicate that their talents exceed or even match those of other
all-time greats.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings tell us is Skip Away and Cigar were talented enough
to dominate rivals, and lucky enough to be born at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation isn't limited to the consumer price index. Purses in
horse racing _ particularly in stakes races _ have increased
dramatically, so using earnings to compare runners of different
generations is as foolish as declaring that Mark McGwire is a
better home-run hitter than Babe Ruth was because his salary is
higher.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1966, the year Kelso was retired, the average
stakes purse was $20,773. By 1996, the average purse was $73,001.
</P>
<P>
   The rich Breeders' Cup series, created in 1984, contributed to
that rise. But even if those seven races are removed from the
statistics, the 1996 average still comes in at $69,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before Skip Away tried unsuccessfully last month for his third
consecutive victory in the Jockey Gold Cup, Hine said the race
meant a lot to him because Kelso had been his favorite horse. Kelso
won the Gold Cup five consecutive years by an average margin of
almost six lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso makes a perfect case study. He earned $351,135 for his
1960-64 victories in the Gold Cup, which then carried a
$100,000-added purse. If he had won those races in 1994-98, he
would have earned $2.7 million. The Gold Cup purse has been $1
million guaranteed the past three years, $600,000 to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Applying a similar purse modernization to Kelso's other wins,
such as the Woodward (three times) and the Whitney (three times),
his adjusted earnings would vault to the neighborhood of $8.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, this was before the Breeders' Cup Classic. Kelso
was a unanimous horse of the year for five consecutive years, and
at level weights, each of those years he would have been a
overwhelming favorite in the Classic, had it existed. Projecting
four Classic wins and a second, another $9 million can
realistically be added to the tally.
</P>
<P>
   That arithmetic brings Kelso's hypothetical modern-day winnings
to $17.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The ``fantasy'' earnings of other famous horses can be estimated
in this fashion, too.
</P>
<P>
   How much could one of the most sensational horses in history
earn in today's market? Citation swept through 1948 with 19 wins in
20 starts, including the Triple Crown. He made only $1,085,760, a
record at the time. A purse equalization puts those wins at $4.4
million in 1998 purse dollars. Now add the $5 million Triple Crown
bonus that today's 3-year-olds are offered, and further assume that
Citation would have galloped in the Breeders' Cup Classic. That
adds up to $12.2 million ``in one year.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't belabor the issue by including Citation's 2-year-old
championship year, which probably would have been capped in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Or mention his respectful but less
successful comeback years in 1950 and 1951, all of which could have
pushed him into the $15 million range.
</P>
<P>
   And to avoid getting too complicated, we're pretending that the
$4 million Dubai World Cup doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   One doesn't have to delve that far back into the record books to
come up with interesting applications.
</P>
<P>
   The ageless John Henry was a four-time champion grass horse and
also twice horse of the year. He made $6.5 million, but massaging
the numbers brings his winnings to $12.3 million. Add more if you
wish, since he never had a chance to compete in even one Breeders'
Cup Turf, which offers about $1 million to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring where Secretariat ranks requires a more subjective
approach. He comes in at about $13.2 million for his
horse-of-the-year campaigns in 1972 and 1973. That includes
hypothetical victories in the Juvenile and Classic, and the $5
million Triple Crown bonus. It also assumes that the Marlboro Cup
race created in 1973 to showcase he and stablemate Riva Ridge would
have been a $1 million purse in today's racing economy; a
quarter-century ago, it was $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up several other points to toss around.
</P>
<P>
   If a once-in-a-lifetime horse like Secretariat or Citation came
along today, he would almost certainly be the subject of bidding
wars by racetracks. That would cause potential winnings to increase
by an even greater factor.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, recall that Secretariat was retired after his
3-year-old season. In today's purse environment, wouldn't his
syndication have been tempted to run him again as a 4-year-old, or,
like Skip Away and probably Silver Charm, at age 5?
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, a $20 million horse might not be that far in front
of us. The possibilities are almost bright enough to make one raise
an arm at the next yearling auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for Skip Away to break the record,'' said Bill
Mott, who trained Cigar. ``I knew Cigar's record would be broken,
and if Skip Away sets a new record, that'll be broken, too. It
might not take very long, either.
</P>

STARS HOPE TO KICK-START OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ A kick in the rear would do the Stars good,
winger Brett Hull said. And there's nobody like the San Jose Sharks
and their rowdy fans to deliver just that boot.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars continued their schizophrenic ways Wednesday night,
losing a 4-0 game to the Sharks, now 2-6-2. And while no team in
the NHL has a better record than the Stars at 6-2-2 (.700
points-won percentage), it's clear this team hasn't found the
chemistry coach Ken Hitchcock has been seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just a lack of concentration,'' Hull said. ``It's
tough for me \Rto say\S, because I'm the new guy, but I think it's
a situation where we're getting a little too big for our britches.
We're 6-2-2, but we haven't played a whole bunch of good games.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said the team's successful power play and ``sometimes
spectacular goaltending'' have masked early-season problems, and
that those problems have been exposed in key games by hard-working
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we really need is a shot of reality and a kick in
the \Rrear\S,'' Hull said. ``Because I don't think we're looking at
ourselves realistically.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock yesterday put the team through an intense practice and
promised more of the same ``for the balance of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not putting enough in, and we are not getting enough
out,'' Hitchcock said. ``As coaches we have to become more
demanding.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were outworked early by the Sharks and surrendered two
goals in the first 4 minutes, 9 seconds. Goalie Ed Belfour, who
entered the game with a 1.70 goals-against average, allowed three
goals on six shots before being pulled midway through the second
period. Ironically, the Stars set a franchise record by holding the
Sharks to nine shots for the game _ the previous record was 11 set
twice last season _ but it was clear from the start that the Sharks
would simply play suffocating defense and chip the puck down the
ice once they took the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more important was that the Stars were able to take only
21 shots and were 0-for-7 on the power play _ the second
consecutive game in which they have been shut out with the man
advantage. The Stars averaged almost two power-play goals a game
through the first seven contests, and now are struggling to get
their offense going when they aren't assured of two freebies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our power play has been great, but it can't carry us, and
we've talked about that before,'' winger Grant Marshall said.
``This isn't new stuff. When you go out and know the game plan and
still don't take it to the ice, that's terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Shawn Chambers said the Stars have been getting away
with inconsistent play all season, and that the victories have
masked their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it, but now we really know it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly most upsetting Wednesday was that the Stars were not up
for a game against the rival Sharks in the San Jose Arena, where
motivation shouldn't be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, we're playing stupid, and that's bad enough, but we're
not even playing hard,'' Marshall said. ``That's just not us;
that's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars might have had a letdown after beating the defending
Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings on Saturday, but captain
Derian Hatcher said the problem dates to the beginning of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``For one, I think we've had two successful seasons, and we're
not going to surprise anyone. Teams get up for us,'' Hatcher said.
``And ... we probably think we're a little better than we are.''

MINNESOTA'S GOVERNOR-  ELECT IN NO RUSH TO RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE RUBENSTEIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    ST. PAUL, Minn. _ The good, slightly bewildered people of
Minnesota tried Thursday to figure out exactly what they had gotten
themselves into by voting to become Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura's
tag-team partner for the next four years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yes, there were still wrasslin' jokes being tossed around
beneath the gleaming state Capitol, a dome nearly as shiny as the
one between the governor-elect's shoulders. There were cracks about
Jesse poundin' the pundits and Jesse body-slammin' the big boys and
Jesse pummelin' the political establishment like it was Hulk
Hogan's raw flesh and the silver belt was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard to find anyone laughing in St. Paul Thursday.
The laughing is over. Now it is time for the former pro wrestler to
slip off the tights and the feather boa and start governin'.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, however, was not in the governin' mood. He spent the
day holed up at his horse ranch west of town, with a pair of state
troopers guarding the gate and his mother-in-law screening calls.
Meanwhile, his transition office was not doing a lot of
transitionin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't told us anything,'' said a lone secretary dispatched
to answer Ventura's phone in the Capitol basement and scribble
messages on pink papers that no one from Ventura's staff was
picking up.
</P>
<P>
   Most governors-elect have the quaint notion that they ought to
hit the ground running. This view is apparently not shared by Jesse
the Body. His transition office, a cobbled-together suite just down
a concrete corridor from the furnace room, had no transition team
in it, just the secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has named no transition director or staff. He has not
designated a spokesman. Three days after voters rang the bell,
Jesse the Body is still in a neutral corner.
</P>
<P>
   When Ventura's campaign chairman, Dean Barkley, was asked if the
governor-elect would show up Thursday morning for a political
meeting of his supporters at the Capitol, the chairman said he
didn't know where Ventura was and didn't know anything about any
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Well, a Chronicle reporter told him, it's in Room 181.
</P>
<P>
   ``You seem to know a lot,'' said Barkley, who between campaigns
runs a local car wash. ``How would you like to be our press
spokesman?'' (The offer was declined.)
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Ventura did drop by the Capitol, it being on the
way to the sports bar where he does his radio talk show. He met
with the outgoing governor and took hold of a stack of documents
that had been prepared for him. He shuffled them in his hands and
he placed the stack on a table. He did not, however, read them.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Minnesotans came to the Capitol to see if Ventura
would show up again. But Ventura had already been there and done
that, and there were horses to take care of.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voted for him because he can't screw it up worse than anyone
else,'' said Carol Parker, standing inside the hallowed rotunda
where trod the likes of Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, Eugene
McCarthy and other people that Ventura could probably beat up.
</P>
<P>
   High overhead was a classical frieze depicting a half-naked
Minnesota pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got good quadriceps,'' said Capitol tour guide Jeanne
Blomberg, comparing them to a photo of Ventura's in the morning
paper. ``Hard to say whose are better.''
</P>
<P>
   The front page also depicted an enormous close-up of the back of
Ventura's shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minnesota, Meet Your Head of State,'' it said, and a lot of
people in the lunchroom laughed when they saw it, but not too loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son voted for Ventura, but I didn't,'' said the woman
scooping out scrambled eggs. ``He bet me $40 that Jesse would win.
I lost.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a voting pattern that went to the heart of Ventura's
improbable victory. Ventura, the nominee of Ross Perot's Reform
Party, found strength from young voters, men, working people,
disaffected Republicans, disenchanted Democrats and the vague but
unmistakable Populist-based bent of Minnesotans to rock the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Pummeled by Ventura with everything but a folding chair were his
two opponents in the race _ state Attorney General Hubert ``Skip''
Humphrey, the son of the former vice president, and St. Paul Mayor
Norm Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   While Ventura lay low, Capitol watchers were grumbling that
Ventura did not yet seem to be doing much of anything, and that he
may find that being governor is less fun and more work than
campaigning for it.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling the Capitol halls was the respected state finance
commissioner Wayne Simoneau, who has seen the lay of the land and,
for the past 72 hours, has taken to calling himself Wayne the
Brain. He said he could not understand why Ventura has not gotten
down to business and installed a transition team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were me, I'd have a crew over there,'' he said. ``But
they represent a party I know nothing about, other than they have a
crazy old aunt locked up in a closet someplace,'' paraphrasing a
line by Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Party chairwoman Diane Goldman was trying to be sane and
statesmanlike.
</P>
<P>
   She invited key Reform Party leaders to the Capitol in the
apparent hope that Ventura, the head of the party in more ways than
one, would show up. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   So Goldman passed out copies of the party platform instead.
Apparently, few people had ever cast eyes on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I recall Jesse said that he had no problem with
it,'' Goldman said, which, while not the ringingest of
endorsements, was consistent with the fact that she does not get
much face time with the 6-foot-4 Ventura, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm short,'' she said. ``It's real hard to get near him.''
</P>
<P>
   The only people Ventura got near Thursday were photographers
from a pair of weekly newsmagazines, who were granted an audience
because they said they were going to put Ventura's picture on their
covers. That was good enough to gain them admittance to the barn,
if not the main house, as Ventura admits to having a thing about
the press.
</P>
<P>
   If there was no Jesse the Body to gaze upon Thursday, at least
there was plenty to talk about on the talk radio shows that were a
keystone of the campaign in the lean early months. That was before
there was money for the cutesy Jesse-the-Thinker TV commercials,
with their good guys and bad guys that were at least as much a
morality play as anything in the wrestling ring.
</P>
<P>
   For hours on the radio, the talk was all Jesse, with occasional
breaks for news reports about soybean futures (up 6 cents) and hog
bellies (down $1.02). Jesse's neighbors called, Jesse's wrestling
fans called, even Jesse's high school history teacher called.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very open to compromise on the student council,'' the
teacher said. ``And the football team always won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us hope for the best,'' piped in the show's host, adding
that Ventura is scheduled to be a guest on the show, sometime in
the future, maybe, if Ventura remembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna have Jesse on tomorrow, or Monday I think,'' the
host said. ``We hope. I dunno.''

 What Do BioTime Investors See That the Rest of World Doesn't?  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Pity the poor shareholders of BioTime.
<P>
   If these investors are innocents, they are over their heads. And
if they are experienced stockpickers, they must not be very good at
what they do because the Berkeley biotech concern is most
definitely not going to be the next Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have I encountered such a mean-spirited,
contemptible bunch of so-called readers. And that includes a number
of thin-skinned chief executives of major companies who haven't
always agreed with what I've written over the years.
</P>
<P>
   I say ``so-called'' because judging by their missives, they
don't seem to read the columns or articles they are criticizing
(nor do they even convey their threats very articulately).
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a critical column about BioTime.
It was not the first time. I wrote a bearish piece for the Wall
Street Journal earlier this year on the company, as have other
financial journalists over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Why beat a dead horse?
</P>
<P>
   Because there still are lessons to be learned. Investing in
development-stage companies that post no profits for several years
is risky business. Innocent people lose their money on pretenders
every day. And investors who hold BioTime until the end will join
them. BioTime is not likely to be a long-term winner.
</P>
<P>
   The product it is developing, Hextend, a starch and water
solution that is mixed with blood during surgery, is comparable to
several products already on the market. &UR;  &LR; The company's clinical
trials are not intended to prove anything beyond what other
products can already perform.
</P>
<P>
   Management has been cagey. In the company's initial offering
prospectus, the company called the product a ``blood substitute.''
Medical doctors said there are no such things as blood substitutes.
When I pressed on this issue for the earlier article, management
blamed the investment bankers for using the wrong term.
</P>
<P>
   While doing research for that same article, I asked Chairman
Paul Segall in an interview some questions about his previous
experience as an executive at a company called Trans Time. When I
asked Segall what positions he held at Trans Time, a cryonics
practice that freezes body parts, he said he wasn't sure.
Seriously. He couldn't remember specifically what titles he held
nor his tenure. (A Trans Time Web site indicates that Segall helped
incorporate the company.)
</P>
<P>
   And you wonder why BioTime has credibility problems?
</P>
<P>
   Now, in fairness, BioTime President Ronald Barkin has been very
accessible. He has called from the road a number of times while
I've been working on this column. However, what he says is as clear
as mud.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether BioTime has requested ``fast track'' new
drug review status for Hextend from the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, investors want to know whether Hextend has received
``priority review'' status under fast track guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is early approval for the product. Both ``fast track''
and ``priority review'' are specific terms used by the FDA,
according to an FDA spokeswoman. Prospects for early approval of a
new health care product can often give a stock a boost. BioTime
closed yesterday at $12.38, up dramatically from its 52-week low of
$5.88 on August 31.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if BioTime had been granted fast track status, Barkin
said: ``We have applied for an expedited review. We have not seen
any notification from the FDA.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ``expedited'' review can mean many things, but it is
not a specific request for fast track approval. The FDA is required
to notify companies in writing within 60 days of having asked for
fast track status. And if fast track has been granted, the FDA is
required to determine priority review status within six months of
the filing.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than six months since BioTime says it filed for
review. And Barkin says he still doesn't know what the status of
Hextend's review is. That doesn't jive.
</P>
<P>
   FDA sources say the review process is usually collaborative,
with frequent communication between the company and the
administration. In other words, Barkin should know by now whether
Hextend is in line to get early approval, which by the way, is
usually reserved for anti-cancer drugs or AIDS treatments.
</P>
<P>
   When asked repeatedly whether Hextend was granted priority
review status, Barkin replied: ``The company is optimistic and
hopeful that (approval) will take closer to six months than 18
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, standard approval status (let's call it slow track) takes
up to two years, and the six-month window for priority status has
already passed.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Barkin doesn't know by now that Hextend doesn't have
priority status, why doesn't he just ask the FDA?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, he doesn't want to hear the answer.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST DAY: From the better late than never file. Shares of UCBH
Holdings of San Francisco finally began trading yesterday on the
Nasdaq stock market. The stock, which was initially issued in a
private placement, was supposed to begin trading publicly about two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the move was delayed because shareholders opted to extend an
institutional road show, a UCBH spokeswoman says. UCBH is the bank
holding company for United Commercial Bank, a lender to ethnic
Chinese customers. Shares opened yesterday at $13.25 and closed at
$14.09.

 Mutuals Ordered to Show Supermarket Costs  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Mutual fund companies must disclose to investors the real costs of
selling shares through fund supermarkets, the wildly popular
brokerage programs for selling mutual funds, the Securities and
Exchange Commission has warned.
<P>
   Supermarket programs let investors buy and sell mutual fund
shares, often with no transaction fees, through their brokerage
accounts. Under this arrangement, mutual funds typically pay fees
to the brokers based on how much the brokers' customers have
invested in their funds.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter last week to the Investment Company Institute, the
trade group representing mutual funds, the SEC said fund companies
must clearly disclose what they pay brokers to sell shares in
supermarket programs. Specifically, the SEC said, mutual funds
can't hide the fees they pay brokers by jacking up the amounts they
pay to the investment advisers who manage funds.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates said the issue is important because many
investors are unaware that selling through supermarket programs
increases a mutual fund's expenses, thereby trimming returns to all
investors, including those who buy through supermarkets and those
who buy directly from the fund company.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket programs ``seem as if they're at no cost,'' said
Maria Scott of American Association of Individual Investors in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Since Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. started its One Source program in
1992, mutual fund supermarkets have grown explosively, attracting
$79 billion in investments by late 1997, according to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC's guidance to mutual funds hinges on a legal distinction
between sales costs and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   If mutual fund marketing, distribution and sales costs are paid
out of a fund's assets, the amount must be disclosed separately in
prospectuses and other fund reports, according to a rule known as
12b-1. Other costs, such as administration and payments to
advisers, can be lumped together and reported separately.
</P>
<P>
   When a mutual fund takes part in a supermarket program, the
fund's directors must figure how much of the fee they pay the
broker will be used to sell shares and how much will go to
administrative costs. The sales costs have to be included in their
12b-1 disclosures, the SEC advised.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter, the SEC said it would watch out for ``any
increase in a fund's investment advisory fee that appears to be for
the purpose of compensating the fund's investment adviser for
paying the fund's supermarket fee.''  &LR;

 Day Early, Dollar Short _ DigiCash Files Chapter 11  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DigiCash, whose system for making electronic cash payments failed
to win over consumers, banks and merchants, has become the latest
Internet company to hit the wall.
<P>
   The privately held Palo Alto software-maker filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection late Wednesday, capping a skid during which
its workforce fell from 50 early in the year to just six employees
who will oversee a restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   The company, now $4 million in debt, closed its only other
office, in Amsterdam, in September.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of DigiCash underscores the difficulty companies have
had trying to position electronic cash as an alternative to credit
cards for online shopping. Only one other proponent, CyberCash of
Reston, Va., has been even modestly successful, and it has yet to
turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite initial concerns about Internet security, consumers
appear increasingly willing to use their credit cards online to buy
everything from books to airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the cold truth is that there is no demand for
electronic cash right now. ``There could be way in the future, but
it's not something that anyone can possibly make money off of
today,'' said Erina DuBois of Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   DigiCash's electronic cash, called eCash, is paperless money
that can be transferred on the Internet. A computer user withdraws
eCash electronically from a bank that also subscribes to the
system. The digital dollars are stored on the user's hard drive and
then can be used in a transaction with an online merchant who
accepts eCash.
</P>
<P>
   A big selling point for the system is that it can be used for
online transactions too small for credit cards, such as $1 for
retrieving a news article. And shoppers don't have to divulge their
identity online because the money goes directly from their computer
to the merchant.
</P>
<P>
   The drawback is that everyone involved in a transaction must use
special eCash software _ an enormous obstacle to widespread
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a complicated infrastructure, and at this stage of
e-commerce, there's not enough support for it,'' said analyst Tim
Bajarin of San Jose's Creative Strategies.
</P>
<P>
   DigiCash said banks in Switzerland, Germany and Australia have
been using its system. But the only U.S. bank to embrace it _ Mark
Twain Bank in St. Louis _ halted its eCash trial in September.
</P>
<P>
   The number of online stores accepting eCash could not be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Scott Loftesness, who joined DigiCash in August as chief
executive in a last-ditch attempt to save the company, said the
real problem is that eCash was ahead of its time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels it's going to happen,'' he said, adding that
``it's just a question of time, money and the participation of some
big banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Since June, DigiCash has been surviving thanks to a bridge loan
from its initial investors _ August Capital, Applied Technology and
Gilde Investment, a Dutch firm.
</P>
<P>
   Loftesness said DigiCash may sell its assets or try to find a
partner willing to continue the development of eCash. ``We've got a
big portfolio of intellectual property that can be attractive to
some strategic players,'' he said.

 Banana Republic Spending Millions to Shed Safari Identity   By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Some companies have a skeleton in their closet. Banana Republic has
a jeep.
<P>
   The 280-store chain, a division of San Francisco's Gap Inc., has
more than tripled its advertising spending this year and introduced
its first catalog in nearly a decade. The impetus behind both
multimillion-dollar projects is that shoppers still associate the
clothier with its long-defunct travel theme, epitomized by the
safari jeep that was parked in each store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news, and the bad news, is that we have a very strong
heritage,'' said Amy Schoening, Banana's vice president of
marketing. ``Clearly the work we have to do is to clarify the brand
image to the customer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``out-of-Africa motif'' that Banana's phased out in the late
1980s, ``made a very strong impression on people that is really
tied into the name `Banana Republic,''' said San Francisco ad
executive Tom Bedecarre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as they have become a more upscale clothier, it has been
tough to shake loose that very strong imagery associated with that
unique name,'' said Bedecarre, chairman of Citron Haligman
Bedecarre.
</P>
<P>
   Market research has shown that shoppers have a much clearer idea
of the ``brand identity'' of Banana archrival J. Crew than they do
of Banana, even though New York's J. Crew has about one-fourth the
number of stores as Banana.
</P>
<P>
   Schoening declined to discuss J. Crew. But Banana executives
privately blame the J. Crew catalog, which bombards home mailboxes
with an estimated 100 million catalogs a year, for the difference
in brand awareness, according to people familiar with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Banana's response is a sophisticated-looking catalog that is
square-bound like a book rather than stapled in the middle like
most catalogs. It uses high-quality paper and is printed with a
matte finish, distinguishing it from the majority of catalogs,
which are glossy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is meant to be a keeper, it's one to keep on the coffee
table,'' said a local consultant who has worked with Banana and did
not want to be identified. The consultant estimated production
costs at a minimum of $1 per catalog, a steep price that does not
include shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Banana has mailed about a million of its catalogs and
distributed others through its stores and in unconventional venues
such as airport lounges. Schoening said she does not know the
number of catalogs distributed.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to disclose the cost of the mail-order effort,
which includes opening a 90,000-square-foot distribution center in
Grove City, Ohio, that employs 200 people.
</P>
<P>
   Banana's first television ads, which showcased suede clothing in
brown, beige and gray, ran in late September and October. Holiday
television spots will run between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
Outdoor and print ads are running simultaneously, including
prominent signs in the windows of every Banana store.
</P>
<P>
   Banana's advertising budget is three-and-a-half times higher
this year than last, said Schoening, declining to provide details.
Competitive Media Reporting estimates Banana spent $4.7 million on
ads in 1997, almost exclusively in magazines. That would put this
year's budget at about $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at building top-of-mind awareness of the
brand,'' said Schoening.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants believe people are more likely to seek out brands that
have top-of-mind awareness, which means that shoppers and potential
shoppers mention it without prompting when asked to name a clothing
store.
</P>
<P>
   Bedecarre said Banana should have bolstered its marketing
efforts years ago to clear up consumer confusion.
</P>
<P>
   But he and other experts said they are impressed with the lush
ads and the catalog, which deliver a consistent, upscale look and
appealing merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banana looks marvelous, they're doing a fabulous job,'' said
securities analyst Margaret Gilliam of Gilliam &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the retailer's muddled identity has not prevented it
from growing rapidly, including opening more than 40 new stores
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. analyst Richard Baum estimates Banana will
generate $1.2 billion in sales this year, up from $900 million in
1997. Sales at stores open at least a year, the benchmark for
retail success, will rise a healthy 11 percent this year, Baum
forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Banana was founded in 1978 as a catalog company. It had opened
two stores by the time Gap bought it in 1983. Gap discontinued the
catalog in 1989 and spent several years experimenting with Banana's
image and merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Banana introduced a line of pillows, picture frames
and other home furnishings made from materials, such as chenille
and silver, that mirror its clothing and jewelry lines.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 of Banana's 280 outlets now carry home goods; most of
the stores are not large enough. One role for the catalog will be
to sell home goods more broadly, said Banana spokeswoman Cindy
Capobianco.

TRUCK DRIVER CONFESSES TO GRISLY KILLINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLEN MARTIN, KEVIN FAGAN  
 and CHRISTOPHER HEREDIA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ A trucker walked into the sheriff's office
here, calmly confessed to killing at least four women and then
offered grisly evidence to back up his story, authorities said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had been sent by God, 36-year-old Wayne Adam Ford of
Arcata pulled a severed breast from his pocket, handed it to
officers and was promptly arrested, authorities said. He is being
held on $1 million bail and is scheduled to be arraigned Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   By late Thursday, authorities had linked Ford to bodies found
over the past year in San Bernardino, San Joaquin and Humboldt
counties. They were attempting to pinpoint the location of the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Interrogators said Ford, described by some as a quiet but odd
man, told them that while driving long-haul trucking routes, he
picked up hitchhikers, killed them and cut some into pieces. He
also told them he had driven truck routes through 14 Western States
_ raising the possibility that the alleged trail of killings may
grow, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his claims, Ford told police he had killed and dismembered
a still-unidentified woman whose torso was found by duck hunters in
Ryan Slough near Eureka in October 1997, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The breast Ford was carrying in a plastic bag did not come from
that torso, police said without elaboration. An arm was also found
in the slough at about the same time as the torso, but police have
been unable to trace it to any body.
</P>
<P>
   However, San Bernardino County sheriff's detectives said they
believe the breast may have come from the body of Patricia Anne
Tamez, a 29-year-old Victorville woman discovered floating in the
California Aqueduct on October 23. Ford implicated himself in the
killing, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Ford also told them he had dumped the body of
another of his victims near Interstate 5 outside Lodi _ and
authorities there believe his description of the crime matches the
discovery of the body of 25-year-old Lanett White of Fontana. Her
corpse was found last September in a canal off I-5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Humboldt County sheriff's deputies were taken by surprise
Tuesday night when Ford walked into their office with his sordid
tale and his compelling evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Ford explained that ``God told him to talk because he was
feeling bad,'' said Deputy Dennis Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was involved in serious criminal activity, and
said, `I have physical evidence on my body,' '' said Lewis. ``He
then produced human tissue which turned out to be a human breast.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said detectives believe Ford sexually assaulted the
victims during his attacks. Investigators are exploring the
possibility that Ford may have been killing people for several
years.
</P>
<P>
   They said Ford has a criminal record but they declined to give
details. They said he had been living in Arcata for some time and
had also lived in Big Bear in Southern California and in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Corrections said Ford has no state
prison record.
</P>
<P>
   Officers searched the trailer and several campsites where he
lived and ``found evidence that corroborates his testimony,'' said
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was working as a cement truck driver at Arcata Ready Mix
for about nine months until being laid off recently, and co-workers
there described him as ``quiet but not really weird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept his truck neat and was never dirty, but we all kind of
wondered what he was about,'' said one co-worker who asked not to
be identified. After being laid off, he was living on public
assistance, the co-worker said. He reportedly worked for a
long-haul trucking outfit before Arcata Ready Mix.
</P>
<P>
   Residents who saw him around town, however, said he was an
oddball who attracted notice with his strange ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd all see him around, looking kind of mangy and scary,''
said one worker at a nail salon in town. ``Everybody's just
appalled that this kind of thing could happen here. I mean, we've
had a few stray body parts around town lately that have had the
cops confused, but this is a college town and usually bad things
don't happen here.''
</P>
<P>
   Humboldt State University is in Arcata, a town of about 20,000,
about six miles north of Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I remember is he was talking about how his wife had taken
his kid to Vegas _ he was mad as hell because he never got to see
the kid,'' said Donna Hammers, bartender at Toby &AMP; Jack's, a
popular Arcata bar Ford frequented. Police said Ford had an ex-wife
and at least one child who had moved from Arcata to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from San Bernardino and San Joaquin counties were
in Eureka last night, questioning Ford in connection with their
unsolved homicide cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Joaquin case of White, Ford told investigators he had
picked up a woman in Ontario, killed her and dumped her body in a
canal near Lodi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is from Fontana, we had a nude body discovered in an
irrigation canal. It all really pieced together,'' San Joaquin
County Sheriff's spokesman Mike Padilla said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the discovery of the badly decomposed, naked
body of White, a mother of four from Fontana, near Ontario, had the
appearance of an unsolvable murder.
</P>
<P>
   San Joaquin investigators had visited San Bernardino County _
where White lived _ to interview relatives, ex-boyfriends and her
fiance, and ruled them out as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had checked out virtually every lead and had to this point
run into dead ends,'' Padilla said. ``This is an enormous break,
should all the facts come together.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on interviews with Ford _ in which investigators compared
details about the condition and whereabouts of White's body _ San
Joaquin County sheriff's Sergeant David Levesey said he is ``very
confident'' that Ford killed her.
</P>
<P>
   White's body, discovered by a motorist, was identified by her
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Levesey said his department may not hand over the case to the
San Joaquin County district attorney's office pending the outcome
of charges in Humboldt County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going anywhere,'' Levesey said. ``He'll be available
if we need him.''

MICROSOFT ASKED APPLE TO `KNIFE THE BABY,' COURT TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ Introducing shades of Greek tragedy into the
government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Thursday, Apple
Computer executive Avadis Tevanian accused Microsoft of urging his
company to ``knife the baby'' by killing one of its own products to
make way for a rival Microsoft version.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the antitrust trial moved into its 11th day, the dramatic
testimony marked just one of several tense exchanges in which
Tevanian thwarted the cross-examination of Microsoft attorney
Theodore Edelman by turning to the judge and expounding on his own
version of events rather than simply answering the question.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson not only permitted Tevanian's
elaborations, but repeatedly scolded the Microsoft attorney for
attempting to mislead Tevanian or mischaracterize his version of
events.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Jackson told Edelman, ``You keep mischaracterizing
what he's told you. . . . It's misleading language and it is not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian managed to insert his description of an exchange
between Apple and Microsoft executives at an April 1997 meeting
about Apple's QuickTime, an Internet software product that plays
music and video. Tevanian had testified that Microsoft tried to use
its industry clout to force Apple to cede the market for so-called
multimedia playback software to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Looking directly at the judge, Tevanian said that at the
meeting, Apple's Peter Hoddie asked Microsoft's Christopher
Phillips, ``Do you want us to knife the baby?'' referring to
QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian said Phillips replied, ``Yes, we're talking about
knifing the baby.''
</P>
<P>
   The Apple executive quickly conceded that he was not present at
the meeting, but by then the charge had electrified the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian is a star witness for the Department of Justice and 20
state attorneys general who accuse Microsoft of exploiting its
monopoly in computer operating software _ Microsoft's Windows runs
on roughly 90 percent of all personal computers _ to destroy
competitors and strangle innovation. Before the trial began, he
submitted 45 pages of scathing testimony that accused Microsoft of
using its market power to bully Apple into accepting Microsoft's
Internet Explorer browser and to sabotage QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   As the afternoon wore on and Edelman methodically tried to pick
apart Tevanian's testimony and imply that Apple employed many of
the same business tactics it accused Microsoft of using, Judge
Jackson grew increasingly impatient.
</P>
<P>
   When Tevanian said he could not respond to questions about a
complicated technical document without further study, the judge
sustained an objection from government lawyers, barking at Edelman,
``Fine, you call your own witness (to explain the document), but
he's said he's unfamiliar with the document.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelman persisted, asking if Tevanian might study it over the
weekend. Jackson retorted, ``That's entirely up to Dr. Tevanian. He
may have other things to do this weekend. I think you'd better go
on to another subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was not without its victories. After being urged by
the judge to conclude his cross-examination, Edelman wrapped up
with videotaped testimony that directly contradicted a key Apple
allegation: that Compaq Computer Corp. dropped QuickTime because
the company was afraid of vexing Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In his written testimony, Tevanian said Compaq executive Steven
Decker explained to Apple managers at a meeting last March at
Compaq's Houston headquarters, ``You have to understand what's
going on here. They're very afraid of doing anything to upset
Microsoft. We are very wary of bundling anything that would upset
Microsoft because they touch us in so many places.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tape showed Decker saying under oath, ``Apple doesn't
get it,'' explaining that Compaq had included an earlier version of
QuickTime with its computers when Apple offered it free. But when
Apple wanted Compaq to pay a royalty to use an updated version,
Decker said, ``Compaq was not about to pay Apple a royalty for that
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq ships a competing Microsoft product, NetShow, that it
gets free.
</P>
<P>
   Decker said Compaq was ``very happy'' to continue shipping the
old version of QuickTime free, but that Apple insisted that the
computer maker use the new version and pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our answer was that we just weren't going to ship the
product,'' Decker said. Asked whether he or any Compaq employee had
ever mentioned Microsoft in those discussions, Decker answered,
``No. Not at all.'' Asked again whether perhaps he just didn't
recall mentioning Microsoft, Decker emphatically replied, ``No, I
didn't'' mention Microsoft. He said of Apple's allegations, ``No,
that's actually false. We would be shipping QuickTime if Apple gave
it to us for free.''
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian will return to the stand when the trial resumes Monday,
this time responding to questions from Justice Department lawyers.

 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Hollywood Stars, a
weekly column with color art.) 
 &HT;    
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For nearly 60 years Lew Wasserman was one of the most powerful
men in America.
 &HT;    Wasserman and his mentor and partner in MCA/Universal Pictures,
Dr. Jules Stein, made superstars of Bette Davis, Cary Grant, Paul
Newman, Marilyn Monroe and Fred Astaire.
 &HT;    Without them Ronald Reagan might have remained a B-picture actor
past his prime, and Steven Spielberg might still be just a Long
Beach State dropout with a yen to make pictures.
 &HT;    These are some of the revelations made by Dennis McDougal in his
bombshell new book, ``The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the
Hidden History of Hollywood'' (Crown Books).
 &HT;    McDougal writes that Wasserman and Stein underwrote the
presidential aspirations of Ronald Reagan, who owed them both big
time. In the '50s, they gave him a new career on TV with General
Electric theater. In exchange, as president of the Screen Actors
Guild, Reagan sold his union members down the river by denying
their request for residuals from TV producers like Universal.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' says Dennis McDougal, ``Reagan is doing
side deals with Universal that keeps their studio working
throughout the SAG strike.''
 &HT;    With massive research and in meticulous detail, McDougal, a
former Los Angeles Times writer, charts the rise of Wasserman, the
boy from the wrong side of the Cleveland tracks, who started his
career as a cinema usher and rose to the top of the Hollywood heap.
 &HT;    Wasserman and Stein, first as agents then as heads of a movie
empire which encompassed films, music, theme parks and television,
developed a stranglehold on the entertainment industry.
 &HT;    Their methods, McDougal asserts, included every form of coercion
up to and including blackmail. And at the height of their power,
scarcely a picture could be made in America without their say-so.
 &HT;    Presiding over his kingdom from his Universal City black tower,
Wasserman was an enigma. Tall and very thin, with a thick crest of
snow white hair, thick black horn rimmed glasses and an
undertaker's costume of dark suit, white shirt and thin dark tie,
with nary a cigar in sight, he is scarcely the central casting
mogul of Hollywood mythology.
 &HT;    McDougal, whose book looks set to break over the back lots of
Hollywood like an incendiary device, blasts the enigma apart to
offer a grimy backstage reality behind the glittering Hollywood
facade.
 &HT;    Among the revelations: Wasserman, son of Russian immigrants,
loved only two things, money and movies and began his ties with
organized crime through his wife Edie whose attorney father Henry
Beckerman was a front man for the Moe Dalitz Mayfield gang of
Cleveland.
 &HT;    ``Nobody understood,'' contends McDougal, ``that the organized
crime strike force was interested (in MCA's ties to the mob) to the
point where they convened not one but two grand juries to
investigate MCA.''
 &HT;    The feds had received an anonymous letter, which McDougal prints
in the book, that alleged that Wasserman had hired a hit man to
kill his daughter's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Investigations of MCA and Wasserman however had a habit of
coming to naught. One Justice Department probe came to a grinding
halt in the '60s after the death of Marilyn Monroe who was
threatening to reveal all about her relationship with U.S. Attorney
General Robert Kennedy. McDougal implies that Kennedy may have
pulled off his attack dogs in exchange for Wasserman's assistance
with Kennedy's entanglement with Monroe.
 &HT;    The federal prosecutor who was pursuing MCA retired and moved to
a Beverly Hills law firm, where he suddenly died of a heart attack
at 47.
 &HT;    ``I've already been criticized in one prepublication review for
being strong on innuendo,'' McDougal admits. ``There are bold flat
statements about these deaths that I didn't make in the book and I
can't make them now. But I do think it's curious and worthy of
attention because both the Monroe death and the prosecutor's death
came at fortuitously convenient times. Maybe MCA just happened to
get lucky and these two thorns in their souls just happened to
expire at the same time in untimely ways.''
 &HT;    More solid is the story of the end of Tennessee Sen. Estes
Kefauver's investigation into the mob which had also drawn
perilously close to Wasserman and MCA, when the senator had the
misfortune to be found in bed in a New York hotel room with not one
but two hostesses from the nearby Chez Paree nightclub. The
incident found its way, in slightly altered form, into the Francis
Ford Coppola's Godfather epic.
 &HT;    In the year that Teamster chief Jimmy Hoffa disappeared and
gangster Sam Giancana was gunned down, Wasserman and his Hollywood
lawyer Sydney Korshak became more and more afraid, writes
McDougall. Korshak began traveling with a bodyguard and Wasserman
beefed up security at his Beverly Hills home and had his drivers
taught how to throw off a pursuit.
 &HT;    If Wasserman's business universe was suspect, his personal life
as depicted by McDougal, is a put under a harsh light. Sure to be
criticized for his revelations about the private life of Edie
Wasserman, a respected Los Angeles-based philanthropist, McDougal
says it was absolutely germane to his portrait of Wasserman the
mogul.
 &HT;    ``If you don't understand that Lew had no home life and that his
relationship with his wife at some point evolved into an almost
brother and sister relationship then you don't really understand
what made the guy run. He hated to go home. I mean to this day when
he's 85 and virtually retired, I understand he goes into the office
every day and does not relish the idea of having to go home,''
McDougal said.
 &HT;    Today MCA is owned by Seagram Co. Ltd.(who bought it from the
Japanese company Matsushita in 1995) and as depicted by McDougal,
the last mogul is a lonely figure with a poor relationship with his
only daughter, a strange marriage and no deep friendships.
 &HT;    ``He has no broad sweep of close friends that he can just sit
and shmooze with or feel close to,'' says McDougal. ``He's very
isolated , very alone. And I feel a certain compassion for him.''
 &HT;    In Hollywood where he has been a towering figure, and a large
donor to charities taking on Lew Wasserman even in the twilight of
his years, is a brave endeavor.
 &HT;    Says McDougal, ``One of his MCA vice presidents told me that the
most chilling thing you could ever hear was that Lew was
'disappointed in you.'''
 &HT;    McDougal admits there is much to admire in the man. ``I think he
has a very strong sense of what is good. But he compartmentalizes.
He is very capable of destroying a career and the next day ...
speak passionately and sincerely about helping labor get a decent
contract. He has many good sides but he's capable of being
absolutely ruthless.''

WHEN YOUR CHILD STEALS FOR ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.) 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old son is bringing home all sorts of
goodies from school. I don't think they're his, but I don't want to
accuse him of stealing. How common is stealing with kids, and if I
ignore it, are banks next? _ Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: It's not unusual for kids to steal, but it's not
something you want to encourage as a way to garner attention. Don't
condone or ignore his stealing, but shift the emphasis from
negative to positive. Make sure he is not stealing to get
attention. You don't need your kid to be the first jailbird in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is stealing, ask yourself why he is doing this. Who
sees his booty? If no one, he probably wants it for its own sake.
If he shows his friends, he wants their approval. If he shows you,
he's most likely asking for help. He's figured out how to get your
attention, and unfortunately punishing him will only emphasize the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Does he have an older sibling who gets a lot of attention for
sports or grades? Or a new baby in the house? Then he needs
reinforcement from you, including gold stars on the forehead, pats
on the back for positive behavior and help in making purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to accuse him of stealing. Just explain you're
uncomfortable with his trading efforts and to cut it out before
other parents object. Suggest he takes no goodies to school and
brings no goodies home. If he doesn't already have an allowance or
job to pay for his own ``must-haves,'' institute a series of chores
to earn money that you will match.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I've been going with a woman 20 years my junior for a
little over a year. She's been divorced for a little under a year.
While she was married, she had numerous affairs. When I asked her
about them, she gave me sketchy details. Later I found out she'd
lied about the number and length of affairs. I want to leave her,
but I'm supporting her and her two children, ages 5 and 9, since
she doesn't work and doesn't receive sufficient alimony. What
should I do? _ Toronto
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Heavens! So many red flares shot up as I read your
letter my office is on fire. Despite your noble intentions, you've
stumbled into nearly every relationship pitfall there is.
</P>
<P>
   What she did before is none of your business. What matter is
what's going on between the two of you today. Stop supporting this
woman, so both of you can evaluate your feelings for each other.
She needs to grow up, get a job and realize that a romance is not a
rescue. Stop being ``Wally the Wallet'' and take a breather from
this troubled relationship for six months.
</P>
<P>
   After that your head should be clear enough to see who this
woman is as a person _ not a project. If at that time, you still
want to pursue a relationship, proceed with caution. You never know
when a booby trap might spring up and bop you on the shins again.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a guy trying to save money to buy a car, so I'm
living at home while I attend college. But my parents wait up for
me every night and want to know everything that goes on in my life.
Aren't I entitled to any privacy? _ Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Of course, but you may have to get it the old-fashioned
way _ earn it by moving out. Everything in this life has a price
tag. You're finding the price tag for free room and board is
expensive in terms of personal privacy and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Live under your parents' roof and I guarantee you're going to be
treated like a child whether you're 14 or 114. If you're unwilling
to change your living arrangements, compromise. Volunteer
information if they promise not to ask. Tell them you'll be home by
a certain time and say goodnight when you get in. Your parents are
always going to be interested in your life even after you move out.
It doesn't mean they're nosy, just that they're your parents and
they love you.
</P>
<P>
   Your best long-term solution is to earn more independence, which
may mean finding less luxurious housing with a friend, foregoing
the car temporarily, getting a job or finding campus housing in
exchange for some work. Not only will your parents drive you less
crazy, but you'll also feel a lot more grown up.

THE SPIN ON JEFFERSON'S BABY 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DNA tests verified that Thomas Jefferson fathered a child by his
slave Sally Hemings. The finding confirms 200 years of black folk
history and vindicates some (but not all) of Hemings' descendants,
who have argued for generations that Jefferson was an ancestor.
</P>
<P>
   The ambivalent historical spin: This further complicates our
understanding of the third president, who preached against
miscegenation while practicing it.
</P>
<P>
   The hopeful historical spin: This may make whites more willing
to acknowledge their common heritage with blacks.
</P>
<P>
   The gleeful pro-Clinton spin: Jefferson's affair proves that a
president's private foibles shouldn't overshadow his public
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   The grouchy anti-Clinton spin: Jefferson was a widower at the
time of his relations with Hemings, never lied about his affair
under oath, and Clinton's accomplishments hardly rival the
Declaration of Independence.

THE EXPLAINER: WHY IS THERE NO JURY IN THE MICROSOFT TRIAL AND WHAT
DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS.: Slate is owned by Microsoft.) 
 By BRUCE GOTTLIEB and KATE GALBRAITH 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: Why is the case being tried before a judge, not a
jury?
</P>
<P>
   ANSWER: If the plaintiffs (the Department of Justice and 20
states) were seeking ``damages'' (money) from Microsoft, then
either side would be entitled to request a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plaintiffs are not seeking money--they only seek
injunctive relief such as stopping Microsoft from packaging its
internet browser in Windows 98. The Microsoft trial thus falls
under a category of law called ``actions in equity.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a tradition dating back to English law, ``actions
in equity'' are tried before a judge not a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The DOJ complaint does seek to recover ``costs'' from
Microsoft--such as the money spent while preparing depositions.
Likewise, the states' complaint filed Aug. 17 seeks to be ``awarded
their costs of suit, including reasonable attorneys' fees.''
However, costs and fees are minor sideshows of the case, and
neither of these constitute ``damages.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: What Does the Government Want From Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   answer: The government thinks Microsoft violated the antitrust
laws. But what does the government wish to do about this? What
remedy is the government proposing?
</P>
<P>
   The reason the newspapers don't tell you is that the Justice
Department hasn't said what it wants to happen. This antitrust
suit, like all civil cases, begins with a plaintiffs' complaint
detailing the alleged offenses. (The Department of Justice and 20
state attorneys general are the plaintiffs.)
</P>
<P>
   It is common, though not mandatory, for the complaint to suggest
so-called ``remedies.'' For example, a person who is hit by an
automobile will declare that $2 million cash will alleviate her
pain and suffering. Or parties to a bitter divorce will sue for
exclusive custody of the children.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, however, the Justice Department is waiting to see
how the court rules before deciding what remedy to ask for. The
antitrust laws are both vague and in flux. The remedy request will
depend not merely on whether the government wins the case, but on
the judge's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Potential remedies the government might seek include, among
others: 1) requiring Microsoft to separate its browser from the
Windows operating system; 2) requiring Microsoft to provide details
of its products to competitors; or 3) breaking the company into a
number of smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   The judge may accept the government's proposed remedy or fashion
one of his own. And of course any remedy can be appealed to a
higher court.

THE ONLY PLAYERS ARE THE PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES SUROWIECKI 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The central dilemma in the current NBA lockout is that the
workers control the means of production because the workers are the
means of production.
</P>
<P>
   NBA owners contribute almost nothing to the product that they
put out, and while the current lockout represents their attempt to
re-establish control over the players, it's both difficult to
imagine that attempt succeeding and, even more, unclear whether
that attempt should succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fact that when it comes to the NBA players we're
talking about men who on average take home more than $1 million a
year while getting the summers off, it's undoubtedly hard to see
these guys as the vanguard of the working class. But you can
recognize the logic behind the players' demands without mistaking
them for proletarian heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The current impasse began, after all, because the existing
players' agreement had a provision saying that the owners could
reopen contract discussions if player compensation reached more
than 52 percent of annual revenue. Last season, compensation
totaled 57 percent, and the owners want to reduce that to 48
percent, while the players' best offer so far is 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are just having a hard time grasping reality. While
they may have legal title to their teams' names, and in some cases
to the stadiums they play in, they don't really do very much to
bring in any revenue. The players do the lion's share of the work.
It's not clear why they shouldn't bring in the lion's share of the
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you could argue that this is true of any business.
Shareholders in a company don't do any work, so why should they get
paid any dividend (or why should profits be reinvested rather than
paying them out in salaries)?
</P>
<P>
   But in most businesses workers are fairly interchangeable.
Nobody goes to McDonald's because Megan is behind the counter
(well, unless you're a high school boy who has a crush on Megan).
People go to McDonald's because of the name and the food, both of
which are the product of the company, not of the workers. And, in
any case, those employees who are judged to have a
disproportionately important impact on the business--the
executives--are compensated exceedingly well in most corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA--indeed, all of professional sports, but the NBA above
all--is different from these other situations because the workers
are the reason people come to the games.
</P>
<P>
   People come to see NBA games not because it's the NBA, but
because they know that's where they'll see the very best basketball
players in the world. If the NBA disappeared tomorrow, people would
still want to see those players. If those players moved on, people
would not still want to see the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the owners put up the capital and deserve a return
on investment to compensate them for their risk. But cutting costs
by cutting salaries may make sense in a business world where
workers are fungible commodities. It makes no sense in a business
where the workers are the only resource that matters.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if the players deserve 67 percent of the league's
annual revenue. But to decry their position as greedy or
unreasonable is simply to misunderstand the nature of the game.

PROSPERITY TAKES AMERICA TO THE LEFT 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID PLOTZ 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Democrats eagerly tout their break-even performance as a
grand triumph, and as Republicans spin the same numbers into an
affirmation of the conservative status quo, both sides are
overlooking the election's most astonishing results: the ballot
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives have made news in recent years by advancing
conservative causes: limits on gay rights, immigration, and
affirmative action. And there were certainly some initiatives to
delight the right this year, too. Voter initiatives approved in
Alaska and Hawaii banned gay marriage. An initiative in Michigan
upheld a ban on assisted suicide. And a Washington initiative
modeled on California's Proposition 209 abolished state affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the overriding theme of the 1998 initiatives is not
conservative at all. It is that American voters, at least in this
complacent year, are a lot more liberal than Republican pollsters
would have you believe.
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives rewarded both lefty libertarians and paleoliberals.
On the libertarian front, five states--Alaska, Nevada, Oregon,
Washington, and Arizona--put medical marijuana on the ballot, and
five states approved (or in Arizona's case, re-approved) it. That
means the entire Western flank of the nation now permits marijuana
as medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon voters also killed an initiative to re-criminalize
marijuana possession. Initiatives in California and Missouri
expanded legalized gambling, a libertarian cause increasingly
embraced by Democrats. And both Colorado and Washington rejected
bans on partial birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives also expressed a surprisingly strong faith in
government and a willingness to expand it. Voters gave a
full-throated endorsement to public education. Californians
approved a $9 billion school bond issue, and Rhode Islanders OK'd a
(much) smaller one. Coloradans rejected a proposal to give tax
credits for private school tuition, and South Dakotans rebuffed an
effort to stop financing schools with property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Five states--Arizona, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, and North
Carolina--endorsed ballot initiatives to expand state environmental
funding and, in all but Arizona, by huge margins. South Dakotans
voted to restrict corporate hog farming, as well. Only in Oregon,
where a massively broad ban on logging was proposed, did an
environmental initiative fail.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats afflicted with a foolish optimism may view these
initiative victories as a sign of an impending liberal majority. I
suspect they represent something else: the generosity of the
prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   According to exit polls, American voters feel happy and rich.
These votes reflect a generous, expansive mood. Sick people want to
smoke a joint? Let 'em, what harm does it do? More money for
schools? Sure! Clean water? You bet!
</P>
<P>
   These are not liberal activist votes, cast because the
initiatives advance a progressive agenda. They seem to be
smile-on-the-face votes, cast because the initiatives are modest
and well-intentioned and, at worst, harmless.

THE PRACTICE OF READING
</HEADLINE>
  By Denis Donoghue 
 307 pp. New Haven: Yale University Press. $30 
 ------ 
 ENGLISH AS A SECOND LANGUAGE 
 By PETER BROOKS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one of the more polemical moments of ``The Practice of
Reading,'' Denis Donoghue proposes that we should teach English
language and literature as if they were a foreign tongue and a
foreign literature. Our problems, he says, arise from the
assumption that our students know the language and are qualified to
undertake a study of the literature, and ``if we taught English as
a second language and a second literature, we would become more
responsive to the mediating character of the literary language, the
opacity of language as such: we would not assume that the language
is transparent to our interests.'' This may be implausible as a
practical proposal of reform, but it effectively highlights
Donoghue's overriding concern in his new book: that the arduous and
exciting business of close attention to the language of literature
may be suffering from perilous neglect.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue has for many years been worrying about how we read --
and how we should read. As a leading ``practical critic'' -- to use
I. A. Richards's term -- with a broad and deep literary culture,
Donoghue has always been ready to skewer theories that he thinks
stand between the reader and a direct experience of texts. His
allegiances lie most of all with the tradition of the New Critics
and other ``close readers,'' from T. S. Eliot and Richards through
William Empson, F. R. Leavis, R. P. Blackmur, Kenneth Burke. But
whereas in earlier books, for instance ``Ferocious Alphabets''
(1981), his critique was directed toward post-structuralists like
Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida and Paul de Man, now what he calls
``ideologically opportunistic'' criticism draws his wrath.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue is right (and hardly alone) in detecting an ideological
and political turn in criticism, part of the movement often
referred to as cultural studies, which (under the general influence
of Michel Foucault, among others) tends to see literature as just
one among many discourses reflective of dominant ideological
practices and to study it as a cultural artifact without any
special claim to independent status or superior insight. He is
right, too, in his claim that most critics of this persuasion don't
read with the patient attention to language characteristic of the
New Critics: ``Their metier is not verbal analysis but the
deployment of themes, arguments and morally charged conclusions. .
. . They take language for granted as providing direct access to
reality and fantasy.'' In one of his liveliest chapters, Donoghue
takes on recent commentaries on ``Macbeth'' that, he says, ``issue
not in analyses of the language of the play but in an invidious
account of the ideology that the play allegedly sustains: for that
purpose, a reading of the play in the detail of its language is
thought to be a nuisance.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting result of Donoghue's warfare on this new front is
a newly relaxed attitude toward the deconstructive readings of
Derrida and de Man, who in fact gave very close attention to texts,
though with austere and unsettling results. De Man, after all,
proposed a ``return to philology'' as ``an examination of the
structure of language prior to the meaning it produced.'' It's not
theory Donoghue is hostile to, he has asserted -- in fact, we don't
have enough good theory in literary study -- but ``the prosecution
of principles and ideologies under the pseudonym of theory.''
Indeed, literary study at present is sometimes held to be
post-theoretical, and that has often meant the neglect of poetics
-- the study of the conditions of meaning of texts -- as well as
scrupulous reading, in favor of a search for sociopolitical
implications.
</P>
<P>
   If Donoghue generally aligns himself with formalism, as the
attention to the shape and texture of literary works, his larger
ambition is the rehabilitation of the esthetic, particularly as it
was formulated two centuries ago by Schiller. The esthetic to
Schiller is not marginal or decorative, it is central to human
experience: the realm of human freedom, of the Spieltrieb -- the
human capacity for play -- for reformulating the givens of reality.
The word Donoghue keeps coming back to, here and elsewhere, is
``imagination'': the capacity of the mind to encompass other forms
of life, a fictional sphere where, in the line of one of his
favorite poets, Wallace Stevens, ``the world imagined is the
ultimate good.'' He also likes the word ``Romanticism,'' not as set
in sterile opposition to Classicism but as a ``permanent category''
of human aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   These are crucial and complex issues. The problem is that ``The
Practice of Reading'' doesn't provide much scope for their full
development. A series of eight mainly short occasional essays on
critics and practices of reading, followed by seven readings of
individual texts, the book never provides an extended argument on
any one topic. The problem isn't made any easier by the fact that
the book refuses to tell us what the occasion for most of the
essays originally was (most were journal pieces or lectures), which
makes some of them float a bit weightlessly. Donoghue's arguments
are often given in a kind of shorthand, leaving this reader, at
least, largely unsatisfied. When, for instance, he takes on de
Man's interpretation of Wordsworth's famous, and famously
problematic, ``Boy of Winander,'' he concludes by calling it
``formidable but perverse,'' and simply asserts to the contrary,
``I have to remind myself that Wordsworth . . . wrote some of the
most moving poems in the language.'' To be sure, but this is not an
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Donoghue's magisterial tone and his readiness to pass trenchant
judgment can be bracing, but they can also confuse and even
trivialize important issues now much debated. Nor are definition
and clarity advanced by his tendency to refer in a litany to
critics he likes -- Leavis, Empson, Blackmur, Burke especially --
while taking unexplained swipes at those he doesn't, sometimes, one
feels, without much sense of what they are really saying. The
result is a book that is somehow less than the sum of its parts.
Donoghue is a formidably gifted critic whose range of reference is
truly impressive and whose commitment to what he calls (he is
paraphrasing Blackmur on Stevens) ``the superior impersonal reality
of words'' is profound and, in the current context, salutary. But
his book never really gets to the business of telling us how and
why the practices of reading he approves are the right and powerful
ones.

MY FIRST COUSIN ONCE REMOVED
</HEADLINE>
  Money, Madness, and the Family of Robert Lowell 
 By Sarah Payne Stuart 
 Illustrated. 244 pp. New York: HarperCollins Publishers. $25 
 ------ 
 YANKEES IN THE BELFRY 
 By REEVE LINDBERGH 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nathaniel Hawthorne once suggested that ``in every half-century,
at longest, a family should be merged in the great abstract mass of
humanity, and forget all about its ancestors.'' Good advice. We
risk a great deal when we cannot allow our parents, our
grandparents or any of our other relatives, however admirable they
may be, to recede into the benign realms of memory, but instead
keep them with us always, in sharpest focus, throughout our days.
Indeed, those especially who have famous relatives will admit, if
they are honest, that it is one thing to honor one's celebrated
kinfolk, and quite another thing to struggle with the lifelong
impression that those other illustrious family lives are more
important than our own. With a hearty, if somewhat toxic, mixture
of pride, envy, exasperation, love and despair, Sarah Payne Stuart
goes straight to the heart of this struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first cousin once removed was Robert Lowell, the Pulitzer
Prize-winning poet -- a fact I just happened to mention on my
application to Harvard College. The worst part was that I had to
work this genealogical information into the essay.'' Thus begins
``My First Cousin Once Removed: Money, Madness, and the Family of
Robert Lowell.'' Stuart and her brothers grew up with the knowledge
that ``we were Winslows, as if this information alone should make
everything clear in our lives.'' It did not. Instead, Stuart
learned that she and her family were Boston aristocrats, with a
heritage, like most, partly honorable and partly horrific. Her
Mayflower ancestor, Edward Winslow, established peace with the
Indians and maintained it for 40 years. He once traveled for many
miles through the snow to nurse Massasoit, chief of the Wampanoags.
A generation later, Edward's son Josiah, who had grown up with
Massasoit's children, trapped a group of women and children from
the Narragansett tribe in their wigwams and burned them alive.
</P>
<P>
   For the descendants of the Winslows, and of the Thorndikes,
Lowells, Cottings and Paynes, family history is a mixed blessing,
and family life can be very grim. Stuart's perspective is often
friendly, but never reverent. ``In my family, genes are
everything,'' she writes, ``so that even being a manic-depressive
is a kind of badge of honor, proving the family's tenacity in
sticking close to Boston, where there was no one to marry but one
another.'' Robert Lowell, known to his family and friends as Bobby,
was a manic-depressive as well as a poet. He also had a tendency to
drink heavily, to write about his family in a way that upset them,
and to leave his wives. ``Bobby had created a lot of turmoil in the
family before I was born,'' his younger cousin Sarah writes, ``but
then he had won the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and
for years he could get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard, reading this book, to envy Robert Lowell, who
suffered a series of debilitating breakdowns over the course of his
career, until in 1977 a heart attack ended his life at 60. Others
suffered too. Stuart's mother, Lowell's first cousin and a
childhood intimate, also had a breakdown, and was hospitalized for
a year and a half. Johnny Payne, the second of her three older
brothers, a gifted musician perceived by his family as ``the
perfect child . . . considerate of his parents and hard-working in
school,'' suffered his first breakdown during his second year at
Harvard, and his condition was diagnosed by the staff of McLean
Hospital in Belmont, Mass., as paranoid schizophrenia. His sister
tried, and failed, to have her brother come to live with her in her
own Harvard suite at Winthrop House. One weary paragraph conveys a
wealth of feeling about that period of her life. ``After you are
with someone who is really crazy, you never use the word the same
way again,'' Stuart writes, and then, simply, ``I was unable to
cure Johnny.'' (Johnny ultimately got well enough to perform with
Phoebe Snow, Bonnie Raitt and Tim Hardin, and to get married, have
children and start a music school.) Half a dozen family members
were afflicted in all.
</P>
<P>
   This story about family craziness seems, in and of itself, so
remarkably and cheerfully sane. It is a survivor's story, with so
much intelligence, humor and affection brought to bear that even
the monsters it occasionally offers up are appealing. They are the
artist's own monsters, after all, and it is clear that she loves
them, from the benevolent family matriarch of her childhood, her
namesake ``Great-Aunt Sarah,'' who at 99 turns to her beloved
great-niece and says, ``I don't like you, you're poor,'' to the
Boston relatives at Lowell's funeral who ``sat stiffly in their
pews, careful not to be too comfortable,'' to the very atmosphere
of the ancestral home in Boston, ``where everything was stifling,
where never once had I said a true thing, but where everything was
certain, down to the chicken they ate every Wednesday, year after
year.''

BOOKS IN BRIEF: NONFICTION 
 JUDE
</HEADLINE>
  A Pilgrimage to the Saint of Last Resort 
 By Liz Trotta 
 HarperSanFrancisco, $24.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The saint of lost causes and desperate cases, Jude, the most
obscure of Jesus' Twelve Apostles, is enjoying a grass-roots
renewal of interest, Liz Trotta contends, thanks to
end-of-the-millennium despair. Trotta takes readers to the ruins of
Edessa, an ancient city in eastern Turkey where legend has it that
Jude earned his reputation as a miracle worker by healing King
Abgar of leprosy; to Rome, where Jude's relics lie in St. Peter's;
on her talks with AIDS patients at Jude's shrine in San Francisco;
and to her interviews with believers across the United States, who
offer accounts of desperate prayers to Jude being rewarded with
miracles. Jesus' assignment to Jude, she suggests, was:
``Fundamental changes happen in secret within individual hearts. It
is not a matter of converting nations and bestowing victory upon
chosen peoples, but of revealing God's kingdom quietly by answering
each lonely cry.'' If only Trotta, the New York bureau chief for
The Washington Times, could define her own role as clearly. She
seems to see Jude's hand everywhere that she cannot find an answer:
a missed interview, a wrong turn or an altar she cannot locate. Is
her search factual or spiritual? The reader is left wondering. _

   &UR; EX LIBRIS &QL; 
 &UR; Confessions of a Common Reader &QL; 
 &UR; By Anne Fadiman &QL; 
 &UR; Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the literary Eden that forms Anne Fadiman's life, the air
remains pure allusion, the marginalia flows, and the only snake in
the grass is a typo. The daughter of the writer Clifton Fadiman,
she cultivated her bibliomania in her family's intellectual
atmosphere, affectionately called ``Fadiman U.'' She grew from
assembling castles out of her father's set of Trollope to learning
about sex from his poorly concealed copy of ``Fanny Hill.'' Editor
of The American Scholar, Fadiman now has her own bookish family
(her husband reads Homer aloud to her in bed). Her ``common
reader'' take on these topics and others -- like John Adams's
incensed jottings in Mary Wollstonecraft's ``French Revolution''
(``200 years later, his handwriting still looks angry'') and the
wordy exotica of a mail-order catalogue (``a Harlequin romance for
the kind of people who vacation in Krk'') -- fills these 18 lissome
essays on bibliophilism and language, which appeared first in
Civilization magazine. How you respond to them depends a lot on how
you feel about someone whose greatest discomfort as a 19-year-old
evidently occurred in the offices of The New Yorker (she
mispronounced ``Ms.'' in front of a gracious William Shawn). Like
Gladstone, whose ``On Books and the Housing of Them'' exhibits how
completely his Victorian sensibility operated ``within the
miniature empire of his own library,'' she, too, functions within a
genteel fortress of books. _ RENEE TURSI

   &UR; FAMILY OUTING &QL; 
 &UR; By Chastity Bono with Billie Fitzpatrick &QL; 
 &UR; Little, Brown, $24 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Viewers of Sonny and Cher's television show in the early 1970's
remember Chastity Bono as the blond, angelic child holding hands
with her famous parents. Bono broke that dainty public image by
growing up to become a gay activist. Readers hoping for a dishy
tell-all or a literary memoir in ``Family Outing'' will be
disappointed. The book is more of a comprehensive guide to the
coming-out process for homosexuals and their parents. With its
heavily instructional and sometimes wooden tone, ``Family Outing''
reads like a textbook. Yet there is no doubt it will be helpful to
its intended audience. Bono's celebrity may attract readers who
need this kind of advice but might not receive it otherwise. Though
she tends to explain rather than feel in her prose, she shows guts
by revealing her own story, including her sorrow at the death of
her father, a Republican Congressman who co-sponsored the Defense
of Marriage Act. At the time of his death, father and daughter had
not spoken in almost a year. The biggest surprise: when Bono came
out, Sonny was supportive; Cher, known for her wild, rebellious
image, was enraged. Ultimately, Cher embraced her child and told
her, ``So this is your journey: making being gay or lesbian
commonplace.'' _ ANDREA COOPER

   &UR; CULTURAL CALISTHENICS &QL; 
 &UR; Writings on Race, Politics and Theatre &QL; 
 &UR; By Robert Brustein &QL; 
 &UR; Ivan R. Dee, $26 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the playwright August Wilson delivered a speech in which
he celebrated what black theater ``often accomplished amid adverse
and hostile conditions,'' slammed the idea of ``color-blind''
casting as ``a tool of the Cultural Imperialists,'' and identified
the critic Robert Brustein as chief cultural imperialist. A heated
public debate ensued, which Brustein continues in several of his
essays here. He characterizes their differences as ``a
philosophical dispute over the basic function of dramatic art.''
``I believe that plays must be engaged with the social and
political issues of the time,'' he writes, ``but I continue to hold
the admittedly unfashionable view that no major work of art ever
changed society, however it succeeded in changing consciousness.''
Many of these essays, most of which were originally published in
The New Republic, are concerned with how ``extra-artistic
considerations'' -- multiculturalism, gay rights, women's issues
and political correctness -- impair current thought, including that
of arts funding agencies. It is because of trying to accommodate
these ``extra-artistic considerations,'' Brustein argues, that we
find ourselves bending over backward to perform what he cleverly
calls ``cultural calisthenics,'' much to the disservice of art.
Other essays praise the great acting teacher Stella Adler, the
playwright and performer Anna Deavere Smith, and recent plays like
``How I Learned to Drive'' and ``Gross Indecency.'' Robert Brustein
is an elegant and eloquent voice in the wilderness of contemporary
American culture. _ ROBIN LIPPINCOTT

   &UR; ELVIS PRESLEY 1956 &QL; 
 &UR; By Marvin Israel &QL; 
 &UR; Abrams, $17.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Elvis Presley released his first album in March
1956, a photographer for Seventeen magazine named Marvin Israel
caught him on tour at the University of Dayton. ``Elvis Presley
1956'' (Abrams, $17.95), a gritty compilation of dozens of
previously unpublished black-and-white photos, was the result.
Seventeen probably passed because the photos of the rising teen
idol were too raw: the black-rimmed, raccoon-like eyes, the pitted
skin and the electric current that seemed to ripple through
Presley's spine. We also see his natural charm: a picture of a
smiling Elvis, en pointe, knees splayed, cradling his
leather-embossed guitar; a gauzy picture of his Pharaonic features
that makes him look like a god from ancient Memphis. Portraits of
the fans capture an era: girls in their Junior League best with
polka-dot bows, and their gape-mouthed, sullen dates; a
leather-jacketed Natalie Wood look-alike scowls in front of a
30-foot-tall cutout of Presley at the premiere of ``Love Me
Tender,'' his first film, at the Paramount in Times Square. Israel,
who went on to become one of the most influential photo editors of
the 1960's, commissioning work by Diane Arbus, Robert Frank and Lee
Friedlander, had an intimate access to Presley before he became a
superstar that comes across in the photos. The text is perfunctory
(``in 1956 Elvis was a rocket'') and identifying captions would
help, but the images speak for themselves. _ ERIC P. NASH

 THE BOOK OF JOB 
 Translation, introduction and notes by Raymond P. Scheindlin 
 Norton, $23.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Book of Job, considered by many to be the greatest poetic
drama in the Hebrew Bible, resonates with spiritual import and
psychological power. Probably set down at some time during the
fifth or fourth century B.C., the story may well be a retelling of
an even older exemplary folk tale about Job, who undergoes
unimaginable suffering inflicted by an omnipotent and seemingly
uncaring God. Raymond P. Scheindlin, a professor of medieval Hebrew
literature at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America,
translates the biblical Hebrew into language that is mellifluous
and eloquent, yet contemporary in tone. He acknowledges the Book of
Job's well-documented difficulty and resists any urge to nudge his
version in a more discursive direction. As he says in his
introduction, ``Poetry does not state the book's message . . . it
is the book's message.'' _ ANDY BRUMER

   &UR; THE HIGHER JAZZ &QL; 
 &UR; By Edmund Wilson &QL; 
 &UR; University of Iowa, cloth, $34.95; paper, $17.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, Edmund Wilson wrote and partly revised a
novel set in the months before and just after the 1929 stock market
crash _ a time when he had suffered a breakdown and was unable to
write. He intended, as Neale Reinitz explains in his introduction,
``a sweeping narrative'' called ``The Story of the Three Wishes,''
in which a man assumes three successive identities _ a New York
stockbroker, a Russian official and a bohemian writer in
Provincetown. But the original project veered in another direction,
more in keeping with the new title, ``The Higher Jazz,'' given by
Reinitz to this previously unpublished narrative. Its main
character, Fritz Dietrich, may be out to distill ``the blue unhappy
beautiful longings'' of American popular music into a classical
form, but he's just as entranced by the ``round little rump'' of
his companion, Caroline Stokes. Fritz and Caroline soon wed, and
join a witty set of New Yorkers loosely based on Dorothy Parker,
Robert Benchley and Wilson's friends Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.
Unfortunately, there are too many characters in the novel, and not
much plot for them to be essential to. Reinitz has successfully
reconciled gaps and inconsistencies in the text, and his
commentaries connecting it to Wilson's life and other work are the
chief interest of the book. Interesting too are the parallels to
Wilson's editing of Fitzgerald's unfinished novel, ``The Last
Tycoon,'' published just before Wilson started his own manuscript,
and those between ``The Higher Jazz'' and ``The Great Gatsby.''
Wilson's story has its own Nick; its parlor-gag family, the
Ratsbys; and a lot of clever dialogue -- all of it mildly engaging,
but never very captivating. _ DAVID WALTON

   &UR; LIKE BEING KILLED &QL; 
 &UR; By Ellen Miller &QL; 
 &UR; Dutton, $24.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's something daunting about a novel that opens with a long
scene in which self-described ``dope fiends'' sit around a table
getting high. Usually in such situations, the author means to clue
us in to an addict's skewed logic, but often we just feel as if
we're stuck at a party where no one speaks our language. Ellen
Miller's first novel begins with one of these sequences and never
quite recovers. The narrator, Ilyana Meyerovich, is a Brown
graduate living on the Lower East Side who reads books about
pharmacology for fun and has a deadpan wisecrack for every
occasion. She also knows with comfortable certainty that heroin,
the drug that seems to mesh so well with her tendency toward
existential despair, will eventually kill her. Then she meets
Susie, a sunny, good-hearted soul who knows how to make peach pie,
and she falls in a kind of love. But the relationship shatters, and
Ilyana careers down a self-destructive spiral. In Ilyana, Miller
has drawn a surly yet oddly appealing character. Mostly, though,
her novel simply seems calculated to shock, and the pace is dragged
down by Ilyana's serpentine digressions. ``An image formed, was
completed, then disintegrated, then reconstructed itself into a new
image, which formed fully, which crumbled, which was rebuilt into
something different,'' is just the beginning of one such musing.
``Like Being Killed'' puts you in a drug user's head, but it
doesn't give you enough reasons to want to stay there. _ STEPHANIE

   &UR; A MASTERPIECE OF REVENGE &QL; 
 &UR; By J. J. Fiechter &QL; 
 &UR; Arcade, $21.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fact that its publishers are calling ``A Masterpiece of
Revenge'' a mystery is more mysterious than its plot. A chief
suspect and motive are established early on, and despite a clever
twist at the end, events generally unwind without suspense. As one
might expect from a man who once ran the Swiss watch company
Blancpain, J. J. Fiechter has written a meticulously detailed
narrative. The novel's central character, Charles Vermeille, is an
expert on the 17th-century French painter Claude Lorrain. But it's
a seemingly simple set of modern pictures that stumps Vermeille:
photographs of his son that arrive in unmarked envelopes. There are
no threats, no notes, just candid photos of the young man, who has
recently begun studying at Berkeley. Then another picture is
brought to Vermeille's attention -- a painting, apparently a
long-lost Lorrain. More intrigue arrives with Jane Caldwell, the
director of a lab devoted to art conservation and keenly in need of
cash. A scientist by training, Caldwell is also a methodical flirt:
``She made calculated but graceful gestures; she formed
irresistible smiles; she fluttered her eyelashes; she moved her
shoulders sinuously.'' ``A Masterpiece of Revenge'' is similarly
calculated and graceful, but, sad to say, not nearly as sinuous. _

   &UR; ALL OF US &QL; 
 &UR; The Collected Poems &QL; 
 &UR; By Raymond Carver &QL; 
 &UR; Knopf, $27.50 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The novel Raymond Carver occasionally spoke of writing never
materialized. Who can say, had he escaped death from lung cancer at
the age of 50, whether it ever would have? Carver was disposed to
the short form, and if he is the story writer of Teacher's Scotch
and domestic dissolution, then in ALL OF US: The Collected Poems
(Knopf, $27.50) he is their poet as well. The four volumes
collected here by William L. Stull (who also provides ample
biographical material, a chronology and exhaustive appendixes) were
mostly written in the 1980's, during the final decade of Carver's
life; they capture in verse much of the same pared narrative power
that distinguishes his fiction. Throughout the book, simple
declarative sentences pile up like collection notices as Carver's
plain-spoken diction lends immediacy to his characters' downward
spins and sporadic redemptions. As an offshoot of his desire to
blur the lines between poetry and prose, Carver even arranges
passages from the stories of his beloved Chekhov, lining them up
like verse. For Carver himself, however, the strongest poems begin
where his own stories end, in moments of lyrical insight that leave
narrative to one side. In ``September,'' ``Near Klamath'' and
``Late Fragment,'' for example, he discovers his own perfect music
and density of expression. Other poems, while sharing the
melancholy humanity of his stories, never quite realize their
potential as verse. Still, their willed artlessness and unflinching
emotions commend them to us. Like the fresh rolls a baker offers to
grieving parents in one of Carver's stories, each of them is ``a
small, good thing.'' _ DAVID YEZZI

   &UR; THE ROAD TO THE ISLAND &QL; 
 &UR; By Tom Hazuka &QL; 
 &UR; Bridge Works, $22.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Dolan, the 31-year-old narrator of Tom Hazuka's first
novel, becomes entwined in a cat's cradle of guilt, betrayal and
revenge after the death of his beloved father in a suspicious
hit-and-run accident. In the opening chapters, Hazuka deftly
balances back-fence realism with a supercharged expository style.
In short, sure strokes, he creates credible if not terribly complex
characters -- the wife and son Jimmy has abandoned, his best
friend, his resentful brother, his stoical mother. But Hazuka
eventually lets the novel's fast-paced plotting assume such control
that it distorts the emotional range and logic of his story.
Exposition clicks like a metronome, grim secrets are held back for
authorial convenience, and coincidences become felicitous to a
fault. In the end, no one can disagree with Jimmy's discovery that
it is better to forgive than to seethe. But the plot doesn't allow
him room to come naturally to the realization that he has
misunderstood the crucial emotional relationships of his youth. Nor
does it seem likely that his passivity can change into the optimism
of the novel's last pages. Still, ``The Road to the Island'' has
moments of high moral purpose and somber grace; it suggests that
for Hazuka more convincing efforts lie just ahead. _ CHARLES

<TEXT>
<P>
   After a life writing about politics, Robert Shogan is spitting
with contempt. Bob Dole, we are told on the first page of ``The
Fate of the Union,'' ``waged a brain-dead campaign'' in 1996.
George Bush's economic policies suffered from ``bankruptcy.'' At
the start of his Presidency, Bill Clinton had ``no guidepost beyond
the relentless pursuit of expediency.'' And time is no healer:
``Clinton began his second term with no clear objective except to
get through it.''
</P>
<P>
   For most authors, one broadside at a time might offer catharsis,
but Shogan's frustration is mightier than that. In ``The
Double-Edged Sword,'' published almost simultaneously, he unloads
his grievances about earlier statesmen. John Adams suffered from an
``abrasive, introspective personality''; Jefferson was duplicitous;
Madison lacked dynamism; Jackson's supporters had to organize a
``whitewash committee'' to defend their man against character
assaults. And after Jackson, ``a nearly unbroken parade of
political mediocrities presided in the White House.'' Shogan has
his generous moments in describing Washington, whose force of
personality he credits with holding the young Republic together.
But, even then, the author keeps his critical faculties about him:
Washington had only ``meager gifts as an orator,'' a ``notoriously
short temper'' and was not even a brilliant general.
</P>
<P>
   This two-book assault on American statecraft has a larger point.
As Shogan points out, Americans set great store by their
Presidents' personal qualities. They want them to act, in the words
of Walter Dean Burnham, as ``the high priests of the American civil
religion.'' Ever since Washington's hagiographers invented the myth
of the cherry tree, they have longed for virtue in them. This
thirst reflects more than mere idealism. It reflects the fear, as
Shogan, a political correspondent for The Los Angeles Times, puts
it, that the country has ``a political and governing system that
was designed not to work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You and you alone can awe the insolence of opposing
factions,'' Gouverneur Morris implored Washington at a time when
the great man seemed reluctant to accept the job of President. In
Shogan's view, the need for character in the White House has grown
pressing again recently. Modern innovations have rusted the
political machinery: primary elections, ballot initiatives and
television have all eroded parties as the organizing instruments of
politics; strong Presidential character is needed to fill the
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   And yet such character has not been forthcoming. In fact, Shogan
hints that attaining it may not be possible. In 1996, for example,
some voters judged that Bob Dole's trustworthiness counted for more
than Bill Clinton's empathy; but more thought the opposite. In
1976, a majority voted for Jimmy Carter's honesty. But four years
later an even bigger majority decided that Carter's indecisiveness
made him unsuitable for a second term. No consensus on the optimum
Presidential character seems possible. And so America seems
destined for more years of stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The logic of Shogan's views is that America should scrap its
Constitution for a parliamentary system less dependent upon elusive
character and faster at dumping inadequate leaders. But although
Shogan does rail at one point that ``social and economic change has
transformed the anachronistic system bequeathed to us by the
Founders into a political wasteland,'' he shies away from pursuing
his argument to its bracing conclusion. Instead he offers the kind
of anecdote and color that have disinguished his long reportorial
career. Rather than attempting to demolish the edifice of American
politics, Shogan is content to amuse the reader. Which may come as
a relief.

THE ROAD HOME
</HEADLINE>
  By Jim Harrison 
 446 pp. New York: Atlantic Monthly Press. $25 
 ------ 
 O PIONEERS! 
 By THOMAS MCNAMEE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a singular comfort in knowing, on the first page of a
novel, that you are in the hands of a master:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is easy to forget that in the main we die only seven times
more slowly than our dogs. The simplicity of this law of proportion
came to me early in life, growing up as I did so remotely that dogs
were my closest childhood friends. It is for this reason I've
always been a slow talker, though if my vocal cords had been
otherwise constructed I may have done well at a growl or bark or
howl at scented but unseen dangers beyond the light we think
surrounds us, but more often enshrouds us.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the first words of ``The Road Home,'' and they
accurately prefigure the idiosyncratic grace of the narrative to
come. ``My mother was an Oglala Sioux,'' this introductory voice
tells us, ``my father was an orphan from the East . . .
intermittently mad as he was over a life largely spent on helping
the Natives accommodate themselves to their conquerors.''
</P>
<P>
   If you have read Jim Harrison's 1988 novel, ``Dalva,'' the
intricately layered world of ``The Road Home'' will be immediately
familiar. Like ``Dalva,'' this novel has multiple narrators, the
first of whom is Dalva's grandfather, John Wesley Northridge 2d, a
Nebraska country gentleman of moderate wealth and immoderate
awareness -- the one giving him the time and the other the means to
look deep into human experience. If you don't already know the
Northridge family, you soon will, so vividly does Harrison render
them, and with such economy: ``When you tell me stories about your
life,'' Dalva demands of the old man, ``why do you always pretend
you were such a nice person? . . . Everyone in town says you were
the scariest man in the county. . . . So I wish you wouldn't just
tell the good parts about yourself. I'm not some little kid, I'm
11.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the space of a few pages, Northridge's impetuous mind
will plunge into the past, leap decades forward in time, then snap
back to the present like a whip crack as he assembles what at first
seem unrelated fragments into a comprehensive and harmonious
composition. Northridge's childhood best friend, now a Lakota
medicine man, has prophesied that Northridge is soon to die, and
Northridge takes him at his word. ``I have settled down to enjoy
what I now truly believe to be the last year of my life,'' he says.
The old man returns to the calling he gave up long ago, making
sketches of the things and people he has loved. This too is a way
of coming to terms with his life: ``Artists,'' he remembers his
first wife saying, ``paint the world so they can understand its
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel's shifts of mood are as wrenching as those in its time
line; merriment topples into horror in a heartbeat: Northridge, in
1952, remembers his art school classmate Davis, on a trip back in
1909, ``swigging tequila for a toothache when he said he was going
to climb a mountain to catch the breeze. This irritated me and I
said, 'Go ahead, you fool, you'll break your neck,' and he did. . .
. He said no last words so crushed was his face but his eyes still
moved for a moment or two after I reached him.''
</P>
<P>
   This book's view of the world emphasizes connectedness, from
generation to generation and between the earth and its furred,
feathered and human inhabitants. Northridge sees these fragile
bonds as the pattern for human love, the best of all willable
emotions in a landscape of pain and sorrow. Even as an adolescent,
Northridge could manage to feel both awe and love in the midst of
fear; he remembers facing the terrifying tribal elders of a girl
whom he had impermissibly (being only half Indian and therefore, in
their view, white) pursued: ``These were not Methodist Indians but
warriors with a lineage that owed nothing to the white man. We did
not live upon the same earth that they did and we flatter ourselves
when we think we understand them. To pity these men is to pity the
gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the novel's narrative voices so fills the mind that no
other seems possible. Then suddenly another is speaking, equally
convincingly, apparently whirling away with different concerns but
in time woven into interlacing stories of cousins, daughters,
friends, dogs, horses, heartbreak, folly, violence and illness.
Hard on the death of the gentle John Wesley Northridge 2d, the
voice of his great-grandson Nelse seems at first a belligerent
slacker whine. But as the young man discovers and rejoins the
family from which he was severed at birth -- when Dalva, then 15,
was forced to give him up for adoption -- his deepening knowledge
of the never-ending waste of Indian greatness darkens the novel's
tone shade by shade, edging toward the anguish and compassion that
are the irrecusable estate of his bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   The nature-nurture conundrum that runs throughout ``The Road
Home'' comes nearest the surface in Nelse's narrative, in which
adoption removes him from Northridge nurture even as his Northridge
nature drives him back into the arms of his biological family.
Nevertheless, Harrison repeatedly insists that having Indian blood
does not make Nelse -- or his grandfather, for that matter -- an
Indian. (``Though I was half Lakota,'' the old man observes, ``I
lived as a white man and that's what mattered.'') Do these
narrators sound so much alike because of their shared nature -- or
is each speaker an inflection of the author's sensibility? Surely,
the answer is both; the coexistence of contradictions, as
Grandfather Northridge makes clear, is a problem only for those who
do not pay full attention to life.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison's voice is at its richest in the older narrators,
particularly Naomi Northridge, the widow of John W. 3d and the
mother of Dalva. Her history is the obverse of Nelse's: without
Northridge blood but immersed in Northridge heritage, she has
escaped the family curses of violence and excessive introspection,
and she shares their gifts for contemplation and bold action. ``I'm
just Naomi,'' she says, ``definitely an older woman looking at the
moon and stars, ordinary as the earth they shine down upon'' --
which is to say, not ordinary at all.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-HOME-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: ordinary at all.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paul Northridge, the fourth narrator, the brother of Naomi's
dead husband, also finds exaltation in the everyday. Echoing Yeats,
he wonders ``how you make your soul clap its hands and sing.'' The
answer, he discovers at last, lies in ``my very ordinariness,''
which leads him back home. ``The central thing about loving
someone,'' he concludes, ``is that it very much made you want to
continue living.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalva returns, in middle age, as the last narrator, reunited
with her son and, like her uncle, drawn by a mysterious magnetism
back to the Sand Hills of Nebraska. If, ultimately, this novel
offers the sort of practical wisdom suggested by the title of
Wallace Stevens's great poem ``How to Live. What to Do,'' Dalva
takes us to its home, a place beyond speech -- ``the natural world,
the grace of the divinely ordinary.'' In the mind that is
sufficiently mindful, the world as it is is enough, and
transcendence is not necessary. Love is always available, inside
oneself, to be lavished on ``the sound of horses eating oats, the
crunch,'' on ``birds and flowers, including also bird and flower
shadows,'' on ``the presence of underground rivers.'' For Dalva,
this even extends to ``my first car, the aqua convertible,'' and to
``a rooster named Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   Such awareness makes the ordinary extraordinary, the unnamable
unforgettable. To read this book is to feel the luminosity of
nature in one's own being.

RAISING THEIR VOICES
</HEADLINE>
  The Politics of Girls' Anger 
 By Lyn Mikel Brown 
 259 pp. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press. $24.95 
 ------ 
 OPHELIA FIGHTS BACK 
 By REBECCA MEAD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been seven years since a much-discussed study by the
American Association of University Women identified the phenomenon
of girls' diminishing sense of self-worth as they approach
adolescence. Since then, books like Mary Pipher's blockbuster
``Reviving Ophelia'' have further lamented the evaporation of young
girls' feistiness into hesitancy and self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn Mikel Brown, who is an education and human development
professor at Colby College, takes a different tack. In ``Raising
Their Voices,'' she argues that the popular reception of such books
has all but ignored an equally significant phenomenon -- girls who
``actively resist dominant cultural notions of femininity.'' Girls
question the weakling role assigned to them, Brown says; she
approvingly quotes one of her defiant young subjects as asking,
``Who exactly is Ophelia?'' -- a comment she interprets not as an
indictment of the school's English literature department but as an
encouraging instance of ``refusal and resistance.'' She worries
that the current rhetoric of low self-esteem ``has become a
self-fulfilling prophecy,'' and this book is an attempt to provide
an alternative prophecy, with the hope that it, likewise, will be
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   In her quest for productive anger, Brown listened over the
course of a year to two small groups of girls from 11 to 14: the
first from the working-class town of Mansfield, Me.; the second,
from a far more affluent town nearby, Acadia. Brown, who in 1992
was co-author with Carol Gilligan of ``Meeting at the Crossroads,''
another study of adolescent girls, hypothesized that Mansfield's
working-class girls would be the more active in their resistance to
social pressures; and the Mansfield girls have indeed learned about
female toughness. (She quotes one girl explaining why she wouldn't
fight with her mother: ``You should see her arms, she's got
muscles!'') More significant, these girls do not for the most part
fall prey to the anxieties that the contemporary literature would
have us believe are endemic among adolescents: one girl who,
feeling cold, had refused to take her coat off in a classroom,
recounts with scorn a teacher's interpretation that she is going
through a phase where she dislikes her body.
</P>
<P>
   The Acadia girls, whose lives are so much more cushioned, are
far less comfortable in their skins. School is a fraught hierarchy,
in which they are lorded over by the ``popular'' girls whom they
both disparage and envy. When it comes to the middle-class girls,
Brown seems to be stretching to find instances of nonconformity;
for the most part, the girls accept the prevalent female
stereotypes, referring to classmates as ``sluts'' or ``airheads.''
You almost get the impression that she would like to prescribe
poverty for them to force them into rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's thesis that working-class girls are better equipped to
avoid the epidemics of American adolescence is provocative, but her
study is conducted on what social scientists call a ``convenience
sample,'' one that came easily to hand rather than one selected to
be representative. And while Brown, whose work is unhappily
jargon-ridden, has a sharp ear for the ``ventriloquation'' of
sexist stereotypes, she is less attuned to the possibility that her
subjects may be mouthing feminist dictums -- as when a 13-year-old
tells her that ``a lot of what makes me mad is a society that
ideals the perfect woman,'' a phrase that strikes the reader as
learned rather than felt.
</P>
<P>
   Brown tries to strike an optimistic note, saying that it is
important to learn from girls' ``outspokeness.'' But she betrays
her pessimism when, in conclusion, she quotes a line from Susanna
Kaysen's memoir of mental illness, ``Girl, Interrupted'': ``It is
easy to slip into a parallel universe.'' Brown applies Kaysen's
words to the transition between girlhood and womanhood; Kaysen,
though, was talking about the movement from sanity into madness.
For Brown, it seems, one shift is not so different from the other.

THE SEARCH FOR THE GIANT SQUID
</HEADLINE>
  By Richard Ellis 
 Illustrated. 322 pp. New York: The Lyons Press. $35 
 ------ 
 THE BIG CALAMARI 
 By LAURA MILLER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the more than 50,000 species in the phylum Mollusca, few can
be said to possess much allure. Gastronomes might argue for the
more delectable bivalves -- oysters, scallops and clams -- but only
one genus fulfills the old Romantic formula for the sublime by
combining beauty with terror: Architeuthis, the giant squid.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty is harder to see. As for the terror, humanity has
been fabricating vicious intentions for Architeuthis since the
first specimens washed ashore and inspired legends of the kraken
and the sea serpent, as Richard Ellis exhaustively demonstrates in
``The Search for the Giant Squid.'' Jules Verne's ``Twenty Thousand
Leagues Under the Sea,'' and especially the Walt Disney movie based
on his novel, are touchstones for most contemporary squid fanciers,
who thrilled as children to the sight of Kirk Douglas on the deck
of the Nautilus, fending off malevolent tentacles with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Architeuthis evades us. ``No one has ever seen a
living, healthy giant squid,'' Ellis maintains. The creature
inhabits the deep ocean, surfacing only when dead or dying. Its
home -- utterly dark and icily cold, under the pressure of
thousands of feet of seawater -- is as alien to human beings as
outer space, and as inaccessible. As a result, the giant squid
presents us with zoology's last grand mystery. Architeuthis, which
can grow to a maximum (known) length of 60 feet, is one of the
largest animals on earth, but we know next to nothing about it --
not its hunting and breeding habits, or its life-span, or even its
geographical distribution.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally, we pursue it. In 1997, an expedition led by the
Smithsonian Institution teuthologist (or squid specialist) Clyde
Roper and filmed by National Geographic sought to photograph the
giant squid in the waters off New Zealand. They used a camera
attached to the body of a sperm whale, Architeuthis's nemesis,
which produced spookily mesmerizing footage of the backs of whales
as they dived to stupendous depths. This looks like those scenes of
desert highway illuminated by the halo of a speeding car's
headlights in old film noir movies, and the expedition turned out
to be as doomed as a noir hero: no squid.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Ellis, the author of ``Imagining Atlantis'' and other
books, has compiled what little we do know about Architeuthis, and
just about everything we can surmise. It has lidless eyes as big as
dinner plates. It probably changes color depending on its mood. The
sperm whale most likely disables it with a focused sonic boom,
which enables the mammal to scoop up the stunned cephalopod. Unlike
the flesh of its smaller, edible squid cousins, Architeuthis's is
saturated with ammonium chloride, which causes it to taste like a
mouthful of household cleaner. Some of the rigorously researched
pages in ``The Search for the Giant Squid'' contain more data than
anyone but the most devoted squid buff could desire. Still, after
piling on the facts, Ellis will dash off an evocative sentence
urging his reader to ``envision the giant squid lurking almost
invisibly in the blackness of the depths, its amazing eyes able to
pick out the tiniest light or movement, its muscular tentacles
shooting out to capture its unsuspecting prey,'' and send a shiver
down your spine, the kind of shiver from which squid mania is born.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely, it starts with terror, but Architeuthis does have
its own beauty, one born of mystery. In an overlighted,
overphotographed, overdocumented, prettified world, the darkness
and its strangest creature have become precious.

T. C. BOYLE STORIES
</HEADLINE>
  The Collected Stories of T. Coraghessan Boyle 
 691 pp. New York: Viking. $35 
 ------ 
 THE DAMNED OUTNUMBER THE REST 
 By JIM SHEPARD 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fact that I've just negotiated almost 700 pages of T. C.
Boyle's short fiction -- who else of his generation could have
assembled, by this point, a ``Collected Stories'' the size of the
Phoenix white pages? -- and I'm not sick to death of it attests to
its overall inventiveness, flash and just plain entertainment
value. Everything is here, each of the stories from Boyle's four
previous collections plus seven new stories, a staggering 68 in
all: the blasphemous and the hilarious, the maddening and the
moving, the weak and the strong.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of his career, Boyle has been compared to
everybody but Sappho, and there's probably no escaping
name-dropping when discussing his fiction, since he's always trying
on voices and forms, rummaging through the toy box and pulling out,
for his own purposes, other people's shticks. He has S. J.
Perelman's affection for the absurdities of pop culture as starting
point (``De Rerum Natura'' begins, ``The inventor is in his
laboratory, white smock, surgical mask, running afoul of the laws
of nature'') as well as his understanding of the comic potential of
craven narrators propelled mostly by their baser instincts: libido,
hunger, self-preservation. He has Robert Coover's wicked sense of
the flimsiness of our received cultural representations of goodness
and virtue. (In the early and hilarious ``Heart of a Champion,''
Lassie's rigorous A.K.C. morality and trouble-at-the-dam heroism
give way to her darker impulses.) He has Donald Barthelme's gift
for deadpan comic premises (``The Hit Man'' begins, ``The Hit Man's
early years are complicated by the black bag that he wears over his
head'') and for Osterizing high and low culture: ``The son
threatened to waste his father. He did not, restrained no doubt by
considerations of filial loyalty and the deep-seated taboos against
patricide that permeate the universal unconscious.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the parodies, which have as their usual M.O.
the collision of the canon with the mingy, statureless aspects of
contemporary culture. Kafka's hunger artist becomes a
publicity-grubbing cross between one of the Wallendas and Evel
Knievel. ``The Overcoat II'' puts a Soviet spin on the travails of
Gogol's hapless protagonist. Hemingway takes a double beating, once
for ``The Short Happy Life of Francis Macomber'' (this time the
female sports Banana Republic shorts and an N.R.A. marksmanship
award) and once for ``For Whom the Bell Tolls,'' with Robert
Jordan's cowardly and inept slacker of a grandson fighting contras
in Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Are Norsemen'' posits a Woody Allen type as a warrior bard
singing of mayhem and plunder. (``Some of us wore our twin-horned
battle helmets, the sight of which interrupts the vital functions
of our victims and enemies and inspires high-keyed vibrato.'') And
``Green Hell'' levels the whole travel-disaster subgenre with one
swipe, confirming that no one does cartoon catastrophe with more
panache: ``The plane is nosing for the ground at a 45-degree angle,
engines wheezing, spewing smoke and feathers. Lights flash,
breathing apparatus drops and dangles. Our drinks become lariats,
the glasses knives.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyle is drawn to that ``look of the mad saint,'' to the
obsessive, the mortifier of the flesh. He's like ``Flannery
O'Connor with a television and no church,'' as Lorrie Moore once
put it, and at first glance his landscapes -- full of comic
ignorance, incipient violence and the continual oppressive sense of
an unsparing judgment about to be rendered -- strongly resemble
O'Connor's. But setting his energetic godlessness aside, Boyle's
work seems more Calvinist than Catholic: most of the time, the
question of who's among the elect and who's damned -- the latter
stupendously outnumbering the former -- seems inexorably
predetermined. In a world divided into predators and a kind of
evolutionary backwash that constitutes their prey, the
socioeconomic group that can be described as ``the end product of
psychosomatic dieting and the tanning salon'' is singled out for
repeated scourging. Special contempt is heaped upon ``the miser,
the hoarder, the burrowing squirrel.'' The collection opens with
``Modern Love,'' about a woman who brings disposable sanitary
sheets to public theaters and requests a ``full-body condom'' when
making love, and closes with ``Filthy With Things,'' about a
married couple suffering from ``acquisitive disorders.'' A nether
ring of Boyle's Inferno seems reserved for real estate developers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a continuing preoccupation with the approaching
apocalypse, as well as the thematic motif of yuppie fecklessness
and complicity in the face of disaster. In ``A Bird in Hand,'' 10
million birds assault a homeowner's little grove of trees while his
wife is ``concentrating on a tricky picot stitch.'' Far better, in
this worldview, either to get down into the muck, to ``partake once
more of the seething life of pond, puddle and ditch,'' or become
the predator (animals throughout these stories -- whales,
elephants, even frogs -- represent a Lawrentian model of
decisiveness and passion) and be shaken to your primordial root by
``the pounce, the slash, the crack of sinew and bone . . .
terrifying and wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-BOYLE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: wonderful.'') &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, there's a lot of playing at badness -- characters
who ``thought they were hip and depraved, thought they were
nihilists and libertines, thought they'd invented sex'' -- and a
lot of the real thing. Boyle is chillingly good at noncomic
psychos, whether they're stalking a solitary forest ranger in her
fire tower in ``Sitting on Top of the World'' or mailing apiarian
death threats to adoptive parents in ``King Bee.'' The apogee of
this Darwinian strain may be found in what might be called the
Konrad stories: in ``Descent of Man,'' the evolutionary weakness of
humans is enacted by the narrator's realization that he's losing
his scientist lover to Konrad, an increasingly intimidating
chimpanzee. In its sequel, ``The Ape Lady in Retirement,'' Konrad
returns to enact, with a different woman, one of the collection's
most explicit versions of a thumb-wrestling match between Eros and
Thanatos.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the comedy in Boyle's work resides in his similes, and
in the offhand or theatrical harshness of the worldview they
reveal: ice in a glass rattles like ``loose teeth spat into a
cup.'' Someone's eyes seem to ``swell out of his head like
hard-cooked eggs extruded through the sockets.'' Such similes can
be strung together to further bury a still-twitching victim: a
daughter's hand lies across a father's palm ``like a demolished
building, a cement truck, glacial moraine.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to read 68 of these stories without becoming convinced
of the advantages of a ``Selected'' -- as opposed to ``Collected''
-- ``Works.'' Some stories echo one another. (``Hopes Rise'' seems
to be a later and more successful version of ``Whales Weep.'')
Boyle is a particularly premise-driven writer, and for every great
idea played out with wit and ingenuity -- ``I Dated Jane Austen,''
or Idi Amin as the centerpiece of a Dada festival, or a Beat
Christmas with Jack and the gang all underfoot in Mrs. Kerouac's
living room while Mario Lanza blares carols on the radio -- there's
a premise so well trammeled that you can't help wondering if it was
taken on as some sort of challenge. There's the warmed-over
Sartre-meets-Kafka of ``The Big Garage'' and the ``Tales From the
Crypt'' tire-iron irony of ``The Devil and Irv Cherniske,'' in
which a yuppie sells his soul to the Devil in exchange for more
material goods. In ``Hard Sell,'' a publicity flack negotiates a
makeover for the Ayatollah. ``The Little Chill'' stamps flat the
self-absorbed concerns of Lawrence Kasdan's film. It's like
watching 16-inch guns blow long-since-riddled wrecks out of the
water. In the least interesting of these stories, the protagonists
are straw dummies who get steamrollered and dragged to and fro to
demonstrate that it's a ferocious world out there. In the best --
stories like ``If the River Was Whiskey,'' ``The Fog Man,''
``Without a Hero'' and ``Stones in My Passway, Hellhound on My
Trail'' -- a genuine sadness is glimpsed amid all the suffering,
and the feelings generated are not simply visceral.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Boyle fans is that his more recent stories
suggest an increasing willingness to stay committed to the human
beings under examination. ``Mexico,'' one of the newest, renders
with heartbreaking empathy, rather than contempt, ``the voice of a
loser, a fat man, the maker of bad guesses and worse decisions.''
Which is a development the author may have foreseen as far back as
``De Rerum Natura'' in 1976. In that story, an all-powerful and
endlessly quirky inventor is asked, ``And which of your myriad
inventions gives you the greatest personal satisfaction?'' He
answers, ``Those to come.''

THE SHADOW UNIVERSITY
</HEADLINE>
  The Betrayal of Liberty on America's Campuses 
 By Alan Charles Kors and Harvey A. Silverglate 
 415 pp. New York: The Free Press. $27.50 
 ------ 
 P.C. 101 
 By SAM TANENHAUS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do we really need another tract on the sins of higher education?
Haven't we been told more than we ever wanted to know about the
offenses committed in academia in the name of political correctness
and multiculturalism? The opening pages of ``The Shadow
University'' aren't promising. We meet once more the durable cast
of villains: aging 60's radicals, grim-lipped feminists,
sensitivity enforcers. Worse, the authors' prose bears down on us
with all the nuance of a dropped anvil. ``Universities have become
the enemy of a free society,'' they declare, ``and it is time for
the citizens of that society to recognize this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Charles Kors, a professor of history at the University
of Pennsylvania, and Harvey A. Silverglate, a civil liberties
lawyer, deliver the unexpected. Refreshingly, they seem to believe
that even if professors teach what they wish, Western civilization
will survive. What does concern them is the threat to free
expression posed by the advent of campus speech codes -- adopted,
according to one survey, by 60 percent of American colleges and
universities as of 1989 -- and by the profusion of diversity
workshops and the like. The goal of this enormous program of
enlightenment may be laudable, the authors concede. The trouble is
that far too few institutions encourage free discussion, and far
too many promote ``censorship, indoctrination, intimidation,
official group identity and groupthink.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty members with the temerity to challenge the
new orthodoxy are not dealt with kindly. Many of the most ludicrous
examples cited in this book have received ample attention, like the
case of the University of Pennsylvania freshman threatened with
disciplinary action because, in a fit of pique, he called noisy
members of an African-American sorority ``water buffalo.'' But the
authors also describe more obscure cases, for instance that of a
sociology professor denounced by feminist colleagues for an article
he had written justifying patriarchy on the grounds that its roots
were biological. The professor was dismissed, as was a dean who
intervened on his behalf. Curiously, the institution in question
was not a left-wing redoubt but a conservative Baptist university
in Dallas. Stories like this, the authors say, are repeated in
every region of the country and at every variety of educational
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Most usefully, Kors and Silverglate provide an unsparing picture
of how campus authorities settle these cases. More often than not
the accused are prohibited from mounting even a minimal defense.
They are barred from questioning those who have lodged complaints
against them and from calling witnesses of their own. In addition,
there is a double standard. Conservative white heterosexual men,
the authors observe, are monitored like parolees, while
homosexuals, feminists and people of color get away with
comparative murder. Kors and Silverglate report that ``the theft of
student publications at universities is pandemic.'' The majority of
the stolen publications are conservative, and ``in most instances,
the thefts occur with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, Kors and Silverglate are old-fashioned civil
libertarians who support everyone's right to sound off. While most
victims of speech codes these days seem to be on the right, the
authors also deplore attempts by Emerson College to censor the rap
music played on the campus radio station. And they criticize the
City College of New York for ejecting Leonard Jeffries, a professor
of African-American Studies, from his departmental chairmanship
because of his inflammatory opinions about Jews and the slave
trade.
</P>
<P>
   One piece of good news about all this is that the press, so
often maligned of late, has covered the issue closely. Many of the
injustices described in ``The Shadow University'' were first
reported in newspapers. This shouldn't be surprising. Even the
shabbiest journalist knows the value of free speech. Kors and
Silverglate have performed a useful service too. The abuses they
describe need fixing, and this cogent book should help.

THE SIXTIES
</HEADLINE>
  Cultural Revolution in Britain, France, Italy, and the United
States, c.1958-c.1974 
 ON THE BARRICADES 
 By ELLEN WILLIS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The right's passionate hatred of the man Newt Gingrich called a
``counterculture McGovernik'' propels an all-out effort to destroy
him for offending traditional sexual morality. Most of the American
public resists the jihad, barely reacts to the explicit sexual
detail in the Starr report and seems inclined to think consensual
sex is not the state's business. It's not yet clear which viewpoint
will prevail. But whatever the resolution of the presidential
scandal, it is one more proof -- as if any were needed -- that 30
years after the fact, the conglomeration of events and symbols
known as ``the '60s'' refuses to fade into history.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the issues raised by the rebellious '60s remain
unresolved; debate on the meaning of the '60s is as contentious as
ever. Nor of course are these only American concerns. ``The
Sixties,'' Arthur Marwick's expansive narrative of the era's events
and consequences, takes as its starting point the contested legacy
of those tumultuous years in four countries: the United States,
England, France and Italy. Against this broad backdrop Marwick, a
British cultural historian, explores the question, can what
happened in the '60s be called a cultural revolution?
</P>
<P>
   The right has never doubted that the '60s were exactly that --
an unmitigated disaster for conservative social values. Not so the
left. In the United States, most liberals and leftists see the
civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements as the decade's major
achievements, while regarding its cultural radicalism as a
frivolous, if not positively destructive, distraction from ``real''
politics. In Europe, judging from Marwick's account, the idea that
the '60s were a missed opportunity for a Marxist revolution still
has currency on the left. As for those who come from the cultural
movements themselves -- at least in America -- many feminist, black
and gay rights advocates, beleaguered by racial and sexual
backlash, insist that little has been accomplished, that racist and
patriarchal institutions remain essentially unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the views about the '60s, the right's seems to me the
most accurate. The very virulence of the conservative reaction and
the continuing turmoil over cultural issues attest to the erosion
of social norms that were once taken for granted; it's
conservatives' frustration over their inability to translate their
political dominance into cultural hegemony that leads to episodes
like the Starr inquisition. This is Marwick's judgment as well. As
he sees it, the '60s (a period he defines as stretching from 1958
to 1974) resulted in a genuine and lasting '' 'revolution,' or
'transformation' in material conditions, life styles, family
relationships and personal freedoms for the vast majority of
ordinary people.''
</P>
<P>
   The signature events of the '60s -- the emergence of the
Beatles, the Berkeley and Columbia uprisings, May '68 in Paris and
so on -- are in Marwick's view only the dramatic flashpoints of a
pervasive breakdown of rigid social rules and hierarchies, in which
widespread affluence, the influence of young people, the explosion
of mass media and the development of an international popular
culture played vital roles. Taking as his purview every aspect of
the '60s -- from the early stirrings of artistic experiment, civil
rights activism and sexual rebellion to black power and the Vietnam
War to the emergence of radical feminism and gay liberation -- he
marshals in exhaustive and often exhausting detail the
cross-national evidence for his thesis. Youth magazines in France,
the introduction of divorce in Italy, student protest at the London
School of Economics, the desegregation of universities in the
American South, all appear as pieces in a mosaic of change that
stretched across the West.
</P>
<P>
   Marwick rejects the view, held by most '60s rebels and their
enemies alike, that the cultural revolt he describes was about
destroying the bourgeois social order. The champions of this
apocalyptic project he labels ``Marxisant,'' a catch-all term for
various ideologies that share ``a broad metaphysical view about
history and about how society works, derived from Marxism.''
Marxisant thinking, he says, assumes the existence of ``the
dialectic'' -- the emergence of a new cultural synthesis from the
conflict between bourgeois society and its opposition -- for which,
Marwick declares, ``there is no more evidence . . . than there is
for the existence of 'the Holy Ghost.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he cites his commitment to ``nonmetaphysical,
source-based, scientific history'' as the basis of his own
conclusion that the countercultural movements ``did not confront .
. . society but permeated and transformed it.'' Most of the
cultural innovations of the '60s ``were thoroughly imbued with the
entrepreneurial, profit-making ethic.'' Furthermore, Marwick
argues, established institutions were for the most part managed by
liberals who reacted with ``measured judgment'' to the '60s
protesters and accommodated many of their demands. When
confrontations did occur, they were caused by failures of measured
judgment, in the form of intransigent authorities and
out-of-control police.
</P>
<P>
   I can't quarrel with Marwick's contempt for the '60s fantasy of
revolution, which started with blinky-eyed delusions that the
echt-commercial enterprise of rock-and-roll was anticapitalist,
progressed to the notion that provoking the police would expose the
true, fascist nature of the system and ended by producing real
bombs. But he oversimplifies the relationship between the culture
of the '60s and its politics.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he doesn't understand the extent to which liberal
authorities' ``measured judgment'' was contingent on radical
militance and the threat of social disruption. Like the society in
general, many liberal politicians, university administrators and
other heads of institutions were genuinely influenced by the
cultural radicals' ideas, but by and large their first concern was
stability. Radicals' disregard for accepted limits made them
nervous, and their impulse was to head off trouble by making
concessions. Radicals, for their part, understood that it was only
by being uncompromising that they would get anything at all; and in
fact reforms like legal abortion and clean air and water standards
would never have been won without radical agitation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SIXTIES-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: radical agitation.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marwick's assumption of an essential harmony between the '60s
counterculture and capitalism is also too simple. The dynamic,
entrepreneurial economy of the '60s was indeed an engine of
cultural experiment. But there is another face of capitalism: the
corporation, with its authoritarian, hierarchical bureaucracy and
its subordination of human values to the discipline of the bottom
line. Cultural radicalism, with its celebration of freedom and
pleasure and its resistance to compulsive, alienated work, is
always a potential threat to the corporate system, however
profitable its music, art and favored technological toys may be.
It's unfortunate that Marwick has succumbed to the reflexive,
sweeping dismissal of Marx that (like the parallel dismissal of
Freud) is now the intellectual fashion. If he had been able to
entertain the concept of dialectics, not as a dogmatic prescription
for social theory but as a useful way of thinking about
contradictions, his grasp of the political '60s would be more
nuanced.
</P>
<P>
   Marwick's ``nonmetaphysical,'' resolutely empirical approach to
history has another drawback: ``The Sixties'' suffers from his
effort to pack so much material into a single volume. The result is
an overload of information that, paradoxically, calls attention to
what's left out (Germany, which rates only a couple of references,
is a glaring example). The author's treatment of some subjects (pop
music, for instance) is inexcusably sketchy. At the same time, he
often lets his historian's interest in trees distract him from the
analytical forest, leading him to go on about other subjects --
John Updike's ``Rabbit, Run,'' the liberalizing of liquor laws in
Memphis -- at a length far out of proportion to their significance.
There's something to be said for the sheer weight of facts
documenting the extent of change. Yet a more selective, more
focused narrative would have added considerably to the rhetorical
power of Marwick's argument.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``The Sixties'' is an important and timely
contribution to public debate. The conventional wisdom about the
'60s -- that its achievements were either trivial or evil -- has
helped produce Americans' current pessimism about the possibility
of change. Those who fail to understand their history may or may
not be doomed to repeat it, but they are certainly unable to build
on it. Marwick shows that we have something to build on.

NEW &AMP; NOTEWORTHY PAPERBACKS
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT VEALE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 ONE MAN'S AMERICA: 
 A Journalist's Search for the Heart of His Country 
 By Henry Grunwald 
 Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The former editor in chief of Time Inc. tells of how he arrived
here in 1940 as a 17-year-old Viennese refugee and worked his way
into the house that Henry Luce built, which gave him a terrific
vantage point on his adopted country. This memoir ``percolates with
anecdote, insight and charm,'' Robert W. Merry wrote here last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE COMPLETE STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; By Bernard Malamud &QL; 
 &UR; Noonday/Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $16 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most of these 55 tales focus on Jews of amazing variety,
laboring or wandering under the weight of conscience. Whether grim
dramas of workaday existence or ruminations on the meaning of love,
the best stories meld the allegorical and the everyday and brim
with ethical concerns, from the burdens of capitalism to the
enormity of the Holocaust. ``There must be many readers who will be
grateful to 'The Complete Stories' for prompting a return to
Malamud,'' Walter Goodman wrote in these pages in 1997. '' 'Is
morality a necessary part of fiction?' one of his characters asks.
The answer, in Malamud's revelatory work, remains a resounding
yes.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE ADIRONDACKS: &QL; 
 &UR; A History of America's First Wilderness &QL; 
 &UR; By Paul Schneider &QL; 
 &UR; John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $12.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In recounting more than 300 years in the life of what is now the
six-million-acre Adirondack Park, the author argues that wilderness
is not only a human invention but a New York invention. This is ``a
thoroughly readable and entertaining tour'' of the preserve and the
Indians, trappers, redcoats, magnates and others who have passed
through, James Gorman said here last year. Heart and Blood: Living
With Deer in America, by Richard Nelson (Vintage Departures, $14),
raises difficult questions about our complex relationship to deer
and wildlife in general, and tackles the troubling ethical and
ecological contradictions of hunting in the modern age. Last year
our reviewer, Robert Finch, called this ``a brave and beautifully
rendered work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MOORING OF STARTING OUT: &QL; 
 &UR; The First Five Books of Poetry &QL; 
 &UR; By John Ashbery &QL; 
 &UR; Ecco Press, $18 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his first five collections of poems (1956-72), the celebrated
author reveals his twin obsessions with self-evasion and
self-renewal, and his enthusiasm for complex poetic schemes and
outre forms of lyricism. ``The elusiveness and mysterious promise
of his lines remind us that we always have a future and a condition
of meaningfulness to start out toward,'' Nicholas Jenkins wrote
here earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOOK OF FAMOUS IOWANS &QL; 
 &UR; By Douglas Bauer &QL; 
 &UR; Owl/Holt, $12 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A middle-aged man tries to make sense of his mother's scandalous
affair when he was a boy in a small Iowa town, a betrayal that
continues to haunt him as an adult. Last year in the Book Review,
Douglas Unger called this a ``moving and lyrical'' novel that
``gracefully works its way back and forth in time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ALMOST NO MEMORY: STORIES &QL; 
 &UR; By Lydia Davis &QL; 
 &UR; Ecco Press, $14.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For many of the characters in these inventive tales, the past is
disturbing, while the present is strange and vivid. Last year our
reviewer, Liam Callanan, said the author writes ``in compressed
prose that is frequently poetic and, without question, memorable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LAST WISH &QL; 
 &UR; By Betty Rollin &QL; 
 &UR; Public Affairs, $12 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In this revised account of the author's personal encounter with
the assisted suicide issue, she describes what happened when her
terminally ill mother asked that she help her commit suicide in
1983. ``Rollin's loving portrait of her mother's life . . . is as
compelling as the account of her death,'' Susan Jacoby said here in
1985.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEMOIRS &QL; 
 &UR; By Sir Georg Solti &QL; 
 &UR; A Cappella, $15.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The renowned conductor, who died last year at the age of 84,
looks back on an astonishing career driven by an irresistible
addiction to making music. The result is a ``zestful book by a man
whose motto was 'Never Give Up' and whose appetite for work and
life comes across as genuinely inspiring,'' Paul Driver wrote here
in 1997. Bernstein: A Biography, by Joan Peyser (Billboard,
$19.95), which was originally published three years before Leonard
Bernstein's death in 1990, has been revised and updated. In 1987
our reviewer, Leon Botstein, found the profile to be gossipy and
repetitious, but said ``Peyser has managed to convey the magnitude
and range of Mr. Bernstein's talent and achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VAPORETTO 13 &QL; 
 &UR; By Robert Girardi &QL; 
 &UR; Delta, $11.95 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An American banker in Venice becomes obsessed with a mysterious
young woman with a cool touch who will meet him only at night. Last
year our reviewer, Malachy Duffy, said this ``artful novel ...
invites us to put aside our rational skepticism and enter a world
where the past is still hauntingly present.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MATTERS OF CHANCE &QL; 
 &UR; By Jeannette Haien &QL; 
 &UR; Harper Perennial, $13 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of this large novel is Morgan Shurtliff, a
wealthy Midwesterner whose character is tested during World War II
and after, when he returns to a changing country. ``Haien
charmingly takes us through more than three decades of one family's
pleasures and sorrows,'' Ruth Coughlin wrote here in 1997.

   In addition to age, generations use cultural milestones as
markers along the highway of life. The baby boomers, for instance,
were not only midwives to the birth of rock-and-roll but also
witnesses to the rise of television as a popular entertainment and
informational medium. In ``Extra Life: Coming of Age in
Cyberspace,'' David S. Bennahum notes that the generation known as
X was the first to incorporate a new home technology into its
ethos: computers. ``As computers entered our homes, we were
defining a new culture through gleeful experimentation,'' he
writes, ``one that with the Internet in the 1990's would become
dominant, capturing as much attention as did rebellion in the
1960's or jazz in the 1920's.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennahum, a contributing editor of Wired, Spin and Lingua
Franca, has written a laid-back autobiography of opinionated
observation. Memoirs of people under 30 (with the possible
exception of Drew Barrymore) often run out of interesting anecdotes
because there has not been a whole lot of living done yet. ``Extra
Life'' neatly sidesteps this pitfall, because Bennahum relives not
only his own youth but that of the personal computer as well.
</P>
<P>
   Like many memoirs, the book longs for a simpler time. Instead of
``Howdy Doody'' and Beatle wigs, Bennahum, born in 1968, wistfully
recalls learning BASIC code writing from a manual, programming
modems by hand and enthusiastically sharing his computer knowledge
with his buddies. ``To know the machine as we did, so intimately,
is to forever change the way we experience our machine-mediated
world,'' he observes. In many ways, he is a classic poster child
for those of us who came of age in the late 70's and early 80's.
(Full disclosure: I'm 31.) The family moved frequently, his parents
divorced when he was young and, mired in adolescent angst, Bennahum
discovered, as many of us did, the magical world of pixels and
programming through Pong, a popular arcade video game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours was the first generation to have toys that bore little
relation to the world of adults, or reality on this planet,'' he
recalls. ``They came from a galaxy far, far away, as the opening
titles to 'Star Wars' suggested.'' With gadgets like these and some
preteen experimentation with drugs enlightening his lonely
Manhattan childhood, Bennahum takes his interest to the next level.
Bargaining with his father, he strikes a deal -- his dad will buy
him a home computer in exchange for excluding his hoodlum friends
from his bar mitzvah's invitation list. With an Atari 800, 48
kilobytes of RAM and a cable to attach the thing to a television
set to convert the screen into a monitor, he's off and running.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book dwells too long on certain details of his life
(his youthful druggie days bring to mind ``The Basketball
Diaries,'' except with Upper East Side nerds), Bennahum sticks to a
steady narrative pace and re-creates well his mind-set and
childhood loneliness. In a memorable chapter, he alternates his
recollections with the script of a computerized role-playing game
to amplify his explanations of just why computers enticed him so
and how he applies basic computing principles to his life.
</P>
<P>
   Like amateur acousticians who prefer the sound of analog vinyl
records to digital compact disks, Bennahum is a purist. After
examining the past, he voices his concerns for the future, worrying
about the commercialization of the Internet and fearing that slick
off-the-shelf software with easy-to-use interfaces will keep people
from truly understanding their machines (whether they want to is
another matter). ``Such camouflaged technology changes into
wizardry or sorcery, becoming the alchemy of our time,'' he warns.
</P>
<P>
   With low-key but astute introspection, ``Extra Life'' strips the
surface layers to find the roots of both a generation -- one expert
at converting alienation into self-sufficiency -- and one of its
milestones. A milestone that, in Bennahum's view, ``would cross
over and become a rich part of our culture, world culture. . . . A
new media. . . . Here is where it would happen -- not at Microsoft,
or in some mysterious research lab. It would happen out here, built
by us, for ourselves.''

CRIME
</HEADLINE>
  By MARILYN STASIO 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's this boat, see, all sparkly bright and gleaming in the
sun, sailing up the Hudson River to Albany. To the New York state
legislators who voted to give it a trial run as a riverboat casino,
the pretty cruise ship represents a legitimate source of new
revenue. But to the bold thieves standing on the shore in Richard
Stark's dazzling crime caper ``Backflash'' (Mysterious Press/
Warner, $20), the Spirit of the Hudson looks like ``a big shiny
white empty box, going upriver to be filled with money.''
</P>
<P>
   The meticulous planning that goes into their ingenious heist is
typical of Stark (Donald E. Westlake, in noir humor) and of Parker,
the master strategist of this series, who organizes a crack team of
professional con men and killers -- each and every one an artiste
at his trade -- to empty the pretty white box of its newly
accumulated loot. Parker spares no detail and leaves nothing to
chance; but he can't control the human wild cards that run amok in
this deck, and before you can say ``Deal me out,'' the delicate
infrastructure of his brilliant scheme begins to topple in a wave
of panicky violence. The cool killings that resolve this setback
are as skillfully managed as the steel-nerved dialogue and
cold-blooded code of honor that give Parker's gang its peculiar
charm. Meanwhile, anyone who took this trip for the sightseeing can
hang over the side of the Spirit of the Hudson and marvel at the
wonderful life studies Stark makes of the proud old towns clinging
to the edges of a time that has passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   The ardent feminism that distinguishes Anne Perry's Victorian
mysteries finds its ideal focus in ``A Breach of Promise'' (Fawcett
Columbine, $25), which hinges on the scandalous public trial of
Killian Melville, once widely admired as ``the most brilliant,
dazzling, creative architect of the age'' but now despised for
weaseling out of a promise to marry his patron's daughter. The
distraught genius engages Sir Oliver Rathbone to present his case
but refuses to tell his barrister why he cannot, under any
circumstances, marry the girl. In his puzzlement, Rathbone turns to
William Monk, the private inquiry agent who has uncovered many a
horror in this series, and to Hester Latterly, who is currently
caring for a young officer gravely wounded in India.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the jarring coincidence that sets up the resolution,
the story is full of feeling and weighted with intelligent thought
about the status of women in mid-Victorian society. Outraged by
``the whole forced performance of grooming every young woman for
marriage and . . . judging her human worth by her
marriageability,'' Perry makes an impassioned case for every person
who, like Hester's hideously disfigured patient, becomes an outcast
in society's attic.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about the blues, Ace Atkins lets us know in
``Crossroad Blues'' (St. Martin's, $21.95), ``something mysterious
and dark.'' The down-and-dirty music of the Mississippi Delta sure
does tug at the hero of this frisky debut mystery, a gone-to-seed
blues historian named Nick Travers who plays harmonica at JoJo's
Blues Bar, the ``last of the old New Orleans blues joints.'' When a
rival musicologist disappears into the delta landscape with a stash
of lost recordings by the legendary Robert Johnson, Nick takes
himself upcountry to pick up the trail.
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't quite make it to the mythic crossroads in
Greenwood, Miss., where Johnson met up with the Devil, Nick does
run across a few hellbent psychos who are pretty scary, and he
interviews some old bluesmen whose scratchy voices catch the ragged
cadences and downbeat mood of the delta. Although Atkins could use
the tip on style that JoJo gives Nick on his harmonica playing
(``It wasn't about being fancy. . . . It was about bringing the
right emotion out at the right time''), when his old guys open up
you can really hear the music everybody talks about so
reverentially.
</P>
<P>
   For a bunch of liberated lesbians, the characters in Joan M.
Drury's ``Closed in Silence'' (Spinsters Ink, paper, $10.95) spend
more time talking about hair than the entire beauty salon of
Southern honeys in ``Steel Magnolias.'' In fact, Mary Sharon,
Teddie, Rachel, Grace, Julie and the narrator, Tyler Jones, have so
much to say about their looks, their lives, their loves and how,
some 20 years after graduating from college, they came to be
huddled together on an island in the San Juans, that the story is
half over before a body turns up to open the mystery. But if
efficient storytelling is not Drury's strong suit, she certainly
knows how to establish the right atmosphere for a whodunit. That
probably doesn't say much for a book that tries with deadly
earnestness to deliver meaningful insights into character and
relationships. But for what it's worth, Drury has a knack for
setting a scene. Who knows -- she might yet get around to the
story.
</P>
<P>
   A graffito in a tough neighborhood of Edinburgh -- ``Won't
Anyone Help?'' -- tells the whole story of ``The Hanging Garden''
(St. Martin's, $24.95), another rubbed-raw police procedural in Ian
Rankin's superior series featuring his enigmatic detective, John
Rebus. This time, it's all up close and personal for Rebus, whose
daughter is made the target of a hit-and-run ``accident'' to teach
him a lesson. As she lies hospitalized in a coma, Rebus wonders
which of his current cases inspired this dreadful act of vengeance:
The distinguished scholar suspected of being a Nazi war criminal?
The gangsters fighting a vicious war to corner the market in drugs,
guns and prostitutes? Or could it be Candice, the young Serbian
woman he is trying to rescue from the white slave trade? The answer
that emerges after the customary genre rituals of violence are
observed does not address the deeper issue raised by the wall
graffito. Only Rebus does that, by caring for all the people he
tries to help. ``Their stories fascinated him,'' Rankin writes.
``When part of their lives, he could forget his own.''

 HOW I GOT THAT STORY 
 By CHRISTOPHER DICKEY 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has lived through combat and tried to talk about it
to someone who has not will remember the look. There is excitement,
at first. But then the listener's eyes draw away, sympathetic but
distant and, finally, simply uninterested. And you realize suddenly
that you have made your life, and your near death, a bore. So after
a while, you do not talk about the war to those who have not been
there. If you're a journalist, you write the story, publish the
picture. You talk about other things.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Anderson, a journalist who has been in many danger zones,
including Bosnia and Chechnya, knows this. So, too, do the
characters in his haunting first novel, ``Triage.'' It is a story
of war, the photographers who cover it and the people they leave
behind. It is about the insidious guilt that attaches itself to the
deaths of all those you saw dying but could not save, because you
never can: not the shrunken babies in the refugees' arms; not the
young woman whose red handprint, streaked on the wall, lingers in
the house where she had thought she would find shelter. None of
them. It is the guilt that comes from having been the ultimate
voyeur at the ultimate moment.
</P>
<P>
   The novel opens among Kurds facing an Iraqi assault in the late
1980's, another episode in a fight that only the Kurds or the
correspondents and aid workers who travel among them ever seem to
care about, ``a perpetual second-tier conflict,'' as Anderson
writes. Mark Walsh, an American freelance photographer, has been
wounded and finds himself in a hideous makeshift hospital where the
Kurdish doctor can do nothing but guess at which patients are
beyond his feeble power to heal. To make room for those coming
freshly wounded from the battlefield, the doctor tags the men he
thinks have no chance to survive; then he shoots them. The Kurdish
warriors, those proud perennial losers of Middle East history, call
themselves Pesh Merga. ``Do you know what Pesh Merga means?'' the
doctor asks Walsh. ``It means 'those who face death.' A romantic
name don't you think? Poetic. I myself have never seen one face
death; they all turn away at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh is not tagged for mercy killing. He makes it out to Turkey
and back to his Spanish girlfriend in Brooklyn. But he does not
talk about what happened to him in the mountains of northern Iraq.
He does not explain what happened to the friend who went with him
to Kurdistan but did not come back. ``He kept the details of his
work to himself as if it were all some desperate secret,'' Anderson
writes. ``He would be quiet for a few days, waiting for his mind to
adjust to peacefulness the same way eyes had to adjust to the
dark.''
</P>
<P>
   If only his mind would adjust. But it betrays him, and as it
does, his body begins to shut down. His legs no longer function.
The world of his apartment closes in.
</P>
<P>
   One does not feel very sorry for Walsh, in fact. We don't know
him that well. We never have any real idea why he has spent nine
years of his life photographing combat. For Walsh, as for many
other correspondents and photographers, war has become a job, a way
of life, sometimes a rush. And then it's all you know how to do. Is
there a reason that he searches out suffering thousands of miles
away from home when there is so much of it just down the street?
Walsh doesn't know, or guess, or ask. He moves along the brittle
surface of the pain that he sees, as if it had no roots in his own
experience. All we know is that his parents have retired to Fort
Lauderdale, a brother has a nice apartment in Seattle, one sister
is in San Diego and another is in Chicago. When Walsh was little,
he used to watch the evening news while sitting on his father's
lap, and sometimes it made him cry. So much for history, culture,
faith, family, all the things so important to the people he
photographs as they die in obscure wars. A typically rootless
American, Walsh can hardly begin to understand their conflicts,
their lives or their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh's girlfriend, Elena, however, has a European's sense of
history. She has a woman's knack for deflating a man's pretensions
of bravery, a woman's need to know the things he will not admit. We
are not sure what has brought Elena to her barren loft with Walsh,
but we do know what she is running from: the history of the
grandfather who raised her. She has discovered that he operated a
special clinic for Franco at the end of the Spanish Civil War. Papa
Joaquin took in war criminals and ``purified'' their thoughts
before sending them back into the world. This is the inherited
guilt she lives with, and which she hopes to atone for.
</P>
<P>
   Then Joaquin insinuates himself back into her life, hoping to
cure Walsh. The old fascist is still spry, bright and unrepentant.
He is the character who gives the book its life, its grim but
genuine humor and all of its worthwhile surprises. Into the sere
landscapes of a Hemingwayesque novel about men at war comes this
Roman Catholic conscience straight out of Graham Greene, full of
doubt, anger and hard-earned, hard-edged wisdom. Joaquin was not a
voyeur, but a participant in a vast and monstrous war. ``Because
decent men never act as quickly as tyrants, the decent of both
sides were soon dispensed with. And because cruelty has always been
man's most awesome weapon -- capable of shocking entire nations,
entire peoples, into submission -- the spoils of victory went to
those who showed mercy the least, who knew cruelty the best.''
Joaquin learned in Andalusia, where history had always moved with
such cruel deliberation, ``that history was now to become like a
falling object, constantly gaining momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Triage'' you will find that there are a few peasants who
are far too wise, or at least too articulate, and some long
passages of dialogue that should have disappeared in earlier
drafts. And there are times when I wish Anderson's design for this
novel were a little less schematic. There are too many layers of
triage: in Kurdistan, in a New York hospital and in Joaquin's
defunct center for ``psychological purification'' -- plus the
sorting that takes place when Elena examines the files of refugees
at her job in the United Nations, or when Walsh selects his slides
on the light table. But the thought that lingers at the end of the
book remains strong. Those who look death in the face do what they
can, and it is all they can do. As reporters, as photographers,
even as voyeurs, they try to make the rest of us glimpse, at least
for one uncomfortable moment, the thing we did not want to see.

AT HOME WITH THE MARQUIS DE SADE
</HEADLINE>
  A Life 
 By Francine du Plessix Gray 
 Illustrated. 491 pp. New York: Simon &AMP; Schuster. $27.50 
 ------ 
 THE PORNOGRAPHER AND HIS WIFE 
 By EMILY EAKIN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Standing by your man has newfound respectability. Once the
province of the poor, the powerless and the naive, wifely displays
of fealty and forgiveness now meet with feminist approbation.
Today, even at the highest echelons, there is strength in
abjection, honor in stoicism, virtue in endurance. All of which
makes the timing of Francine du Plessix Gray's latest biography,
``At Home With the Marquis de Sade,'' impeccable.
</P>
<P>
   In Gray's boldly imaginative retelling, the long-suffering
spouse of history's most infamous rake becomes a praiseworthy
enabler of greatness. Through sex scandals, police raids and prison
terms, Renee-Pelagie de Montreuil de Sade, the marquis' plain,
unschooled and, to his mind, sadly underpedigreed wife, remained a
model of devotion. Though what was demanded of her -- particularly
in the conjugal bed -- might not always have been to her liking,
Pelagie, Gray writes, never wavered. While her husband languished
in the Bastille, Pelagie lived hand-to-mouth just to keep him in
cutting-edge frippery and rich desserts. During a single month in
1784, according to prison logs, she had 12 packages of strawberries
delivered to his cell. When she wasn't traipsing around Paris in
doomed efforts to satisfy his wants (``We're sending back to Mme.
de Sade the useless bonnet,'' he scolded in a typical thank-you
note. ``We doubt it would even fit a 5-year-old child''), she was
busy petitioning for his release, overseeing his real estate
holdings and paying him marital visits (she bore him a child
conceived in the Lyons jail). The single recorded exception in this
chronicle of exemplary servitude involved a request from the
marquis for custom dildos. Dutifully, Pelagie approached local
cabinetmakers, only to have them laugh in her face when they
learned the proposed objects' dimensions. ``I beg you to release me
from this errand,'' she entreated her husband, apparently to no
avail. But even this, Gray urges us to consider, was humiliation in
the name of a greater good: ``It was solely through Pelagie's love
and dedication that the Marquis de Sade's talents were able to
flower and become part of the Western heritage.'' In other words,
without his wife's tireless ministrations, the irascible marquis
might never have written a word.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, of course, will share Gray's horror at this
thought. Once revered as a martyr of the French Revolution (``the
one complete and thoroughgoing revolutionary of history,'' Aldous
Huxley gushed), a freedom-loving philosopher of the first rank and
a novelist whose literary gifts earned him a place in the
prestigious Bibliotheque de la Pleiade, Sade has lately been
treated as a dangerous fraud. His philosophical ideas, where not
blatantly plagiarized, have been exposed as wholly derivative, and
his vaunted novels -- which one commentator likened to ``the sacred
books of the great religions'' -- viewed as pornography of a
particularly insidious kind. Roger Shattuck, perhaps the most
eloquent of contemporary Sade bashers, has deemed ``Juliette'' -- a
1,000-page orgy of rape, murder, sodomy, incest, dismemberment and
bestiality -- the literary equivalent of toxic waste. Susceptible
readers, he warns, might attempt some of these scenes at home. His
proof? Ted Bundy read the marquis.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, though she turns Pelagie into something of a
cardboard saint, Gray's take on Sade is mercifully short on cant.
Obviously an admirer -- she extols his ``visionary gifts'' for
``expressing humankind's most bestial urges'' -- she is
nevertheless at pains to demystify her subject. Husband, homeowner
and parent, her Sade is more comfortable hanging out at the estate
in Provence than preening or skirt-chasing at court. From letters,
laundry lists and grocery bills, Gray extracts the temper of his
marriage, noting the tenderness (unlike most upper-class couples,
the Sades used the familiar tu form of address), the material
extravagance and the gourmandise. The affinity between husband and
wife could hardly have been greater, Gray writes: both had been
``lonely, affection-starved children.'' (In ``Sade: A Biographical
Essay,'' University of Chicago, $29, Laurence L. Bongie challenges
such an interpretation with suggestive new evidence that Sade's
mother was a far more involved and affectionate parent than
previously supposed.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus is Gray's Sade domesticated -- and thoroughly defanged. Yet
the feat is difficult to sustain. There is frustratingly little
home in ``At Home With the Marquis de Sade.'' Though his marriage
lasted 27 years, Sade spent 15 of them in jail or on the lam. Even
when he was a free man, his taste for prostitutes and kinky sex
kept him frequently on the road. Like everything else, Pelagie
seems to have taken these absences in stride, just as she looked
the other way while Sade seduced her little sister right beneath
her nose. And yet, when it came to matrimony, Gray would have us
believe, the marquis was something of a prude. ``Perhaps because of
his high regard for his wife,'' she writes, ``Sade developed a
notably idealistic view of marriage. With one exception, all of his
liaisons were held with courtesans, whores and young domestic
helpers, and he prided himself immensely on never affronting 'the
sanctity of wedlock' by committing adultery with a married woman.''
``There was no inappropriate sexual relationship,'' you can almost
hear him saying -- and believing it!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-SADE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: believing it!) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even Gray, however, must eventually concede defeat.
Three-quarters of the way through her book, the saintly Pelagie
deals the tale of marital idyll an unexpected blow. On the eve of
her husband's release from the Bastille, she obtains a formal
separation and promptly drops out of his life. It's an act for
which Gray seems unable to forgive her: ``Having survived greater
measures of passion and devotion than most women experience in 10
lifetimes, she returned to being the placid, conventional creature
she had been before she met Donatien de Sade. Reclusion, religious
devotion, the petty groveling of a provincial Catholic life, would
now be the measure of her days.''
</P>
<P>
   Equally entertaining but more persuasive is Gray's evocation of
historical context. The marquis' sexual and literary
transgressions, she suggests, were excessive not in kind, just
degree. Whipping and sodomy were all the rage at 18th-century
bordellos, and composing highbrow smut was a favorite pastime of
many a Provencal noble. In fact, she notes, some of the century's
finest erotica can be traced to the pen of Sade's distant cousin,
the future revolutionary Mirabeau. As for Sade himself, much of
what we know about his illicit activities, Gray justly points out,
comes from reports filed by a high-ranking inspector on the royal
vice squad, a man whose job was not to stamp out moral deviance but
to record its prevalence in exacting detail for the king's
titillation. This same monarch maintained a brothel of adolescent
beauties for his personal use in a mansion near Versailles.
</P>
<P>
   Among Sade's other misfortunes, Gray contends, he was a victim
of circumstance. He was an easy target for the rebellious municipal
courts in their war against the arbitrary -- and for aristocrats
exceptionally preferential -- juridical treatment meted out by the
crown. In 1768, already in detention in a royal jail on charges of
whipping a woman until she bled, the marquis was pursued with
single-minded zeal by the Paris court, which publicly denounced his
crime and issued a (thoroughly redundant) warrant for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The marquis, however, was a repeat offender, and no amount of
historical context can explain away his penchant for
self-destruction. Typical of his escapades, Sade blithely engaged
six adolescents to ``work'' at his estate, despite serious
continuing legal trouble and heavy surveillance by the authorities.
Six weeks later, the region was buzzing with news of wild orgies at
the castle, and the parents of the young hires were suing the
marquis on charges of abduction and seduction. Like other Sade
biographers before her, Gray at this point turns to Freud. And
while diagnoses of narcissism, delusional identity and infantile
anality may not entirely satisfy, her larger point is sound.
Lusting, raging and whining his way through life, Sade was no
revolutionary hero or infernal fiend, just one very big, very bad
baby. ``With Pelagie acquiescing like some cosmic wet nurse to his
every longing,'' Gray writes, ``he howled like an infant to be
readmitted to the paradise of instant gratification, constantly
schemed for yet stronger orgasms, yet more baroque choreographies
of desire.'' Here, presumably, lies his value as a writer: an
unmediated access to the presocialized id, to the whole terrible
underworld of the psyche that Gray believes lurks inside us all.

 THE FIRST SYLLABLE 
 By SUNIL KHILNANI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was as if everybody were suddenly tired of doing things
that had meaning. They wanted to sit down, in the grass or around a
heap of smoldering logs, and listen to stories.'' Roberto Calasso's
gloss on the epic intricacies of the Mahabharata, the longest story
in the world, might also stand as a caption to his own new book,
sleepless in its storytelling. But we should not be disarmed, for
the book, ingeniously translated from the Italian by Tim Parks, is
equally quick with meanings.
</P>
<P>
   The third in a planned five-volume work, ``Ka'' -- which the
publisher describes as ``stories of the mind and gods of India'' --
follows the high torsion of ``The Ruin of Kasch'' (1996), which
evoked the emergence of the modern from the collapse of the past,
and the more languorous seductions of ``The Marriage of Cadmus and
Harmony'' (1994), which subsumed the whole of Greek mythology in a
single meditation.
</P>
<P>
   To read ``Ka'' is to experience a giddy invasion of stories --
brilliant, enigmatic, troubling, outrageous, erotic, beautiful. Yet
``Ka,'' like the two previous books, is not a novel. Calasso's
form-defying works plot ideas, not character. A writer with
philosophical tastes, he thinks in stories rather than arguments or
syllogisms. The two epigraphs to ``Ka'' announce this style:
Spinoza's remark that ideas are only narratives or mental figures
of the real world and, from the Yogavasistha, a definition of the
world as being ``like the impression left by the telling of a
story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ka'' is the emotional and philosophical nub of Calasso's
five-volume project. His acutely nominalist temperament finds its
ideal home in the stories of India, especially those early stories
of the Aryans, which affirm always the power and sovereignty of
mind. As Atri, one of the seven rsis, or seers, of the Aryas (the
people that migrated from central Asia to India and became the
upper castes there), says, ``Every true philosopher thinks but one
thought; the same can be said of a civilization.'' The one
crystallizing insight of the Aryan intellect, as Calasso sees it,
is that the existent world ``only exists if consciousness perceives
it as existing. And if a consciousness perceives it, within that
consciousness there must be another consciousness that perceives
the consciousness that perceives.''
</P>
<P>
   It is to this vertigo-inducing thought that the stories of
``Ka'' constantly return. The book opens and closes with a flight
by Garuda, the great eagle best known as the steed of Vishnu but
here cast in a central role. At the beginning and at the end, he
reads the Rig-Veda, intrigued by the incantatory question of Hymn
121 of the 10th book: ``Who (Ka) is the god to whom we should offer
our sacrifice?'' Like Garuda's inky feathers, this question rustles
through the book. The answer (if a reply so mysterious may be
called that) is Prajapati: the ``nameless and shapeless'' one,
whose secret name is itself Ka, or ``who.'' He precedes even
Brahma, the creator and first god of the later Hindu triad of
deities (the others being Siva and Vishnu). Alone, Prajapati is
without identity: ``He didn't even know whether he existed or
not.'' In fact, Prajapati is nothing less than mind, manas; and,
desiring to know himself, to gain self-consciousness, he creates
the world, bringing forth beings able to perceive one another.
</P>
<P>
   In the span between Garuda's taking wing twice, the stories of
``Ka'' enact the emergence of consciousness, always split between
the self and the I, atman and aham. As Garuda perches on the
immense tree of life, puzzling over the identity of Ka, ``the very
syllable from which everything had issued forth,'' the stories
stream out.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the Rig-Veda, the book navigates the narrative
ocean of the Brahmanas, the Upanishads, the Mahabharata and the
Puranas, as well as stories of the Buddha. The stories become more
orotund as we move ``from the allusive cipher of the Rig-Veda and
the abrupt, broken narratives of the Brahmanas . . . to the
ruthless redundance of the Puranas.'' And, in the vast wake of
stories that succeed the Rig-Veda, the names of the gods change, as
do the literary genres and the demands on the listener: ``There was
a time when he'd been obliged to solve abrupt enigmas, or find his
head bursting. Now he could heap up rewards merely by listening to
the stories as they proliferated. The shift had to do with a
growing weariness: the era of the bhakti had begun, the era of
obscure and pervasive devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Calasso regrets that shift, and the imaginative heart of his own
book is in the austere hymns and narratives of the Aryans -- the
Rig-Veda and the Brahmanas. These stories -- of sacrifice, of the
mind and the world, of sovereignty -- are superbly narrated here.
We know very little about the Aryans. There are no Aryan monuments
or artifacts -- only ``words and gods. They left nothing else.''
The Aryans, ``more interested in grammar than in glory,'' were
``masters of the goaded, greased, hard-brushed, well-honed word.''
Their world revolved around contemplation of ``the simple fact of
being conscious,'' and around sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most memorable passages of ``Ka'' re-creates for us
the asvamedha, the sacrifice of the horse. This eerie ceremony
begins with the release of a stallion. It must wander for a year,
never retracing its steps, thus establishing the boundaries of the
King's dominion. During the wait for the horse's return, narrative
is born -- a 10-day-long story cycle is repeated 36 times. On its
return, the horse -- which, in that favored Sanskrit locution, iva,
has ``in a certain sense'' become the world through its wandering
-- is strangled after an elaborate ritual. Then, in an odd
maneuver, the first wife of the King takes the dead horse as her
lover; finally, its body is ``broken up like a line of poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   As Calasso sees it, the ancient world of sacrifice, of
prohibition and authority, is ruined by the coming of the Buddha.
The Buddha wishes to ``eliminate the residue,'' the leftovers from
which everything new is generated (the pursuit of nirvana is
nothing less than a wish to extinguish the residue of a lived life
-- rebirth). His doctrine prefigures our own world: ``What would
one day be called 'the modern' was, at least as far as its sharpest
and most hidden point is concerned, a legacy of the Buddha. Seeing
things as so many aggregates and dismantling them. . . . An arid,
ferocious scholasticism. . . . Total lack of respect for any
prohibition, any authority.'' Here, Calasso's hieratic nostalgia is
apparent: Aryan India suggests to him a comforting pastorale, just
as it did to those scholars of religion, Mircea Eliade and Georges
Dumezil.
</P>
<P>
   Calasso has drawn on a wealth of Western Indological scholarship
in preparing his book. But he is no po-faced purveyor of
Orientalist bookishness, and he freely recomposes to suit his own
intellectual obsessions. If firmly with the ancients in his
political tastes, Calasso has a modernist enthusiasm for formal
experiment: his narratives are a literary analogue of the painterly
technique of anamorphosis, juxtaposing disparate events, ideas and
styles, and only yielding up their meanings from a hidden vantage
point. ``Ka'' has horse-headed gods joke fearfully about ending up
as a ``papier-mache sign over the door of some boucherie
chevaline,'' and he does not disdain the occasional post-modernist
wink (``Hybridization is de rigueur these days'').
</P>
<P>
   Prajapati is compared to Kafka's K., Proust is a ``Vedantic
master though unaware of being such''; the elusive meaning of
``brahman'' is given a Wittgensteinian gloss, while the seekers of
the mysterious substance called the soma become Baudelaire's
``prophetic tribe with blazing eyes.'' Proust is in fact a key to
the narrative constellations of ``Ka'': Proust, for whom the
inescapable puzzle of the self, its elusiveness and mutability, is
so intimately tied to the recognition that the mind is the world,
and who writes ``as if the universe was captive, lost in the midst
of my consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   Calasso shares Proust's ambition to create a work that surpasses
literature: like Wagner's ``Ring'' or Mallarme's notion of
literature as simply the ``Book,'' which was emblematic of the
creativity of the entire universe -- in a word, a work that enfolds
within itself all there is. The Mahabharata is perhaps the fullest
realization of that intention, ``the first of those 'works that are
too complete, works in which everything is expressed.' '' As Vyasa,
its composer, says of it, ``Whatever is here, on Law, on Profit, on
Pleasure and on Salvation, that is found elsewhere. But what is not
here is nowhere else.'' Such works, like the world and like our
selves, will always ``mean too much.'' And whenever we get tired of
worrying away at their meanings, we can always settle down to
listen to the stories they also tell.

A MAN IN FULL
</HEADLINE>
  By Tom Wolfe 
 742 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. $28.95 
 ------ 
 MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA 
 By MICHAEL LEWIS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Norton Simon Museum, in Pasadena, Calif., there hangs a
self-portrait of the 18th-century French painter Maurice Quentin de
La Tour. The artist wears an expression of intense
self-satisfaction and the foppish attire of the flaneur. Just below
him is a note from the curators that tells you who he was and why
he looks so pleased with himself. Unlike most academy painters of
his day, the note explains, Quentin de La Tour chose to work in
pastels rather than oils. Pastels were widely dismissed as
superficial by the oil painters, but the effects this artist
achieved were so powerful that the oil men were forced to take
notice. And with each new pastel the oil painters became more
fearful that Maurice Quentin de La Tour would put them all out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the note, I couldn't help thinking of Tom Wolfe. Wolfe
has spent the better part of 35 years sketching America with
pastels. Time and again his work has achieved effects as impressive
as those of oil-based prose. In the early part of his career he was
treated by serious literary people as an annoying distraction. But
then he went deep in 1987, with his first novel, ``The Bonfire of
the Vanities,'' and he wrote a flamboyant end zone jig of an essay
in Harper's Magazine, in which he argued that his sort of novel
writing was the best sort of novel writing. At that point Wolfe
ceased to be merely annoying. He became a public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent dust-up has been billed, and not only by Wolfe,
as Tom Wolfe versus the Academy. It was never as simple as that. I
recall in particular a letter to Harper's approving of Wolfe's
essay from Walker Percy, who was, and is, about as welcome in
academia as a writer can be. And even at their most shrill the
academicians did not appear to view Wolfe as a serious threat. They
did not feel they had anything to fear from this Master of Pastels.
And perhaps, back then, they did not.
</P>
<P>
   But now they do.
</P>
<P>
   If there was in fact some wan spirit disturbed by the success of
``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' he will be suicidal after ``A Man
in Full.'' The novel contains passages as powerful and as beautiful
as anything written not merely by contemporary American novelists
but by any American novelist. The book has its flaws (what book
does not?) and there are things that can and will be said against
it. But that is what happens when a writer has the audacity to
attempt what Wolfe has attempted: the stuffing of the whole of
contemporary America into a single, great, sprawling comic work of
art. He may not have quite managed to fit it all in. But he has
come closer to doing it than even his admirers could fairly expect.
</P>
<P>
   The story of ``A Man in Full'' does not really lend itself to
simple summary. The protagonist, Charlie Croker, is a
megalomaniacal white Atlanta real estate developer whose empire,
along with his identity, is hurtling toward bankruptcy. Meanwhile,
a black football star at Georgia Tech, Fareek (the Canon) Fanon, is
accused of raping the daughter of a prominent white Atlanta
businessman. The two events converge like a pair of churning
rivers, and all of Atlanta is swept away in the deluge. Charlie's
wives, his bank officers, his white business friends, his black
legal adversaries, his former employees -- all these characters
find themselves in their own peculiar jams. (All Wolfe's characters
seem to start out in trouble on their way to even bigger troubles.)
Nevertheless, each finds time to visit misery upon Charlie Croker.
</P>
<P>
   It is tempting to say that ``A Man in Full'' is about race.
Certainly it contains a great deal about race. But race is
subsidiary to the book's great theme, which is the decline of Old
South agrarian values -- or, at any rate, the New South's idea of
Old South agrarian values. The author doesn't appear exactly to
mourn the decline, at least not in the usual, sentimental fashion
of the Confederate widow. He seems simply to wish to make a study
of the phenomenon. And Charlie Croker, the embodiment of Old South
agrarian values, is his lab rat. Having created Charlie, Wolfe sets
the whole of the modern world in opposition to him. And truth be
told it is not always clear who gets the better of the struggle.
Here he is on Charlie's chief aide-de-camp:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wiz was young and fit, but he was neither manly nor
unmanly. He was a financial officer and a technogeek. He ran six
miles before dawn every morning solely to keep the Wismer Stroock
cardiovascular system lubricated and tuned up for the long-term
project, which was to live forever. . . . He produced an HP-12C
calculator from the side pocket of his jacket, and the ditch down
the middle of his forehead deepened, and he began pecking away.
That damned HP-12C was the Wiz in hardware form. It was the
wizard's wand of the technogeeks. Charlie couldn't stand the sight
of it, because it utterly baffled him and made him feel how cut off
he was from the new generation coming out of the business schools.
Curious about the thing, he had once asked the Wiz to let him try
it for a second. He tried to enter 2 + 2. He couldn't get 4!
Couldn't get 2 + 2  &QC;  4! Turned out that with this damned machine,
you had to enter + 2 plus + 2. It worked backwards or something.''
</P>
<P>
   In many respects ``A Man in Full'' is the sort of novel you
would expect Tom Wolfe to write. His instincts remain those of an
especially acute and zealous tour guide. He insists on grabbing
hold of your lapel and showing you all the strange sights he has
seen with his own eyes. You want to hear the 14 different dialects
spoken in the greater Atlanta area? Look . . . here! You want to
see how a man in full captures a rattlesnake with his bare hands?
Look . . . here! You care to see a world gone mad, in much the same
way the world is mad, only more intricately and amusingly so? Look
. . . here! A fair criticism of ``The Bonfire of the Vanities'' was
that Wolfe's reportorial interests stopped just short of the
ghetto. He didn't much sully his white suit. That criticism is not
likely to be reapplied to ``A Man in Full,'' which offers a
harrowing tour of the American underclass, starting in a meat
freezer and ending in a prison. And if there was ever a more
chillingly persuasive depiction of the inside of an American
prison, I haven't read it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-NYTBOOK-TOM-WOLFE-2NDTAKE-NYTSF &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: read it.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The novel also has the same deliciously irresponsible feel of
much of Wolfe's work. He toys with human fears and anxieties the
way a mischievous boy might play with a new chemistry set. No
sooner has Wolfe invented a character than he is asking himself,
``What can I do to this human being to cause him the most searing
social pain?'' A light-skinned black with a middle-class
upbringing? Toss him into the black ghetto! A homophobic throwback
who owes his bankers $200 million? Force him to buy a table at the
museum's retrospective of a gay painter of lurid homosexual scenes!
It sounds contrived, and it is. And yet somehow -- don't ask me how
-- these characters and their situations rarely feel contrived or
stereotypical. They're real! There were moments when I would not
have been surprised to turn the page and find a glossy section with
their photographs.
</P>
<P>
   All very Tom Wolfe. But in at least one way this book is not at
all what you might expect. There is something more going on here.
The book is as funny as anything Wolfe has ever written; at the
same time it is also deeply, strangely affecting. This may be
because Wolfe runs a risk here that he has never before run in
fiction: he takes one of his characters dead seriously. That
character, Conrad Hensley, is a young man who, with a kick from
Charlie Croker, falls rapidly to the very bottom of American
society. Conrad believes the world is just, and his insistence on
that belief drives him mad. He is easily satirized; but Wolfe
declines to satirize him. Instead he gazes up at the reader from
between the lines as if to say ``who can blame him?''
</P>
<P>
   In sparing one poor soul from his satire, Wolfe runs a pair of
risks. The first and most obvious is artistic: it is hard enough to
compose a monumental comic novel without tossing in the
complication of a tragic figure. (For God's sakes man, keep it
light!) The second is . . . well, I'm not quite sure what you'd
call it. Personal risk, I suppose. In his refusal to expose Conrad
as he exposes everyone and everything else, Wolfe inevitably
exposes himself. There is something moving in that, in the great
writer taking risks that he does not need to take. He could very
easily have had himself another whopping great hit without sticking
his neck quite so far out of his lemon-meringue collar. But he
stuck out his neck anyway, and for no reason other than that he
wanted to take a chance on his very best.
</P>
<P>
   The novel has a couple of obvious soft spots. The sheer
unbridled pleasure Wolfe takes in showing you things for the first
time -- Look . . . here! -- tempts him to turn all his characters
into tour guides. When a white male bank officer who has spent two
decades envying Atlanta's rich citizens arrives in the best Atlanta
neighborhood he is unlikely to gaze upon it as if he has dropped in
for the day from Mars. (``Peepgass was all eyes. Rolling lawns,
absolutely perfectly cut.'') The ending is also typically
disappointing. It's unfortunate that Wolfe doesn't know how to end
his novels but there isn't much to be done about it. He achieves so
many of his comic effects from the clashing of points of view, and
he spawns such an extraordinary number of characters whose points
of view we care to see clash, that there is no hope of anything
approaching a satisfying resolution to it all. As he roars toward
his climax Wolfe must himself realize that he would require another
500 or so pages to gather up all his split ends. And so, with a
horrible thunk, he just drops a hairball on the reader.
</P>
<P>
   But this is no note to end on. It's just too fine a book to
dwell on its weaknesses. Too fine, and too long in the making. The
moment I heaved ``A Man in Full'' up into my lap a distressing
thought crossed my mind: ``My God, this one could be his last.''
Hard as it is to believe, Wolfe is pushing 70, and he seems
incapable of writing a masterpiece inside of a decade. How sad to
think of the world without some book by Tom Wolfe in the works. And
how dull! In any case, rather than open the novel at the beginning,
I leafed immediately to the end, to read Wolfe's final words: ''
'Oh, don't worry,' said the man of the world, 'I'll be back.' ''

  A Catholic Son's Return to His Jewish Family 
 By Stephen J. Dubner 
 Illustrated. 320 pp. New York: William Morrow &AMP; Company. $24 
 ------ 
 UNCONVERTED 
 By JONATHAN WILSON 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The excitements of religious conversion continue to exert a
dramatic hold on the contemporary imagination. In 1996, when
Stephen J. Dubner, an editor and writer at The New York Times
Magazine, published in that magazine an abbreviated account of his
parents' choice of Catholicism over Judaism and his own subsequent
return to the Jewish fold, he was deluged with mail: letters of
approbation and disgust, accounts of parallel stories and so on.
John Cardinal O'Connor quoted from the article in a Sunday sermon
at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York (albeit against the grain of
the narrative), and Dubner quickly became, in his own words, ``a
sort of Jewish poster boy,'' a speaker in demand at synagogues,
Hanukkah candle lighting ceremonies and even a Hasidic bar mitzvah.
</P>
<P>
   All this he recounts in the final chapters of his intense,
acutely observed and, in its documenting of both his intimate and
extended family's move through history from intolerance to
open-mindedness, exigent memoir. ``Turbulent Souls,'' in a manner
appropriate to the spiritual oscillations of the personalities
under scrutiny, features two distinct narrative voices (third
person for the parents' story, first person for Dubner's own), each
of which manages to incorporate and elucidate a number of points of
view, including those of Dubner's grandparents and siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the book charts the constantly fascinating
journey of Brooklyn-born Solly Dubner and Florence Greenglass, as,
at first independently and then in powerful compromise, they move
away from the rigid Jewish orthodoxy of their parents to embrace
what frequently appears to be an equally uncompromising set of
Roman Catholic dogmas. Elated by their crossover, and freshly
transplanted to a rambling, Spartan farmhouse in upstate New York
(the rundown place and its nonetheless ``magical'' ambience are
splendidly evoked), Florence and Solly emerge as Paul and Veronica
Dubner, pillars of the local church, and the spiritually charged,
if materially impoverished, parents of a thriving brood of eight.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dubner, the youngest of the children, separated by 16
years from his eldest sibling, Joe, characteristically knows the
least about his parents' former lives. Inevitably, perhaps, he
surfaces as the most inquisitive of the children, the one who in
later life comes to fill in the cultural spaces that ultimately
explain why, on Sunday afternoons, his father would occasionally
break into ``My Yiddishe Mama'' as he danced through the kitchen to
``grab a hunk of gefilte fish from the refrigerator.''
</P>
<P>
   What Stephen learns as an adult, from both his mother and other
relatives (frequently new discoveries) as they approach or inhabit
old age, engages a story that is at once enlightening and baffling,
as the ways of the spirit tend to be. It is not that his parents
have ever hidden the fact that they were once Jews; quite the
contrary, but the major players in and the texture of their
pre-Catholic lives have remained a secret history. Among the
secrets are the facts that his mother was first cousin to Ethel
Rosenberg (Communism was, of course, anathema to the strictly
devout Dubners, and his mother's reaction to the electrocution of
her cousin is both subdued and conflicted) and that, after learning
of his son's conversion, Stephen's grandfather, Shepsel, rent his
clothes and sat shiva, mourning Solly/Paul as if he were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Solly's and Florence's roads to conversion are laid out
carefully and sympathetically with the mystery at their heart,
especially where Solly is concerned, both respected and carefully
guarded. Has the Holocaust played a part in influencing decisions?
It isn't clear. Years later Stephen's Uncle Sam trenchantly remarks
that ``the why is a never-known.'' Solly comes to Christianity
after the death of his mother and via the loneliness and depression
that accompany him through his experiences as a G.I. in the
Pacific, where he is the only Jew stationed, suggestively enough,
on Christmas Island during the last years of World War II.
Florence's journey begins with an existential childhood experience
during sickness: lying in bed with a cold she hears her friends
playing outside and thinks, ``Boy oh boy, life goes on all by
itself whether I'm there or not.'' But the meanderings of her
spirit are truly shaped by two Catholic mentors: her ballet teacher
Mme. Asta Souvorina, and a priest, ``a tall, handsome young
Irishman,'' Father Conroy of the Church of the Blessed Sacrament in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of ``Turbulent Souls'' has Stephen Dubner echo the
steps of one or the other of his parents as he turns from
Catholicism to Judaism. His mother, after a moment of profound
revelation, abandoned a promising future as a dancer to embrace the
church. Similarly, Dubner deserts a rock band on the edge of
stardom because he takes stock and finds rock life empty. His
father, it seems, was at the deepest level drawn to the Virgin Mary
by the loss of his own mother, for whom Mary is a replacement.
Stephen Dubner, although he never quite wants to acknowledge it,
appears pulled to Judaism, which he feels instinctively like a
melody in his soul, as at least a partial substitute for his
father, whom he lost to death at 10.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way on his spiritual excursion Dubner is nudged, and
sometimes shoved, by powerful mentors and guides, like Ivan
Kronenfeld, his girlfriend's acting teacher; Simon Jacobson, a
Hasidic rabbi for whom Dubner ghost-edits a collection of teachings
by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitch leader; and,
most bizarrely, a high-gloss matron from Miami whom he meets at a
party.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Dubner's Jewish incarnation is, however, strikingly
moderate in comparison to his parents' radical Catholicism. Where
Paul and Veronica pushed the envelope of religious experience both
spiritually and politically by organizing groups of charismatic
Christians to practice glossolalia or, in his mother's case,
picketing at abortion clinics, Stephen is content to learn a little
Hebrew, study a little Talmud, utter a few prayers, light his
Shabbos candles, amiably discuss Jewish issues with Upper West Side
friends and yearn for a Jewish wife who will give his mother ``her
first Jewish grandchild.'' Nothing wrong with this picture unless
you believe that the Truth must come in blows. Indeed it is
Dubner's admirable and relentless pursuit of the middle road (a
calling that leads him to Cardinal O'Connor for advice on how to
handle Mom's persistent objections to his newfound faith -- she
presses on him a coffee-table book called ``The Living Gospels of
Jesus Christ'') that ultimately secures a poignant gathering of
both the Catholic and Jewish members of his family: those alienated
from one another by the events of the distant past and those who
for years have simply been unaware of the others' existence. The
family reunion, a model of religious harmony and mutual respect,
looks like progress, and it is. It also looks like a personal
resolution for Dubner.
</P>
<P>
   But the story doesn't end there: slipping into the Church of the
Blessed Sacrament for a Jewish look-see at midnight Mass last
Christmas Eve, ``I instinctively dipped my hand into the holy water
and crossed myself,'' Dubner writes. Habit, he thinks, not heresy.
It's O.K. Nevertheless, while it is clearly better for Stephen
Dubner if his turbulent soul stays quiet, I think readers of this
wonderful book will rather hope that a continued measure of
unsettlement inspires him to write more.

TALES OF THE URBAN LEGEND
</HEADLINE>
  (Color photo illustrating a motorist attacked from the backseat of
a car) 
 By KATHERINE LEE 
 c.1998 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This one's true, I swear. A friend of my mother's was at a gas
station late one night, and when she paid the attendant, he told
her to get out of the car, because her money was counterfeit. When
he got her inside the gas station, he told her he had just called
the cops because there was a guy in her backseat with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   Heard that one? Then you might also have heard about the Mexican
chihuahua. Or the girl who fell asleep in the tanning bed and
cooked her insides. Or the vanishing hitchhiker who was really a
ghost.
</P>
<P>
   They're all urban legends, spread for decades by word-of-mouth
and relying on the use of what cultural anthropologists call the
FOAF: Friend of a Friend. A friend of a friend had his kidney
stolen, bit into a Kentucky Fried rat, ate an apple with a razor
blade in it, microwaved her cat ...
</P>
<P>
   Urban legends themselves haven't changed much over the years,
but they're getting a boost from modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the Internet has helped to spread and validate
urban legends, since people seem to believe what they read on their
PCs, no matter how unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible how it's proliferated,'' said Jennings Bryant,
director of the Institute for Communication Research at the
University of Alabama. ``It's an interactive medium that's targeted
for mass consumption.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall the urban legend provides the inspiration for a film
from TriStar Pictures/Phoenix Pictures called, appropriately
enough, ``Urban Legend.'' When a series of strange deaths occurs on
a New England college campus, a student (Alicia Witt) suspects that
they are murders based on urban legends. When she gets too close to
discovering how the deaths are connected, she realizes she's the
killer's next victim.
</P>
<P>
   Urban legends will use whatever path is available to them, says
Bill Ellis, an English professor at Pennsylvania State University,
Hazleton, and president of the International Society for
Contemporary Legend Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been in circulation since ancient times, and they've
developed as the mass media developed,'' he says. ``They were sold
on broadsheets in Shakespeare's time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folklore puts a name and a face on an issue that's usually
threatening and difficult to get a handle on.''
</P>
<P>
   Stories about organ thievery, for instance, may arise from
medical advances and recent rumors about foreign countries selling
organs for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the stories deal with society's fears of the unfamiliar,
according to University of California at Berkeley anthropology
professor Alan Dundes, who teaches a class on popular folklore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urban legends center around people's anxieties about certain
things: unfaithful spouses, the parent-child relationship, the loss
of a kidney,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The themes are all a subject of concern. They reflect real
problems in the world, although the stories themselves are lies.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, there's the story of the woman who brought back
what she thought was a chihuahua from her vacation in Mexico, only
to find that the little dog was actually a giant rat. This is
really a comment on xenophobia, a fear of anything foreign, Dundes
says.
</P>
<P>
   Other stories deal with fantasies, most commonly involving
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rotten husbands fooling around with their secretaries who get
shown up are common,'' Ellis said. ``People want to see others
exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Conspiracy theorists have taken to the Internet, both to
dispense their own scenarios or to find evidence to substantiate
them, no matter how dubious. Take, for example, former Kennedy
adviser Pierre Salinger swearing that he had proof that missiles
shot down TWA Flight 800. The proof he cited came from a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Internet) is given more credibility than it should
because of how the information is dispensed,'' Bryant said. ``It's
electronic. You can print it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, Dundes says, has done nothing more to urban
legends than make them easier to spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make them any harder to debunk, but it reaches more
people,'' he said. ``The problem with the Internet is that half of
what's on it is junk.'' Dundes refuses to open an e-mail account
himself because he doesn't want to be inundated with false
information or spammed with e-mail ads.
</P>
<P>
   Only one legend has cropped up solely because of the advent of
the Internet: computer viruses that can instantly wipe out
everything on someone's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting that the warning against e-mail viruses is
actually the virus itself,'' Ellis said. ``It's spread around,
talked about, takes up energy. It functions as a virus. It's a mind
virus. It infects the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Because rumors on the Net are virtually impossible to trace to a
source, they can also be damaging, since many urban legends involve
nefarious behavior on the part of a person or corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based department store Neiman-Marcus periodically fights
off an urban legend about a $250 cookie recipe. As the story goes:
A woman who ate at the store's cafe was so taken with the cookie
she was served that she requested the recipe. Upon being told that
the price of the recipe was ``two-fifty,'' she allowed the waitress
to add the amount to her charge card. When the bill came, the price
was actually $250. The store refused to remove the charge, so the
woman sought revenge on the Internet by passing along the recipe
for free.
</P>
<P>
   Variations on the store and the recipe abound. Versions include
a red velvet cake served at Saks Fifth Avenue, a cookie recipe from
Mrs. Fields' or a devil's food cake at Nordstrom's.
</P>
<P>
   Author Kurt Vonnegut became the real-life subject of an Internet
rumor when he was credited with delivering a commencement address
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology that included such sage
advice as ``Wear sunscreen,'' ``Get plenty of calcium'' and ``Be
kind to your knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of the speech bounced from e-mail box to e-mail box until
Vonnegut's words became legendary. The only problem was, they
weren't Vonnegut's words. Chicago Tribune columnist Mary Schmich
had written the mock commencement address to entertain her readers.
</P>
<P>
   Vonnegut himself wasn't aware of the hoax until his wife asked
when he had been to MIT.
</P>
<P>
   How could such a simple truth morph into an urban legend? That's
part of the appeal of urban legends. Finding their starting point
is practically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is a utility,'' said Ellis. ``If it's a useful
story, people think, who cares if it's true?''
</P>

A WINE SNOB? MOI?
</HEADLINE>
  By FAREED ZAKARIA 
 c.1998 Slate 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once, the great villain of the wine world was phylloxera, a
louse that lived on the roots of vines and, in the late 19th
century, destroyed virtually every vineyard in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is the wine snob, a louse who terrifies wine drinkers
everywhere with his supposed expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone hates the wine snob. Winemakers angrily decry his
(always his) pernicious influence in the business. Wine writers in
particular are at pains to explain how much they despise wine snobs
and, in case anyone was wondering, are not ones themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly they are terrible fellows, these wine snobs. But what do
they believe, and what do they say that so enrages wine writers? I
ask all this only so as to better identify the enemy for, of
course, I am not now, nor have ever been, a wine snob--whatever one
may be.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out there exists a guide to wine snobbery, sort of ...
In their book ``Wine for Dummies'' (IDG Books, 1998), Ed McCarthy
and Mary Ewing-Mulligan provide a set of icons to help the reader
navigate the text. So, on the left of a paragraph with technical
information there usually appears an icon labeled ... ``Technical
Stuff.'' (Remember, as the title implies, the reader is not a brain
surgeon.) One of these icons is a sketch of a dweeby guy with
saucer-shaped eyes, wearing a bow tie and pocket square. Captioned
``Snob alert,'' this figure is sprinkled throughout the text to let
the unsuspecting reader know when he or she is face to face with
wine snobbery in any of its forms.
</P>
<P>
   The first appearance of the icon alerts you that wine snobs tend
to serve cheap sparkling wines labeled ``champagne'' to
unsuspecting guests. How declasse! I always thought these guys were
ritzy!
</P>
<P>
   Later in the book we learn that wine snobs tend to buy
super-expensive bottles from special wine lists in restaurants--a
waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   We also learn in the book that wine snobs are no experts. They
believe that all wines aged in oak are fantastic but, as the
authors explain, some wines can be ``over-oaked,'' and stainless
steel fermentation is the best way to make many white wines.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and wine snobs mistakenly think that varietal names
(Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, etc.) indicate quality. Now, if you
thought that wine snobs were the types who touted their knowledge
of wines named after obscure French villages, well, they're that
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine for Dummies'' begins with a paean to ``some parts of the
world'' where people drank wine without fanfare. The restaurants in
this Eden didn't have wine lists. But then came the fall.
``Sophisticates, information addicts, and seekers of status have
made wine so complicated that many people are too confused to drink
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with invoking this mythic French town is that those
people drank wine like water, and most of the stuff they drank was
awful. (If you don't believe me, try a French regional wine that
costs less than $5.) They had no choice, since they had no wine
from other regions, let alone countries.
</P>
<P>
   If everyone treated wine as they did, there would be no market
for a book like ``Wine for Dummies.'' If you don't need a wine
list, you certainly don't need a 400-page tome, dense with
information, explanations, names, tasting tips, and much more.
</P>
<P>
   Most wine is made to be drunk quickly and without any
discussion. Fine wine, however, is a carefully crafted product that
deserves some appreciation. And it is a complicated subject; not
because wine snobs make it such, but because the number of grapes,
places, vintages and styles of wine are immense.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of new high-quality regions such as New Zealand
and Oregon, the complexity has increased over the last 20 years.
People who study the art of winemaking and who have either
naturally or through practice developed the ability to distinguish
among the bewildering array of wines in the world may legitimately
be considered experts. Their discussion of wine is bound to be more
detailed and esoteric than the layperson's or even the casual wine
drinker's.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as in any of these other areas, there are snobs,
people who use their knowledge to intimidate the layperson or to
make the appreciation of wine seem unattainable. This is all the
more infuriating because fine wines have certain class connotations
that can be used to browbeat people easily cowed by that sort of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   But wine experts should be treated like numismatics experts. If
you want to know something about their arcane subject, ask.
Otherwise, ignore them. Just as you can die happily knowing nothing
about coin collecting, you will be no poorer if you never find out
what maloatic fermentation is.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a quality revolution, most wines--certainly those over
$7 or $8--are decent, and many below that price range are pretty
good.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that what has changed is not a sudden rise of wine
snobs but the fact that wine drinking is becoming a routine
activity in upper middle-class American life. Winemakers and
writers all want to cater to this growing audience and that means
education through self-esteem enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   The title of ``Wine for Dummies'' (and of another such book,
``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Wine'' Macmillan, 1997) is
obviously ironic. What it really means is that the reader is no
dummy at all; he's savvy and should trust himself. There's nothing
wrong with this advice, but it's an amusing and successful
marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a pose that allows writers who are engaging in the
obviously esoteric, expertise-ridden business of writing about wine
to claim that they are actually at one with the masses. Populism in
all its hypocrisy has finally reached the wine world.

   _ Make chores ``off limits.'' Unplug the phone or let the
answering machine take calls. Make a ``no laundry'' rule. (After
vacation, have ``cleanup day.'' The entire family hauls the
mountain of laundry to the Laundromat to use the ``big'' machines.
Afterward, stop for pizza.) And don't scrub that tub!
</P>
<P>
   _ Create your own motel. Have the kids make room number signs to
be taped on bedroom doors. Put fresh sheets on each bed. Reassign
sleeping quarters for everyone (maybe even for mom and dad!).
</P>
<P>
   _ Go camping. Pitch a tent in the living room (or just use
sleeping bags). Make s'mores in the microwave and have ``room
service'' delivery. Use flash lights, eat hot dogs for dinner and
tell ghost stories.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get mom out of the kitchen! Cook some meals in advance and
freeze. Use paper plates and cups. Serve bagels, cream cheese and
orange juice for breakfast. For lunch, picnic in the park or in
your backyard. For dinner one night (watch the kids' faces!), serve
just ice cream with lots of fruit. Plan to eat at least one meal a
day at a restaurant or get takeout.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create your own restaurant. Instead of dining at one big table
at home, set up folding tables and chairs to resemble a mini
restaurant. Older kids can take turns being waiters, diners and
short-order cooks. (Have ingredients handy for making mini pizzas,
sandwiches or other kid-friendly meals.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Plan Ahead for Fun &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Find close-to-home activities. Try the zoo, bowling, art
museums, nature walks, local amusement parks, water parks or
movies. Go to the library and get info on free local events (puppet
shows, concerts in the park, story hours). Or visit the local
historical society or natural history museum and find out if
dinosaurs lived in your ``back yard'' millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plan a day trip. Check out a neighboring town you've never
visited. Head to the local mountains, lake or beach. Or drive to
the nearest train station and take a morning train ride to the
nearest town _ for lunch! (The kids can buy a train postcard and
mail it to themselves _ or to grandma _ from the next town.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't forget the evening's entertainment. Let the kids decide
in advance what talent they would like to display. Then enjoy a
``floor show'' after dinner. (Keep your camera handy!) Or open up
the sofa bed in the living room (or use the floor) and pile on the
pillows. Pop popcorn, watch old home movies or rent an old family
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Remember the Souvenirs &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Give each child some souvenir money. Then, as you go to the
train station, the natural history museum, or the zoo, keep an eye
out for train whistles, arrowheads, animal books, toy dinosaurs...
</P>
<P>
   _ Make your own family vacation souvenir. Make or buy a kite.
Then create a special tail using markers or fabric paints on strips
of white cloth. Have family members decorate the kite and add their
names. (Be sure to add ``Vacation '98'' to the tail.) Consider
making a new kite during each at-home vacation as a fun way to
preserve your kids' artwork and to remember special times.

HELP YOUR BABY UP TO THE PLATE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: The proper names Brittney and Elisabeth and Sheah are cq.) 
 By HILORY WAGNER 
 From Child magazine 
 World rights  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   From his first mouthful of rice cereal at 4 months, Lanita
Cunningham's first child, Vinnie, delighted in every new food he
was fed.
</P>
<P>
   So a few years later, the Hubbard, Ohio, mom was surprised when
Vinnie's sister, Brittney, didn't have an immediate taste for
solids.
</P>
<P>
   Their family pediatrician said it was time for Brittney to start
solids at 6 months _ but she had other ideas. ``Every time I got
the spoon to her mouth she'd put up a huge fight,'' Cunningham
says. ``If I got anything in there, she'd scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Brittney's protests continued until she was nearly 8 months old,
when she discovered her brother's Cheerios and began feeding
herself.
</P>
<P>
   It seems everyone _ particularly your baby _ has an opinion on
the subject of solids. Doctors warn about starting too early,
grandparents wonder why you haven't started yet, and at the center
of it all, your baby spits her strained peas back at you faster
than you can put them in her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's challenging to sort through all the conflicting
messages,'' says Elisabeth Schafer, a professor of nutrition at
Iowa State University in Ames. ``Thirty years ago, parents were
told to begin solid foods as early as the first few weeks, while
the current advice is to wait until between four and six months.''
</P>
<P>
   The best way to decide when to begin is to understand your
baby's nutritional needs and the milestones that must be reached
before her first solid meal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Before the First Bite &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The two most important cues that a baby is ready to eat foods
have nothing whatsoever to do with hunger,'' notes Schafer.
</P>
<P>
   First, an infant should be able to hold his head steady and
upright while being fed. He may not yet be able to sit up on his
own, but he should be able to stay in place with support. If he's
sliding out of his chair, it may be wise to wait a few weeks before
introducing solids.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, perfect posture will get a baby nowhere at the dinner
table if his tongue and mouth muscles are not well developed. A
baby's tongue-thrust reflex works fine for nursing or bottle
drinking, but the same motion pushes solid foods right back out. As
this reflex diminishes gradually between 4 and 6 months, your baby
will be better able to move food to the back of his mouth and
swallow it.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing a baby to eat when his tongue-thrust reflex is still
strong can make him gag. ``Tyler pushed everything out,'' notes
Sofia Hollum of Santa Maria, Calif., who tried to start her
5-month-old son on solids. ``I fed him several times that first
week, but it all ran down his chin.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempting to feed a baby who is not developmentally ready can
have other ill effects. Under about 4 months, a child's immature
immune system and gastrointestinal tract may take offense at the
introduction of solids, causing diarrhea, vomiting, rashes, or
respiratory symptoms (such as wheezing).
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a study by researchers at the Christchurch School
of Medicine in New Zealand found that children who ate four or more
different types of solid food before 4 months had almost three
times the risk of developing recurrent eczema. They believe
exposure to a diverse diet with a variety of proteins and chemicals
_ that babies' digestive system can't handle _ may predispose
children to this condition.
</P>
<P>
   No matter when you decide to start solids, it's imperative that
breast milk or iron-fortified formula continue to be baby's dietary
mainstay throughout the first 12 months, cautions Sheah Rarback, an
assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Miami School
of Medicine. ``Babies may not be eating enough from a spoon to get
the proper amount of nutrients,'' she says, adding that no other
foods are as nutritionally balanced and complete.
</P>
<P>
   But after six months, she observes, there are specific
nutritional needs that can best be filled by solids. For example,
babies need more iron, says Rarback. ``Babies are born with iron
stores they built up in the last trimester of gestation, but these
need to be replenished beginning at around four to six months,''
she explains. That's why iron-fortified cereal is recommended for
all new eaters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Best First Food &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since you can't properly evaluate your child's tongue-thrust
reflex until you try a feeding, consider your first few efforts to
be trials rather than serious meals. The time of day doesn't
matter, but choose a time when neither you nor your child is
stressed. Take the edge off her hunger with some breast milk or
formula, and she will be more likely to give her new entree a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Sit your baby comfortably in a highchair or a reclining baby
seat. But remember: Up to this point, your baby has enjoyed her
liquid meals in the comfort of your arms. ``You may want to hold
her in order to reassure her during the first few tastes,'' says
Schafer.
</P>
<P>
   Start with iron-fortified cereal, preferably rice (least likely
to cause an allergic reaction). Put about a tablespoon of dry
cereal in a small bowl and combine it with breast milk or formula
to form a moderately soupy mixture, thick enough to stay on the
spoon but not so thick that your baby can't swallow it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she allows a bite or two to pass her lips, stop feeding
if you see signs she's had enough, like crying, turning her head
away, or refusing to open her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel like a failure if there's more cereal on her than in
her! After a few tries, however, if your baby has made it clear
that he is against this new activity entirely, you should probably
pack up your supplies for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first times we offered rice cereal to Brandon, he wanted
nothing to do with it'' says Elyse Nathanson of St. Louis. ``So we
held off, giving him as much formula as he wanted. When we tried
again two weeks later, it was like feeding a different baby.''

   Everyone hates the wine snob. Fine wine, however, is a carefully
crafted product that deserves some appreciation. And it is a
complicated subject; not because wine snobs make it such, but
because the number of grapes, places, vintages and styles of wine
are immense.

 &HT;    
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For nearly 60 years Lew Wasserman was one of the most powerful
men in America.
 &HT;    Wasserman and his mentor and partner in MCA/Universal Pictures,
Dr. Jules Stein, made superstars of Bette Davis, Cary Grant, Paul
Newman, Marilyn Monroe and Fred Astaire.
 &HT;    Without them Ronald Reagan might have remained a B-picture actor
past his prime, and Steven Spielberg might still be just a Long
Beach State dropout with a yen to make pictures.
 &HT;    These are some of the revelations made by Dennis McDougal in his
bombshell new book, ``The Last Mogul: Lew Wasserman, MCA, and the
Hidden History of Hollywood'' (Crown Books).
 &HT;    McDougal writes that Wasserman and Stein underwrote the
presidential aspirations of Ronald Reagan, who owed them both big
time. In the '50s, they gave him a new career on TV with General
Electric theater. In exchange, as president of the Screen Actors
Guild, Reagan sold his union members down the river by denying
their request for residuals from TV producers like Universal.
 &HT;    ``At the same time,'' says Dennis McDougal, ``Reagan is doing
side deals with Universal that keeps their studio working
throughout the SAG strike.''
 &HT;    With massive research and in meticulous detail, McDougal, a
former Los Angeles Times writer, charts the rise of Wasserman, the
boy from the wrong side of the Cleveland tracks, who started his
career as a cinema usher and rose to the top of the Hollywood heap.
 &HT;    Wasserman and Stein, first as agents then as heads of a movie
empire which encompassed films, music, theme parks and television,
developed a stranglehold on the entertainment industry.
 &HT;    Their methods, McDougal asserts, included every form of coercion
up to and including blackmail. And at the height of their power,
scarcely a picture could be made in America without their say-so.
 &HT;    Presiding over his kingdom from his Universal City black tower,
Wasserman was an enigma. Tall and very thin, with a thick crest of
snow white hair, thick black horn rimmed glasses and an
undertaker's costume of dark suit, white shirt and thin dark tie,
with nary a cigar in sight, he is scarcely the central casting
mogul of Hollywood mythology.
 &HT;    McDougal, whose book looks set to break over the back lots of
Hollywood like an incendiary device, blasts the enigma apart to
offer a grimy backstage reality behind the glittering Hollywood
facade.
 &HT;    Among the revelations: Wasserman, son of Russian immigrants,
loved only two things, money and movies and began his ties with
organized crime through his wife Edie whose attorney father Henry
Beckerman was a front man for the Moe Dalitz Mayfield gang of
Cleveland.
 &HT;    ``Nobody understood,'' contends McDougal, ``that the organized
crime strike force was interested (in MCA's ties to the mob) to the
point where they convened not one but two grand juries to
investigate MCA.''
 &HT;    The feds had received an anonymous letter, which McDougal prints
in the book, that alleged that Wasserman had hired a hit man to
kill his daughter's boyfriend.
 &HT;    Investigations of MCA and Wasserman however had a habit of
coming to naught. One Justice Department probe came to a grinding
halt in the '60s after the death of Marilyn Monroe who was
threatening to reveal all about her relationship with U.S. Attorney
General Robert Kennedy. McDougal implies that Kennedy may have
pulled off his attack dogs in exchange for Wasserman's assistance
with Kennedy's entanglement with Monroe.
 &HT;    The federal prosecutor who was pursuing MCA retired and moved to
a Beverly Hills law firm, where he suddenly died of a heart attack
at 47.
 &HT;    ``I've already been criticized in one prepublication review for
being strong on innuendo,'' McDougal admits. ``There are bold flat
statements about these deaths that I didn't make in the book and I
can't make them now. But I do think it's curious and worthy of
attention because both the Monroe death and the prosecutor's death
came at fortuitously convenient times. Maybe MCA just happened to
get lucky and these two thorns in their souls just happened to
expire at the same time in untimely ways.''
 &HT;    More solid is the story of the end of Tennessee Sen. Estes
Kefauver's investigation into the mob which had also drawn
perilously close to Wasserman and MCA, when the senator had the
misfortune to be found in bed in a New York hotel room with not one
but two hostesses from the nearby Chez Paree nightclub. The
incident found its way, in slightly altered form, into the Francis
Ford Coppola's Godfather epic.
 &HT;    In the year that Teamster chief Jimmy Hoffa disappeared and
gangster Sam Giancana was gunned down, Wasserman and his Hollywood
lawyer Sydney Korshak became more and more afraid, writes
McDougall. Korshak began traveling with a bodyguard and Wasserman
beefed up security at his Beverly Hills home and had his drivers
taught how to throw off a pursuit.
 &HT;    If Wasserman's business universe was suspect, his personal life
as depicted by McDougal, is a put under a harsh light. Sure to be
criticized for his revelations about the private life of Edie
Wasserman, a respected Los Angeles-based philanthropist, McDougal
says it was absolutely germane to his portrait of Wasserman the
mogul.
 &HT;    ``If you don't understand that Lew had no home life and that his
relationship with his wife at some point evolved into an almost
brother and sister relationship then you don't really understand
what made the guy run. He hated to go home. I mean to this day when
he's 85 and virtually retired, I understand he goes into the office
every day and does not relish the idea of having to go home,''
McDougal said.
 &HT;    Today MCA is owned by Seagram Co. Ltd.(who bought it from the
Japanese company Matsushita in 1995) and as depicted by McDougal,
the last mogul is a lonely figure with a poor relationship with his
only daughter, a strange marriage and no deep friendships.
 &HT;    ``He has no broad sweep of close friends that he can just sit
and shmooze with or feel close to,'' says McDougal. ``He's very
isolated , very alone. And I feel a certain compassion for him.''
 &HT;    In Hollywood where he has been a towering figure, and a large
donor to charities taking on Lew Wasserman even in the twilight of
his years, is a brave endeavor.
 &HT;    Says McDougal, ``One of his MCA vice presidents told me that the
most chilling thing you could ever hear was that Lew was
'disappointed in you.'''
 &HT;    McDougal admits there is much to admire in the man. ``I think he
has a very strong sense of what is good. But he compartmentalizes.
He is very capable of destroying a career and the next day ...
speak passionately and sincerely about helping labor get a decent
contract. He has many good sides but he's capable of being
absolutely ruthless.''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR NOV. 6. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The congressional election aftermath produces Friday's two lead
stories.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today, the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times go with
Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde's submission to President
Clinton of a list of 81 questions about his conduct in matters
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The move, which once upon a time would have been seen as
dynamite, is now widely viewed as a popgun in the hands of
chastened Republicans looking for an impeachment exit strategy that
won't shoot them in the other foot. And according to the New York
Times lead, the electoral shove has come to putsch, as various
Republican House members maneuver to topple Newt Gingrich. (An
inside Washington story the WP honors inside.)
</P>
<P>
   The papers report that the questions Hyde sent to the White
House focus more on President Clinton's conduct after attention was
directed towards his possible relationship with Monica Lewinsky
than on the relationship itself.
</P>
<P>
   The LAT reports that Hyde's cover letter asks Clinton to respond
in writing and under oath by signing an attached affidavit. The
questions range from asking whether Clinton took an oath to defend
the Constitution, to whether he ever gave Lewinsky cigars.
</P>
<P>
   All the papers either quote or describe some of the questions,
but the NYT, fulfilling its tradition of supplying primary sources
whenever possible, runs the entire list of them in a separate
article. Even though everybody's story makes it clear that Hyde was
asking Clinton to admit or deny the details in the list, unlike the
other papers, the WP's headline, ``House Panel Asks Clinton to
Admit Lying Under Oath,'' makes it seem that Clinton was left
without a choice.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde Thursday also announced his revised plans for substantially
downsized impeachment hearings. His main witness will be Kenneth
Starr, who will be called Nov. 19. The LAT says the two
developments taken together ``raise the likelihood that Starr's
case against Clinton could be disposed of soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers somehow keep straight faces while they pass along two
of Hyde's whoppers about all this: 1) The new shape of the hearings
has nothing to do with the election results, and 2) He's calling
Starr because ``He's someone everybody wants to hear from.''
</P>
<P>
   The NYT reports that Louisiana congressman Robert Livingston has
in recent days been conducting a telephone campaign that could lead
to him running against Gingrich for House Speaker. In addition, the
Times quotes one congressman saying there are six Republican
members besides himself who have flatly decided not to vote for
Gingrich--no small matter given the GOP's reduced edge of 12 seats.
The House Republicans, the paper explains, will cast secret ballots
for Speaker on Nov. 18, with the full House voting on the matter in
January.
</P>
<P>
   The majors all front the news that scientists at the University
of Wisconsin and Johns Hopkins are about to publish reports of
separate successful experiments in which cells culled from the very
early stages of a human embryo have, in a test tube, been grown
into undifferentiated cells that could be used to grow various
kinds of human tissue. The breakthrough is thought to pave the way
for implanting cells developed to have certain healthy properties
into a patient as a way of treating disease or defects.
</P>
<P>
   The WP and the NYT bring to the fore ethical questions the new
science is sure to raise: issues of genetic engineering and
harvesting embryos.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody reports that the Bureau of Labor Statistics
accidentally prematurely posted on its web site its information
about the number of jobs created last month. A surfing analyst
shared the inside scoop with his clients, thereby roiling the
financial markets for a few hours. The Wall Street Journal sees a
trend, reminding readers that just last Monday, the ABC News web
site accidentally disseminated false test election results. But the
paper also takes note of a model of Internet security: the
dissemination of the Starr report.
</P>
<P>
   The USAT front section cover story examines a classic example of
unintended consequences. The profusion of designer and customized
license plates may delight car owners, but it's frustrating police,
who say the 4,800-some special plates make identifying cars much
harder than it used to be. The paper mentions a case in which a
robbery victim remembered the getaway car sported a tag with
mountains on it, which would have ordinarily have been a great
tip--except that 14 states now have plates like that. And don't
forget, the paper points out, about Kansas, where the counties, not
the state, issue the license plates, meaning that any given
sequence of letters and numbers could be shared by 105 vehicles.

   The WP's Al Kamen reports that once again ``civilian'' political
junkies who sent him their election predictions did a far better
job than all those ``experts'' on TV. Nearly 20 percent of Kamen's
150 correspondents predicted Democratic gains in the House. Five of
them were only off by one seat in their total House and Senate
calls. The occupations of the best guessers included: Treasury
Dept. program manager, intelligence analyst, ex-congressional aide,
U.S. Marshal's office staffer, and--thank God--journalist.

<P>
   STORE-AUCTION (Sanderson, Texas) _ Microphone in hand,
auctioneer Ken Norris started with a large, hot- dipped galvanized
steel tub and began the rapid-fire, piece-by-piece dissembling of a

three auctioneers, and when the last piece of Kerr Mercantile's was

   CABIRIA-FILM-REVIEW (Undated) _ Joining the current crowd of

gloriously over the top in ``Velvet Goldmine,'' writer-director
Todd Haynes' visually intoxicating look at a fictional group of

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Out-flaked by Minnesota. The
shame of it all. It's bedtime for gonzo politics for the state that

George Murphy (a tap-dancer, kids) and Sonny Bono. Minnesota
elected a professional wrestler named Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura as
governor. By ROB MORSE.

<P>
   JESSE-VENTURA (Albany, N.Y.) _ In the grand tradition of Abraham
Lincoln, Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura has answered the higher call of
public service. That's right, Abraham ``The Beard'' Lincoln first
made a name for himself in Illinois as a wrestler before duty and
the nation summoned him to run the country. By STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   ASIAN-AMERICANS (San Francisco) _ Talk about ``the ethnic vote''
tends to gloss over important distinctions. This is particularly
clear in the case of Asian Americans _ where an exit poll suggests
it may be time to reconsider just who, exactly, is the ``Asian
American voter.'' By A. A. QUONG.

<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ To mark the 200th anniversary of the death
of George Washington, an exhibit drawn from his life and his Mount
Vernon estate will travel to museums in five cities around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The 170 artifacts in the traveling exhibit include Washington's
fabled false teeth, which he began wearing at the age of 57.
Contrary to legend, these dentures were not made of wood but from
human and cow teeth, and elephant ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Robert E. Lee IV, the head of the Mount Vernon Ladies'
Association that owns and maintains Mount Vernon, said the dentures
have only rarely been displayed because the association's
leadership viewed the teeth as ``too personal a matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Times have changed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But today, people are losing touch with George Washington and
we feel that by sending his dentures and other personal items that
we have in our collection on the road, we will help make him more
real and relevant to the nation, particularly to younger
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, titled ``Treasures from Mount Vernon: George
Washington Revealed,'' is designed to ``reintroduce the real George
Washington to as many people as possible,'' said James C. Rees,
resident director of Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Rees said Washington's sudden death on Dec. 14, 1799, triggered
a huge outpouring of grief that exceeded that surrounding the death
in 1997 of Princess Diana. Washington died from a throat infection
at age 67, almost three years after leaving the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Deluged with requests for mementos, Martha Washington, his
widow, sent pieces of china and swatches of his clothing to
admirers around the nation. But now Americans tend to know almost
nothing about the man whose face adorns the $1 bill, according to
Rees.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ The bloodstained military sash given to Washington by the
dying British Gen. Edward Braddock at the Battle of Monongahela in
1755 during the French and Indian War, when Washington served with
the Virginia Regiment of the British army.
</P>
<P>
   _ The only two surviving letters from Washington to his wife.
Mrs. Washington burned most of the letters her husband had written
to her over the 40 years of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   _ An iron key from the Bastille, sent to Washington in 1790 by
the Marquis de Lafayette after the destruction of the French prison
by revolutionaries.
</P>
<P>
   _ A bathing dress belonging to Mrs. Washington, made of homespun
blue-checkered linen, with lead weights sewn into the hem for
modesty's sake.
</P>
<P>
   _ A census of the slaves of Mount Vernon recorded by Washington
only months before he died. Washington freed the slaves
posthumously through his will.
</P>
<P>
   _ Four of Washington's swords.
</P>
<P>
   _ An exact replica of the mansion on a scale of one inch to one
foot. The model, ``Mount Vernon in Miniature,'' measures 10 feet
long, 8 1/2 feet high and 6 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also includes a 10-minute video, produced by the
History Channel, that presents an overview of the life and
interests of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Following is the itinerary for the exhibit:
</P>
<P>
   _ The New York Historical Society in New York City: Nov. 20 to
Feb. 22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Huntington Library Art Collections and Botanical Gardens
in San Marino, Calif.: March 16 to June 6.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, Va.: July 1 to
Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Atlanta History Center in Atlanta: Oct. 14 to Jan. 6,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Chicago Historical Society in Chicago: Jan. 28 to April
23.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit, underwritten by the Ford Motor Co., has six
thematic sections.
</P>
<P>
   The first, ``The Presence of Washington,'' evokes the physical
appearance of the first president and includes the false teeth, a
tailored suit and two portraits by Charles Willson Peale.
</P>
<P>
   The next section, ``Venturing Forth,'' reviews his early careers
as a land surveyor and officer in the French and Indian War. On
display are his compass, staff and chain and one of his earlier
professional surveys. The Braddock sash also is displayed here.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the section ``Assuming Command'' is a
full-scale recreation of the tent Washington used when he was
commander in chief of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary
War. Saddlebags, a pistol, camp bed and spurs are among the items
displayed here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pleasure of His Company'' _ the largest section of the
exhibition _ depicts his marriage, family life and friendships.
</P>
<P>
   ``On His Own Farm'' focuses on Washington's management of the
8,000 acre Mount Vernon estate.
</P>
<P>
   The final section, ``Getting A Touch of Him,'' shows how the
mythologizing of Washington began during his lifetime and reached a
feverish pitch immediately following his death.
</P>
<P>
   This includes his swords and a facsimile of his last will and
testament.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Ironically, the roots of Tuesday's defeat for
Newt Gingrich's Republicans were in Gingrich's apparent triumph
four years earlier in the Contract With America election that

correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED THURSDAY.

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ I must confess that I often bristle when, in
the voting booth, I find the ballot to be in English and Spanish. I
also was disturbed to read about a San Francisco judge ruling that
English-deprived absentee ballot voters there could vote again
because the names of seven candidates were not translated into the

   GLASS-COLUMN _ WASHINGTON _ Rather than prepare a political
pudding from the results of the midterm voting, it might be better
to follow Winston Churchill's advice and send the results back to

for Cox News Service in the Washington bureau.) MOVED THURSDAY.

<P>
   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ Pity the poor fiction writers. It's getting
harder and harder to top reality. Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, of

Minnesota. Had it happened in a novel, it would have been derided
as implausible. (McCarty, Cox News Service) MOVED

<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The government sets aside land
and provides habitat for endangered birds, bugs and lizards, right?
If we can give that sort of special treatment to the golden-cheeked
warbler and the Barton Springs salamander, shouldn't the State of
Texas establish a part of Travis County as a preserve for the
endangered Texas Yellow Dog Democrat? (Kelso, Austin

   WILD-GEORGIA _ To most folks, limbs, branches, stumps and dead
trees in a yard are simply debris - or at best potential firewood.
But for many creatures, the dead wood is home. An array of insects,
reptiles, small mammals, birds and other animals depend on dead
wood for survival. A fast-rotting woodpile, for instance, is home
to snails, slugs, wood-eating beetles and the larvae of predatory
insects like the eyed elater. (Seabrook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   HEELSPURS _ Richard Waits, 47, could barely walk at times
because of a painful foot condition that he had struggled with for
more than seven years. But after having a new experimental
treatment that uses shock waves, he is walking again; able to play
golf and most importantly, take weekend strolls with his wife. The
treatment, which uses high energy shock waves to blast away
calcifications and re-tear injured tendons in heel spurs and tennis
elbows, is giving weekend warriors a new lease on life. Atlanta is
one of five sites conducting clinical trials of the machine's
effectiveness. For the past three months, Georgia Baptist Hospital
has tested the machine for the treatment of heel spurs and soon,
the hospital will be evaluating the machine's effectiveness with
tennis elbow. (Lore, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 28. WITH

services and other ceremonial events a Torah scroll is used. The
completion of one of these scrolls _ they are hand-lettered on
specially prepared parchment _ is considered a holy moment. Just
such a moment will be observed next week (Wed., Nov. 11) by members
and supporters of the Atlanta Scholars Kollel, an educational

   METEORS _ The Earth is hurtling headlong into the most intense
cosmic sandstorm in more than 30 years. With a little luck most
people will never notice. With the wrong kind of luck, the world
may discover just how much it now depends on orbiting satellites
for weather reports, talk shows, freight deliveries, telephone
calls, pagers, even national security. On Nov. 17, the Earth will
pass through the heart of the dusty debris stream left behind by
the Comet 55/P Tempel-Tuttle on its 33-year journey around the sun.
The comet itself will be millions of miles away, but for a few
hours before and after 2:43 p.m. EST, satellite operators the world
over will be on the edge of their seats. ``This meteoroid storm
will be the largest such threat ever experienced by our critical
orbiting satellite constellations,'' says William Ailor, director
of the Aerospace Corp., orbital debris center in El Segundo, Calif.
``Some satellites could be damaged.''From busy commercial satellite
control rooms in suburban Virginia to the Air Force satellite
network center at Falcon Air Force Base, Colorado, earthbound
technicians are preparing to do what they can. (Toner, Atlanta

 &HT;    WOODWORKING: Interesting items from the Internet
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A gentleman posted a message asking where he could buy a
carver's mallet for his brother-in-law. I had assumed he was a
non-woodworker, to be asking such a simple question as this, but
apparently I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He got several replies chiding him, not for failing to realize
that mallets are available wherever woodworking tools are sold, but
for not making one himself. Evidently a light bulb came on over his
head, because he decided this was a fine idea _ even had some
dogwood available with which to make one.
</P>
<P>
   Mallets are an interesting item, because there are two basic
kinds and each has its adherents. The two kinds, of course, are the
ones made like hammers with very fat heads and the ones made like
clubs, with vertical cylinders, more or less, for heads.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of carvers say they prefer the round mallets. They are
constantly putting their mallets down on the bench and picking them
up again, and the round head means they can pick up the tool and
strike the gouge with it without having to look to see how they're
holding it _ the entire head is a striking surface.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback, they say, is a slight tendency on the part of
the tool to roll around on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Not being a carver, I prefer the hammer-head mallets. A carver,
one assumes, develops a great degree of expertise with his mallet.
Not having this expertise, I tend to strike a lot of glancing blows
with a round mallet. These seldom produce a satisfactory result and
on occasion can be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Another gentleman proposes a plan for a ``quick and dirty''
workbench, and asks everyone if they think it will be sturdy
enough. He says he's only going to use it for making ``stuff'' and
eventually will use it to make a better bench.
</P>
<P>
   Well, now, I suspect if you have to ask whether your plan will
be sturdy enough, it probably won't be. There are all kinds of ways
to build a workbench, some cheap and simple, some dreadfully
expensive and difficult, but if it isn't rock solid then it really
isn't a workbench. It's a table.
</P>
<P>
   His idea for the top is three laminated thicknesses of 3/4-inch
plywood, cut five feet long and two feet wide. I'd use medium
density fiberboard, which might well be even cheaper, but the
plywood should be all right.
</P>
<P>
   It's the underpinning that bothers me. He says he's going to use
a maze of diagonal bracing because he doesn't have the equipment to
cut mortise and tenon joints or even lap joints.
</P>
<P>
   Balderdash. If he can cut up the plywood, he can make lap
joints, and if he can make lap joints, then he can make mortise and
tenon joints.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to make 4x4 legs and braces using standard fir or
pine 2x4s. Well, they can't be standard ones; they've got to be
carefully selected, very straight ones. The mortises and tenons can
be cut with a circular saw and a chisel before the 2x4s are
laminated. The whole base is held together not with glue, but with
heavy-duty bolts, so it can be tightened periodically and also
taken down to be moved.

 &HT;    New treatment shocks pain away from foot
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For more than seven years, Rick Waits, 47, watched his
world shrink. Struggling with a painful foot condition, he could no
longer play golf or even take weekend strolls with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   And although he didn't complain, the couple realized his problem
was getting worse over time, limiting their activities and creating
a chronic, sedentary lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   But after having a new experimental treatment that uses shock
waves to mend minor bone and tendon problems, he is walking again;
able to play golf and, most importantly, take weekend strolls with
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not completely well, I've probably got about a third of
the pain left,'' Waits said. ``But the beauty of it now is all I
have to do is get off my feet for 15 or 30 minutes, and I start to
get relief. That was never the case before.''
</P>
<P>
   The treatment that turned Waits' life around involves a machine
called an OssaTron, which uses high energy shock waves to blast
away calcifications and re-tear injured tendons in heel spurs and
tennis elbows. By doing this, doctors can dissipate old scars,
cause tendons to heal correctly and alleviate pain.
</P>
<P>
   The technique, called Extracorpeal Shock Wave Therapy, has been
around since the mid-1980s, when it was first used to disintegrate
kidney stones. But researchers also suspected the process has a
number of orthopedic applications as well.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Atlanta is one of five sites in the United States
conducting clinical trials of the machine's effectiveness. For the
past three months, Georgia Baptist Hospital has tested the machine
for the treatment of heel spurs and soon, the hospital will be
evaluating the machine's effectiveness with tennis elbow.
</P>
<P>
   And that's good news for the state's weekend warriors. Serious
injuries, often from spurts of sports and exercise, aggravate and
sometimes cause bone and joint conditions suffered by one in four
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be a real solution to a lot of people's problems,''
said Dr. John A. Ogden, director of Georgia Baptist Hospital's
orthopedic division. Before the OssaTron, most doctors can only
offer basically three types of of treatment _ anti-inflammatory
drugs, devices such as splints or casts and physical therapy or
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem with the drugs is they don't fix the ailment,
but merely mask the symptoms. Devices and therapy often don't
alleviate the pain and and surgery requires more time healing and
is more expensive _ costing between $2,500 and $3,000 per
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, this procedure is done on an outpatient basis and
is expected to cost about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Anice Pearson, 62, of Peachtree City, said she was still sore
about a week after having the procedure, but it didn't hurt at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could feel it hitting against my heel, but nothing beyond
that,'' said Pearson, who had suffered from foot problems for at
least two years. Pearson had already tried ultrasound and
cortizone, but they did nothing to ease the pain. Pearson decided
to seek treatment after the ailment stopped her from walking and
playing golf. ``And I didn't want to take any more pain pills,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told her _ like all patients _ that it will take about
two weeks before she feels better.
</P>
<P>
   Waits said when he was treated, the procedure probably took
about 45 minutes. Local anesthesia was used, with the machine's arm
placed against the heel. Waits then received 1,500 jolts to the
injured area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The treatment was intense, but not scary,'' he said. ``I
wouldn't say it was a totally pain-free experience, but it was
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other options, such as a cast and physical therapy, Waits
said he actually felt better the same day. Within a couple of weeks
of treatment, he played golf.
</P>
<P>
   Ogden said the hospital has used the machine on about 30
patients. By the end of one to two months, about 80 percent of the
patients showed marked improvement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The machine _ like any shock wave device _ works by sending an
electrical impulse to an electrode submerged within a brass or
steel ellipsoid lens immersed in water. When a charge of up to
30,000 volts is fired, a small amount of water is vaporized and a
shock wave results. The wave then ricochets from the side of the
lens and reconverges at a focal point that is aimed at the injured
tendon.
</P>
<P>
   The risk of treatment is relatively low. Ogden said, however,
physicians need to take special care when treating the elbow
because it's so close to the shoulder and sensitive lung tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the process is being used in Europe, with more than
60,000 therapies being recorded in 1997 alone, up from 5,000 the
previous year. The OssaTron was developed in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Besides treating heel spurs and tennis elbow, Brown said the
machine is also being evaluated for its ability to correct
fractures that failed to heal or healed badly. It is also scheduled
to be tested for fixing loose hip prostheses.
</P>
<P>
   And applications might not be limited to humans. The machine and
technique is showing promising results with curing lame horses,
Brown said. In the U.S., clinical trials for veterinarian use
should start within the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Waits is thrilled he was able to participate in the new
therapy. For years, he said he was frustrated with the pain and the
slow erosion of his quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally got help because my wife said, `You're too young and
life's too short' to be so debilitated,'' Waits said. ``She was
right.

 &HT;    At-home mother never regretted trading places
 &HT;    By Janet Wilson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When high-powered attorney F. Carolyn Graglia
became pregnant with her first child, she decided to quit the legal
profession to pursue what she felt was a more important role _
full-time mom.
</P>
<P>
   Then her children grew up and moved away and started
establishing families of their own. So Graglia refocused her
attention, becoming an author and popular orator on the lecture
circuit, speaking about her anti-feminist beliefs on talk shows and
at workshops and seminars across the country.
</P>
<P>
   So it's a bit ironic that just when her professional career is
booming again, Eagle Forum, a national pro-family organization,
taps her as Full-time Homemaker of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed and pleased,'' says Graglia, 68, pointing to her
award, a print of an idealized farm scene hanging in the living
room of her West Austin home. ``I was surprised because they
usually give the award to younger women whose children are still in
the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum, says in the past her
organization has given the award to women who
</P>
<P>
   are still at home with their children. But she made an exception
this year because of Graglia's book, ``Domestic Tranquility: A
Brief Against Feminism'' (Spence Publishing, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   ``Her book is really remarkable and was a big factor in
selecting her for the award,'' says Schlafly, who presented the
award in Washington, D. C., in September. ``It has been so
beneficial to the role of full-time homemaker that I felt she
should be honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Graglia's initial decision to trade her legal career for work at
home was a gift she longed for as a child. She was a poor latchkey
kid from a broken home in New Jersey who ``wanted more of my
mother's time than she could give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Graglia's mother was proud of her daughter's academic
achievements and encouraged her to pursue her dream of becoming a
lawyer. But life was hard, and even though Graglia wanted more
attention, she never mentioned it to her mother because she didn't
want to burden her.
</P>
<P>
   Graglia earned a scholarship to Cornell University and, while
attending Columbia Law School, met her future husband, Lino
Graglia, a professor of law at the University of Texas School of
Law.
</P>
<P>
   By all measures, she had achieved success. She was happily
married, loved practicing law and found it a challenging and
exciting career. She had clerked for Warren Burger when he was an
appellate judge and never imagined staying home with children.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1959, when she became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   That's when she remembered when she was a toddler, sitting at a
kitchen table in what she thinks was a home day care, scared to
death that she would die before her mother came to get her.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't remember what frightened her, only that she needed
mom. That memory, she says, ``was influential'' in her decision to
stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it also was something she wanted to do. She was
never bored and she still is amazed that people think she wasted a
good education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absurd to think that you have to earn money in order to
use your education,'' says Graglia. ``My education helped make me
the woman I am today. It enabled me to be a better mother, a more
interesting wife and to create a many-faceted life out of my
domestic role.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my education that showed me how to find the greatest
delight in the simplest activities of my daily life. These are the
rewards that make an education worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Graglia's daughters _ Donna Rosenwasser, Carol Ledwith and Laura
Graglia _ graduated from college with degrees in law, medicine and
English and moved to New York City and Colorado. Graglia has added
grandmother to her growing resume.
</P>
<P>
   Another irony? Her granddaughter, one-year-old Jessica
Rosenwasser, spends part of her day with a nanny. Jessica's mother,
Donna Rosenwasser, is a New York tax attorney providing management
and financial advice to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my friends ask me whether my daughter has read my
book,'' Graglia says. ``I tell them she doesn't have to read it.
It's the same things I've been telling them all their lives. I made
my choices, she makes hers.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that some women, like her mother, must work
to financially support their families, Graglia strongly believes
all children benefit from having stay-at-home moms. She champions a
society that respects the role of, and a legal system that creates
a level playing field for, fulltime homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   In the award ceremony and in her book, Graglia credited her
husband's support with making her life as full-time homemaker
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband has always been a source of strength for me,'' says
Graglia, who has been married for 44 years. ``He supported me back
when being a career woman wasn't so fashionable and then in later
years when I became a housewife after housewife became a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this feeling that a person accepts you and stands by you
no matter what that gives you a tremendous sense of security.''
</P>
<P>
   Graglia has been by her husband's side as well, particularly in
1997 when he was harshly criticized _ and had calls for his
resignation _ after he said blacks and Mexican Americans are not
academically competitive with whites in selective institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Graglia says those days were difficult because she felt
her husband was being ``mistreated'' and she wanted to do something
to make it up to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are both very independent and don't look outside ourselves
for confirmation of what we believe,'' she says. ``We look within
ourselves.''

 &HT;    Girl looking forward to her brightest day
 &HT;    By Lawrence Budd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Saturday should be Abby Perkins-Banks' day in the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   All her life, the 4-year-old Middletown girl has been forced to
stay inside during the day by a genetic disorder that leaves her
skin acutely sensitive to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until it gets dark, I'm not allowed to go out,'' said the
energetic blue-eyed, blonde-haired girl, her face darkly freckled
as a result of her condition.
</P>
<P>
   This gray period of Abby's life will end Saturday when she slips
into a modified space suit allowing her to engage in daytime
activities ranging from riding the miniature horse her uncle keeps
for her in Franklin to playing with friends in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to play games with them and swing with them,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is a down-sized version of those designed for
astronauts, such as John Glenn, who has asked about Abby this week
while orbiting Earth in the space shuttle Discovery, according to
her mother, Caroline Perkins-Banks.
</P>
<P>
   The suit will be provided to Abby at no cost through the efforts
of her mother, an anonymous benefactor, a Virginia-based foundation
and two California companies developing and marketing the NASA
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know she'll put in on. That'll be her first trip into the
sun,'' said Perkins-Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother seeking help in April from Sarah Moody, director of
the H.E.D. Foundation in Hampton, Va., after learning that the
group had arranged the donation of a similar suit to another child.
</P>
<P>
   Abby's will help her battle xeroderma pigmentosum, an incurable
condition that speeds the aging of skin exposed to sunlight. Like
Abby, those afflicted are more susceptible to cancer. Unlike her,
many wind up blind, hearing impaired and mentally retarded. Also
unlike Abby, many develop nerve-related problems, including spastic
muscles and poor coordination.
</P>
<P>
   Abby will be the eighth child outfitted with a cooling vest and
space suit, Moody said. Abby's suit and five others, purchased for
$2,000 each, were paid for through a donation from a famous person
who wishes to remain anonymous,'' Moody said.
</P>
<P>
   Originally designed by NASA scientists, the suits are produced
by two California companies, the Solar Protective Factory, which
makes the fabric, and the Wise Child, which hand - sews them.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Moody will present a suit to Abby at the Holiday
Inn at the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony will culminate a long fight by Perkins-Banks to
bring light to her daughter's existence.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 months old, Perkins-Banks began to realizing Abby had a
special problem. At 9 months, Perkins-Banks recalls ``she would
come out of her car seat and hit the floorboard'' to dodge the
daylight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what she had,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Over During the next two years, Perkins-Banks, a nurse, pushed
doctors for a full diagnosis, while studying the rare disorder
herself. There are only 147 documented cases worldwide, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Abby has undergone numerous surgeries for cancer, ``has the
eyelids of a 70-year-old,'' and relies on artificial tears to
moisten her eyes, her mother said. She use moisturizers to soothe
skin that has about one-fifth the normal capability to regenerate
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even indoors, Abby wears special sunscreen and clothing that
sells for $110 an outfit. Before venturing into the sunlight, she
must don a wide-brimmed floppy hat and a $200 pair of sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Abby's bedroom walls are lined with a picket fence and painted
with sunflowers and fluffy blue clouds. The windows in her room,
the living room and her sister Adrianna's room are blocked with
specially tinted glass panes costing $5,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The basement is dominated by a large tent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broken backs and all,'' Perkins-Banks said, the family sleeps
there once a week, after singing campfire songs or huddling around
an artificial fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since she can't be out in the light, I brought the indoors
into her,'' Perkins-Banks said.
</P>
<P>
   The family vehicles are outfitted with windows so darkly tinted
that Abby's grandfather, Charlie Perkins, was pulled over by
police.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such precautions, doctors say Abby will be lucky to live
to turn 30. The suit will allow her and her family to live more
fully.
</P>
<P>
   The family expects to enroll her in kindergarten next year.
</P>
<P>
   Like most 4 - year - olds, Abby offers little in conversation
with strangers. But she misses very little as her parents discuss
their lives. At one point, she betrayed the family's growing
anxiety as Saturday approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow I get it,'' she proclaimed.

 &HT;    Back yard bones may have been here before Columbus
 &HT;    By Lou Grieco
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Bones found in October in a box in a Wayne Avenue
garage are much older than investigators realized: They may predate
Christopher Columbus' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The house's former owner, a retired carnival worker, told police
he bought the bones more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County coroner's office sent the bones to a
Cincinnati anthropologist, who found they come from three humans,
as well as a deer, a bird and a turtle.
</P>
<P>
   Her analysis: The bones are 400 to 500 years old, most likely
removed from an Indian burial site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animals didn't surprise her a bit,'' said Ken Betz,
director of the coroner's office. Animal remains were often placed
in burial sites.
</P>
<P>
   Betz said the human remains include:
</P>
<P>
   The upper jaw of a child, about 1 year to 2 years old.
</P>
<P>
   A full skeleton, minus the skull, of a male about 45 years old.
</P>
<P>
   An adult's shin bone.
</P>
<P>
   The anthropologist told Betz she could tell from bone
destruction of the skeleton's ribs that the person had suffered
from tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Three men, cleaning out the garage for the current owner, found
the bones Oct. 16, Dayton police said. Some women who were treasure
hunting had stopped at the house, and the men showed them the
bones.
</P>
<P>
   The women took the bones to the Mother Earth Connection, 434 E.
Fifth St., put them on the counter and walked out, police said.
Someone working at the store called police.
</P>
<P>
   The following week, two other bones taken from the box were
turned in to police.
</P>
<P>
   The bones' former owner told police he bought them to use as
props. He did not remember where he bought them or from whom,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Betz said Thursday he would ask officials at SunWatch
Archaeological Park , 2301 W. River Road, for advice on what to do
with the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation
Act, tribes can claim remains if they can prove lineal descent,
said Lynn Simonelli, assistant curator for anthropology at the
Dayton Museum of Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   But because these bones offer no clues to what tribe they came
from, Simonelli said she would advise the coroner's office to keep
the bones or give them to a museum, which can hold them until
federal officials can ``come up with a way to deal with culturally
unidentified human remains.''

 &HT;    A place for Yellow Dogs to roam free
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The government sets aside land and provides
habitat for endangered birds, bugs and lizards, right?
</P>
<P>
   If we can give that sort of special treatment to the
golden-cheeked warbler and the Barton Springs salamander, shouldn't
the State of Texas establish a part of Travis County as a preserve
for the endangered Texas Yellow Dog Democrat?
</P>
<P>
   It seems the humane thing to do. If we can reserve acreage and
take environmental steps to help other animals facing elimination,
certainly we can do as much for the suffering, limping, severely
whupped Texas Yellow Dog.
</P>
<P>
   Let's save the Yellow Dog Democrat, folks. Extinction is nipping
at the heels of this critter. Used to be these parts were lousy
with Yellow Dogs, or, if you prefer the formal Latin species name,
Yellowus dogeroonii. But no more. Not since the white man's
wholesale slaughter of the majestic buffalo on the Great Plains in
the 1800s have we seen such cataclysmic decimation of a once-noble
species.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, it was open season on Texas Yellow Dog Democrats,
with no bag limit. Texas Republicans won every statewide election.
Locally, Todd Baxter became the first Republican elected to the
Travis County Commissioners Court since Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Not that this is entirely bad. With a Republican on the
Commissioners Court, maybe we can get some of these roads widened
that go to golf courses and hire a towel attendant for the
courthouse men's room.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion to save the Yellow Dog Democrat would be to put
aside 5,000 acres of habitat for Democrats south and east of
Austin, in exchange for Northwest Hills, since the Yellow Dog can't
survive in that stuffy environment anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The few remaining Texas Yellow Dogs living in other parts of the
state could be trapped and caught in places like Longview, Lufkin
and Lubbock, then relocated to the preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Another area that could be used for the Yellow Dog preserve is
Robert Mueller Airport when it closes. Officials have been
wondering what to do with that large stretch of tar. Now we have
the answer _ a reservation for the endangered Liberalus
bleedingheartamundi.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like those locations for the preserve, there's
always Bastrop County, where the Yellow Dog still roams free. There
hasn't been a Republican elected to countywide office there in more
than 100 years. Of course, the reason for this is that 10 to 15
years ago, half the hippies in Austin moved to Bastrop County so
they could grow their own wacky tabacky. And now that they've
gotten too old for that, they're all making crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Steps can be taken to discourage Republicans from nesting on the
Yellow Dog preserve. The environment could be managed to make the
habitat unlivable for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it would be against the rules on Yellow Dog habitat
land to build a circular driveway, own a Lincoln Town Car or have a
riding lawn mower.
</P>
<P>
   No restaurants with more than one fork per place setting would
be allowed on the Yellow Dog preserve. Cummerbunds and
blazer-pocket hankies would be strictly forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing rental tuxedos on the Yellow Dog preserve would be
permitted for special occasions. But if you own your own tux, you'd
have to live somewhere else.
</P>

 &HT;    Reality bites, especially if you've got `The Body'
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity the poor fiction writers. It's getting harder and harder to
top reality.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, of pro-wrestling,
flamingo-sunglasses fame, is governor-elect of Minnesota. Had it
happened in a novel, it would have been derided as implausible.
</P>
<P>
   How are folks going to address this guy? The Honourable ``The
Body''? Governor ``The Body''?
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's outmuscling of two veteran politicians is THE story of
the election, and no doubt will send politicians scrambling for a
handle of their own. Forget sound bites. Give us identity bites.
How about Bob ``Did I Mention My Great-Grandfather Was President''
Taft? Ken ``Take This Job and Shove it'' Blackwell? George ``He
Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother'' Voinovich?
</P>
<P>
   Naah. They lack the elegance, the simplicity of ``The Body.''
Clearly, I'm not very good at this. Better let the candidates pick
their own nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general? If she were in pro wrestling, she'd go by
Betty ``The Enforcer'' Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Our 5th-District state representative? Call her Rhine ``Tinker
Bell'' McLin. Bear with her on this one: ``It was magic that we won
against all that negative campaigning. I'm trying to sprinkle good
fairy dust and change their way of campaigning. If not, they might
end up like Captain Hook _ thrown to the alligators.''
</P>
<P>
   Our newly elected state treasurer, Hamilton County prosecutor
Joe Deters, will stick with the moniker already provided by
kamikaze WLW radio personality Bill Cunningham: Joe ``TNT'' Deters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea what it means _ you'll have to ask
Cunningham _ I certainly could enter big-time wrestling with that
one,'' Deters said. ``Maybe if Lee Fisher had used the Sheik as his
running mate, there could have been a different outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Montgomery County auditor? He'd pick A.J. ``The Poet''
Wagner. ``My staff, my kids or my wife _ I'm sure they'd all have
different words that they'd put in the middle of my name.''
</P>
<P>
   The re-elected Montgomery County commissioner would like to be
known as Chuck ``The Biker'' Curran. As in James Dean? Leather
jackets? Nope _ the nickname refers to the electric scooters and
three-wheel banana bikes he rides in the Thanksgiving parade.
</P>
<P>
   The new secretary of state chose a kinder, gentler moniker _ Ken
``This Little Light of Mine'' Blackwell _ after the song he often
led in churches along the campaign trail. Tony Hall picked ``The
Terminator,'' presumably because it sounds more forceful than his
college nickname, ``The Twister.''
</P>
<P>
   What would local party heads nickname their political opponents?
Montgomery County Party chairman Dennis Lieberman offered up Jeff
``Mad Dog'' Jacobson; Gary ``Sound Bite'' Haines; Robert ``Tee
Time'' Corbin; Mike ``No Comment'' Turner; and Chuck ``The Pork
Barrel'' Horn.
</P>
<P>
   His Republican counterpart, Jeff Jacobson, countered with Dennis
``Bad Hair Day'' Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura is shaking up American politics,
and maybe that's not so bad. Maybe it's healthy for people who
aren't professional politicians to hold public office.
</P>
<P>
   But that only seems to happen if it's a celebrity of some odd
stripe or other. Why can't we elect Jane ``The Teacher'' Doe? Or
Joe ``The Soccer Dad'' Schmoe? If we are going to elect Everyman or
Everywoman, why can't it be someone famous as ``The Heart'' or
``The Brain'' instead of ``The Body''?
</P>
<P>
   Just call me Mary ``Pollyanna'' McCarty.

SOMETIMES IT'S BEST TO GO WITH THE BOO-BOOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you may know, nearly every word Bill Clinton utters in public
is recorded and transcribed. It's one more reason I'm glad I'm not
Bill Clinton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This process happens at his speeches, press conferences, ``photo
opportunities'' and so forth. (Where were these stenographers when
Monica was around him?) I don't know how many words Clinton has
said as president, but surely more in nearly six years than Calvin
Coolidge said in his whole life, which, by the way, lasted 60
years, six months and one day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the people who record and transcribe Clinton's public
utterances are human, now and then they make mistakes or they can't
quite make out what our softly drawling chief executive said. But
it's bad form to interrupt him in the middle of a speech to ask.
And they don't have much time after the president finishes to check
fuzzy words. After all, journalists (and worse) are awaiting these
as-delivered speech texts. My own copies of them arrive by daily
e-mail, filling my computer with Clintonesque verbiage that, at
times, is more dense than the coding that makes the computer work
at all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because of this hurry-up process, from time to time you will
find in the Clinton transcriptions the proper name of someone he
mentioned followed by the parenthetical word ``phonetic'' to
indicate the transcriber guessed at how the person's name was
spelled. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At other times you will find wonderful mistakes that add an air
of mystery and intrigue to what the president said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, for instance, Clinton participated in a roundtable
discussion on Social Security. There was the usual blah-blah-blah,
especially because one of the speakers was Vice President Al Gore,
who is to rhetorical brilliance what Jerry Springer is to good
taste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But I'm glad I just used the word brilliance because it was
exactly the word the transcriber used in Clinton's remarks that day
when the context clearly called for the sounds-similar-in-drawl
word ``billions.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This odd sentence resulted: ``When I said in my State of the
Union address I would reject any attempt to spend any surplus until
we save Social Security, I knew the congressional majority wanted
to drain brilliance from the surplus even before it appeared on the
books, much less having the ink dry.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans wanted to drain brilliance from the surplus? Odd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Actually, in an off-plumb sort of way, that's a nice way to put
it. But even though I haven't wasted my time and yours by going
back and checking to see if Clinton really said ``billions''
instead of ``brilliance,'' I'm absolutely sure he did. And yet
there's something fetching and enigmatic about the idea of draining
brilliance from the surplus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if I go back through the rest of what Clinton said that
day and change a few words he sounds much more intriguing. So
engaging, in fact, that it would be hard to imagine how anyone in
the House could vote to impeach a guy with this hypnotizing command
of the English language. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here, for instance, is a Clinton sentence in which the original
word was ``sites'': ``I want to thank the vice president, the
members of the administration, Congressman Cardin, all the
panelists who are here (and) the satellite audience at the 12 other
heights across our country.'' Can you name both the 13 colonies AND
the 13 heights? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here the word was ``sunset'': ``Every American must have
retirement security in the quonset years.'' (There he goes again,
sucking up to military veterans.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if I were the official transcriber, I'd stick in words
like brilliance, heights and quonset all over the place. It would
make this embattled president look positively billion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEC EAST
</P>
<P>
   1. KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 35-4; 14-2 SEC; won SEC Tournament; defeated Utah
78-69 for NCAA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Orlando ''Tubby'' Smith, 159-66 overall, 35-4 in one
season at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (2): F Scott Padgett, 6-9, Sr. (11.5 ppg); G
Wayne Turner, 6-2, Sr. (9.3 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G/F Tayshun Prince, 6-8, Compton, Calif.; F
Souleymane Camara, 6-11, Oak Hill Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The 'Cats lost three strong seniors from a national
championship team, but if they can find a suitable backcourt mate
for point guard Wayne Turner, they could make another run. Inside,
Kentucky has to get more consistent production from Jamaal
Magloire, who played well in March. Scott Padgett's return at
forward will help the team stay focused.
</P>
<P>
   2. TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 20-9, 9-7 SEC; lost to Illinois State 82-81 in first
round of NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Jerry Green, 242-187 overall, 20-9 in one season at
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (5): G Brandon Wharton, 6-3, Sr. (15.2 ppg);
G Tony Harris, 6-0, Soph. (14.2 ppg); F C.J. Black, 6-8, Jr. (12.6
ppg); F Rashard Lee, 6-6, Sr. (10.2 ppg); C Charles Hathaway, 6-10,
Soph. (7.3 ppg) (sat out last season after starting as a freshman).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomer: F Vincent Yarbrough, 6-7, Cleveland, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: After taking the Vols to the NCAA Tournament in his
first season, Jerry Green and company have the talent to make a run
at Kentucky. Hathaway is back after sitting out last season with a
blood clot in his shoulder. Tennessee also has one of the nation's
best backcourts in Wharton and Harris. Throw in Yarbrough, a highly
regarded freshman, and the Vols should be very good.
</P>
<P>
   3. FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 14-15, 6-10 SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Billy Donovan, 62-52 overall, 27-32 in two years at
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Eddie Shannon, 5-11, Sr. (11.6 ppg); F
Greg Stolt (12.0 ppg); G Kenyan Weeks, 6-4, Jr. (12.7 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Ted Dupay, 5-10, Cape Coral, Fla.; G LaDanus
Halton, 6-3, New Smyrna Beach, Fla.; C Udonis Haslem, 6-8, Miami;
F/G Mike Miller, 6-8, Mitchell, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Three starters and nine lettermen return, and to them
Donovan has added one of the nation's top recruiting classes. A
year ago, the Gators lost three games at the buzzer and eight by
five points or fewer. Florida still might be a year away from going
head to head with Kentucky for the SEC East championship, but the
Gators will make a lot of noise because they are so talented.
</P>
<P>
   4. GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 20-15, 7-9 SEC; lost to Penn State 66-60 in
semifinals of NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Ron Jirsa, 20-15 in one season.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (4): F Jumaine Jones, 6-7, Soph. (14-7 ppg);
G G.G. Smith, 5-11, Sr., (13.5 ppg); G Ray Harrison, 6-3, Sr. (11.9
ppg); G/F Michael Chadwick, 6-4, Sr. (8.7 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Shawn Fields, 6-3, Lexington, Ky.; G D.A.
Layne, 6-2, Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Jirsa must convince his team that Jones is the main man
and that everything on the team flows from him. Georgia must get
some kind of inside scoring. If Jones can do that, and if the
Bulldogs can stay healthy, they have the makings of a 20-win team.
If not, Georgia could be headed back to the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   5. SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 23-8, 11-5 SEC; lost to Richmond 62-61 in first round
of NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Eddie Fogler, 227-144 overall, 85-64 in five seasons at
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G B.J. McKie, 6-2, Sr. (18.8 ppg); F
Williams Gallman, 6-7, Sr. (5.9 ppg); F Antonio Grant, 6-5, Soph.
(6.6 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: C Tony Kitchings, 6-10, Aiken, S.C.; G Aaron
Lucus, 5-11, Columbia; G Jamel Bradley, 6-2, Beckley, West. Va.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Gamecocks returned seven of their top nine players
from a year ago, but McKie will miss Melvin Watson, his backcourt
partner from last year. Guard Herbert Lee Davis, who started four
games last season, must come through and regain the form he showed
as a freshman. South Carolina also needs points from the inside
from senior center Bud Johnson or talented newcomer Tony Kitchings.
</P>
<P>
   6. VANDERBILT
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 20-13, 7-9 SEC; lost to Georgia 79-65 in
quarterfinals of NIT.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Jan van Breda Kolff, 113-95 overall, 90-66 in five
seasons at Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (2): G Atiba Prater, 6-1, Jr. (8.9 ppg); G/F
Vince Ford, 6-4, Sr. (7.4 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Deandre Moore, 5-10, Compton, Calif.; F Michael
LeBlanc, 6-6, Soph., Sugarland, Tex. (UConn transfer).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Vanderbilt lost 53 percent of its scoring with the
departures of Drew Maddux, Billy DiSpaltro and Austin Bates. The
Commodores hope to recover some of those points by turning to
sophomore Greg LaPointe, who averaged 5.3 points. This will be van
Breda Kolff's most athletic team, but it appears to lack scoring
punch.
</P>
<P>
   SEC WEST
</P>
<P>
   1. ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 24-9, 11-5 SEC; lost to Utah 75-69 in second round of
NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Nolan Richardson, 433-155 overall, 314-118 in 13 years at
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Pat Bradley, 6-2,Sr. (14.8 ppg); G
Kareem Reid, 5-10, Sr. (11.9 ppg); F Derek Hood, 6-8, Sr. (8.4
ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Brandon Dean, 6-0, Monroe, La.; F Chris
Jeffries, 6-8, Fresno, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: After losing three of his last four meetings with Ole
Miss, Richardson decided to hit the road recruiting and has signed
a class that will take the Razorbacks to the top of the SEC West.
If the Hogs are going to go beyond the SEC, they will need to get
great seasons from Bradley and Reid in the backcourt. Bradley led
the SEC in three-pointers last season, and Reid was third in
assists.
</P>
<P>
   2. AUBURN
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 16-14, 7-9 SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Cliff Ellis, 415-267 overall, 67-55 in four seasons at
Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (4): C Mamadou N'diaye, 7-0, Jr. (8.0 ppg); G
Scott Pohlman, 6-2, Soph. (10.6 ppg); G Doc Robinson, 6-2, Jr.
(12.4 ppg); F Bryant Smith, 6-5, Sr. (13.3 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: F David Hamilton, 6-9, Compton, Calif.; G Jay
Heard, 6-3, Oxford, Ala.; F Chris Porter, 6-7 (Chipola, Fla., JC).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: A year ago, Auburn jumped out to an 11-4 start but ran
out of players when it started grinding through the SEC schedule.
Ellis thinks he's solved that problem with a top-20 recruiting
class. Now, the Tigers will have some depth to back up those
starters and keep them fresh. Hamilton has a chance to make some
real noise as a freshman. Still, this team is at least a year away
from going to the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   3. MISSISSIPPI
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 22-7, 12-4 SEC; lost to Valparaiso 70-69 in first
round of NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Rod Barnes, first year as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Keith Carter, 6-4, Sr. (14.8 ppg); F
Jason Smith, 6-6, Jr. (9.8 ppg); G Michael White, 6-1, Sr. (5.4
ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: F Marcus Hicks, 6-6, Northwest CC; G/F Lataryl
Williams, 6-6, Northwest CC; F Darrian Brown, 6-6, West Memphis,
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Barnes takes over for Rob Evans, who left for Arizona
State. So will the program drop off the face of the earth? Maybe
not. Carter and White are starting in the backcourt for the fourth
consecutive year. Smith is the team's best athlete and its most
ferocious rebounder (6.5 per game). But to make the transition
successfully, those three guys will have to show some leadership.
The Rebels also need to get some help from its incoming class.
</P>
<P>
   4. MISS. STATE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 15-15, 4-12 SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Rick Stansbury, first year as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): C Tyrone Washington, 6-10, Sr. (12.9
ppg); G Detrick White, 6-1, Sr. (12.2 ppg); G Bart Hyche, 5-11, Sr.
(6.8 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: F Tyrus Boswell, 6-7, Mountain Brook, Ala.; F/C
Robert Jackson, 6-8, Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Since reaching the Final Four in 1996, the Bulldogs
have fallen on hard times and will start over under Stansbury, who
was the chief recruiter for former coach Richard Williams. Last
year, Mississippi State lost nine games by four points orfewer. The
key will be getting some consistency out of Washington, who had
great games and then terrible games. With three starters, three key
reserves and a decent recruiting class, the Bulldogs could be
respectable, if they get a little luck.
</P>
<P>
   5. ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 15-16, 6-10 SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Mark Gottfried, 68-24 overall, first year at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Brian Williams, 6-1, Sr. (16.1 ppg); G
Chauncey Jones, 6-1, Sr. (9.9 ppg); C Jeremy Hays, 6-10, Jr. (9.3
ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: F Sam Haginas, 6-9, Mobile, Ala.; F Marc
Kimbrough, 6-6, Jr., Pensacola JC.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: After a successful stint at Murray State, Gottfried, a
fomer Alabama player, takes over. The Crimson Tide returns three
starters and four others who averaged nine minutes or more, but the
talent base isn't what it once was. Gottfried sent a message by
signing Haginas, Alabama's Mr. Basketball last season. But he needs
more talent to get this team into the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   6. LSU
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 9-18, 2-14 SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: John Brady, 98-95 overall, 9-18 in one season at LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (2): G Maurice Carter, 6-4, Sr. (14.4 ppg); G
Willie Anderson, 6-4, Sr. (12.0 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Collins Temple, 6-4, Baton Rouge, La.; C Jabari
Smith, 6-11, Atlanta (Metropolitan JC).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: John Brady's first season in Baton Rouge was pretty
much a disaster, but he has brought in 10 new bodies to upgrade the
talent level. The Tigers' hopes took a hit when signee Stromile
Swift of Shreveport did not qualify academically. He would have
become the team's best player immediately. Brady, who will spend
most of this season just getting to know his players, still doesn't
have enough talent to compete.

<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Keeping track of coaching moves in SEC basketball
is tougher than tracing subpoenas at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Four schools made changes before last season, and the SEC will
welcome three first-year coaches this year. Alabama hired former
Murray State coach Mark Gottfried, while Mississippi and
Mississippi State elevated assistants Rod Barnes and Rick
Stansbury, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   One coach who is staying put is Kentucky's Tubby Smith, who
guided the 'Cats to an improbable national title in his first
season in Lexington. Kentucky lost guard Jeff Sheppard, center Nazr
Mohammed and swingman Allen Edwards, but the Wildcats have enough
talent to remain the favorite in the SEC East.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, Arkansas returns its talented backcourt of seniors
Kareem Reid and Pat Bradley, which should be enough to take the
division. Auburn is the darkhorse, with the other four teams facing
overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite
</P>
<P>
   If junior Jamaal Magloire or sophomore Michael Bradley come
through in the middle, and highly regarded freshman Tayshaun Prince
evolves quickly at shooting guard, Kentucky again could be among
the last teams standing in March.
</P>
<P>
   The darkhorse
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's top four players might be as talented as anyone's in
the league, but the Dogs must get consistency from senior guard Ray
Harrison and forward Michael Chadwick. If Georgia finally figures
out that sophomore Jumaine Jones is its meal ticket, the Dogs could
be a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Billy Donovan, another Rick Pitino disciple, is on the verge of
building a monster at Florida. The Gators added McDonald's
All-Americans Ted Dupay of Florida and Mike Miller of South Dakota
to this year's roster. And Donovan already has a commitment for
next season from West Virginia playground legend Brett Nelson, the
nation's top prep playmaker. But Donovan's best move might have
been dismissing troubled guard Jason Williams, whose off-court
disruptions outweighed his on-court production.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the decline
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the SEC East seems to be improving, Vandy
appears ready to sink to the cellar. The Commodores lost their top
three scorers from a year ago _ guard Drew Maddux, forward Billy
DiSpaltro and center Austin Bates. Coach Jan van Breda Kolff will
be on the hot seat unless Connecticut transfer Michael LeBlanc and
redshirt freshman Sam Howard have big impacts.
</P>
<P>
   Player of the Year
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Jones overcame a slow start in the SEC a year ago to
average 14.7 points and 8.5 rebounds as a freshman. Coach Ron Jirsa
appears ready to focus on Jones' low-post skills _ and his
teammates might be willing to get him the ball. Jones is a rare
combination of inside-outside skills, and Georgia could be
hard-pressed to keep him in Athens beyond this season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Smith proved what most of us already knew: He's one
heck of a coach. All he did in his first season in the commonwealth
was patch together a team that had lost four players, including NBA
first-round picks Ron Mercer and Derek Anderson. Now, Smith faces a
similar challenge with even fewer experienced players. But after
two successful years at Georgia, followed by Kentucky's seventh
national title last season, who should doubt him?
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer of the Year
</P>
<P>
   The consensus pick is Tennessee small forward Vincent Yarbrough,
but Florida's Miller could have the biggest impact. Gators shooting
guard Kenyan Weaks is suspended for the first seven games, so look
for Miller, who will start at small forward, to pick up the scoring

 &HT;    IS TENNESSEE'S PAT SUMMITT BEST COACH IN U.S.?
 &HT;    FOR USE WITH AJC BASKETBALL PREVIEW PACKAGE
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE _ Often, the greatest coaches get that way because
they adapt to the evolutions in their game.
</P>
<P>
   In college basketball, UCLA's John Wooden embraced the emergence
of black players while racial turmoil roiled the nation.A rules
change forced Dean Smith to abandon North Carolina's ``four
corners,'' but he saw the benefits of a disciplined yet athletic
full-courtand won two national championships.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, Indiana's Bobby Knight, still
considered one of the game's best tacticians, has refused to open
up his offense. For most of the last 25 years, Pat Summitt has
resisted change almost as much as Knight. His last NCAA
championship was in 1987, the same year Summitt won her first
women's title at Tennessee, after seven unsuccessful trips to the
Final Four. But another decade passed before the Lady Volunteers
mentor adopted a different approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, you couldn't get Summitt to consider using a
zone defense. When the game painted the three-point line12 years
ago, she didn't have a shooter to take advantage of it _ and for a
long time, she didn't bother recruiting anyone who could. She clung
to a physical, half-court style that prompted one rival coach to
sneer that her players were ``corn-fed chicks.''
</P>
<P>
   And Summitt's ultra-stern demeanor _ which over the years has
drawn comparisons to Knight, minus the chair-throwing and
stretched, red sweaters _ is almost as legendary as her career
record of 664-143 in 24 seasons. In March, she was the subject of a
massive psychological profile in Sports Illustrated, but she
refused to read it until the season was over because she was
unhappy with the glaring cover photograph.
</P>
<P>
   As far as she's concerned, that's the old Pat Summitt. The
modified one, now 45 years old and coming off her third national
title in a row and sixth in the last 11 seasons, has become the
personification of change in a women's collegiate game that is
still young. Perhaps her greatest transformation has been off the
court, where she has altered her steely reserve to the point of
occasionally moving to the beat of rap music played on the team
bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how much I did change,'' Summitt said,
speaking strictly in basketball terms. ``But now, I want to push
tempo, and I want to push it more and more. If you're going to beat
us, you're going to beat us after 40 minutes of up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Come again? Up and down? This from a woman whose longtime motto
was, ``Offense sells tickets; defense and rebounding win
championships''?
</P>
<P>
   Since Summitt made the switch, the Lady Vols haven't been
beaten. Their 39-0 record last season was the best ever by a men's
or women's NCAA champion. And Summitt, whose six NCAA titles are
just four behind Wooden's, has been encouraging her players to push
even higher this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take the game to the next level,'' said three-time
All-American Chamique Holdsclaw, who promised after last year's
national championship game that Tennessee would improve . ``We
can't become complacent. This team can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee still plays punishing ball-denial defense, but now
it's with smothering full-court pressure and a constant mixture of
defenses that forces opponents into an average of 26 turnovers a
game. The Lady Vols used its fastbreaking ability to score nearly
90 points a game, easily becoming her most potent offensive team
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Only a single, little-used senior is gone, and Holdsclaw and
point guard Kellie Jolly enter their final senior with a chance to
do something no other NCAA Division I player _ male or female _ has
been in position to accomplish: win four national championships.
</P>
<P>
   If Tennessee rolls through the women's pack again this year,
calls will increase that Summitt's name belongs with Wooden, Smith,
Knight and others. Although the women's collegiate game stretches a
span not much longer than Summitt's coaching career, and has had
little of the parity usually found in the men's, is it fair to put
her in such exclusive company?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely. There is no doubt in my mind that she is one of
the best,'' ABC/ESPN analyst Dick Vitale said. ``I don't care what
level you play, when you win as often as she has, and when you do
it with great class and discipline, it doesn't matter. Great
basketball is great basketball, period.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of top women's coaches are concerned that Tennessee's
dominance might not be helping their sport. Louisiana Tech's Leon
Barmore, who has had his fair share of success against the Lady
Vols, muttered before losing last year's NCAA title game that too
much more of the same might not be a good thing, that people would
stop watching if the results became predictable.
</P>
<P>
   In the SEC, the reality of trying to co-exist with Tennessee is
accepted nearly without public complaint, although some coaches
have become weary wondering how they're going to keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see Pat in the television booth,'' quipped coach
Gary Blair of Arkansas, whose Cinderella team was crushed by
Tennessee by 28 points in the Final Four. ``I think Tennessee is 10
points better than they were last year. Pat's driven, and that's
good for the game. Will all this ever end? Right now, I don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions and challenges
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee is on the verge of eclipsing a number of reachable
records, including the all-time women's winning streak, so the hype
machine coming out of Knoxville figures to be humming at even
greater velocity. Summitt, who published her autobiography in
March, followed it last month with an account of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Summitt, who for years has been asked whether she'd ever be
interested in coaching a men's team, has always said no, and has
deflected speculation on when she may be ready to leave the Lady
Vols for other challenges. But on her first book tour and over the
summer, she made statements that raised questions about whether
that time might be sooner than later.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question by PBS talk show host Charlie Rose,
Summitt said that if she ever decided to enter politics, it
probably would be as a Republican, since those are the stronger
partisan leanings in east Tennessee (Her brother is a Democratic
state representative in the farm country northwest of Nashville
where she grew up.).
</P>
<P>
   And when she was impressed with a packed Madison Square Garden
while attending several games of the WNBA's New York Liberty, the
New York newspapers were awash in the idea that she might be
planning to go to the Big Apple in a package deal with Holdsclaw,
who appears all but certain to be playing there next summer. Near
the end of ``Raise the Roof,'' her book about last season, Summitt
answered that talk more decisively than she has in interviews:
``What people don't understand is, I already have important work _
redefining what young women are capable of and how they compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, she was asked again about what keeps her
going with seemingly nothing more to prove. She disagrees
vehemently: ``You know what drives me? The players themselves,
players who are serious about their games.''
</P>
<P>
   And serious about making them better.
</P>
<P>
   That's why former and present players find it difficult to
believe that a major change in her career could happen anytime
soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else would she do?'' asked Georgia State head coach Lea
Henry, who played for Summitt at Tennessee and on the 1984 gold
medal-winning U.S. Olympic team. ``She's got to be in a competitive
environment. She could be the governor of Tennessee; she's that
popular. But she's still pretty driven as a basketball coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressing concern of winning another title will have more
distractions than last year. Tennessee's 45-game winning streak is
just nine behind the all-time women's record held by Louisiana
Tech. And should the Lady Vols go undefeated again and win a fourth
consecutive title in March, they would finish 36-0, extending the
streak to 81, just seven short of the UCLA men's magical number of
88 consecutive wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even think about going there,'' Summitt said. ``My
brother said that to me, and I told him, 'Tommy, that's
ridiculous.'
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm concerned about right now is getting this team on the
court, playing together, finding the right chemistry, staying
healthy,'' she said. ``And I want them playing in that (national)
championship game. What happens between now and then isn't as
important to me as a head coach as it might be to the team or the
fans or my assistants. I want to play in that last game.''
</P>
<P>
   A lmost benched
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, she wondered how much longer she could endure it.
The Lady Vols stumbled into the NCAA Tournament with a 23-10
record, the most losses for a Summitt team in more than a decade.
It was a team that, lacking the fire she demands, absorbed some big
losses late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were going through that, I wasn't sure I was going to
do this much longer,'' she said. ``I don't handle losing well at
all. But it was more about coaching players who didn't give it
their all. I don't like coaching effort. I'm not good at it, and
you don't want me to try to be good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   That reinforced a harsh perception _ one that Summitt readily
acknowledges _ about the way she handled her players. Her control
tactics off the court have included keeping tabs on what her
players purchased when they went shopping and making them sit near
the front of their classes so they'll pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   For years, nearly all of Summitt's players were white, many of
them Tennessee farm girls like herself, until she hired Mickie
DeMoss to be her top recruiter in 1985. Soon, black players became
the majority of her roster, just as the women's game was getting
faster. Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Stanford and Long Beach State had
earned national acclaim and reached the Final Four with a running
style of play, and Louisiana Tech burned the then-No. 1 Lady Vols
that way in the 1994 Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   But Summitt just couldn't find a reason to let go, not until she
saw Holdsclaw, joined by a spectacular freshman class, show in the
first practice last season that they could run and press
relentlessly. ``It took me a while to be comfortable with it,'' she
said. ``But, boy, when I saw them, I was able to get out of my
traditional thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   And loosen up in other ways, to her even greater surprise.
</P>
<P>
   When she entered the locker room before the Final Four game with
Arkansas, Summitt was lifted up and literally dropped to the floor
by exuberant freshman guard Semeka Randall, a tough city kid from
Cleveland who often raised her coach's ire with occasional
moodiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's going to kill her,''Jolly said in a whisper, according
to ``Raise the Roof.'' But Summitt said she ``was too much in shock
to move. Then I started laughing, helplessly. At least I knew this
team was relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Helplessly? This woman, who once kicked her team out of its
palatial locker room at Thompson-Boling Arena because she didn't
think it deserved to call itself the Lady Vols, feeling helpless at
the hands of a player?
</P>
<P>
   Changing pace _and look
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw is amused when she looks at old pictures of Summitt,
coaching up a frenzy in polyester bell-bottom pantsuits and looking
worn down. The high-powered tailored attire she wears now is fit
for a stateswoman, and she walks on the floor before every home
game waving happily to an adoring crowd, as if she were strolling
down the boardwalk in Atlantic City.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks younger now,'' Holdsclaw said, giggling. ``Maybe it
was just the fashions back then. That stuff would make anybody look
old.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of high-school stars that might have passed on
Tennessee are noticing, and signing up to help continue the
dynasty. Summitt, who once , said that former Southern Cal great
Cheryl Miller was almost too much to handle on the 1984 Olympic
team, has received verbal commitments from three of the current top
10 high school seniors and is a finalist for 6-foot-4 center Nina
Smith of Waterloo, Iowa, considered the top prospect in the country
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Throw them together with two more seasons of last year's amazing
freshman class _ including Randall and All-America forward Tamika
Catchings _ and Wooden's 10 titles could be reached shortly after
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   So why would someone having this much fun want to give it all
up?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine Pat doing anything else,'' Jolly said. ``She
is Tennessee basketball.

 &HT;    GEORGIA MEN'S BASKETBALL PREVIEW
 &HT;    FOR USE WITH AJC BASKETBALL PREVIEW PACKAGE
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia coach Ron Jirsa probably isn't in any
trouble, despite a tough first year. But the second-year coach
needs to improve if he's going to claim Tubby Smith's program as
his own. The Bulldogs, whose 4-1 finish in the postseason NIT
helped them win 20 games for the third year in a row, will lose
five seniors after this season, including the starting backcourt of
G.G. Smith and Ray Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa, a career assistant who replaced Smith before the '97-'98
season, needs a strong campaign to prove to fans and recruits that
the Dogs are headed in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Jirsa seems determined to develop the Bulldogs' low-post game,
which vanished for most of last season. The Dogs, who attempted at
least 25 three-pointers in 15 games last year, will build their
offense around sophomore Jumaine Jones, perhaps the top player in
the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really tried to focus on the inside-out,'' Jirsa said.
``I think that will help us develop an inside game. I think
Jumaine's got the ability to score some points on the low post.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's non-conference slate should be easier, with Final Four
participants North Carolina and Stanford gone. The Dogs, however,
still face formidable foes in College of Charleston, Texas, West
Virginia and Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which endured its first 0-5 start in the league last
season, could get off to a strong start this year, facing
rebuilding Alabama, Mississippi State, Florida and Vanderbilt in
the first four games.
</P>
<P>
   Backcourt
</P>
<P>
   Georgia already had a thin backcourt before the season-ending
foot injury to junior Adrian Jones, who will redshirt this season.
Now, the Dogs are left with Smith and Harrison, who each averaged
nearly 34 minutes per game last year, and freshman D.A. Layne of
Wheeler High, who will play both backcourt spots. Smith emerged as
Georgia's most consistent player last season, leading the team in
minutes, assists and 3-point and free-throw shooting. Harrison,
however, hit only 38.5 percent of his shots. Harrison needs to be
selective and must create more baskets off turnovers. Layne has the
ability to score, but he admits that his defense needs work. He
gives Georgia the third ballhandler it lacked last year.
</P>
<P>
   Frontcourt
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a sophomore power forward from Camilla, became the first
freshman in 13 years to lead the Dogs in scoring and rebounding. He
spent much of the summer on the U.S. Goodwill Games team, improving
his low-post skills and shooting range. Small forward Michael
Chadwick vanished at times last year, but his opportunities also
diminished with Jones' presence. The key is at center, where senior
Eric DeYoung, who redshirted last year, will battle sophomore Robb
Dryden. Dryden has gained 42 pounds over the past two years, but
his offensive production is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Strengths
</P>
<P>
   Jones is Georgia's best player since Dominique Wilkins. Jones
has a rare combination of inside and outside skills and should
touch the ball every time down the court. Last year, Jones appeared
frustrated by his teammates' apparent unwillingness to pass him the
ball. Jones has the ability to carry the Bulldogs into March.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs have very little depth, and it could get worse if
senior forward Jon Nordin doesn't get healthy quickly. Nordin, who
injured his ankle this summer, could miss the first four games.
Sophomore Badi Oliver offers little offense. Jirsa wants to
redshirt freshman forward Ryan Lewis, so Layne must provide some
scoring off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Final analysis
</P>
<P>
   With Jones and an experienced backcourt of Harrison and Smith,
anything less than a bid to the NCAA Tournament would be a huge
disappointment. If the Bulldogs don't rebound, though, they could
be left behind in an improved SEC East.

   Catch us if you can.
</P>
<P>
   That's Tennessee's relatively new motto, as the Lady Volunteers
demonstrated last season in an unbeaten national championship
season that featured a blazing up-tempo style and blistering
full-court pressure defense. And the SEC, home to some of the most
athletic teams in the country, has had to respond to the raised
standard.
</P>
<P>
   For coach Pat Summitt to chuck her beloved twin-post offense for
a lineup that is sleek and versatile is a major step, but such
opponents as Georgia, Alabama and Florida always have been running
teams. The new challenge is to follow the leader, which has changed
the rules once again. Perimeter players are frequently 6-0 and
taller, but post players are more desired for the ability to run
the floor and adaptability than raw bulk or power.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia, for example, 5-10 guard Deana Nolan may be used at
the power forward spot at times because of her phenomenal leaping
ability, but she also is exceptionally quick on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not tired of talking about Tennessee,'' said Auburn coach
Joe Ciampi. ``You need an example of what you're shooting for. Size
is still important, but it really comes down to is having players
with the right combination of athletic ability and basketball
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   The favorite
</P>
<P>
   Guess who? Tennessee promises to be even better than last year's
perfect 39-0 team, and with Chamique Holdsclaw, Tamika Catchings
and the entire roster back nearly intact, it's hard to bet against
the Lady Vols standing in the winners' circle in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The darkhorse
</P>
<P>
   After suffering through his worst season at Georgia, Andy
Landers is all smiles and exudes confidence, although the Lady
Bulldogs are still very young.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Auburn has had a hard time trying to recapture the success of
three straight NCAA title games, 1988-90, but coach Joe Ciampi is
starting to haul in some better recruits these days, and his
matchup zone defense continues to be solid.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the decline
</P>
<P>
   When Jim Foster took Vandy to a No.1 national ranking and the
Final Four in 1993, the Commodores shared equal local billing with
Tennessee. But there have been grumbles in Nashville lately that he
tinkers too much, and Vandy might not be able to avoid the
underachieving label again.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the year
</P>
<P>
   When Alabama twice got within 10 points of Tennessee last
season, coaches across the country took notice of Rick Moody's
physically punishing game plan. He still has All-American Dominique
Canty to stay in the SEC race, and he has brought on board several
prep and JUCO stars who will have to contribute quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer of the year
</P>
<P>
   Georgia got perhaps the best freshman at center in 6-4 Tawana
McDonald of Flint, Mich. Landers believes she's got the skills and
work habits to eventually rank with Lady Bulldog greats Janet
Harris, Katrina McClain and Tracy Henderson.

MORE SHOWS FACE BEING SWEPT FROM THE LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Remember these titles, for perhaps they will come
in handy in a trivia contest some day. ``The Brian Benben Show.''
``Costello.'' ``Holding the Baby.'' ``Wind on Water.'' ``Mercy
Point.''
</P>
<P>
   And this list will grow.
</P>
<P>
   All these new shows were touted by the network as proof of their
``quality programming.'' All were gone by Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   November is sweeps month, where audience ratings are critical in
determining advertising rates. This year the networks continuing to
see the inevitable erosion of their audience share to cable are
concentrating on sticking with regular programming rather than
special events.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not a bad thing, depending on the regular programming.
</P>
<P>
   November is also a good time to take a first look back on the
season and see where networks went right and wrong. Here are some
early observations:
</P>
<P>
   _ Best new show: ``Sports Night,'' ABC. Arguably the
best-written show on television and unlike any half-hour comedy,
primarily because of its deft introduction of drama.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worst new show: ``Wind on Water,'' NBC. Critics lamented its
quick cancellation. We wanted more chances to rip on this
broken-down Bo Derek vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best night of television, one station: Tuesdays, ABC. This is
a new category, since NBC's Thursday night lineup perennially had
this wrapped up. But ``Seinfeld'' is gone, and ``Home
Improvement,'' ``The Hughleys,'' ``Spin City,'' ``Sports Night''
and ``NYPD Blue'' offer the best 8 to 11 p.m. lineup out there.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best new show no one is watching: ``Cupid,'' ABC. In a poll of
800 members of Viewers for Quality Television, star Jeremy Piven
was named best actor in a new series, his character the most
interesting new character and ``Cupid'' the season's most pleasant
surprise. The bad news: It's on Saturday night, the tar pit of
television.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worst show that everyone is watching: ``Veronica's Closet,''
NBC. I find more laughs in ``Platoon'' than a year's worth of
episodes of this Kirstie Alley sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best show that worries me the most: ``South Park.'' Comedy
Central. Old-time pitcher Billy Loes once said he never wanted to
win 20 games, because people would then expect him to do it every
year. The first season, last year, of this animated show was
stunning; this season has been all right at best.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most surprising showing in wake of stiff competition:
``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS. Ray Romano wondered aloud where
the audience would be after the show moved to Mondays against
``Ally McBeal'' and ``Monday Night Football.'' It turns out they
are watching your show, Ray: ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' finished
18th in the latest Nielsen ratings, seven spots ahead of ``Ally.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Best new show not currently on television: ``Whose Line Is It
Anyway?'' ABC. The improvisational half-hour show hosted by Drew
Carey was the funniest thing on television during its limited
summer run. ABC has to find a spot on the schedule to bring it
back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most controversial new show: ``The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer,'' UPN. Blacks in particular found the Civil War-era
comedy offensive. Note to UPN: Next time you make a show
specifically designed to tick people off _ not necessarily a bad
thing _ can you make sure it's good?
</P>
<P>
   _ Dumbest move by a network: ABC, for locking out technicians on
Election Day/Night, the most demanding day of the year. Not only
could ABC affiliates not broadcast out of New York City, but Peter
Jennings seemed to be operating out of a dark, sound-proof closet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best move by a network: Fox, ABC, NBC and others, for staying
with good shows despite initially low ratings. ``That '70s Show,''
``Cupid,'' ``Trinity'' and ``Sports Night'' all deserve time to
develop and find an audience.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best show you never heard of: ``Any Day Now.'' Lifetime.
Viewers for Quality Television rated this show, which stars Annie
Potts and deals with racial issues, best new drama.
</P>
<P>
   _ Most disappointing new show: ``Encore! Encore!'' NBC. With the
talented Nathan Lane starring, the low-rated (78th) ``Encore!'' has
been lame at best. The sitcom is being shelved for the November
sweeps, but is slated to return in December.

   In this colorful and informative piece, Rodgers, a popular
cooking teacher known as Mr. Thanksgiving, offers facts and lore
about three staples of the holiday dinner: turkey, cranberries and
pumpkin. A few tidbits: Israelis eat the most turkey of any
nationality. Farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate, so females must be artificially
inseminated. Colonial Americans called cranberries ``bounce
berries'' because bounciness was an indication of a cranberry's
freshness. (slugged:

   Why do we celebrate Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of
November? Because of the 19th-century crusade by Sarah Josepha
Hale, editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book,'' who persuaded Abraham
Lincoln to proclaim the holiday, history buff Malehorn tells us.
Before that Thanksgiving was a haphazard celebration _ in fact, in
colonial times the word ``celebration'' was not quite apt. It was a
somber, religious occasion, spent in prayer in chilly village
churches. (slugged:

 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nearly all American schoolchildren learn the standard
Thanksgiving story: how the Pilgrims survived their first miserable
winter, and how the following fall they feasted with friendly
Indians to celebrate a successful harvest.
 &HT;    But many of us are unaware that the holiday is rooted in
European tradition, that it was a somber, religious holiday in
colonial times and that it was through the efforts of one
determined 19th century woman that it became celebrated on a fixed
day in November.
 &HT;    Many misconceptions surround that first Thanksgiving. It is
indeed true that the Pilgrims' tables were spread with nature's
bounty that 1621 autumn. But the foods were quite different from
those on which we feast today. Turkey might well have graced the
boards, but there likely was other wild game as well, so readily
available from the woods nearby.
 &HT;    Bee-tree honey and native fruits, berries and nuts also likely
satisfied appetites at that banquet, along with fish and shellfish
that abounded close to shore.
 &HT;    Corn, native to the New World, was probably prepared either as a
pudding or baked into cakes. Pumpkins (or pompions, as they were
called) were eaten boiled, for there was little molasses or flour
to bake them into pies.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving in America actually had its origins in Europe well
before any westbound voyagers from that continent ever hoisted
sail. In many parts of the Old Country, in fact, residents had for
centuries held observances of ``Harvest Home,'' a time when farmers
joined forces with neighbors to bring in their crops. This shared
labor was usually followed by festive dancing and food and drink.
 &HT;    Sometimes European governments decreed days of rejoicing among
the populace in thanks for a major victory in battle, or for the
end of a plague or for deliverance from some natural disaster.
 &HT;    In the early decades of American colonial life, Thanksgiving Day
did not always call for making merry. To the contrary, some church
fathers took a dim view of too much jollity. Attendance at worship
was required, where thanksgivers endured hours-long sermons and
prayers in chilly village churches.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving long ago was not uniformly observed on a single
date. Sometimes two or more Thanksgivings were announced within the
same calendar year. For example, during our War of Independence
special days of gratitude were proclaimed following our major
victories on the battlefield.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Continental Congress ordered a day of thanks
after our military alliance with France was signed. Several years
later there was a call for a national celebration of the British
surrender at Yorktown. On each such occasion grateful citizens
thronged to churches to express their thanks.
 &HT;    When the Constitutional Convention gathered in 1787, one
delegate proposed mandating an annual day of thanksgiving across
the land. However, as most of his fellow delegates saw the matter
as rightly belonging to the 13 states-to-be, that provision was
omitted from the landmark document.
 &HT;    In spite of this early congressional reluctance, Presidents
George Washington and James Madison each proclaimed a nationwide
thanksgiving observance. For his part, though, Thomas Jefferson,
viewing the presidency as a strictly civil post, found himself ``in
no position to direct the religious exercise of constituents.''
 &HT;    Since most thanksgiving observances early in our nationhood
occurred only at the discretion of the governor of the various
states, the time chosen for such an event ranged from September
through January. The success in fixing a single date on which to
observe Thanksgiving can be attributed to Sarah Josepha Hale,
editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book.''
 &HT;    In 1846 she began a crusade to set aside the last Thursday in
November as an official national holiday. Each autumn thereafter
she published in her magazine's pages an enthusiastic editorial on
the desirability of such an event.
 &HT;    Each year her November issue focused on that special day,
relating warm stories of family reunions. Mrs. Hale encouraged her
readers to urge their governors to agree on just one date.
 &HT;    When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Mrs. Hale's campaign
faltered for a while. But after the Union victory at Gettysburg,
President Abraham Lincoln set aside a day of thanksgiving and
prayer. Relieved at the recent repulse of Robert E. Lee's rebel
forces, Northern citizens had ample reason to rejoice.
 &HT;    Six weeks later the persistent Mrs. Hale wrote to Lincoln,
urging him to establish Thanksgiving as an annual national event.
Because the last Thursday was already being so proclaimed by
governors of most of the northern states, Mrs. Hale argued, Lincoln
should make it official.
 &HT;    And so, on Oct. 8, 1863, Lincoln decreed a national Thanksgiving
for the last Thursday in November _ not in honor of military
success, but rather ``for a year filled with blessings of fruitful
fields.''
 &HT;    The following year Lincoln renewed his proclamation, and ever
since our nation has seen fit to continue the tradition. And so
today millions of Americans gather each November to enjoy families,
friendships and abundant food _ the same blessings so important to
the Pilgrims in 1621.

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURKEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is only assumed that wild turkeys were served at that first
Thanksgiving in 1621. The firsthand accounts of the menu simply
mention ``fowl.'' We do know that the Pilgrims had venison, cod and
lobster on the table, so why don't we have surf and turf or fish
cakes instead of turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The turkey is an impressive bird, with its bronze feathers,
unusual head markings and showy tail. Even a hardened critic like
Brilliat-Savarin _ a French gourmand who, in 1825, uttered the
phrase, ``Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are'' _
said, ``The turkey is certainly one of the handsomest gifts the New
World made to the Old World. ... [It] is the largest and, if not
the most subtle, at least the most tasty of our domestic birds.''
Just looking at its corpulent figure it gives one a feeling of
abundance and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The wild turkey is native to North and Central America and was
domesticated by the Aztecs. No one knows when the first turkeys
traveled to Europe, but they seem to have been brought to Spain by
conquistadors in the early 1500s. The turkey quickly established
itself as the bird to serve at festive occasions, especially in
Italy, France and England, and was bred into a plumper version.
</P>
<P>
   This new improved turkey was brought back to the Americas, where
it was crossbred with its wild cousin to make the breed we know
today. The turkey was not a strange bird to the Pilgrims _ they
were well acquainted with it, and must have been relieved to find a
familiar food in this strange land.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how the turkey got its name. There are many
explanations, none definitive. Some think that early explorers,
believing they were close to India, misidentified the bird and
called it tuki, an Indian name for peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Because it also resembled the guinea fowl, which came from
Africa via Turkish merchants, it could have picked up the name by
another misappropriation of origin. (Guinea fowls were also called
turkeys.) Or it could have gotten its name from one of its calls,
which sounds like ``turk, turk, turk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkeys were so abundant in Colonial America, they were
a major source of nourishment for our country's forefathers. In a
well-known letter to his daughter, Benjamin Franklin expressed his
dismay over the eagle's being chosen as the official United States
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the eagle's ``bad moral character,'' he went on to
say, ``I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the
representative of our country! The turkey is a much more
respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 675 million pounds of turkey are served each
Thanksgiving, in recent years its healthy profile and versatility
have changed the turkey from a holiday bird to one that competes
with other meat and poultry on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Americans do not eat the most turkey. In 1997, it
was estimated that Israelis ate about 25.7 pounds per capita, while
we weighed in at 18.7 pounds. Runner-up was France, at 13.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most turkeys are of the White Holland variety, which have a lot
of the white breast meat that more than 70 percent of Americans
prefer. In fact, farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate. All farm-raised female turkeys are
artificially inseminated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRANBERRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure that cranberries were served at the first
Thanksgiving, but the cranberry was a very important food to the
Pawtuxet Indians, so historians assume that they would have offered
it as a contribution to the feast. Instinct must have taught the
Indians that the tart berries are an excellent source of Vitamin C,
because they used them in many dishes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate them raw and boiled with maple syrup, but perhaps the
most common use was in pemmican, which was a kind of low-tech
energy bar made with berries, dried venison meat and melted animal
fat. Pemmican kept well, and went with the Indians on long
journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims probably referred to cranberries as ``fenberries,''
a common fruit in old England which they resembled. The cranberry,
however, gets its modern name from the Dutch and German settlers,
who called it a ``crane berry.'' When the cranberry vines bloom,
the blossom looks like the head and bill of a crane. Eventually,
the name became cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Americans called them ``bounce berries,'' referring to
their bounciness. Bouncing berries are an indication of freshness;
bruised, old berries don't bounce.
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for cranberry sauce is included in the very first
printed American cookbook, Amelia Simmons' ``American Cookery,''
which appeared in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   Canned cranberry sauce first hit the shelves in 1912, a product
of the Cape Cod Cannery Company, which eventually became the Ocean
Spray Preserving Company. The president of the company was a Boston
lawyer, Marcus L. Urann. In 1930, Urann organized a merger between
his company and two other cranberry canneries to form the Cranberry
Canners, Inc., a cranberry farming cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative, which eventually acquired Urann's former
company name after a few months of squabbling, now provides more
than 70 percent of the world's cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered how many cranberries are in a 12-ounce
bag, the number is 360, give or take a few berries.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin pie was certainly not included in the first feast. The
Mayflower's stores of wheat had long been depleted, and the first
planting had failed. No wheat, no pie crust. As with so many other
foods, the Indians taught the Pilgrims about pumpkin. Along with
beans and corn, it was one of the three major foods in the Native
American diet throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   There is some argument over the pumpkin's origin. Some botanists
say it is a New World vegetable, and others claim it was known in
Europe before the Exploration Age. It is likely, however, that the
European ``pumpkins'' in the pre-Columbus era were really gourds,
and that we can truly claim the pumpkin as an American native that
deserves a place of honor at the Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians probably roasted pumpkin over an open fire or boiled
it with maple syrup. Pumpkin pudding became one of the favorite
dishes of the Puritan era. The pumpkin flesh was scooped out, mixed
with milk, spices and syrup, then returned to the pumpkin shell,
where it was roasted for hours in hot ashes. It is easy to see
where the basic recipe for pumpkin pie filling came from.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the settlers as pompion _ the name given by French
explorers in the late 1500s _ pumpkin saved them from starvation in
the lean early years of their colony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first recipes for pumpkin pie appeared in 1655 in a
British book called Queens Closed Open. This version represents the
then current taste for highly seasoned foods and includes thyme,
rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, cloves and apple. Amelia
Simmons included ``pompkin pie'' in the first American cookbook,
published in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the modern pumpkin pie can be dated back to 1929.
In that year, Libby, McNeil and Libby bought a small pumpkin pie
cannery, Dickinson Canning Company. The little cannery's pride and
joy was its special eating pumpkin, now called the Dickinson
variety. Eating pumpkins, very different from the jack-o'-lantern
varieties grown for their size and appearance, are elongated and
buff-colored with thin walls. The Dickinson is noted for its bright
orange color, creamy texture and fresh taste.
</P>
<P>
   Libby's took years to develop its own strain, improving upon the
Dickinson, called ``Select.'' Today, Libby's, a division of Nestle,
Inc., plants more than 4,000 acres of pumpkins annually.

 By ELIZABETH LEVANG  
 From ``Holiday Hope: Remembering Loved Ones During Special Times of
the Year,'' published by Fairview Press 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The holiday season calls up wistful memories and returns us to
faraway places, to scenes filled with the scents and sounds of
warmth and happiness. No other time of year evokes such strong
images of family togetherness.
 &HT;    For all its nostalgia and sentimentalism, however, the holiday
season is a difficult and often debilitating period for those who
are bereaved. More than anything, the holidays seem to accentuate
what others have and they have lost.
 &HT;    A time of year that once was joyous now often becomes almost
unbearable. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's are
days to endure rather than enjoy.
 &HT;    A friend whose 17-year-old son died in a car accident once
confided, ``I'd like to rip Dec. 25 off my calendar forever.''
 &HT;    Those with loved ones who have died experience a special pain or
burden during the holidays. Your lives have been altered, and your
family togetherness has been disturbed forever. Trying to reconcile
your reality with the idealized picture of the holidays projected
by the media causes even more emotional pain.
 &HT;    The expectations put on the bereaved, both socially and
emotionally, can feel overwhelming. You may have parties to attend,
gifts to purchase and a tree to be bought and trimmed. You are
expected to get in the spirit and join in the festivities just like
everyone else, yet in your heart is a gnawing pain and the constant
fear that you won't make it.
 &HT;    A close friend once remarked how much she had come to hate
Thanksgiving. ``The family focus hurts me,'' she said. ``I feel
somehow out of place. It's a depressing and lonely time for me.
Both my parents are dead and I don't really feel like I have much
to give thanks about.''
 &HT;    Comparing yourself to others, isolating ourselves, feeling
jealous, lonely, depressed or angry are some of the reactions that
you may experience during the holiday season. Many also feel guilt
from time to time, or are totally overwhelmed with sorrow.
 &HT;    Still, there are ways to survive the holidays, and with a change
in attitude and a bit of planning, they can become tolerable, and
even enjoyable. How can you better handle your grief during the
holidays?
 &HT;    First, acknowledge your pain. You miss your loved one. It is
agonizing not to be able to spend this joyous time with him or her.
Feel free to share your pain with friends and family. By
acknowledging and sharing your feelings, you allow others to
support and care for you. Rather than pushing your feelings down
and hoping they will stay hidden, you need an opportunity to
resolve them. Only by letting the hurt out will you make room for
healing.
 &HT;    Second, take charge of your life and don't leave things to
chance. This does not mean putting yourself on a rigid schedule,
but rather deciding in advance what you would like to do and with
whom. By taking charge, you give yourself things to look forward to
rather than things to dread. Occupying yourself lends a purpose to
your days and keeps you from feeling sorry for yourself.
 &HT;    Third, think more realistically and positively. What you think
has a dramatic effect on how you feel. When you form positive yet
realistic expectations for the holidays and accept your own
limitations, you reduce the tensions and pressure you face. Now,
how do you put these three new attitudes into practice? Here are a
number of specific coping strategies:
 &HT;    + Be honest. Your feelings are legitimate. Trust that you know
what is best for yourself. If a gathering of family or friends is
too painful, make your apologies and leave.
 &HT;    + Accept and seek support. Let your family and friends know how
they can be of assistance. If hanging ornaments on the tree feels
overwhelming, ask a friend to lend a hand. If neighbors offer to
bake cookies or wrap gifts, graciously accept their help and good
intentions.
 &HT;    + Be kind to yourself. Look for ways to nurture and care for
yourself throughout the holidays. Perhaps buy yourself a special
gift, sign up for a massage or do that something you've always
wanted to do. And at the very least, treat yourself to an
occasional smile.
 &HT;    + Have a plan. Talking with friends and family about what you
want and don't want to do during the holidays can be very helpful.
Being prepared lessens anxiety.
 &HT;    + Alter traditions. Since circumstances have changed, old
traditions may need replacing. Even simple changes, like serving
another dish instead of turkey or opening gifts later in the day,
may make you more comfortable.
 &HT;    + Start a new tradition. Start afresh by adding one new
tradition each year. Attending a seasonal play, decorating a
special tree outdoors or reciting a favorite poem before opening
gifts are some examples.
 &HT;    + Shop early. Avoid the holiday atmosphere by completing
shopping early. Rely on catalogs or the telephone, or enlist the
aid of a supportive friend.
 &HT;    + Decrease your commitments. Grief saps energy, so you may need
to pare down your commitments. Consider buying instead of baking
cookies, cutting down on the number of cards you send or having an
artificial rather than a fresh tree.
 &HT;    + Cherish your memories. Religious services, Christmas concerts
or other holiday events can trigger memories of your loved one.
While some may be painful, memories need to be cherished, for they
are an enduring and intimate connection to your loved one.
 &HT;    + Give tribute. The holidays can be a special time to honor your
loved one. Donating money to a special cause, offering to help
someone in need or volunteering your time and talents to a local
charity are some ways to do this.
 &HT;    + Be hopeful. The pain and stress of the holidays is very real.
Still, with some trial and error, things will get better.
 &HT;    + Remember the life of your loved one. More than anything else
at this time of year, you may feel a strong need to know that your
loved one has not been forgotten. Setting a plate at the table,
hanging a stocking on the mantle or retelling stories about him or
her are just a few ways to reassure yourself that the spirit of
this special person lives on.

 By RICK RODGERS  
 From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rick Rodgers, often called Mr. Thanksgiving, gives holiday
cooking classes nationwide. Below he answers questions about
choosing from among the myriad types of turkey on the market.
 &HT;    + Other than gender, are there any differences between hen and
tom turkeys? Is one more tender than the other?
 &HT;    Hens are female turkeys, weighing from 8 to 16 pounds. Male
toms, bred to yield a high proportion of the white breast meat that
most Americans prefer, weigh 14 to 26 pounds. The size of the bird
relates to its age. Turkeys are often labeled ``young,'' because no
commercial turkey is much older than 26 weeks.
 &HT;    Thanks to modern animal husbandry methods, there is no
difference in flavor or tenderness between toms and hens. In the
old days, a younger bird meant a more tender one, and while an old
tom had plenty of flavor, it was also tougher.
 &HT;    + What are the differences between fresh and frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    There are actually three designations for fresh and frozen
turkeys.
 &HT;    _ ``Frozen'' turkeys have been deep-chilled at 0 degrees or
below. They are at their best if defrosted and cooked within one
year of purchase. (If you've ever wondered how your supermarket can
give away free frozen turkeys as premiums at Thanksgiving time,
it's probably because they are using up last year's surplus.)
 &HT;    _ ``Fresh'' birds have never been chilled below 26 degrees, and
have a correspondingly short shelf life. (Turkey freezes at eight
degrees lower than water does.) Fresh turkeys are readily available
at supermarkets or butchers. You rarely have to special order them
anymore, unless your butcher requires that you do so or you are
concerned about getting a certain size. Buy fresh turkey no earlier
than two days before roasting, even if the ``sell-by'' date on the
label is later. I always buy a fresh turkey.
 &HT;    _ Turkeys kept at temperatures between 0 and 26 degrees are
considered ``hard-chilled.'' You won't see turkeys labeled
hard-chilled, though, as each turkey producer is allowed to create
its own name for this designation, as long as it isn't misleading.
Holding turkey at this temperature range prolongs shelf life and
has little effect on quality.
 &HT;    + What about frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    Frozen turkeys are the least expensive, but freezing dries out
the meat, and more moisture is lost down the drain during
defrosting. Good turkey producers always inject the birds with a
moistening solution to replace the lost liquid. The best frozen
turkeys have been injected only with wholesome ingredients like
broth, vegetable oil and seasonings.
 &HT;    Also, frozen birds require advance planning to defrost. I hardly
have enough room in my refrigerator at holiday time as it is,
without a huge turkey taking up all the space while it thaws for
three to five days.
 &HT;    Considering the minor difference in price between frozen and
fresh (or hard-chilled, which is almost as good as fresh) turkeys,
why not get the best you can afford?
 &HT;    + If I do buy a frozen turkey, how do I defrost it?
 &HT;    First and foremost, never defrost a turkey at room temperature.
 &HT;    Allow enough time for the turkey to thaw. It takes a full 24
hours to defrost each five pounds of turkey in the refrigerator.
So, if you want a 25-pound turkey to be thoroughly defrosted by
Thanksgiving morning, you must buy it by the preceding Sunday at
the latest. (I'd buy it on Saturday, just to be sure.)
 &HT;    If you are in a hurry, a second-best option is to defrost the
bird in a large sink of cold water, allowing 30 minutes per pound,
changing the water and turning the turkey often. Do not add warm
water to hasten the process.
 &HT;    Don't defrost a turkey in the microwave oven. The turkey is
irregularly shaped, and some parts of the bird will cook while
others are still defrosting. Besides, most microwave ovens won't
hold a bird larger than 12 pounds.
 &HT;    + What about self-basting birds?
 &HT;    Self-basting birds, available fresh and frozen, have been
``enhanced'' (in the eyes of the producer) with flavorings, some
natural and some artificial. They purport to make the turkey moist
_ I say these make the turkey soggy and wet, and predisposed to
fall apart when lifting it from the pan.
 &HT;    They say the basting liquid makes the turkey taste better _ I
say a turkey tastes good enough without fake flavorings. I want to
promote turkeys that taste like turkey, not canned soup.
 &HT;    And I like to baste the bird, so the concept of ``self-basting''
leaves me cold. Not only does opening the oven and basting give the
cook an idea of the turkey's progress, but the hot basting liquid
helps to brown and seal the skin and hold in the juices.
 &HT;    + My farmers' market has organic, free-range birds. Are they
worth the price?
 &HT;    The terms organic and free-range are not recognized by the USDA.
Butchers, farmers and restaurants can use them as marketing terms,
but they cannot use them in labeling (although they can be written
on signs advertising the product).
 &HT;    Generally, ``organic poultry'' has been raised on organically
grown, antibiotic-free feed. ``Free-range'' turkeys, which are
often organic, have been raised in a relatively spacious
environment that gives them access to open spaces.
 &HT;    Many turkeys that are not called free-range may have been raised
in henhouses with the same amount of space. The term free-range may
make you think of wide-open skies, but it's no guarantee that the
birds have ever been outside _ it just means that the door to the
henhouse is open and they can go out if they want to.
 &HT;    These birds can be excellent, but, again, they still need to be
cooked carefully for fine results. They are significantly more
expensive than ordinary fresh turkeys, and whether they are worth
it or not is up to you.
 &HT;    + My specialty butcher carries wild turkeys. What are they like?
 &HT;    Today, most wild turkeys are actually farm-raised. They are very
full-flavored, but not gamy like hunter-bagged wild turkeys. Most
true, wild turkeys are so tough that cooks roast only the tender
breast and stew the dark meat. I like to say they are to regular
turkeys what sourdough bread is to white bread. Some people just
like the complex flavor of the former better than the latter.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys look much different from regular ones, with a high,
humped breastbone and freckled white skin. While wild turkeys may
look meaty, they actually have a very low meat-to-bone ratio. Their
weight ranges from only six to 12 pounds. Allow about 1 1/2 pounds
per person.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys are very lean and should be roasted only to 170 to
175 degrees, or the meat will dry out. The dark meat may be a
little pink, but it is safe to eat. If you prefer your dark meat
more well-done, just pop the sliced meat back into a 400-degree
oven for a few minutes _ it will probably be cooked by the time you
get around to serving the mashed potatoes.
 &HT;    + My neighbor swears by kosher turkeys. What makes them
different?
 &HT;    Kosher turkeys are raised free-range in a manner similar to
organic turkeys and are fed antibiotic-free feed. They are
slaughtered and salted according to Jewish dietary laws. Some cooks
feel that the method of slaughtering gives the birds a fresher,
cleaner taste. The salting seasons the turkeys and makes their meat
somewhat firmer than that of regular birds.
 &HT;    These extra steps are labor-intensive, so kosher turkeys always
cost more. Many kosher turkeys are frozen, so be sure to defrost
them properly to protect your investment.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 By ELLEN H. PARLAPIANO AND PATRICIA COBE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

<P>
   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office
users. Claris/Filemaker, 800-544-8554, $79 for Windows, $99 for
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive, and expensive, productivity suite is
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition Version 2.0, which
includes Word 97, Excel 97 (spreadsheet), Publisher 98 (desktop
publishing), Outlook 98 (integrated E-mail) and Small Business
Financial Manager 98 (financial analysis and reporting tools).

   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.

 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.
</P>

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office
users. Claris/Filemaker, 800-544-8554, $79 for Windows, $99 for
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive, and expensive, productivity suite is
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition Version 2.0, which
includes Word 97, Excel 97 (spreadsheet), Publisher 98 (desktop
publishing), Outlook 98 (integrated E-mail) and Small Business
Financial Manager 98 (financial analysis and reporting tools).
</P>
<P>
   Two extras you'll find handy are the Direct Mail Manager, a
program for developing and managing direct mail lists, and Expedia
Streets 98, an easy way to locate key customers and integrate maps
into your marketing materials. Microsoft, 800-426-9400, $500.
</P>
<P>
   Jian Software offers a terrific set of nuts-and-bolts programs
designed to help you plan and organize your entire operation, from
working up your initial business plan to marketing and employee
management. Titles in the series include BizPlan Builder,
PublicityBuilder and BusinessBasics. This helpful software walks
you through the planning step by step and provides hundreds of
customizable templates for documents of all types. Jian Software,
800-346-5426, $50-$150.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining an upscale image on a barebones budget is easier
with Business Card, Ink &AMP; More, a program that lets you design and
print out professional-looking stationery and business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you incorporate an existing logo or dream up a new de-
sign, you'll have ample guidance and materials. DogByte
Development, 800-936-4298, $35.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   The program's standout features include instant access to
electronic banking and payment, custom invoices and inventory
management. Intuit, 800-4-INTUIT, $100.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Dahl's favorite timesaving tools: the Pitney Bowes
Personal Post Office Miter. This nifty device lets her download
postage by phone with a 30-second tollfree call. The meter prints
l0 envelopes per minute and holds up to $1,000 in postage _ making
trips to the post office a chore of the past. Pitney Bowes,
800-672-6937, $20 per month plus postage.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.

`THE MIND' VENTURA ALREADY RENEGES ON A CAMPAIGN PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the grand tradition of Abraham Lincoln, Jesse
``The Body'' Ventura has answered the higher call of public
service.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, Abraham ``The Beard'' Lincoln first made a name
for himself in Illinois as a wrestler before duty and the nation
summoned him to run the country. The Body found fame and fortune in
the World Wrestling Federation before Minnesotans promised him the
keys to the governor's mansion if he'd do the honor of running
their state.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address. The Body addressed the
public the day after the election and likened himself to the lead
character from an old Rodney Dangerfield movie: ``It's time to go
back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln freed the slaves before dying from an assassin's bullet.
The Body has the distinction of being the only actor to kill Arnold
Schwarzenegger on screen. That was in ``Predator,'' where The Body
played a soldier who uttered the memorable words, ``I ain't got
time to bleed.''
</P>
<P>
   The rise of The Body to the governorship of Minnesota will
endure forever more as a cautionary tale of what can happen when
people decide to cast ``protest'' votes for candidates they're
certain cannot win. The Body is a 6-foot-4-inch, 250-pound cross
between Mr. Clean and G. Gordon Liddy.
</P>
<P>
   Running as a candidate from Ross Perot's Reform Party, The Body
got 37 percent of the vote to defeat Republican Norm Coleman and
Democrat Hubert Humphrey III. Weeks earlier, Coleman had suggested
that any vote for The Body was a wasted vote. Now The Body is the
first member of the Reform Party to win a statewide election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wasted them with wasted votes,'' The Body said. Actually,
The Body would appreciate it if people stopped referring to him as
The Body. Henceforth, he would like people to call him The Mind. He
did, after all, mimic a pose of Rodin's ``The Thinker'' sculpture
in political ads. Not that The Mind has overburdened himself with
thoughts of what he would do if he actually won. Asked the day
after the election about his plans for the state, The Mind said,
``I'm not sure at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mind, after all, has been busy campaigning and serving as a
volunteer high school football coach. He put the voters' minds at
ease by reassuring them that he didn't even know what the team's
game plan was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply will say I will do the best job I'm capable of
doing,'' said The Mind, whose body of work includes stints as a
Navy SEAL, a California motorcycle club member, a bouncer, a Tampa
Bay Buccaneers' analyst, radio talk-show host and mayor of a town
of 60,000 in suburban Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The general thrust of the The Mind's vague campaign was to cut
the size of government. The Mind supports gay and abortion rights
and is in favor of legalizing drugs and prostitution. His first
choice as running mate was Kent Hrbek, the former Twins first
baseman. Hrbek weighed his civic duties against how much they would
interfere with his hunting, fishing and bowling. He declined the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a politician,'' Hrbek said. ``Then again, neither is
Jesse.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there is more politician in The Mind than first meets the
eye. One of his campaign promises was to rappel into the Capitol
from a helicopter if elected. The Mind arrived for a meeting
Wednesday with outgoing Gov. Arne Carlson in a white Lincoln Town
Car, escorted by the state police. One promise broken less than 24
hours after the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   Gopher from ``The Love Boat'' got voted into Congress, and the
republic is still standing. Why not see what happens when a
47-year-old reformed wrestler tries to conduct government business
as unusual? As one Minnesotan wrote in a letter to the Minneapolis
Star-Tribune, ``Well, finally we have a governor who knows how to
execute a flying head scissors!''
</P>
<P>
   What a trip it will be, even if Ventura Highway doesn't run all
the way to Washington, D.C.

HELLS ANGELS ROAR AT CENTER OF VIOLENT QUEBEC DRUG WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Hells, no apostrophe, is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ As the body count continues to rise in Quebec's
vicious biker war, one of its generals _ a Hells Angel honcho known
as ``Mom'' _ went to trial this week amid some of the heaviest
security ever seen in a Canadian courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom'' is the nickname of Maurice Boucher, the bespectacled and
oddly preppie-looking overlord of ``les Hells,'' as riders of the
outlaw gang are known to Quebecers. He is accused in the killings
of two Quebec prison guards _ hits apparently ordered to teach a
lesson after correction officials showed disrespect for Angels in
custody.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big case for the hard-pressed forces of the law in a
province where mayhem and massacre have become commonplace, thanks
to Boucher and his savage breed.
</P>
<P>
   But even with the Angels' bossman behind bars, car bombs are
still exploding across the province with appalling frequency, and
hardly a week passes without a midnight ambush outside some
biker-controlled strip joint or tawdry roadhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The war pitting Quebec's Hells Angels against a hodgepodge of
rival biker gangs, backed by the province's more traditional
organized crime groups, is roaring toward its fifth year, with the
death tally growing and no end in sight. At stake is the Quebec
drug trade as well as prostitution, smuggling, auto theft,
extortion and other rackets worth tens of millions of dollars
annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is about turf, profits and market share _ not some
abstract biker honor,'' said Corporal Jacques Lemieux, a Royal
Canadian Mounted Police investigator assigned to the Criminal
Intelligence Service of Canada. ``So that makes it deadly
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The Quebec war is considered the bloodiest in the 50-year
history of the world's most infamous biker bunch. At least 93 are
dead so far, with scores more maimed or seriously wounded; mostly
bikers and their thuggish comrades, but also civilians cut down in
the crossfire. So extraordinary has the level of violence become
that even the Economist, a serious British news magazine little
given to sensationalism, recently ran a lengthy examination of the
Hells Angels' audacious grab for criminal power in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two weeks alone, three bikers have been cut down
in a fierce spiral of retaliation between the Angels and their
criminal competitors. One shot dead in the gritty city of Laval,
the riddled body of another found in his Montreal apartment, the
charred corpse of a third pulled from a black Jeep Cherokee _
trademark transport of the gang in a province whose long winters
discourage roaring about on Harley-Davidsons _ after the vehicle
exploded on a road north of Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate gang funerals have become routine in Montreal, with
bikers arriving in menacing regalia to mourn their fallen chums
while police surveillance teams and news photographers snap away
behind long lenses.
</P>
<P>
   The Hells Angels Motorcycle Club was incorporated in California
in 1948 by restless World War II veterans bound by a passion for
riding Harleys and raising Cain. For decades, they were little more
than underwashed, beer-swilling rowdies, dangerous only to those
foolish enough to sass them in saloons.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, the Angels rank among the world's most ruthless
organized crime syndicates, with 125 chapters in 22 countries in
North and South America, Europe and the Pacific. That figure
includes the Nomads, an elite corps of Angels, but not the hundreds
of lesser biker gangs that operate under the direct control of the
Hells.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the times: The Angels boast their own Internet
Website. They hawk T-shirts by electronic order and warn that both
their name _ with its eccentric, apostrophe-less spelling _ and
their death's head symbol are copyrighted corporate logos.
</P>
<P>
   Although long entrenched in British Columbia, the Hells didn't
move into Quebec until 1977, when they took over a homegrown gang,
the Popeyes. Today, the French-speaking riders of the province's
chapters are considered the most murderous members of the
notoriously violence-prone fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to make spectacular hits intended to horrify, not
just intimidate or coerce. They sometimes act more like terrorists
than ordinary criminals,'' said Jean-Paul Brodeur, a criminologist
with the University of Montreal's International Center for
Comparative Criminology. ``They are organized to deliver full-scale
war.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1994 that the Hells Angels moved to take over Quebec's
illegal drug trade. But they were met with surprisingly fierce
resistance from a Montreal-based biker band called the Rock
Machine, which police describe as essentially a front group for the
province's more traditional crime families.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected the Rock Machine to last this long against a
group so big, powerful and internationally connected,'' said
Lemieux. ``Now the Hells are stepping up the war. They want to
bring it to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, two top leaders of the Rock Machine have been
gunned down in ambushes, a marked change from earlier tactics in
which the foot soldiers of both sides were targeted, but rarely the
generals.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time they were going after the knees,'' said RCMP
Staff Sergeant J.P. Levesque, an organized crime specialist. ``Now
they are going for the head.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several bomb blasts in September narrowly missed
Hells Angels, ripping apart vehicles and raising the fear level on
the streets of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Police efforts to bring the battling factions under control have
been largely thwarted, although the arrest of Boucher following the
killings of the two prison guards was an important coup. But last
July, in a major setback to law enforcement, five Angels associates
were acquitted of murdering a Rock Machine rival, apparently
because jurors were unconvinced that the killing of gangsters by
other gangsters represented a social wrong.
</P>
<P>
   According to Quebec news reports, the Rock Machine may be
negotiating an alliance with the Texas-based Bandidos, archrivals
of the Hells Angels and the only other biker gang with an
international reach.
</P>
<P>
   The last blowout between the Bandidos and Angels was fought in
Scandinavia with assault rifles and grenade launchers. It ended in
a truce several weeks ago after a dozen or so deaths, making it a
mere skirmish compared to the Quebec carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Canada, the Hells Angels are growing fast, adding
new chapters in Alberta and Saskatchewan in recent months.
According to police, the gang is a major crime presence in every
province except Ontario and tiny Prince Edward Island _ and is well
on its way toward controlling serious drug trafficking across the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   In British Columbia and Nova Scotia, for instance, the Hells
Angels control not only distribution of heroin, cocaine and
hydroponically grown marijuana, but also, through waterfront
unions, the ports at which smuggled drugs enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are using this particular province and this particular
sea coast as a platform to the world,'' Halifax's police chief,
Vincent MacDonald, recently told reporters. ``They are involved in
international organized crime.''
</P>
<P>
   If Quebec falls, the Hells Angels are almost certain to turn
their attention to Ontario, Canada's most populous province and the
only important territory in Canada they have failed to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   Police say that entry into Ontario might result in another
bloody war, since at least 13 rival biker gangs are already active
in that province, and other organized crime groups such as the
Mafia and Asian triads are unlikely to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Hells Angels emerge as the undisputed winners in the
Quebec war, potential enemies in Ontario might be frightened into
cutting them a big piece of the action without a battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hells have never lost a war, and can't afford to lose this
one,'' said anthropologist Daniel Wolf, who once rode with an
Alberta affiliate of the Angels. ``A big part of their power stems
from their image as the bikers that never back down.''

   The Harvard Business School seems to be out of the business of
selling $6,000 videotapes with Rosabeth Moss Kanter droning out
platitudes like ``Great companies are focused in their approach to
doing business.'' (They will, however sell you a $495, 30-minute
video on ``Managing Future Performance.'') Now the B-School has a
brand new bag: flacking for the ``personal development'' seminar
known as The Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based Forum came into being when Werner Erhard
(John Paul Rosenberg to his parents) sold the ``technology'' for
Erhard Seminars Training _ est _ to his brother Harry. The Forum,
formally known as the Landmark Education Corp., has enjoyed
considerable success with the self-actualization crowd, and with
the Cambridge intelligentsia. That success is now chronicled in an
HBS case study so sycophantic that Landmark has been using it _
improperly, Harvard says _ as a promotional tool.
</P>
<P>
   The document, originally written for classroom discussion, is
also sold to the public. Last revised in April, it reads like a
22-page advertisement for Landmark's ``breakthrough in paradigm
thinking.'' Authored by professor Karen Hopper Wruck, the case
breathlessly quotes Forum executives who compare their work to that
of Galileo and Socrates (!). The study also quotes from a
Forum-sponsored Daniel Yankelovich survey of graduates. Surprise!
All six veterans of the Forum's weekend training quoted by Wruck
loved it!
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wruck quickly dismisses critics who call the Forum a cult.
The Forum is listed on the Internet FACTnet database of ``cults,
groups and individuals that are alleged to be using coercive
persuasion mind control techniques,'' but they have sued people who
call them a cult. In an appendix, she quotes at length from four
experts who insist the Forum is not a cult, but cites no contrary
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Had Wruck been seeking to find anyone critical of the
touchy-feely Forum she needed only to cross the campus and chat
with Radcliffe public policy fellow Wendy Kaminer. The Forum is the
subject of acidulous commentary in Kaminer's best-selling book,
``I'm Dysfunctional, You're Dysfunctional.'' ``If you want to
experience or `process' New Age's heady combination of
pseudoscience, religion, and money,'' writes Kaminer, ``visit a
session or two of The Forum, the new incarnation of est.''
</P>
<P>
   In her defense, Wruck told me: ``I understood that it was a
controversial company, but I wanted to study a company that
directly addressed issues around human behavior. A case study is a
pedagogical vehicle, not a position paper or an endorsement.''
Harvard has affixed an unprecedented disclaimer (``Please be aware
that ... the school does not endorse this company or any other
company'') to the document.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Kamin, a Landmark spokesman, said his company ordered
several thousand copies of the document after it was published. He
adds that Landmark signed an agreement with Harvard not to use the
case for promotional purposes, ``and we've endeavored to keep that
agreement.'' When I told him that a recent seminar attendee said
the case was being used to puff Landmark, Kamin said, ``I can't
guarantee that people who led seminars didn't say, `Hey, there's
this case study.'''

   Three years ago, I wrote an item about UMass-Lowell music
professor Jacqueline Charette's decade-long quest to erect a statue
of Claude Debussy in France. Charette considers Debussy ``the
founder of modernism in music'' and was appalled that, although he
stares out from a stamp and from the 20-franc note, he had never
been statue-fied in the land of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in the Paris suburb of St. German-en-Laye, Debussy's
birthplace, Ms. Charette's dream will be realized. After raising
over $200,000 (including over $9,000 from readers of this column,
by the way; thank you), Charette and the mayor of St. Germain will
be unveiling Tewksbury sculptor Mico Kaufman's 6-foot-tall bronze
on a square just in front of the Debussy Museum. The statue,
depicting Debussy held aloft by characters from his best-known
creations from ``Pelleas et Melisande'' and ``L'Apres-midi d'un
Faune'' is a gift from that most shadowy of constructs, the
American people.

MINNESOTA HAS `THE BODY,' CALIFORNIA `THE MOUTH' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Out-flacked by Minnesota. The shame of it all.
It's bedtime for gonzo politics for the state that gave the nation
such entertainer-politicians as Ronald Reagan, George Murphy (a
tap-dancer, kids) and Sonny Bono.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota elected a professional wrestler named Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura as governor. California elected a professional
politician named Gray ``The Gray'' Davis.
</P>
<P>
   It's come down to this. Tom ``The Mouth'' Ammiano is
California's only hope.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco stood up for the great California political
tradition by electing this gay stand-up comic as president of the
Board of Supervisors. Ammiano is intrigued by Ventura for
supporting gay rights and for being downright likable.
</P>
<P>
   He also admires Ventura's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you hate a man who wears a feather boa to work?''
Ammiano said.
</P>
<P>
   God Bless America. I love this country, from Great Lakes to
shining seas.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has, well, a couple of things in common with Ventura
besides a thing for feather boas. Like Ventura, Ammiano didn't get
into politics until his 40s. He says being a stand-up comic was
good preparation for politics, and not just because it was funny
San Francisco politics.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano also was a teacher, which is a little like stand-up
comedy except the audience is required by law to attend, but not
allowed to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand-up comedy is often trivialized, but it teaches you
survival skills,'' Ammiano said. ``I remember being at Rooster T.
Feathers once when even the straight comics were scared of the
crowd. I had Tim (Curbo, his late partner) wait in the car with the
engine running.''
</P>
<P>
   See, Minnesota, it's tougher to be a stand-up comic than a pro
wrestler. You don't know how it's going to come out. And most
people don't want to take on wrestlers, but everyone wants to joke
with comics.
</P>
<P>
   As I spoke to Ammiano on the phone, he kept saying ``Thank you''
to people walking by his office and congratulating him on his
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The queens are all calling me `Your Holiness' and `Your
Excellency,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Minnesota, ``The Body'' wanted people to start
calling him ``The Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura seems like a good and honest man, but there are those in
Minnesota who wonder if his mind is a worthy tag-team partner for
his body.
</P>
<P>
   To quote a friend in Minneapolis (who wishes to remain anonymous
so she won't be body-slammed out of her state job): ``Yaah, ya
know, Jesse may not be the brightest bulb on the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   They talk so cute in Minnesota, like in that movie ``Fargo,''
made by a bunch of Californians.
</P>
<P>
   Those Minnesotans were just lulling us into complacency with
their ``goshes'' and ``darn tootin's.'' Now they're the hippest
state in the nation. Ventura has dominated news coverage this week
the way Monica once did.
</P>
<P>
   Another defeat for California: Minnesota may be the capital of
filmmaking, as long as Ventura's political ad man Bill Hillsman
works there.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis Star-Tribune television critic Noel Holston gave a
rave review to Ventura's advertising. One of them had a kid with a
Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura action figure battling a kid with a
Special Interest Man action figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two kids rolled around on the ground, and Jesse basically
kicked the crap out of the special interest guy,'' Holston said.
``It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant.''
</P>
<P>
   Another advertisement showed Ventura seemingly naked in the pose
of Rodin's ``The Thinker,'' while the narrator recited the
political positions of Jesse ``The Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Jesse winked.
</P>
<P>
   Holston said his favorite was a radio ad that talked about a
huge man, a wrestler who wasn't college educated and was scoffed at
for not being presidential material _ yes, it was Abe ``The
Rail-Splitter'' Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has figured out Americans better than any California
political entertainer since Reagan. He is conservative on crime and
fiscal issues, and liberal on social issues like abortion and gay
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's basically the way Americans are,'' Holston said.
``Democrats and Republicans can accept half of that. They were
defeated by their inability to embrace the fact that Americans
wanted something from Column A and something from Column B.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure California or the nation is ready for something
from Column Ammiano, but he's all we've got.
</P>
<P>
   I'm aware he's hated by some people in San Francisco. He doesn't
have the broad populist appeal of a guy who has gone toe-to-toe
with Hulk Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano for governor in 2002? Maybe. No more bores, just boas.
</P>
<P>
   We've got to catch up with Minnesota before they change their
license plates to say ``Land of 10,000 Flakes.''

KEEPING FAITH WITH `X-FILES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE X-FILES 
Starring: David Duchovny, Gillian Anderson, Mimi Rogers, William B.
Davis, Wendie Malick, Chris Owens, Mitch Pileggi 
ON: Fox, Sunday, 9-10 p.m. 
Rated: TV14 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The X-Files,'' which returns Sunday at 9 p.m., must be the
most withholding series on television. It's smart, stylish, and
altogether stingy, doling out the satisfactions of plot development
with unequaled reticence. Not that creator Chris Carter and his
crew of writers don't snow us with a constant flurry of clues and
connections, but I'll be darned if they don't always melt the
minute they hit the ground. The most you can hope for on ``The
X-Files'' is a glimpse of the possibility of the probability of the
truth, a truth that will be fleeting and, of course, very
out-there.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, after this summer's mediocre ``X-Files'' movie
failed to deliver any promised progress, the bluff factor of ``The
X-Files'' is becoming annoying and self-parodic. The bottomless
paranoia is losing its charms. In Sunday's season premiere, David
Duchovny's Mulder is still asking, ``What does that mean, Scully?''
and Gillian Anderson's Scully is still answering, ``I don't know,
but I think we're onto something; we're onto something huge, a
link.'' Promises, promises. And the show's personal story, among
Mulder, Scully, and now Mimi Rogers's Fowley, remains as slippery
as ever, even after the romantic near miss of the movie. Their
feelings are so muted you need to crank the volume on your
emotional hearing aid for a sign of life, even if few actors can
sigh quite as thoroughly as Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the season premiere of ``The X-Files'' seems to bring
together a few strands from last season's cliffhanger and the
movie, ``seems'' being the operative word. (Don't turn off your
``X-Files'' red-herring detector yet.) The little boy with ESP,
Gibson, is back, and he is joined to the alien invasion plot from
the movie. Also on hand are Agent Fowley, who has replaced Mulder
on the X-Files, and Chris Owens's Agent Spender, the son of
Cigarette Smoking Man (really, he's Cigarette Fake-Smoking Man). Is
Fowley trying to help her ex, Mulder, with whom she founded the
X-Files? Or is she one of the bad guys? And why does the screen
repeatedly fade from Mulder's face into Spender's?
</P>
<P>
   Mixed in with Scully and Mulder's frantic search for the aliens,
which fancy the heat of nuclear reactors, Sunday's episode features
some trademark in-jokes. For instance, the panel of disbelieving
FBI stiffs interrogating Mulder about the events portrayed in the
movie are named after film writers, one of whom is played by the
amusing Wendie Malick of ``Just Shoot Me.'' There's also a small,
sly reference to another Fox show, ``The Simpsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Carter is not about to spill a significant number of
the beans, even if this is the show's sixth season. By definition,
``The X-Files'' needs to dodge denouement, to keep viewers'
suspicions roused, and to test their faith that someday it will all
make sense. But perhaps by clarifying connections among some of the
characters this season, Carter will be freed up to take the show
deep into some fresh new mystery. And maybe then we will be able to
watch the show without getting that sinking feeling.

`WIZARD' SHINES IN ALL ITS RERELEASE FINERY  
 WE'RE OUT TO SEE THE WIZARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 60 years after its premiere at the Loew's Capitol Theatre
in New York, ``The Wizard of Oz'' has become as much as a precious
heirloom as a classic film. The famed 1939 screen adaptation of L.
Frank Baum's children's book, ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,''
released in a restored version today, has passed from one
generation to the next, each enchanted by the fabled journey of
Dorothy and her friends over the rainbow. But it wasn't always that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, in a very frightening land called Hollywood,
``The Wizard of Oz'' was considered something of a flop. Made for
what was then an eye-popping $3.5 million, the film failed to break
even. Some critics found it sluggish and dry. And it certainly
didn't help that the film was overshadowed during what many still
consider the finest year for American movies _ including ``Gone
With the Wind,'' ``Dark Victory,'' ``Destry Rides Again,'' and
``Goodbye, Mr. Chips.'' To some, it wasn't even the best film
directed by Victor Fleming that year; it was Fleming who received
the on-screen directing credit for ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``The Wizard of Oz'' was always a glorious film. On
screen, Baum's tale of a young girl whisked by tornado from the
gray dust of her Kansas farm to a faraway paradise, was fresh and
wondrous, quite unlike anything seen before. From its dazzling
score by Herbert Stothart, with songs by Harold Arlen and E.Y.
Harburg, to the stunning scenery, the film was refreshing and
ambitious. There had been other screen adaptations of the story,
most notably a 1925 film with Oliver Hardy (of Laurel and Hardy
fame) as the Tin Man, but the 1939 film was most faithful to Baum's
book, and became recognized as the definitive version.
</P>
<P>
   And the cast could not have been more perfect: Judy Garland's
spunky, wide-eyed Dorothy (MGM originally wanted Shirley Temple,
but she was under contract with Fox); Ray Bolger's fire-fearing,
spaghetti-limbed Scarecrow; Jack Haley's sweet, vulnerable Tin Man
(Buddy Ebsen was the original choice, and his voice appears on the
soundtrack, but he was allergic to the aluminum powder makeup);
Bert Lahr's campy Cowardly Lion; Margaret Hamilton's cackling
Wicked Witch of the West; and Frank Morgan as the wily Wizard, who
is more _ and less _ than what he seems.
</P>
<P>
   But it took television to elevate ``The Wizard of Oz'' to its
deserved mantle of greatness. In 1956, the film began annual
airings on CBS, and soon it was widely beloved by both children and
adults for its ever-resonant messages about the value of
friendship, discovery, and especially, home.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us who've seen ``The Wizard of Oz'' (and who hasn't?),
have probably watched the film dozens of times. But it is not an
overstatement to say you have not truly seen this film, nor can it
be fully appreciated, until you view it as it was originally
intended _ on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the restored film in a theater is like watching it for
the first time. It has been painstakingly improved through a new
Technicolor dye-transfer process. It's too technical to explain
(and I'm not sure I could do it anyway), but suffice it to say that
the end results are amazing and breathtaking. There's even an added
crispness to the sepia-toned segments that frame Dorothy's odyssey
in Oz.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, the famous flying cow scene in the 1996 summer
blockbuster ``Twister,'' was a nod to ``The Wizard of Oz,'' which
has its own airborne bovine in its tornado sequence.)
</P>
<P>
   But nothing will quite prepare audiences for the orgy of color
that explodes when Dorothy first arrives in Oz. When she opens the
door, that moment the film slides into color is a revelation flush
with vibrant reds and yellows and greens and blues. There are
details, long unnoticed on television, that clamor for attention in
this restoration. For instance, the coroner who declares the newly
deceased Wicked Witch of the East ``not only merely dead, she's
really most sincerely dead,'' is not shrouded in black. In fact,
his suit is deep purple, with playful swatches of blue and green.
You can see the rust on the Tin Man's suit of armor, the stitch and
weave of the Scarecrow's face. Many of the Munchkins have
multicolored hair, and Dorothy's ruby slippers absolutely glow
against the sun-kissed gold of the yellow brick road. Those flying
monkeys, fodder for thousands of childhood nightmares, are more
ghoulish and frightening, as well as those testy, apple-growing and
apple-throwing trees, whose movements seem more defined.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the details may even be too clear; you can see
the wire that makes the Cowardly Lion's tail switch, as well as the
thin overhead wire that holds the Scarecrow on his stake when
Dorothy first meets him.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, this isn't some Ted Turner-colorized mess
that barely resembles the original. In every way, the restoration
enhances the film. So many films have been rereleased this year _
``Touch of Evil,'' ``Grease,'' ``Gone With the Wind,'' and also
today, ``The Big Chill,'' among them _ but ``The Wizard of Oz'' is
arguably the best. This version recalls all we lose as movie lovers
when we watch films on television, whether on cable or videotape.
</P>
<P>
   Television certainly deserves credit for res-urrecting ``The
Wizard of Oz'' in the 1950s, but this rerelease makes clear that
the theater is where the film belongs. There, its viewers can be
fully enveloped in the astonishing sights and sounds, and secreted
away, as if for the first time, to the merry old land of Oz. When
``The Wizard of Oz'' was made, its creators never envisioned that
it would someday be consigned to a 20-inch box and that details
meant to sparkle would sadly fade or go unnoticed entirely. At
last, their vision _ as well as this marvelous film _ is realized
and restored.

NAILS SHOWING THROUGH CEILING? 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Q. My screened and closed-in porch has a solid roof, with
matchstick wainscoting as a ceiling. The wainscoting is nailed on
top of the rafters, acting as roof sheathing as well as inside
ceiling, exposing the rafters. Roll roofing was installed with
extra-long nails, some of which show through the wainscoting. What,
if anything, can I do about those nails?
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATED CALLER
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You can't pull the nails or cut them; even substituting short
nails is not practical; it would mean ripping off the old roll
roofing and relaying new. But If you want to keep the wainscoting
showing, there is no other choice.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one possible solution, but it covers the wainscoting.
Cut Homasote sheets to fit between the rafters, prepaint with two
coats of latex solid stain or latex ceiling paint and press into
place, impaling the material on the nails coming through. You could
nail a quarter-round molding along the edge to hold the Homasote in
place and make a neat edge. Homasote is a heavy-duty papier mache
material thqt comes in sheets half an inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   The only other way to cover the nails is to nail more
wainscoting to the rafters. This would cover the beams, of course,
but it would keep the wainscoting look.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A tack strip holding wall-to-wall carpeting left many holes
in my concrete basement floor. I removed the carpeting and tack
strip, and plan to install resilient tile. Should I fill those
holes, which are a quarter- to half-inch in diameter, or can they
be left open?
</P>
<P>
   AUDREY BENEVENTO, Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Fill the holes with Top 'n Bond, a hydraulic cement. Pack it
thoroughly, smooth off, and let set. You might get away without
filling the holes, because most of them are near the basement
perimeter and would not be walked on. Still, the resilient tiles
might tend to sink into the holes over time, so it is best to fill
them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My neighbors received notices that they must redo their
sidewalks, that the present ones are inadequate. I received a
similar notice, to do something about the big 5-foot by 5-foot,
2-inch-thick slates that are broken and cracked. And it is not just
the walk that goes from house to street, but the sidewalk that runs
parallel to the street. We are in a historic section of the city.
How can I fix that slate? Is there any substitute?
</P>
<P>
   MARK MILLER, Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The sidewalk parallel to the street is not even yours; that
belongs to the city, at least in normal circumstances. And the
other sidewalk is yours, so it is nobody's business. But I suppose
the historical commisison can do what it pleases. Such commissions
can be a big pain sometimes, and the homeowenr is stuck because he
bought a house in a historical district.
</P>
<P>
   But enough of politics. What you can do is have the pieces of
slate lifted and set in stone dust or sand. I imagine broken slate
must be replaced. If you can't get such huge piece of slate, settle
for smaller pieces or install flagstone, if the historical
busybodies approve.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My quarry tile is 18 years old. I put on a polish, but some
of it peeled. I can't chip it off so I tried polishing it with
Armstrong's Shine Keeper; now some parts are shiny and some are
not. What can I do to make the whole floor consistent?
</P>
<P>
   KATHY MILMOE, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Admittedly quarry tile is good looking, but being unglazed it
is extremely absorbent, and will take up all kinds of stains, which
are difficult to remove. So ``they'' suggest putting all kinds of
stuff on them to make them washable and stain-resistant. Many such
applications either peel or create white spots.
</P>
<P>
   So, my suggestions are iffy at best. For starters, put on
another coat of Shine Keeper to see if that makes the shine
consistent. Do this first in an obscure or small area to see if it
works. Or, apply a thin coat of Future to an obscure area to see
what it will do; it should give a fair, consistent shine, but it
also might cause white spots to appear, especially if applied to
another sealer. But if no spots appear and the shine is consistent,
then do the entire floor.
</P>
<P>
   If Future doesn't work, there is no choice but to remove
everything. Dip steel wool in paint thinner and scrub each tile
thoroughly. Or, use chemical paint remover, scrubbing with steel
wool. Wear skin and eye proteciton when using paint remover, and
use lots of ventilation as well. Use one of the milder paint
removers such as CitriStrip.
</P>
<P>
   If you ever get down to the unsealed tile, then you can apply a
coat of Future, which will give a shine, or masonry sealer, which
will provide no shine but help make the tile water and stain
resistant.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the opportunity to re-floor, use glazed ceramic
tile; it comes in a high or low shine. The handyman has gotten into
big trouble in the past for his suggestions on treating quarry
tile, so he gives yout his caveat: No quarantees that these
treatments will work or not make the tile worse looking.
</P>
<P>

LONG LIST OF NEGATIVES SANK HARSHBARGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Cellucci won for a lot of reasons: He ran a better
campaign, spent more money, used the governor's patronage powers to
capture or neuter some Democratic renegades, packaged a simpler
good-times message _ death (penalty) and (no new) taxes _ worked a
cozy relationship with the State House press corps, scored better
in debates.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Harshbarger lost for a lot of reasons. Coming off a
patty-cake Democratic primary, where the rule was nicely-nicely so
as not to alienate backers of Pat McGovern or Brian Donnelly, he
thought he could run a clean issues campaign. Like Mike Dukakis
sailing innocently to battle against George Bush (and Willie
Horton) 10 years ago, the Democratic nominee was unprepared to go
negative, raw, or dirty _ which was the GOP battle plan from the
outset.
</P>
<P>
   Using negative ads reinforced by overall better performance in
debates, Cellucci after the six-week campaign had convinced voters
that Harshbarger was a tax-hiker and a dirty campaigner _ a
double-or-nothing brainwashing that took hold. Unlike Cellucci,
Harshbarger never voted to raise a tax.
</P>
<P>
   Unschooled in the give-and-take of legislative debate like
Cellucci, Harshbarger in the first debate was led like a lamb to
slaughter. Berated as a spendthrift _ ``Your first instinct is to
raise taxes'' _ Harshbarger lacked the swift uppercut response:
``No, Paul, unlike you, I've never voted to raise taxes. And
speaking of instincts, your first instinct is to borrow against the
future and risk bankruptcy down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been a natural segue into two chinks in
Cellucci's armor: his $2,300-per-person bond debt level which
saddles future taxpayers with a big 30-year payout, and Cellucci's
still-astonishing and still-unexplained personal debt of an
estimated $730,000. When Cellucci shoved his wife out to claim
Harshbarger was dirty-politicking by picking on the family, that
capped the issue Harshbarger was never clever enough to fully
exploit.
</P>
<P>
   The media coverage allowed Cellucci to play offense and forced
Harshbarger to play defense. Even the Democrat's
pow-right-in-the-kisser in the third debate was squashed by
universal media jeers for the format _ the third lousy format in a
row, all dictated by media executives, each marred by incompetent
moderating and undisciplined audiences. Ignored in the coverage was
the basic fact: Every debate Cellucci was in _ primary and general
_ degenerated as Cellucci worked his crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking personal connections with many top Democrats who felt
he'd been an over-eager and tone-deaf prosecutor, Harshbarger was
unable to soften his stern image either with paid ads or impromptu
politicking. His primary night acceptance speech was his best to
date, but got lost in Cellucci's let's-come-out-negative barrage.
Harshbarger's passionate concession speech Tuesday night was his
all-time best _ but too late.
</P>
<P>
   He never got credit from the State House crowd for hanging in
when Joe Kennedy was riding high, nor for a stellar record as AG,
nor for a diligent and disciplined campaign style. You only get
credit you claim, not credit you deserve, in this game. Joe Kennedy
never lifted a finger for his party's candidate, not wanting to
create a Governor Harshbarger who someday might eye Teddy's seat.
Still, it was winnable.
</P>
<P>
   The raw vote totals with two of the state's 2,111 precincts
missing: Cellucci 964,501, 51 percent; Harshbarger 899,933, 47
percent; Libertarian Dean Cook, 31,790, 2 percent. Victory was won
by 64,568 votes; had Harshbarger convinced 32,285 folks to switch,
or fewer than 16 voters per precinct, the outcome is reversed. For
the want of the get-out-and-vote nail, the electoral shoe was lost.
</P>
<P>
   In the '90s there are no more political machines, ready-made
field organizations, except what can be cobbled together by
incumbent governors and Boston mayors, who directly control
thousands of political paychecks, or the unions. Apostates like Ray
Flynn, and sellout or me-first unions like the Teamsters, Carmen,
and Firefighters, broke ranks with the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing Democrats had going for them was the state
AFL-CIO under the whip hand of Bob Haynes, whose strong performance
in the losing cause makes him a coming strongman in Democratic
Party politics here. There's plenty of bigger-name ``Ds'' who can
throw a fancy party or steal a headline; Haynes delivered bodies _
and results _ statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger won Boston 3-2, but his 25,000 vote margin was
dwarfed by what Boston delivered for Senator John Kerry over Bill
Weld. If Harshbarger got the 65,000-vote cushion that Kerry had,
Cellucci loses, period. Harshbarger had been endorsed by the
Italian-American mayors of the state's three biggest cities. He
carried Springfield and Worcester (by only 748 votes). But he lost
too many small cities: Attleboro, Beverly, Brockton, Everett,
Gloucester, Haverhill, Leominster, Lowell, Medford, Melrose,
Peabody, Quincy, Revere, Westfield, Woburn. The well-off ($100,000
or more) broke 3-2 for Cellucci's no-new-tax-ever pitch. The
master's-degree-or-PhD gang went for Scott by the same margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Italo factor was huge. Italian-Americans now hold the
governor's office, as well as the state auditor post; the three
largest cities; the 8th Congressional District seat of Kennedys and
O'Neill and Curley is now sat upon by Mike Capuano. East Boston was
rife with Cellucci-Swift signs before election.
</P>
<P>
   The cheapest shot of all had to be Cellucci chief of staff
Virginia Buckingham's base accusation that Harshbarger was
``anti-Italian.'' What many Democrats regard as the devious
undermining of Harshbarger by House Speaker Tom Finneran (elected,
Democrats never forget, with Republican votes) has also left a
marker. Does Harshbarger, at 56, have another statewide race in
him? Who knows? This time, the race is to the Swift _ and the
Cellucci.

GOVERNMENT, SANDINISTA INFIGHTING THREATENS AID EFFORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAGUA _ In nearly every public statement he has made this week
to reassure the thousands of families whose lives have been forever
scarred by Hurricane Mitch, President Arnoldo Aleman has asked
Nicaraguans to act as a unified country.
</P>
<P>
   But his pleas are going largely unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   As rescue workers continued their struggle to reach isolated
areas and the official death toll from the hurricane in Nicaragua
climbed Thursday to 4,000, new political disputes have emerged,
mostly between the democratically elected center-right government
and the leftist Sandinista Front, which ruled the country during
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be confrontational, especially during a
tragedy like this,'' Silvio Mora, a top Sandinista spokesman, said
Thursday. ``But there is a feeling that the Aleman government has
been very insensitive to the people and could've done more to
prepare the country'' before the hurricane arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the bickering between the country's two dominant parties
stems from a decision by Aleman immediately after the hurricane hit
to suspend the powers of 140 mayors across the country in order to
create local emergency relief committees with representatives from
the military, relief organizations, and local residents headed by
representatives of the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the move smacks of a political power play
by the Aleman government. About a third of the mayoralties in the
country are held by Sandinistas, including many of the hardest hit
areas such as the towns of Poseltega, Leon, and Chichigalpa.
</P>
<P>
   The Sandinistas toppled the dicatorship of Anastasio Somoza in
1979 after three years of bloody civil war. For most of the
following decade, the group controlled the country while battling
American-backed counter-revolutionaries. A peace accord was signed
and the country elected a new president, the center-right candidate
Violeta Chamorro, in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Eddie Montenegro, the church's representative on the
national emergency committee, said the political fighting shows
that eight years after democracy returned to this impoverished
country, there is still a large ideological battle between left and
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep in mind that political polarization is here still,''
Montenegro said. ``The government is trying to find a way around
politicizing everything and that's why we've been asked to help.''
</P>
<P>
   But Aleman's problems this week extend beyond the Sandinistas.
</P>
<P>
   When Cuba offered to send medicine and doctors to help the
victims, the Nicaraguan president initially declined. Aleman, who
in the past has openly disagreed with Cuba's communist government,
was quoted in Managua newspapers as saying the doctors only wanted
``to come here to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, David Robleto Lang, Nicaragua's minister of foreign
cooperation who is overseeing the donations arriving from other
countries, said the country would be glad to receive any and all
aid it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not flying any political flags,'' Robleto said after
meeting with international relief organizations. ``We're working
for the good of the whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the country has received about $7.5 million in relief
aid from abroad, Robleto added.
</P>
<P>
   The Aleman government is also under pressure to prove it will
not repeat history. When an earthquake devastated Managua in 1972,
Somoza allegedly pocketed the relief aid and left several
reconstruction projects unfinished. Some relief groups are asking
the current government to provide a strict accounting of how their
money and supplies are being spent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be as clear as possible about where the
assistance goes,'' said Robleto, adding that all the money the
country is receiving is going into a central account that will be
closely monitored. ``But we weren't prepared for this kind of
disaster and we're trying to do our best.''

`HAPPINESS' FAILS MISERABLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' is a miserable movie. It's repulsive. It's
depressing. It's bent on making the viewer wretch: one body fluid
in particular gets a star-making quantity of screen time.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite all of that, and despite all the recent arm-flapping
over subject matter (pedophilia, masturbation, pedophilia), it's
the movie's predictable, aren't-we-all-perverts pessimism that
truly offends. Todd Solondz's study in suburban pathology tries
hard to shock us out of our wits _ it tries to slap us in the face
with our own depravity _ but the whole irksome exercise is more
tedious than startling. Guess what, Todd: We're bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happiness'' is the sort of film that screeches with
self-importance, a movie that wants so desperately to be regarded
as Serious Art that it savages anything resembling convention.
Unlike Solondz's last film, the marginally less bleak ``Welcome to
the Dollhouse,'' this one ditches the usual standards of plot and
character development for piecemeal glimpses of ugliness and
abnormality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have our pluses and minuses,'' says Allen (Phillip
Seymour Hoffman), himself a phone pervert, reflecting on an
acquaintance's grisly crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this truism, used with such bludgeoning irony,
is that no one in the movie has any pluses. They're all minuses.
Revolving around three grown sisters and their loveless parents,
the characters aren't flesh and blood _ they're textbook
dysfunctions with mouths. Besides Allen, we have the textbook
depressed woman (named Joy! wow!), the textbook frigid housewife,
the textbook pedophile (played with sweaty-weirdo blandness by
Dylan Baker), the textbook rapist, the textbook Sex-Crazed
Narcissistic Poet, the textbook frustrated obese woman and the
textbook philandering wife-beater.
</P>
<P>
   Like the malevolent screw-ups in Neil Labute's ``Your Friends
and Neighbors,'' the folks populating Solondz's world are uniformly
warped: There's no depth to them, nothing that connects them to
humanity or gives the rest of us any reason to care.
</P>
<P>
   The result is almost stupefyingly dull. Someone ought to tell
Solondz, who co-produced the film as well as wrote and directed it,
that even the shock of stepping in dog poop (metaphorically
speaking) can get tired after a while. And after 134 minutes of
masturbation and child-seduction, you'll feel like you're bathing
in it.
</P>
<P>
   Relief arrives occasionally. The film is supposed to be a
comedy, believe it or not, and there are brief shafts of light:
Lara Flynn Boyle, as the Sex-Crazed Narcissistic Poet, has a
nastily funny moment agonizing over the falseness of her verse
(titled, variously, ``Rape at Eleven'' and ``Rape at Twelve'').
Louise Lasser and Ben Gazarra _ who seems to be popping up in
art-house fare quite a bit these days _ are islets of dignity as
the exhausted parents. And Jane Adams, who cries virtually nonstop
as the joyless Joy, wails hilariously off-key through a song called
``Happiness'' (``Happiness, where are you? I've searched so long,
where are you?''). Moviegoers who last long enough will be cheered
by the closing version of the song, rendered with buzzy energy by
Michael Stipe.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it should be noted: Although the pedophilia is clearly
implied and much-discussed (in graphic terms), the acts themselves
aren't shown. Small comfort in a movie that features a bodily
substance as postcard glue.
</P>

ROLLBACK GAINS MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE -- Bruce Brooks chuckled. Deputy mayor of this city from
1995-97, he is now senior vice president of a communications and
public relations firm. Asked how he would conduct a campaign to
fight the rollback of affirmative action, he said, ``If I had the
great answer, I would have a consulting gold mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that seems the most important thing to deal with
is the fact that the anti-affirmative action campaign is so
successful at playing up singular ancedotes to work up people's
emotions, like `Uncle Joe got passed over by a woman or an
African-American.' We really have to find the success stories of
affirmative action, get them out front and communicate successfully
why this is good for the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor was good in saying he believed he has benefited
from affirmative action. But this is something that goes much
deeper than intellectual reasoning. It gets to feelings. If a white
person has not had the experience of being a minority, and has not
had the experience of constantly having to trust the majority to
make decisions that benefit you, like hiring and promotions, it's
hard to get that person to see the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's what we need, is to find white people who have
had a major minority experience and get their stories out there. We
have to find a way to get past these feelings based on fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Any answers Brooks might come up with are for now too late for
Washington state. White voters this week made this the second state
in the nation to kill affirmative action in state-run programs.
Initiative-200, which won by 58 percent to 42 percent, was a major
victory for Ward Connerly, the cheerleader of Proposition 209,
which ended state-sponsored affirmative action in California.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly and his right-wing supporters have been searching for
new momentum to carry their attack nationwide. They claimed to have
found the momentum in Washington. On the surface, Washington is not
overtly split along color lines. Seattle recently had an
African-American mayor and deputy mayor. The current governor, Gary
Locke, is Chinese-American.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains a state where people of color and women are far
from full equality in the general work force. Washington is 16
percent of color. The state has had contracting goals of 9.5
percent for people of color and 4.8 percent for women. But the
figures currently stand at 3 percent for people of color and 3.1
percent for women. Before affirmative action, less than 1 percent
of public contracts went to firms of color.
</P>
<P>
   A study of state contracting from 1994-96 found that people of
color still ``face subtle and sometimes blatant racism in the
public and private sectors'' from ``project managers, inspectors
and state purchasers who often have racist and sexist attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   A study released last month by researchers from Rutgers
University found intentional discrimination in hiring and promotion
in a quarter of businesses in the state of Washington. ``It is
clear that the playing field is not level,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence that good old boy networks disappear on
their own. When the Port of Tacoma substituted in 1992 voluntary
goals in place of required goals for contracting public works jobs
to women and people of color, the percentage dropped in just that
one year from 20 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The sobering thing about I-200 is that many of the state's top
politicians and business leaders understood the historical need for
affirmative action. Locke did television ads against I-200. Senator
Patty Murray opposed it as well as Seattle Times publisher Frank
Blethen, Boeing, Starbucks, Hewlett Packard, GTE, Eddie Bauer, and
Weyerhaeuser. The opposition outspent the proponents 3 to 1, and
half of the I-200 money was out of state, from Connerly's
anti-affirmative action institute.
</P>
<P>
   I-200 won by getting voters to ignore reality and becoming
hypnotized on the spectre of reverse discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told friends two weeks ago that I would not have been
surprised if support for I-200 reached into the high 50 percent
range, and I'm sorry to be proven right,'' Brooks said. ``It shows
that anytime you talk about the issue of race, it becomes hard to
separate fact from wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates can get out there and say he's against it. The
governor, who is enjoying great popularity, can get out there and
say he's against it. But they obviously could not reach the
feelings of people, who are so convinced about the rhetoric of a
colorblind society that they have blinders on about what is really
going on. ... It almost takes me back to the writing of the
Constitution where we proclaimed in the same breath that all men
are created equal and slaves are property. That dichotomy is still
with us. I-200 is evidence to me of that dichotomy of saying we're
all equal, while we know that is hardly the case.''  &QL;

BACK SEATS MOVE TO THE FORE AT AUTOMOBILE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, November 08, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of horses up front took a back seat to the back seats
at the New England International Auto Show last week. While there's
plenty of horsepower under the hoods of the 1999 models on view,
it's innovation in the back ends that has drawn the most attention
_ as in how much stuff can one cram in there?
</P>
<P>
   Saturn literally stole the show at the press preview, unveiling
its new three-door SC coupe with the back seat chock full of stuff,
then opening the two doors on the driver's side and unloading. What
came out drew the same sort of amused gasps that greet the 28
clowns who spill out of the little circus car. First came some
modest-sized soft luggage, then a full-size tuba _ and then
another, somewhat larger tuba and a duffel about the size of what
the high school basketball team uses to haul equipment to practice.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, though, when the public came pouring through
the doors on the opening Saturday, the Saturn SC1 and SC2 sat on
the Bayside turntable bereft of cargo to tickle the car buyers'
appetite for usable space _ the tubas and luggage that rammed home
the utility point so graphically are left to the imagination of the
Saturn spielers and their audience. But the rear door, modeled
after the small doors on extended cab pickup trucks, offers the
driver ease of loading otherwise difficult cargo for a small coupe.
Like the trucks, the rear door cannot be opened until the front
door has been opened and there is no ``B'' pillar to obstruct. With
fold-down rear seats for pass-through access to the trunk, the load
potential of the new Saturns is impressive. Perhaps more impressive
is the price list for these built-in-America cars _ $12,445 plus
$440 delivery for a manual-shift SC1 three-door; $15,005 for an
SC2, plus delivery. Add $860 for automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been some criticism of a back door on the street
side of the vehicle, the car drew praise from handicapped visitors
for innovative thinking _ no B pillar and that extra door make it
easier for the wheelchair user to slide the folded chair into the
car after taking a seat at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Station wagons, almost driven to extinction by federal
regulation and the rise and spread of the minivan, are making a
comeback. Saab unveiled its 9-5 Wagon, its first in two decades,
with some innovation borrowed from aircraft _ which should surprise
no one since SAAB began life as an aircraft company: Swedish
Aircraft AB, whence came the Saab name derivation. The cargo floor
of the Saab wagon employs moveable tie-downs in channels along the
sides, much like the cargo floor of an airliner. The tie-downs snap
out, are stored in an accessory pouch under the floor, and offer
secure fastening for breakable stuff and security for the front
passengers who will not be bruised by flying cargo in a sudden
stop.
</P>
<P>
   For heavy stuff, the Saab has a rollout panel that extends
beyond the bumper and, a Saab representative assured as two heavy
men sat on it, a capacity of 460 pounds. Instead of straining your
back to place heavy loads within, one may place them sans muscle
pull on the tray and slide the weight into the wagon. Saab has not
announced price but the wagon is to be available in two trim levels
_ figure price tags around $32,000 at the lower end, $37,000 at the
upper. The wagon is due out in the spring. For right now, the
Swedish maker is showing the new 9-3 five-door and the 9-3
convertible available with a new 2.0-liter 200 horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   BMW also introduced wagons, the 5 Series Sportwagons, billed as
sports car disguised as cargo carrier. It, too, has a slide-out
panel on the cargo floor for manhandling heavy loads, but the
stated capacity was less than half that of the Saab _ about 160
pounds, a BMW spokesman offered. Two versions are available, the
528i with V-6 engine and the 540i with a spirited 4.4-liter V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Wagons abound at the Bayside, ranging from the elite,
electronically enhanced Mercedes E Class all-wheel-drive model and
the sporty Audi A4 and A6 Avants, down through the workaday Ford
Taurus, Saturns, and smaller offerings. And there are what might be
called wagon types _ sport/utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep unveiled its newest Grand Cherokee at the show, a
new-from-the-ground-up SUV that, while it looks like a freshened
carryover from 1998, only carries over a handful of parts _ small
parts, at that. It is longer for more cargo room, an inch wider
with a wider track, and slightly higher. Handling and ride,
Chrysler says, have been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Most important is the new engine that Chrysler has needed; under
the hood of the new Grand Cherokee, you'll find either the proven
4.0-liter I-6 or a brand-new 4.7-liter, 235-horsepower replacement
for the venerable 5.2-liter, an engine that has been around in one
form or another since the '60s. The new engine is more fuel
efficient (20 miles per gallon in the new Jeep, Chrysler says) and
spews 30 percent cleaner exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   And while Chrysler was showing the new Jeep at the auto show,
its Jeep division was showing customers how to use it off road at
Jeep 101, an off-road driving school set up at the Topsfield
Fairgrounds Friday for a four-day session.

   The emphasis on the ability to carry stuff continued with trucks
_ not just stuff in the cargo compartment but people and things in
the passenger space. It's the year of the door. Pickups have three
and four doors; vans have a pair of sliding doors these days just
to gain entry into the main selling arena. And the competition is
fierce what with the new Honda Odyssey challenging Ford Windstar
and the van leader, Chrysler.

   There was a lot to see starting with a sand pile in the lobby
that was gradually shaped into a 1957 Chevy convertible with family
aboard, and ending, perhaps, with the new Jaguars in the back of

Volvo's new convertible _ new cars and new technology of all sorts.

CABLE NEWS HAS A FEAST ON LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge by Tuesday's election results, the American public is
ready to move on from the White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But can 24-hour news cable channels like CNN, MSNBC, and Fox
News Channel, whose strategy for much of this year appeared to be
``all Monica, all the time,'' bear to let the story go?
</P>
<P>
   After all, wallowing in Monicagate drove their ratings to a new
altitude from January through October. In fact, the audience for
some programs doubled or tripled from 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
   More tellingly, even when ratings dropped back down during a
lull in the scandal, the all-news channels retained far more
viewers than they had before. For upstarts like MSNBC and Fox News
Channel that have existed for only two years, the scandal may have
solidified their standing at a crucial moment in their evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have benefited enormously by this news coverage of the
president's scandal, even though people are sick to death of it,''
said Jack Loftus, senior vice president of Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   How to explain the apparent contradiction? Jim Naureckas, editor
of ``Extra,'' a newsletter published by the liberal media watchdog
group Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, contends that while the
ratings gains sound impressive, ``the actual number of people
watching these shows is pretty tiny.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put them all together, it's less than two million
people, which is less than 1 percent of the population,'' said
Naureckas.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, channels like Fox News and MSNBC were starting from
such small audience bases that it was relatively easy for them to
rack up increases that sound impressive in percentage terms. Part
of the audience hikes were also attributable to the simple fact
that more cable systems began offering the channels to subscribers;
Fox News Channel, for instance, has doubled its distribution in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it also appears that saturation coverage of the
scandal helped the burgeoning networks acquire vital ``niche
identities'' in an increasingly crowded television universe. They
capitalized on the tune-in factor to promote their other shows and
generally make viewers aware of their existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the Monica thing has obviously helped our ratings,'' said
Chet Collier, senior vice president at Fox News Channel. ``But
what's encouraging to us is that whenever the Lewinsky story
peaked, there was the question of the halo effect: How many stayed?
And every time we go down, it's to a higher level than we were
before the story broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone shares the enthusiasm of the cable-news executives.
To the consternation of some media ethicists, the
no-detail-is-too-small coverage of the Lewinsky scandal by the
cable networks has infiltrated other parts of the news culture,
helping drive the print media's reporting of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets chatted up on CNBC or CNN or MSNBC adds velocity to
a story,'' said Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for
Excellence in Journalism. ``The New York Times might say `We're not
going to cover a certain story,' but then if it's out there in
other news accounts, they have to deal with it. These networks add
a lot to the `out there' syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe obtained data from Nielsen Media Research and the
networks themselves showing that, across the board, all-news
networks enlarged their audiences by focusing on the Lewinsky
story. The increases ranged from respectable in the case of the
more established CNN to whopping in the case of the upstart
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings spiked dramatically during certain explosive turns
in the case _ when the story first broke, when the report by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr was released, when President
Clinton addressed the nation and finally owned up to the affair
with Lewinwsky, a former White House intern _ but even when the
ratings receded, the all-news channels were left with larger
audiences than before.
</P>
<P>
   Through Oct. 16, CNN's prime-time ratings were up 11 percent
over last year, to an average of 750,000 households this year. The
network's highest-rated show, ``Larry King Live,'' gained 300,000
households over last year, bringing the show's average audience to
1.3 million households. ``Larry's had a tremendous boost from
focusing very heavily on Lewinsky,'' said CNN spokesman Howard
Polskin.
</P>
<P>
   Other shows also benefited from Monica mania. The average
audience for CNN's ``Inside Politics,'' coanchored by Judy Woodruff
and Bernard Shaw, grew by 140,000 households, to 610,000. ``Late
Edition,'' hosted by Wolf Blitzer, CNN's senior White House
correspondent, nearly doubled its audience, to an average of
639,000 households. ``It was the most improvement of any show on
CNN,'' said Polskin. ``Wolf has been very identified with the
Lewinsky story.''
</P>
<P>
   The ratings increases for Fox News Channel sound massive, but it
has to be noted that the channel was growing from a base as low as
40,000 households. From the third quarter of 1987 to the third
quarter of 1998, Fox News ratings increased 540 percent in prime
time and 324 percent across the total day. That brought viewership
to an average of 147,000 households in prime time and 72,000
households throughout the entire day.
</P>
<P>
   Two Fox News talk shows that dwelled extensively on the Lewinsky
matter, ``The Crier Report'' and ``Hannity &AMP; Colmes,'' increased
their average audiences by 738 percent and 451 percent,
respectively. Fox News also green-lighted a self-titled talk show
for Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge shortly after he broke
the Lewinsky story; in September, the ratings for ``Drudge''
matched those of ``Larry King Weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   On CNBC, ``Hardball with Chris Matthews'' enlarged its audience
by 72 percent in January, when the Lewinsky story broke, to an
average of 369,000 households. By September, after interest in the
story had expanded ``Hardball'' from a half-hour to an hour,
Matthews's audience had grown to an average of 745,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC also saw its ratings go higher, and stay higher, as a
result of its focus on the White House sex scandal. For example, in
January, MSNBC's average audience tripled, to 115,000 households;
by September, after nine months of Monica-mania, MSNBC's average
audience had grown to 207,000 households.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at MSNBC is apparently happy with the emphasis on
Lewinsky. USA Today reported last week that Keith Olbermann, host
of ``The Big Show,'' wants to leave the network because MSNBC
executives have ordered him to focus on the scandal (Olbermann's
show has also seen its ratings skyrocket).
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the cable channels insist that the Lewinsky story
has not just been about sex. ``It's a social story, a political
story, a story about power, a legal story,'' contended CNN's
Polskin. ``That's what makes it fascinating.'' Agreed Collier, of
Fox News Channel: ``It goes far beyond sex. It goes to the heart of
the presidency. There are so many implications.'' A spokesman for
MSNBC did not return a call from the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   However, FAIR's Naureckas contends that ``the decision to
virtually go all-Lewinsky all the time is obviously a marketing
decision, not a news decision. It's not a decision that this is the
only story that matters; it's a decision that if we show only this
story, we'll draw viewers. It's no different from a cable station
that shows only pro wrestling all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenstiel said that while ratings may be up, the relentless
coverage of Monicagate may eventually harm the two segments of the
population that have seemed most interested in it: the news media
and congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people turn on their TV and they see the only news is
all-Monica, it fuels the antagonism that people feel toward the
media,'' he said. ``And it has created a kind of Monica fatigue
that will make it harder for the Republicans to proceed with
impeachment.''

15 YEARS LATER, `BIG CHILL' COOLER THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When ``The Big Chill'' was first released in 1983, I was among
those who dismissed it as no more than a Hollywood-ized ripoff of
John Sayles' ``Return of the Secaucus Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   But a return visit to Lawrence Kasdan's film, reissued this week
on video, dispelled that notion. ``The Big Chill'' stands on its
own as a seriocomic lament for idealism lost, or at least
misplaced. This is a counterculture movie with its own heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is more than a mere '60s nostalgia bath. An
awareness of mortality hovers around ``The Big Chill'' from the
moment a friend's suicide brings together seven former college
classmates for a weekend of friendship-testing reflection and
recrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The movie seems like a throwback in other ways. How many films
nowadays trust us to simply watch people sit around a living room
or kitchen and talk? But the script by Kasdan and Barbara Benedek
flows with a kind of confessional banter that pierces as it amuses.
Along the way, ``The Big Chill'' captures a generation on the edge
of a rueful self-knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought we'd both make so much bread?'' remarks
Sam, a TV star played by Tom Berenger, to Harold, a running-shoe
entrepreneur played by Kevin Kline. ``Two revolutionaries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Harold replies drily. ``Good thing it's not important
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Chill'' is studded with memorable one-liners and
indelible scenes. Its young stars were at or near the beginning of
their careers: Kline, Close, Berenger, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum,
Jobeth Williams, Meg Tilly. (Kevin Costner was also cast in the
film as the deceased Alex, but his scenes were cut. Amusingly
enough, Columbia Pictures reportedly wanted to restore Costner's
scenes to the reissued video, but Kasdan refused).
</P>
<P>
   The actors shine individually (a special treat is the underrated
Mary Kay Place as a public defender turned corporate attorney), but
it is their naturalness as an ensemble that makes the friendships
seem real. It lends a poignant force to Glenn Close's Sarah when
she gives voice to the prevailing sentiment: ``I felt I was at my
best when I was with you people.''
</P>
<P>
   And ah, the music! Between the snappy dialogue and the
Motown-flavored soundtrack _ ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg,'' ``Natural
Woman,'' ``In the Midnight Hour,'' ``Tracks of My Tears,'' ``I
Heard It Through the Grapevine'' _ this is one of those rare films
that can even be enjoyed with your eyes closed. With apologies to
Mr. Sayles, my own eyes have been opened regarding ``The Big
Chill.''

SAFETY AN ILLUSION IN DUNSKY'S `ALARMIST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE ALARMIST 
Written and directed by: Evan Dunsky (based on Keith Reddin's
play) 
Starring: David Arquette, Stanley Tucci, Kate Capshaw, Mary
McCormick, Ryan Reynolds, Tricia Vessey 
Running time: 92 minutes 
Rated: R  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Keith Reddin's plays, the times are always out of joint. So,
usually, are the plays. As Reddin sees it, the universe is
malevolent and chaotic and we are sitting ducks for whatever
horrors it throws at us. In Reddin's writing, the message is always
the same. Forget control. ``The Alarmist,'' Reddin's play adapted
to the screen by Evan Dunsky as often suggests nightmare as
narrative, starting with the title. In the film, eager-beaver
door-to-door Salesman David Arquette sells burglar alarms, playing
on people's fears. To keep the sales going, he joins his
unscrupulous boss in driving around at night to trigger the alarms.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the guy provides alarms _ and alarm _ in a world where
safety is a sometimes life-threatening illusion. Then life throws
some alarming stuff back at him. It's interestingly edgy when he
launches an affair with a customer, Kate Capshaw's Gale, who's
quietly raising a hulking teenage son. Arquette's Tommy, who
suggests a nerd on uppers, is the least hip inhabitant of his
little universe. Capshaw brings intriguing faceting to a character
she plays mostly realistically, but also a little mysteriously. And
newcomer Ryan Reynolds, who scares Arquette's go-getter in ways he
can't quite articulate, turns out to be the most surprising
character in the film.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``The Alarmist'' is too arbitrary, with more shifts
in tone and plot than it can comfortably accommodate. But along the
way, the ever-dissolving universe in which Arquette's beginner is
trying to find a toehold with little more than a nervous smile adds
a piquant unpredictability to the usual prefab lineup of copycat
films. Ultimately, the film's sometimes seismic shifts are
reflected and played out in the kaleidoscopic relationship between
Arquette's Tommy and Stanley Tucci, as his shamelessly venal boss,
Heinrich.
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive, wheedling, sneaky, flattering and tenacious by
turns, Tucci's petty hustler is mostly entertaining. Only when
Tucci makes his usual mistake of occasionally allowing us to feel
we're watching an actor making choices rather than a character is
there any dropoff in the comic outrage that he so tirelessly
dispenses. ``The Alarmist'' is flawed, but it's at least more
ambitious than most films and more willing to combine irony and
pessimism than almost any. Although it's too disjointed to satisfy,
it doesn't send you away empty-handed, either.

SIMPLISTIC `SIEGE' IGNORES ROOT PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE SIEGE 
Directed by: Edward Zwick 
Screenplay by: Lawrence Wright, Menno Meyjes, Zwick 
Starring: Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis, Tony
Shalhoub, Sami Bouajila, Ahmed Ben Larby, Mosleh Mohamed 
Running time: 109 minutes 
Rated: R (violence, language and brief nudity) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' arrives in a stir of controversy, fueled by loaded
images of Arab-Americans rounded up at gunpoint. We see them herded
out of their homes and neighborhoods into camps under martial law
as US Army tanks, helicopters, and troops descend upon Brooklyn
following bombings by Palestinian terrorists. Our only hope of
stopping the terror and preserving our civil liberties is Denzel
Washington's straight-arrow FBI agent. Washington holds the screen,
but this is more a tribute to him than to ``The Siege.'' It just
isn't a very good movie.
</P>
<P>
   It undercuts its martial law images by disconnecting them from
the very thing that would have made them shocking, namely
sanctioning them as state policy. Instead, the film
deinstitutionalizes the terror and presents it as the product of
loose cannons on both sides _ a rogue general on the one hand and a
fanatic splinter group on the other. Wipe out the small band of
terrorists, it says, and that will end the problem. Although ``The
Siege'' is more than a screenful of Arab-bashing, it isn't much
more. It depoliticizes and ignores the root causes of the ongoing
friction, simplistically channeling them into the kind of
simplistic one-on-one square-off into which movies like to distill
complexities.
</P>
<P>
   While the film feeds upon the actual World Trade Center bombing
and the terrorist cell neutralized by the FBI in Brooklyn, it boils
down to a pretty ordinary and often tedious action thriller pitting
Washington against terrorist plotters and Bruce Willis's gung-ho
general who justifies what he does in the name of patriotism. Just
where shadowy CIA op Annette Bening, with her links to the
Arab-speaking world, fits in is left deliberately unclear. The film
also casts Tony Shalhoub as Washington's deputy, a
Lebanese-American who is the film's most rounded character because
he's the only one we see living a life.
</P>
<P>
   Shalhoub's Frank Haddad has the film's best scene, finding his
loyalties tested after he learns that his own family has been
arrested and interned, despite his alacrity at identifying himself
as an FBI agent. It's one of the few times the film acknowledges a
racist component. Although there are shootouts, most of the combat
stems from rivalries among law-enforcement agencies. The film
largely wastes Washington, who nevertheless is able to summon
impressive quantities of outraged decency.
</P>
<P>
   He's the one who makes the point that if we subvert the
Constitution to combat the terrorists, the terrorists have won. The
extent to which it takes us into the Palestinians' heads is limited
to a remark by Bening's too-opaque character about how they use
their suffering to seduce the sympathetic. ``The Siege'' hardly
demonizes all Arabic-speakers, as, say, ``True Lies'' did. But it
doesn't illuminate their lives or minds, either, offering less
characterization than a good TV cop show.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``The Siege'' acknowledges the difficulty of stopping
terrorists who learn about explosives from the Internet and are
slippery because they fight under no country's flag, it mostly goes
through the motions of being high-minded while dishing out the same
cliffhanging genre thrills, which it executes more dutifully than
grippingly. The military set pieces look too choreographed to grab
us with anything like the intended visceral nightmarishness. When
we see the troops marching into Brooklyn, we mostly wonder how long
they were permitted to use the Brooklyn Bridge. Instead of
extrapolating involvingly from the potential of this hot-button
topic, the film only puts its own credibility under siege.

BC, O'BRIEN AT CROSSROADS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's known as a gut check, a point in a game or a season when a
football team's character and heart are measured.
</P>
<P>
   Eight games into his second season at Boston College, coach Tom
O'Brien is facing his first gut check Saturday afternoon against
Notre Dame at Alumni Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's team is not playing well, having lost its last five
games after causing a glimmer of optimism at the Heights with three
season-opening victories.
</P>
<P>
   Now we know that that optimism was misguided. Injuries and
inexperience are a bad combination that even for the best of teams
leads to the worst of times.
</P>
<P>
   Those times have arrived at BC. We can understand the Eagles,
with a plethora of untested defensive players, getting blown out by
more talented and experienced teams such as Syracuse and Miami. We
can also look past a field goal that goes wide, turning victory
into defeat against Navy. And we can appreciate the slim chances _
despite a valiant effort _ the Eagles had of beating Virginia Tech
last month.
</P>
<P>
   But what we can't understand, or accept, is the analysis offered
by the Eagles after the losses to Syracuse and Miami, saying they
came out of the locker room ``flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Call a team bad or inexperienced. Those are limitations that can
be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But flat? That is disgraceful, and the blame lies directly at
the feet of O'Brien, whose team has been outscored in the first
half, 90-38, during the losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   One of the joys of college football is the emotion that can
allow a Temple to beat a Virginia Tech _ one of the most stunning
upsets in recent years. Or that lets Texas go to Lincoln, Neb., and
provide the visiting team with a victory for the first time in
nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of the locker room in a frenzy of crashing shoulder
pads and helmets is the essence of college football. And so are the
miracles such as Doug Flutie's pass in Miami in the Orange Bowl 14
years ago to beat the defending national champion.
</P>
<P>
   For all its big-time, businesslike atmosphere, the game is still
about competition for young men who should not be jaded by what
happens outside the lines.
</P>
<P>
   And for BC, which was a clear underdog to both Syracuse and
Miami, coming out flat doesn't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   If this happened once, it might be somewhat understandable.
Teams cannot be up for every game, a rationale that could be used
to explain the losses to Navy and Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   But the Eagles came out flat a few times last year and twice
this season, which is disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien has conducted himself with class in his brief stint at
BC. And since he has nearly a full load of commitments for next
year, optimists would say good times are coming for BC football.
</P>
<P>
   But there also are some alarms going off. If you can't get your
team up for opponents like Miami, Notre Dame, or Syracuse, you are
doing something wrong. You're not connecting with your players.
</P>
<P>
   The odds say Boston College will lose Saturday against Notre
Dame. But the Eagles have more than a decent chance to beat the
Irish.
</P>
<P>
   What the sellout crowd _ as well as O'Brien and his staff _
deserves is a complete effort. None of this ``We were flat''
nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   And the responsibility for preventing that rests with O'Brien in
what is probably the most important game of his head coaching
career to date.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Unselfish act
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In an age when selfish athletes are becoming more prevalent, we
offer you Massachusetts Maritime wide receiver  &UR; Mike Kelley &LR; .
Because of injuries and ineffective play, coach  &UR; Don Ruggeri  &LR; went
four deep on his depth chart searching for a quarterback in last
week's loss to Nichols. This week Kelley, a 5-foot-9-inch,
160-pound senior with two games remaining in his collegiate career
who is 80 yards short of breaking the school mark for receiving,
went into Ruggeri's office and said, ``Coach, I'll give it a shot
at quarterback (against Framingham State).''
</P>
<P>
   To add to the drama, Kelley's father,  &UR; Tom &LR; , &UR;  &LR; is the athletic
director at Framingham State and had counted on watching his son go
for the record Saturday against his team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Mixed signals
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska quarterback  &UR; Bobby Newcombe  &LR; left school this week to
seek a second medical opinion on his injured left knee. Depending
on whose opinion you believe, Newcombe needs either minor
arthroscopic or major reconstructive surgery to correct the
problem. In either case, it's unlikely Newcombe will be available
for the Huskers' grudge match against Kansas State next week ...
Auburn athletic director  &UR; David Housel  &LR; is beginning a search for
 &UR; Terry Bowden's  &LR; replacement and said lobbying efforts for the
coaching job will go unheeded. ``A word to the wise,'' said Housel.
``Lobbying efforts will be counterproductive. The cream rises to
the top on its own, not with lobbying efforts.'' Interim coach
 &UR; Bill Oliver  &LR; is seeking to establish a power base. With Housel's
blessing, Oliver fired offensive coordinator  &UR; Rodney Allison  &LR; this
week. ``If (the job) was offered to me, I'd take it,'' said Oliver
... The Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference suspended four officials
for the rest of the season after the crew blew what turned out to
be the winning play in William &AMP; Mary's 41-34 victory over Hampton
last Saturday. With the game tied, 34-34, and slightly more than
three minutes reamining, William &AMP; Mary wide receiver  &UR; Chris Rosier
 &LR; caught a pass and was tackled near midfield. Or so Hampton
thought. None of the officials blew a whistle, and Rosier got up
and ran into the end zone, giving Hampton its first loss of the
season. MEAC officials reviewed tapes, decided an error had been
made, and suspended the officials ... One of the keys to the
reemergence of Florida State as a national championship contender
has been the improvement of 26-year-old sophomore quarterback
 &UR; Chris Weinke &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who threw six interceptions in the Seminoles' loss
to North Carolina State Sept. 12. Weinke hasn't thrown an
interception since, and FSU hasn't lost. ``After the North Carolina
State game, I remembered that I asked myself, `Do I have a
quarterback or not?''' said coach  &UR; Bobby Bowden. &LR;  ``(Weinke has)
erased all of that.''.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rankled by rankings
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series rankings have confused some,
rankled others. Count Kansas State coach  &UR; Billy Snyder  &LR; among the
rankled. When told that one of the tools used to determine the
Fiesta Bowl participants for the national championship game Jan. 4
was a computerized system by the Seattle Times, Snyder said, ``The
Seattle Times? Give me a break. Why the Seattle Times as opposed to
the Manhattan (Kan.) Mercury? What makes the Seattle Times capable
of selecting the opponents for a national championship game?'' Just
in case you were wondering, the BCS rankings have had Kansas State
fourth the first two weeks ... Ohio State is No. 1 this week in the
Associated Press poll, which marks the 72d time the Buckeyes have
been on top in the weekly rankings. Only Notre Dame has been ranked
No. 1 more times ... With a win Saturday against
Alabama-Birmingham, Tennessee would be 8-0, its best start since
1956 ... Kansas State is first in the country in scoring offense
and first in scoring defense ... Baylor is finishing a rough
stretch _ losses to Texas A&AMP;M, Texas, and Notre Dame. Next up:
Kansas State.

CML GOES OFF TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  CML Group Inc. &UR;  &LR; is seeking bankruptcy protection for its
NordicTrack subsidiary whose ski-machines once propelled CML to
giddy heights.
</P>
<P>
   Because no buyer could be found for the subsidiary, CML said it
would sell off NordicTrack's assets. In another development,
NordicTrack president William E. Shephard had resigned from CML's
board.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, CML, of Acton, Mass., said Thursday it had reached
an agreement with lenders to secure financing for its Smith &AMP;
Hawken division, which sells gardening supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the NordicTrack situation resolved, our goal is to ...
position Smith &AMP; Hawken for growth,'' said CML chairman and chief
executive John Pound in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The news that CML had become a casualty of fast-moving trends in
the home-fitness equipment business was hardly a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   CML has not reported a profitable fiscal year since 1994, and
1998 has been marked by massive layoffs, declining sales, and the
departure of founder Charles M. Leighton.
</P>
<P>
   What went wrong? Part of the problem may have been that CML was
making the wrong kind of fitness gear at the wrong time, and that
anyone who wants a ski machine already owns one.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Sporting Goods Association, vice president Tom
Doyle noted that the equipment category that includes NordicTrack
seems to have reached ``a saturation point.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when retail sales for all types of home-exercise
equipment dropped slightly to $2.95 billion, unit sales for
NordicTrack's category fell by 40 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like golf clubs, something you have to replace every
five years,'' Doyle said. ``You buy a home cross-country ski
machine only once in a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Something else may have hurt CML. In recent years, a market for
secondhand exercise equipment has emerged, taking some business
away from companies such as NordicTrack, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to change, the fitness business can be as fickle
as the fashion industry. For every fad diet, there's a new piece of
home-exercise equipment, and what's in vogue today can soon be as
passe as the hem length of last year's dress.
</P>
<P>
   Glider-riders, a type of stationary bike, were big for a time,
and abdominal toning devices were the rage of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The whimsical tastes of fitness buffs may partly explain the
rise and fall of the NordicTrack, a bulky contraption designed to
replicate the movement of cross-country skiing.
</P>
<P>
   In its heyday, with its popularity fanned by infomercial
advertising, the NordicTrack was the centerpiece of many a
makeshift home gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its gliding movement, the NordicTrack was reputed to
put less stress and strain on an amateur athlete's knees than
jogging or some other high-impact activity.
</P>
<P>
   And because the NordicTrack's ski-style motion required a user
to move arms and legs simultaneously, marketing pitches claimed
that a NordicTrack workout was a more efficient way to lose weight
than many other activities.
</P>
<P>
   While that claim may have wowed the health club crowd and moved
a lot of metal for NordicTrack, it was challenged by the Federal
Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   After some back-and-forth, CML agreed in 1996 to refrain from
``misrepresenting weight loss results'' in future advertising.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, though, many enthusiasts were on to the next
exercise fad, stair-stepping their way to fitness in some cases.
</P>
<P>
   CML tried to market new products and keep up with consumers, but
it may have been distracted by its secondary businesses.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the early 1990s, CML was about more than just ski
machines and gardening tools. At the same time it was trying to
rapidly expand its NordicTrack business, it also operated a retail
clothing chain and a string of nature stores that sold
environmentally correct products.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps such an odd mix of businesses made it a tough challenge
for CML to maintain its focus. But whatever the reason, CML failed
to fend off its rivals and come up with new exercise products that
sold as well as the NordicTrack ski machine in its glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the NordicTrack ski &UR;  &LR; machine so abruptly hit a
saturation point? Part of the answer may have to do with the sheer
size of the thing; only a homeowner with wide-open indoor spaces
could accommodate one.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did it travel well. In foreign markets, where even the
wealthiest of consumers can live in close quarters, the bulky
NordicTrack was about as practical as a Zamboni machine in tropical
climes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a more compact generation of home-exercise equipment
was introducing itself to the home gym. Not only did this equipment
offer novelty, but when not in use, some items could be folded up
and stored under a bed or in a closet.
</P>
<P>
   It was about this time that CML began its slide. In 1993, when
CML was honored as the Globe's Massachusetts company of the year,
it earned $47.4 million on sales of $582 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, CML shares traded near 32 at one
point during 1993; earlier this week, shares could be had for
pocket change. In its most recent fiscal year, CML lost $127.4
million on sales of $274.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, CML has striven mightily to rebound. In
an attempt to focus on its exercise and gardening businesses, it
sold its Britches of Georgetowne apparel chain and its Nature
Company chain in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, though, it may have been too late. Early this
year, founder Leighton was replaced by Pound, a corporate
consultant and a former Harvard professor, and an investment bank
was hired to try to sell the NordicTrack division.
</P>
<P>
   That plan didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the past nine months, we have explored a wide range of
alternatives for NordicTrack,'' Pound said in his statement,
adding: ``There was no meaningful acquisition interest that we
could uncover in NordicTrack in its present configuration and given
its troubled results. This fall, NordicTrack's results began to
deteriorate very rapidly and unexpectedly.''
</P>
<P>
   In its release, CML said its lenders have agreed to give the
company ``a forbearance period'' through Jan. 31. In addition, CML
said it has engaged BancBoston Robertson Stephens Inc. to help
pursue opportunities for raising equity capital.
</P>
<P>
   While CML has its headquarters in Acton, most of its operations
are in Minnesota and California. As a result, Thursday's
announcement is likely to have little additional impact on a
Massachusetts economy over which CML once loomed large.

JACKSON AT EASE RUNNING NOTRE DAME'S ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask Jarious Jackson to name the most stimulating class he has
taken at Notre Dame and he will respond, ``Conflict and
Resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   How apropos for the quarterback who waited so long for a chance
to prove himself.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict?
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, whose college career consisted of 15 appearances, no
starts, spent most of the past four years wondering if his time as
a starter would ever come.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict?
</P>
<P>
   From the time he arrived in South Bend from Tupelo, Miss., he
was quite sure he had made the right choice. He could have gone to
Tennessee, where a phenom named Peyton Manning was about to start
his run at quarterback. He chose Notre Dame, where Ron Powlus had
already been ordained an Irish great, as exemplified by a
television commentator's remark that he would win not one but two
Heisman Trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Powlus, of course, did not win one Heisman, and his career was
considered a colossal disappointment, but his choice to come back
for a fifth season last year only added to the conflict for the
6-foot, 220-pound Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   It meant one more year as a backup, one more year of waiting for
an opportunity, which came only sporadically as Powlus ended his
Irish career with more of a whimper than a bang.
</P>
<P>
   So for Jackson, now halfway through his first and final season
as the starting quarterback, saturday's game at Boston College will
be a pleasant reminder of one of his few previous highlights.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, BC came to South Bend, and Jackson had his
coming-out party. In a 52-20 rout of the Eagles, he ran for two
touchdowns. The game was over by the second quarter as the Irish
built a 28-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Notre Dame was a 3-5 team struggling for some
respect and self-confidence, which BC provided on cue.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the Eagles who are 3-5 and looking for something
positive in a season which seems to have headed south. The Irish _
under the direction of Jackson _ are riding the crest of a
five-game winning streak that has them ranked 13th nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson has not been dazzling, but he hasn't been dull, either.
He has done his job, and aside from a UFO-type game in which the
Irish were humiliated by Michigan State, he has handled his most
important task _ helping his team win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in there contributing,'' he said by phone from South Bend.
``When I need to throw it, I throw it. When I need to run, I run.
It really doesn't matter as long as we're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson concedes it felt strange to take the field without
Powlus lurking. ``At first, I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``But
then it felt normal. I finally felt like it was my job, my
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on whom you talk to, Jackson is either a quarterback
who runs the option or an option quarterback who throws when he
must. That, too, doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can judge whatever they want to judge,'' he said.
``We're winning games. If I am doing anything better, I think it's
in throwing the football.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the first seven games, blemished only by that
45-23 loss to the Spartans in September, Jackson still can't
understand what happened. ``It seemed like they had 30 points in
about 30 seconds,'' he said. ``It was a freaky night of football.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, coach Bob Davie has seen Jackson develop along with
his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's handled the situation very well,'' said Davie. ``He's a
natural leader, and I think each week he gains more confidence. You
have to remember, this is only his eighth game as a starter. So
each week is a new situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is still a work in progress. Take last week's 27-3 win
over Baylor. He completed five of nine passes and threw two
touchdowns, as well as rushing for 66 yards on six carries. But he
also made a mistake on a play sent in from the bench, calling for a
halfback option pass by Autry Denson which was intercepted and
returned to the ND 9.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson conceded he made a mistake, shrugged it off, and moved
on, picking up a little bit more experience in his quest to resolve
the conflicts of his career at ND.

MCGINEST'S BEEF: HE WANTS TO PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ You've seen Willie McGinest a lot on TV
lately, but it hasn't been on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   He's selling a lot of quarter-pounders but not sacking a lot of
quarterbacks. That's because for the last two weeks, McGinest, who
leads the Patriots with 3 1/2 sacks, has been sidelined with a
strained left groin.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest's absence has coincided with a less than ferocious pass
rush that produced no sacks in last week's 21-16 win over the
Indianapolis Colts after getting three in a 12-9 overtime loss to
the Miami Dolphins the week before.
</P>
<P>
   While McGinest has hardly gone sack-crazy this season, his
presence creates opportunities for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of injuries, and Willie not being in there has
made it hard to create the kind of pressure we had earlier in the
season,'' said defensive line coach Ray Hamilton. ``We had a nice
rotation going there with eight guys, but we've had some injuries
to Brandon (Mitchell), Willie, Hank (Thomas), and Chad (Eaton), and
hopefully, now we can get Chad back and Willie back and get after
them again.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest is making strides toward returning Sunday against the
Falcons. He practiced Wednesday, but coach Pete Carroll said
McGinest ``barely got by'' and added that his star ``elephant'' man
couldn't play if his mobility didn't improve.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest practiced Thursday and was hoping to pick up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was puttering around on Wednesday,'' he said. ``Today will
tell whether I can make it back, but it's likely that I will
play.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, 6 feet 5 inches, 255 pounds of speed and agility, has
had problems staying healthy the past two years. He missed four of
the first five games last season with hamstring, groin, and knee
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get completely healthy and realize his potential until
late in the year and in the playoffs, finishing with two
regular-season sacks and 2 1/2 in two playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   With pass rushers at a premium during the offseason, the
Patriots broke the bank for their No. 1 draft pick of 1994. When
McGinest, 27, became an unrestricted free agent, the Patriots gave
him a five-year, $25 million contract with an $8 million signing
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the contract adds pressure,'' said McGinest. ``I'm not
going to sit here and say it doesn't. A few years ago, I had 11 1/2
sacks (1995). Two years ago, I had 9 1/2 sacks. Last year I had two
or three. That's a down year for me. That's terrible. I get paid to
make plays. That's what I have to do. The contract is a reward for
what I've done and for what I should be doing now and in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time I'm on the field, I have to perform _ there are no
ifs, ands, or buts about it. It can't be, `Well, he's doing all
right,' or anything like that. It has to be that I'm doing
something big _ something important to help our team win. If I
don't have a good game or if I've played not to the caliber that I
expect of myself, I'm down on myself. I'm my biggest critic.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's not producing, McGinest has plenty of critics. His
contract makes him a target.
</P>
<P>
   The coaching staff knows McGinest's ultimate job is to sack the
quarterback, but that's not always going to happen. Pressing the
quarterback, forcing bad throws, bringing heat from the outside so
someone like Chris Slade can make a play are important, too. And
McGinest fares well in all those areas.
</P>
<P>
   There are double-team situations on which he is taken out of the
play completely. And there are times when he's up against a bigger
offensive lineman and isn't going to provide the pressure needed.
</P>
<P>
   But when he's being Willie McGinest, everyone on the defense
seems to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest says it's been difficult to watch the team from the
sideline the past two weeks. He's made both trips rather than stay
behind for treatment because Carroll likes to bring along the
impact players and leaders even if they're injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made it a little harder on ourselves,'' said McGinest.
``We have to step up and play better as a team. We have to finish
off teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the second half _ there's no excuses. We have to get it
done. I have to get it done.''

THERE'S NO AVOIDING DIVORCE AT THIS POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have spent too long talking about Mo Vaughn's contract. We
should stop. Contract tales are dreadful. People don't tell the
truth when contracts are discussed. I'd rather listen to Vanilla
Ice's Greatest Hits. I'd rather talk nonviolence with Jerry
Springer's guests. Contracts? Nope. Travel? Well, now we can have a
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mo Vaughn story is now an official travel mystery. It is
obvious that the free agent first baseman is leaving Boston. But
where is he going? His next press conference could be in Los
Angeles, Anaheim, Baltimore, or the Bronx. But wherever it is,
Vaughn won't be able to take the Green Line to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has known that for a long time. Dan Duquette and John
Harrington have known it, too. But in the past couple of weeks,
both camps have been like a married couple afraid to say the words
that would finalize the collapse of a tattered relationship. He
knew it was over but wanted them to say it. They knew it was over
but wanted him to say it. So nobody said anything until 12:01 this
morning. That's when the inevitable was silently said for both
parties, because it's also when the Red Sox lost their right to
negotiate with Vaughn exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   That's funny, isn't it? President Clinton has his own definition
of ``intimacy,'' and the Red Sox have now redefined ``exclusive''
and ``top priority.'' When you say signing someone is your top
priority and you have exclusive negotiating rights, what you are
saying is that you will get a deal done. And you will get a deal
done before anyone else gets a chance to dwarf your offer.
</P>
<P>
   What you don't do is go to Orlando, Fla., meet with a man you've
known for years, then say it was ``exploratory.'' Exploring? You
don't have time to explore when you're on deadline. All the
exploring could have started in late July, when it was apparent
that Vaughn was either going to stay or leave the Sox with nothing
but draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   So forget the chatter about a five-year deal. And forget Vaughn
saying he will take slightly less money to stay in Boston if he
gets five years. He shouldn't have said that. Now he has put
himself in position to lose the public relations war if the Sox
say, ``We offered him five years at $11 million per and he said it
wasn't enough ...'' Five years, 10 years, 20 years. Irrelevant. It
won't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   Darn. I've already started to break my promise. No contract
talk. Nope. We should be talking travel tips. We should be talking
B.B. King and how it is time to crank up the bluesman's classic,
``The Thrill Is Gone.'' I think the thrill will be in Dodger
Stadium in 1999 (is there any chance the new LA owners would dare
give Vaughn Jackie Robinson's No. 42?). It's going to be wild. You
will see Mo hanging out with Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal. You
will see Kevin Kennedy flying to LA to talk baseball with Mo and
Tommy Lasorda. Some Dodger marketer will suggest the ``Mo and Chan
Ho Show'' for Vaughn and new teammate Chan Ho Park.
</P>
<P>
   And we all know that Vaughn's weight has been questioned by the
Sox after his consumption of Foxy Lady eggs, hot dogs, and bacon in
Providence. Vaughn's temptation will be even greater in LA. He will
be dealing with high cuisine. On one side of town, there is a
restaurant called Aunt Kizzy's Backporch Kitchen. Collard greens,
mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, fish, peach cobbler. All
exceptional. It's a place where everyone sings you a birthday song,
pictures of athletes and entertainers line the walls, and the
owners aren't afraid to drop a complimentary meal or two on the
newest celebrities in the area.
</P>
<P>
   That's tempting enough. But then there is an incredible Mexican
restaurant a few blocks away from Koreatown. Be careful, Mo. You'll
have vaults of money to spend in a new city where every other
person looks like/pretends to be a movie star and where friends are
made and lost quickly.
</P>
<P>
   I will bet Dodger general manager Kevin Malone wasn't the only
executive calling Vaughn's agent, Tom Reich, early this morning. Or
put it this way: I'd like to see a copy of George Steinbrenner's
recent phone bills. It's also fair to ask where the Disney-backed
Angels were late last night and early this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Since we're not talking about contracts, it probably would not
be appropriate to note how other teams who don't know Vaughn can
come to him eager to recite numbers while the team that has known
him the longest has not.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everyone understands that sometimes it's simply time
to start over. That's fine. But the Sox had better have some travel
plans of their own; they had better be flying in a group of free
agents themselves. If they had signed Vaughn, they still would have
been short another hitter and starter. Without Vaughn, they now
need two above-average hitters and a starter. Randy Johnson and
Pedro Martinez would look lovely at the top of the rotation. But
Nomar Garciaparra clumped in a lineup of Braggs and O'Learys will
not work. There is one man whom I could see making the Sox just as
competitive as Vaughn made them _ Bernie Williams. The only problem
is that the Sox aren't the only ones who want him. Hey, Dan and
John. Hope you guys have been in touch with Garber Travel.
</P>
<P>
   I have a feeling Vaughn has already done his traveling. I am
convinced he already has a deal with another team. The Sox are
assuming that he will have the courtesy to tell them of any offers
he has received. Are they serious? When has this relationship ever
been courteous?
</P>
<P>
   It is over. You have almost seen the last of Mo Vaughn. You
should not worry if you didn't see his last game at Fenway Park.
You have one more chance to see No. 42. Go to Logan Airport and you
might be able to see him off.

BRANDYWINE FUND STILL HAS LONG-TERM APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 08, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What do you think about the Brandywine Fund? I invested in it
four years ago, and it did well up until a year ago. The fund was
highly recommended, but now I wonder if I should sell my shares and
invest instead in Vanguard Index 500. I am 20 years away from
retirement. What would you do with Brandywine -- buy, sell, or
hold?
</P>
<P>
   J.D., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the question is simply whether to switch from Brandywine
fund to Vanguard's Index 500, I'd be tempted to stick with what
you've got. As you noted, until 1997 the fund had a spectacular
record. It then stumbled to a12.02 percent total return in 1997,
and has a year- to-date loss of 14.9 percent as this is written.
According to Morningstar Mutual Funds, which had downgraded
Brandywine's overall rating from average to below average, the
troubles stem from attempts time the market, building a huge cash
position during the first quarter, and thus missing that quarter's
rally, and then getting fully invested again just in time to get
hammered in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also important to remember that the fund manager,
Foster S. Friess, has been at the helm since 1985, and thus was the
person responsible for its splendid longer-term record, which still
shows average annual gains of 16.30 percent over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the tough results have brought a sharp drop in assets
under management. The fund entered the year with $8.41 billion in
assets, and it held $4.78 billion as of the Oct. 29 report from
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. When it comes to managing a fund in
the small and mid-cap arenas, smaller is not only easier, but from
the shareholder's point of view, it probably should be better.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you are going to consider a switch, why not consider
a somewhat tamer fund in the same category? The T. Rowe Price
Mid-Cap Growth carries a lower risk score in the Morningstar
tallies and is rated above average. This fund gained 18.33 percent
in 1997, and has a year-to-date total return of 6.7 percent as this
is written.
</P>
<P>
   I make this suggestion because it seems to me that for the next
five to eight years the prospects seem much brighter for the
mid-cap and small-cap sectors than for the large-cap stocks, which
dominate the Index 500 portfolio; not only have the large caps had
a spectacular run for the past few years, taking them to a level of
substantial overvaluation, but the small- and mid-caps have lagged
behind to a great extent -- thus leaving them with a lot of
potential for pulling even.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 30 and my husband is 39; we will have been married for
one year this coming May. We are not at all sure in which direction
to go, or how much to save for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time we need to save for a house, children, and so
forth. At present, we only make $30,000 a year combined, but next
year I will graduate from nursing school and then should begin to
make about $30,000 a year. My husband is in the second year of a
four- year program to get his journeyman's electrical license.
</P>
<P>
   I figure if we live on my salary and bank all of his -- about
$12,000 a year after all deductions -- we will be able to afford to
buy a $200,000 house four years from now, with a substantial down
payment of $48,000. We will be able to save a lot after I graduate,
because both our cars will be paid off. We have no other debt, and
our rent is low since our in-laws own the building. We would like
to be comfortable in retirement and not have to pinch pennies as we
do now. Presently we have $8,000 in an IRA, $10,000 in CDs, and
last year we began to contribute to a 401(k) plan available to my
husband, contributing $25 per week, which is the most we can
afford. Based on my projected earnings of $30,000, beginning next
year, how much do you suggest we should put away, and where should
we put it?
</P>
<P>
   C.B., Dracut, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you may be putting a little undue pressure on
yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's tough to keep things together while your salaries are
low and you're working so hard to save for your first home. But
with your graduation from nursing school next year, followed by
your husband completing his training a year later, you can
anticipate a substantial increase in your earnings at that point,
and a great deal more financial comfort as well.
</P>
<P>
   My first instinct is to suggest that the very ambitious savings
program for your first home is enough for the moment; even when
your incomes have increased, you'll discover you can't do it all at
once. If it's possible, it would be nice to maintain some token
contributions towards your IRA program, just to keep in the habit.
But I wouldn't worry about how little it may be; once you've
completed the home savings program there will be time enough to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to get your savings into the right kind of
long-term investment vehicles that should bring you a comfortable
retirement. How have you invested the funds in the IRA money and in
your husband's 401(k) program? You should remember that these are
very long term savings programs, and given your youth you should
have the funds invested fairly aggressively, which is to say almost
entirely in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For your IRA, for example, I'd suggest that about half of it be
in a good large-cap growth and income fund, with the remainder
divided evenly among a small-cap stock fund, an international stock
fund, and a health care fund. For example, if we look at Fidelity's
menu, you might chose Fidelity Spartan Market Index for the first
position, with Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, Fidelity Overseas, and
Fidelity Select Health Care filling out the portfolio. (You can
build similar fund portfolios using other fund families.) You could
seek to establish a similar balance within your husband's 401(k)
program, or, if the selections are limited, you could earmark that
money to fit in as all or part of one of the elements outlined
above -- combining the IRA and the 401(k) in your mind to get the
desired balance.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear the wheels turning in your mind. Is this the same guy
who was saying in the previous letter that the stock market is
overvalued? Yes, but remember, we're looking at an investment
program that will span more than 25 years, so you can comfortably
ignore the surges and ebbs of the markets. The important thing for
a truly long-term savings program is to have the right portfolio
balance and then stick to it, riding through both the bull and bear
markets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you will want to take no risks at all with
the real estate savings. I suggest you use a money market mutual
fund such as Fidelity Cash Reserves, where you might project
average returns of about 5 percent. The effect of this would be
that if you invested $1,000 a month for 48 months, the interest
would have brought the account up to $52,910 after four years,
which would indeed represent a substantial down payment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have suggested inveesting in a fund that holds
government-guaranteed mortgage securities, expecting a taxable
yield of about 6.5 percent. I am not an expert, and have never
heard of such a mutual fund. Can you suggest one?
</P>
<P>
   J.K., Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the mutual funds that invest in government-guaranteed
mortgage securities have the terms ``GNMA'' or ``U.S. Mortgage'' in
their names. These funds invest all or most of their assets in the
securities put together by federal entities such as Government
National Mortgage Association (hence GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) or the
Federal National Mortgage Association (hence FNMA or Fannie Mae).
Basically these agencies buy government- guaranteed mortgages from
the lenders, bundle the individual mortgages into securities, and
sell the resulting securities in the markets. The government stands
behind both the interest and principal payments on the mortgages,
guaranteeing that the owners of the mortgage securities will be
paid even if the borrowers default. But the government does not
guarantee the market value of the mortgage securities, and they can
fluctuate in value fairly sharply, usually as a result of interest
rate changes. Almost all mutual fund companies have a fund with a
portfolio dominated by such securities. Excellent examples are the
Fidelity GNMA and Vanguard GNMA funds.

HORSEPLAY COMES TO A HALT AS BAFFERT, HINE PREPARE FOR DUEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Fate loves to tickle.
</P>
<P>
   So it happened a little after 8 Thursday morning that Silver
Charm and Skip Away headed onto the Churchill Downs track for their
final gallops, a few minutes apart from each other, and there, at
the gap in the backstretch, Bob Baffert and Sonny Hine were
shoulder to shoulder, West Coast and East Coast, barb to barb, the
shortest of jabs from one another.
</P>
<P>
   Finally.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about if we do one of these?'' said Baffert, posing for
that standard boxing wire service photo of the 1940s and 1950s,
each boxer faking a roundhouse right to the other's head. ``Like
pose for one of those old photos? How much money would that be
worth, Sonny?''
</P>
<P>
   The morning air was frigid. Just as the air had been frigid all
summer between Hine and Baffert, trainers of the top two horses in
America, Skip Away and Silver Charm, Hine having the better horse
for the summer but the witty Baffert maybe having the better barbs
as he kept Silver Charm away from Skip Away.
</P>
<P>
   Remember this one?
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonny's like that dog in the Taco Bell commercials,'' Baffert
said a few months back. ``You know, the dog coming around to the
back door and scratching at the screen door saying, `Yo quiero (I
want) Silver Charm.'''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time Hine called Baffert ``a coward'' just
before the Massachusetts Handicap in Boston in May when Skip Away
showed up and Silver Charm was nowhere to be found. ``All I know is
that I go to about every racetrack in America,'' Hine said time and
again during the summer, ``and when I get there, I never see Silver
Charm.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, of course, Skip Away and Silver Charm will finally
meet for the first time this year in the Breeders' Cup Classic,
perhaps the classic of all Classics. The confrontation and the race
itself may be one for the ages, but the undertone to the meeting _
given the long-range barbs traded by the trainers all summer _ will
give a most human dimension to a horse race.
</P>
<P>
   And there they were together in the gap, both of their horses on
the track, Baffert faking the boxing pose and Hine coming back with
a jab: ``Don't get violent. Don't get violent, please.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a death match,'' said Baffert. ``But Sonny's never
seen a death match.'' Ah, a playful jab at Hine's older age.
</P>
<P>
   All he knew about boxing, countered Hine, was ``that I went out
there to your track (Hollywood Park) back in June and somebody said
there should be a heeayweight match between us. And I said I wasn't
worried. Just like your horse, I knew you wouldn't show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight times this year, Hine's Skip Away has raced, in Florida,
Maryland, Massachusetts, California, New Jersey, and New York, and
eight times Baffert's Silver Charm was nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert playfully kept on Hine, the Californian thinking second
thoughts about a death match against Hine, given the elder man's
experience with the CIA in China during the height of the Cold War
in the 1950s. ``Sonny can't get into a death match,'' said Baffert.
``But he knows all this other clandestine stuff ... cigars and all
that CIA stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can disarm you,'' retorted Hine. ``I can do that stuff. I
can disarm you in a hurry. With three fingers, I can make you get
on your knees. I haven't forgotten that stuff. But I don't do that
stuff no more. That's a long time ago, that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert grinned. Hine kept on.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in the Far East as an investigator, you were like
an alien,'' he said. ``You weren't permitted to carry a weapon at
all. Most I carried was a knife in my socks. The British wouldn't
let us carry any weapons or anything. You were there by yourself,
you know. You lived by your sense and your wits.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in this case, wit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
No love lost
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back in the summer, Baffert had egged on Hine and Hine had egged
on Baffert. Baffert once said of Hine, ``He talks like Elmer
Fudd,'' which irked Carolyn Hine, the trainer's wife and the owner
of Skip Away. Hine's slight speech impediment was caused by a touch
of Bell's Palsy, and Carolyn Hine has not forgotten. She bears no
love for Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife's so depressed that this is (Skip Away's) last race
that she didn't want to come to the track Thursday,'' said Hine.
``Stayed back in the room ... too sad to come to the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Both horses, the two grays so hard to distinguish because they
look so much alike, now were on the track, far in the distance.
Baffert called out to April Mayberry, another California trainer,
for help. ``April ... April? Can you see him?'' Silver Charm was
winding up his gallop, and Baffert turned to Hine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm done,'' said the Californian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that means I can take over now,'' said Hine, ever
jabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Hine would be given a fright when the headstrong
Skip Away would not allow himself to be pulled up at the end of his
gallop despite stout restraint by his exercise rider. The exhausted
rider finally jumped off Skip Away, but the horse went to an
outside fence and pulled himself up. ``Everything's fine,'' Hine
would say later. ``I guess this means he's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., the sun was up a bit more and chasing away the
frigid air. The crowd around Skip Away's barn had wandered off, and
Hine was left to chat with only a handful of old pals. Off to the
side, jockey Jerry Bailey was talking about the morning's fireworks
_ those on the track, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good sign when a horse doesn't pull up,'' said Bailey,
who'll ride Skip Away Saturday. ``Actually, I had problems when I
was working him the other day (Sunday at Belmont Park) pulling him
up. I got him pulled up, but it was hard. And that was after a full
work, not a gallop. I suppose it means he's ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only Skip Away was razor-sharp; so was Hine. The trainer was
asked if the morning's cozying up to Baffert really meant the
hatchet had been buried and was not just a show for the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aww ... awwww ... we've never had a real thing going ... never
did,'' Hine said. ``When I won the Hollywood Gold Cup and he
couldn't run, he came over to me and shook my hand and said,
`Congratulations, Sonny.' Awww ... it was good for the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Hine related his response when Baffert congratulated him
for that win June 28: ``I told him, `What are you going to do next
year when you won't have me around goading you to run?'''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hine was reminded that he had called Baffert a coward a
month earlier in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``No ... no ... no ... I was just answering a question,'' said
Hine. ``The question was, `Would you have wished (Silver Charm) had
come to Boston?' And I just answered. I said, `A coward never
wins.' That was what I said. I was just trying to goad him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine then said he and Baffert had bumped into each other on the
Churchill backstretch, ``and we got a chance to talk to each other.
You know, personal things. What his life had been like. He said, he
told me, `Having a horse of that caliber that you have, and
training it yourself, it's a trainer's dream. If I had something
like that, I'd retire.' And we talked about some more personal
things. I mean, I don't know the man ... other than the kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Just fooling?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But neither Hine nor Baffert will retire after Saturday's
Classic, and neither's personality will be retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Hine was told by a media member that the two should get into a
boxing ring and donate the proceeds to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I said?'' Hine said. ``He probably wouldn't show
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Wednesday, when we bumped into each other
inadvertently,'' said Hine, ``(Baffert) said to me, `Don't you
think my horse looks good?' And I said, `Yeah, he looks good.' And
I said to him, `I haven't seen your horse since the Preakness (of
1997) when he was a 3-year-old.' And Baffert said, `Really?' And I
said, `Yeah, your horse hasn't been anywhere where I've been.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baffert and Hine are talkers and have great wits (``We
should be on the road together,'' said Baffert), and no matter
which horse finishes ahead of the other Saturday, it will be far
from clear who has won the battle of the words. A tie, most likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love to jab,'' said Hine, and within a nanosecond, he
directed another toward Baffert. When asked his reaction to
Baffert's playfully intruding on a TV interview a Louisville
station had conducted earlier in the morning, Hine said, ``Aww ...
yeah ... any time there's a camera, I know he's going to pop up.''
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all right, that guy,'' Hine concluded. Two hours later,
Hine and Baffert and Richard Mandella, the trainer of Gentlemen,
were plopped down before a full-blown press conference, and all
were on their best behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hine with a straight face, ``(Baffert) doesn't like me and
I don't like him. But other than that, we get along just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert countered, ``Horses are like kids to their trainers. And
it's a case of `my kid's better than your kid.' Oh, there were some
things said (over the summer), but it wasn't anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine came back, ``I just can't stop jabbing. (Baffert's) been so
successful, so after the race (Saturday), he'll go on ... and I'll
go back to obscurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Just kidding there.
</P>
<P>
   For sure.
</P>
<P>
   Horses and trainers, Baffert and Hine, Silver Charm and Skip
Away, are sharp as tacks going into Saturday's classic of all
Classics. More than anything, Hine and Baffert want to win. Dearly.
</P>
<P>
   For sure.

CHINESE-AMERICANS RAISE THEIR POLITICAL VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By A.A. QUONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Discussions about ``the ethnic vote'' tend to
gloss over important distinctions. This is particularly clear in
the case of Asian-Americans, where an exit poll suggests it may be
time to reconsider just who, exactly, is the ``Asian-American
voter.''
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, where Chinese citizens were once notorious for
not voting, newly enfranchised immigrants have swollen the
Chinese-American electorate to the point where it now accounts for
one in three registered voters in some districts of the city. An
exit poll commissioned by the Chinese-American Voter Education
Committee adds brush strokes to the poorly realized sketch of this
group.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's pollsters targeted predominantly
Chinese-speaking newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sampled to get a pulse,'' explains David Lee, the
committee's executive director. The non-partisan civic group wanted
to know whether party registration was more important than
ethnicity, with an eye on new district elections in the city in
2000, when Chinese-Americans are likely to emerge as swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   The pollsters, who surveyed 300 Chinese-American voters in
English and Chinese, found some subtle differences from results
reported by the news media.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the U.S. Senate race in California, CNN reported
a majority of the state's Asian-Americans had voted for incumbent
Barbara Boxer rather than Republican Matt Fong. But two-thirds of
Chinese-Americans surveyed by the committee voted for Fong _
although they voted three to one for Democrat Gray Davis for
governor (as did the state's Asian-American voters).
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-American support for Fong fell from a high of 72 percent
recorded in a committee poll in May _ suggesting that Chinese
voters aren't so willing to just vote for a Chinese face.
</P>
<P>
   One intriguing finding was the discovery that 38 percent of
Chinese-American voters in San Francisco are registered as
nonpartisan, a figure three times the statewide average. Yet 78
percent of those in the survey support President Clinton and
believe he should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Lee believes ethnic identification is only part of the story,
and points to the Chinese-language news media, which were the major
source of information for 59 percent of those polled.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Chinese media were focused on the election,'' Lee
pointed out. And while Fong was the ``common denominator,'' the
important thing is that ``among the Chinese press, politics is the
reigning issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The surge of interest in politics is fueled partly by immigrant
Chinese now settling into the city. Some energy also comes from
struggles between American-born and foreign-born factions _ adding
more shading to the seemingly opaque picture.
</P>
<P>
   Committee pollsters themselves _ predominantly Chinese-American
women and new citizens _ reflect the concerns and enthusiasms of
the newcomer populations.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Mok, 27, who lives with her four sisters and her parents,
mobilized relatives, neighbors and friends to pitch in because she
believed the survey would ultimately ``help the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People say there's no discrimination, but it's not the
truth,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Mok, who came from Hong Kong eight years ago, wants to encourage
newcomer Chinese to participate _ and not just vote along ethnic
lines. Many newcomers, Mok notes, ``think they want Chinese to be
elected and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bi Huang, a 35-year-old hospital worker, came to the United
States from China in 1987 and voted for the first time this year,
even though she gained citizenship seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better that more Chinese people are standing up for
themselves,'' she says, smiling. ``Before, I didn't know English,''
she explains. ``Now I know and understand more.''

TRICK OR TREAT? BREEDERS' MILE WILL TELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The rewards for being named Horse of the Year
are great, but so are the responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Observers simply will not accept losing on the part of what is
purported to be the nation's best thoroughbred, especially if that
particular Horse of the Year was the only 2-year-old other than the
mighty Secretariat to be voted the honor. Such has been the dilemma
for Favorite Trick, Horse of the Year in 1997 as a juvenile. The
son of Phone Trick hasn't had a bad 1998, winning four of seven
starts and earning nearly $500,000, but those are unacceptable
numbers for the supposed best of the best.
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick is the offspring of sprinters and cost only
$32,000 as a yearling. He went 8 for 8 last year, winning the $1
million Breeders' Cup Juvenile to cap a season in which he earned
more than $1.2 million, but he never ran farther than 1 1/16 miles.
His breeding made him suspect from the start, and he proved he
doesn't relish a distance of ground when he finished third in the
Arkansas Derby in April, the first defeat of his career, then ran a
dismal eighth in the Kentucky Derby. Favorite Trick did win the Jim
Dandy, a 1 1/8-mile prep for the Travers, by a nose in August, but
he raced against Grade II foes in that event.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mott, who trains Favorite Trick for Joseph Lacombe, felt
the Travers, run at 1 1/4 miles, would be too much, so he entered
him in the King's Bishop Stakes, a 7-furlong sprint on the Travers
undercard. When Favorite Trick finished a disappointing fifth, Mott
had seen enough. He put Favorite Trick on the grass and revived his
somewhat tarnished career as the dark bay responded with a victory
in the Keeneland Mile Oct. 17 that was nothing short of
sensational. As a result, Favorite Trick is a very serious player
in Saturday's $1 million Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Lacombe put Mott in charge of Favorite Trick in January after he
discovered that previous trainer Pat Byrne had not worked him for
45 days. Both sides claimed there was nothing wrong with the horse,
that it was a difference in training philosophies that caused the
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I took him,'' said Mott. ``He's been a really fun
horse in spite of some of the things that went against him and that
some people said he wasn't that great of a horse. It was difficult
to disagree with what was said because some of it had some merit.
But remember, he was very, very good last year. He obviously was
not a Kentucky Derby horse. If I knew what the outcome would be, I
wouldn't have run him. But we had our reasons why we took a chance.
It's something that comes with being Horse of the Year and champion
2-year-old. He might not be a great 3-year-old nor a classic horse,
but maybe he's found his niche now.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Derby debacle, Mott looked around for ways to maximize
Favorite Trick's assets, which include heart but not stamina, and
began working him on the grass. ``The first time we worked him on
the turf was at Belmont, and it looked like he really liked it,''
said Mott. ``After that, I ran him three more times on the dirt
because I wanted to give him a chance to prove he could do it on
the main track. I still wasn't sure. But I finally put him on the
grass because I was looking for something to make it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a turf foot (large and flat) and he has grass breeding
on his dam's side (Evil Elaine is by Medieval Man, who is by noted
turf sire Noholme II). I knew he would be competitive on the turf.
He has tremendous use of himself. He's a beautiful-moving horse. On
a tiring sand surface, it takes a very special horse to push
themselves along. But he always had a little bit of a tendency to
burn his heels on a sand track and he doesn't have that problem on
the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick didn't just win the Keeneland Mile, he dominated
under regular rider Pat Day. He went right to the front and was
never headed, zipping the 8 furlongs in 1:35 and leaving odds-on
favorite Joyeux Danseur, who is also in the Breeders' Cup Mile, in
his wake.
</P>
<P>
   The Breeders' Cup Mile is always competitive, and this edition
seems even more so than ususal, with the favorite, Labeeb, who is 3
for 3 this year, listed as a very high 4-1 favorite in the 14-horse
field. Desert Prince, a multiple Group I winner in Europe, is held
at 9-2, while Favorite Trick and Joyeux Danseur are both 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could turn out to be one of the greatest mile races in
the world,'' said Mott.
</P>
<P>
   So when the gates open for the Mile Saturday, 13 horses will be
running strictly for the winner's purse, while one will have a
higher goal _ saving his reputation.

RANGE OF EMOTION HELPS MAKE `LIVING' WORTH LIKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LIVING OUT LOUD 
Directed and written by: Richard LaGravenese 
Starring: Holly Hunter, Danny DeVito, Queen Latifah, Martin
Donovan, Richard Schiff, Elias Koteas 
Running time: 93 minutes 
Rated R  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing deterministic about Richard LaGravenese's
``Living Out Loud.'' This is at once its strength and its drawback.
Its story of a newly divorced woman at loose ends in Manhattan and
the comfort she takes in a relationship with the night elevator
operator in her apartment building convincingly allows for the
bluesy New York of the unattached. Holly Hunter plays her like a
woman wandering in a new landscape _ tentatively, hopefully, a
little bit numbed by it all, a little bit sad, a little bit
reckless.
</P>
<P>
   Playing a range of emotions seldom made available to American
actresses, Hunter identifies keenly and sentiently with the
kaleidoscopic faceting of her character. She's most touching when,
admitting she lost touch with herself to perpetuate a comfortable
but empty marriage to her cardiologist ex, she redirects her
revived empathy toward the pain of others, not just her own. But
not before one of the best marriage-breakup-in-a-restaurant scenes
with Martin Donovan, who, as her ex, has seldom deployed his pained
wishing-he-were-somewhere-else look to better effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' essentially is the tale of a woman in
transit, one of the stops en route being the time she shares with
DeVito's less developed although far from vacant character, who has
his own set of problems at home, plus a heavy load of gambling
debts. The growing friendship between them, punctuated by intervals
of days and weeks, is allowed enough breathing room to make it seem
organic. Hunter is heartbreaking when her eyes tell us she dreads
having to turn down what she senses are his deepening feelings for
her. DeVito, too, does a sensitive and affecting job of conveying
the sincerity of a man of deep feelings also faced with the need to
turn his life around.
</P>
<P>
   LaGravenese is one of the best screenwriters around, and he
pours lots of atmosphere into his directing debut, setting a good
part of the film in a jazz club where Queen Latifah reigns and
fills her songs with a world of experience. LaGravenese
satisfyingly imparts a sense of ebb and flow rare in Hollywood
films. But his editing skills still are rudimentary. He allows
speeches to run long, and the film sometimes can't avoid seeming
choppy and scattered. Still, it's lush and awfully simpatico, with
two lovely performances. And its loose ends and false starts are
part of what makes it seem one of the few adult comedies worthy of
the term.

REVEILLE WAKES UP FAME FOR TEEN BAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Record companies are known for their feeding frenzies. A recent
craving was Reveille _ a teen-age, rap-metal band from the rural
town of Harvard, Mass. The town is known more for apple orchards
than for rock 'n' roll bands, but Reveille hopes to change that
equation. It just signed a seven-figure deal with Elektra Records,
which outbid other labels after the band played three nights of
showcases at CBGB's in Manhattan this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night we had five industry people, the second night
we had 16, and the third we had 150,'' says attorney Frank Cimler,
who negotiated the deal for Reveille.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nerve-racking,'' admits singer Drew Simollardes, 18.
``Fortunately, the lights were in our face and we couldn't see the
people out there. They were just a blur.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a wedding reception afterwards. There we were,
shaking hands with all these coats and ties,'' adds bassist Carl
Randolph, the elder of the group at age 19.
</P>
<P>
   Reveille kept its cool _ and is now moving to a dream situation
with producer Steve Thompson, who has worked with Korn and
Metallica. Reveille, whose ages range from 15 to 19, will start
recording a full-length album with Thompson at the legendary Long
View Farm studio in North Brookfield, Mass. (used in the past by
the Stones, Indigo Girls, and J. Geils Band). It's the first of a
guaranteed three-album deal, which is quite unusual in today's
one-album-and-you're-often-history climate.
</P>
<P>
   Reveille was named after the bugle-blowing signal for a wake-up
call. And the music is a visceral wake-up call, mixing the anger of
Rage Against the Machine with fiery influences from Korn, Black
Sabbath, the Smashing Pumpkins, and House of Pain.
</P>
<P>
   As for Rage Against the Machine: ``I was into them for a time
when I was younger,'' says Simollardes, who writes Reveille's
lyrics. ``I like their music _ it's heavy. I put it on when I'm
trying to get psyched up for something, but I can't relate to
everything they're singing about.''
</P>
<P>
   Reveille isn't into Rage's constant stream of politics. But
Reveille's songs have their own hard-hitting, extremely honest,
rap-metal pulse. The tune ``Flesh and Blood,'' is a virtual band
credo in its plea for self-reliance and distrust of authority.
</P>
<P>
   The song is on a new Reveille EP about to hit the stores. It was
produced at Boston's New Alliance studio by Andrew ``Mudrock''
Murdock, who has worked with Powerman 5000 and Godsmack. Its other
songs offer more emotional statements: ``Playing God'' is about
greed, ``Aftertaste'' about regret, and ``Buried Alive'' stems from
anger over a book-burning incident that Simollardes heard about a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our songs are about life experiences,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   The band was formed 10 months ago, as a merger of two
Harvard-based groups known as Gasket and Dionysius. Rounding out
Reveille are drummer Justin Wilson (the youngest at 15) and
guitarists Steve Miloszewski, 16, and Greg Sullivan, 17.
</P>
<P>
   The group started practicing in Wilson's basement and its first
gig was at Mashpee High School in May, before 100 people at a
battle of the bands. While the band sounds very urban, it doesn't
deny its rural Harvard roots.

   ``It's really interesting living in a place like this,''
Simollardes says of a town (population: 5,000) where a general
store dominates the center. ``It has its ups, but also its downs.
Being sheltered I don't think is a good thing, but fortunately, we
get out to see what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country will soon see as well.

   Life after Crowded House: ``I have no regrets,'' Neil Finn says
about the breakup of Crowded House two years ago. ``We had a good
run and I enjoyed all of those years. It was a good time to go out
on a high and preserve the dignity of what we had.''
</P>
<P>
   The pop-loving, Beatles-spiced Crowded House had a successful
career with such hits as ``Don't Dream It's Over'' and ``Something
So Strong.'' Finn, the chief songwriter, was in the group with his
older brother, Tim.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand-based Neil recently released his first solo
disc, ``Try Whistling This.'' Although Finn toured with a band
earlier this year, he's back with only his 15-year-old son Liam on
drums.
</P>
<P>
   Finn will do some Crowded House songs, but also pull from his
solo disc, a sometimes inspired, sometimes baffling album with
esoteric samples and loops. Radio has been slow to embrace it, but
Finn doesn't want to cast any retaliatory barbs: ``I don't have any
theories (about the lack of airplay). It's just a record I made
that I feel very good about.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side are new songs ``Last One Standing'' (a
beautiful, acoustic-based tune about love), and the high-pitched,
Paul McCartney-esque ``She Will Have Her Way.'' There's also
``Sinner'' (``forever I must walk the earth like some forgotten
soldier'' goes the lyric), which Finn has been telling audiences is
(jokingly) about Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a lot of songs on the album could be about the
president,'' he adds with a laugh. ``There's `She Will Have Her
Way,' `Loose Tongue,' and `Try Whistling This.' I think the White
House should put it out as a Christmas album.''
</P>
<P>
   The album features many guests, from Midnight Oil guitarist Jim
Roginie to Soul Coughing bassist Sebastian Steinberg. The album
rewards repeated listens, and finds Finn continuing to push the
boundaries of pop music, a laudatory goal in this era of gutless,
safe-at-all-costs musicmaking.

KISS AND TELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take a look at the picture of KISS.
</P>
<P>
   You may now stop reading, if you wish, or so says KISS
bassist-singer Gene Simmons. ``The only thing I care about is this:
Print the big picture of me,'' Simmons says. ``I mean whether the
press gets it or not,'' he doesn't care. ``Media people tend to
believe that their word and their taste is more important than
somebody else's. Power corrupts.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, but Simmons is both amiable and media-savvy. KISS
has waged a long-running battle with the rock press, but Simmons
knows this: Negative press affects KISS the same way it did
``Independence Day,'' and much of the press has come around to
appreciate KISS as the rock 'n' roll circus it is.
</P>
<P>
   Look at that photo again.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been taken two decades ago, but it's current, and
so is the band. Guitarists Paul Stanley and Ace Frehley, Simmons,
and drummer Peter Criss are the Dorian Grays of rock _ looking the
same as they ever were, even as their aggregate age is pushing 200.
(Frehley and Criss beat substance abuse problems and rejoined the
band in 1996.) KISS is more popular than ever. The four played to
70,000 people at Dodger Stadium on Halloween, and they kick off
their indoor arena tour at the FleetCenter in Boston Nov. 12 and
13.
</P>
<P>
   KISS has sold over 70 million albums. In 1996 and 1997, KISS was
the No.1 band on tour. It will open the Super Bowl with its
national anthem ``Rock and Roll All Nite.'' The four are currently
filming a KISS movie called ``Detroit Rock City'' for New Line
Cinema.
</P>
<P>
   On its new album, ``Psycho Circus,'' KISS has a thumping rocker
only this band could write, ``I Pledge Allegiance to the State of
Rock 'n' Roll.'' But isn't rock 'n' roll sometimes a sorry state?
Says Stanley: ``I can only define rock 'n' roll in my terms. What
other watered-down, contrived agenda others may have, have no
bearing on what I consider rock 'n' roll. I think I walk the walk
besides talking the talk. After 25 and 70 million albums in the
dictionary I would expect to see my picture next to `rock 'n'
roll.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here is KISS on ...
</P>
<P>
   _The Show. Is it now fun for the whole family? Gene: ``Anybody
can go. We don't dilute anything we do, but we don't kill anybody
either. It's a combination of Americana from horror movies to a
Fourth of July fireworks show _ with a backbeat. If you can hum
along to a couple of things, great. If you hate our music and just
want to come for the spectacle, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   _This tour. The theme, as the new album's title says is ``Psycho
Circus.'' Gene: ``We have a `Psycho Circus' troupe (opening up),
circus performers who are out of their minds. They set themselves
on fire and blow themselves up. Everything is going to be in your
face no matter where you're sitting. It's the first 3-D tour in
history. The 3-D literally pops off the screen.'' During KISS's set
the drum kit will rise and float out over the audience. Gene will
fly to the top of the lighting rig. He will soar over the audience
and vomit fake blood on the specially designated ``blood seats.''
</P>
<P>
   _The ethos. Gene: ``We're not great masters. We're the court
jesters. We're here to put a smile on your face and make your eyes
pop wide open. If the only thing that happens is that for those
couple of hours you feel a little happier to be alive or we tickled
you, that's a good thing. I wish I could bottle that. We stand
guilty of making a complete spectacle out of ourselves. If you're
looking for a message, send a telegram.''
</P>
<P>
   _Self analysis: Gene: ``I'm a whore. I'm easy but ... I'm
honest. Truth in advertising, that's what I believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   _Fashion. Gene: ``Wearing platform heels, studs, leather, and
long hair. Do I care nobody else is doing it? Do I care everybody
has short hair and razor cuts and looks like they escaped from the
Marines? If that's what everybody wants to do, well, great for you.
I want to get up on stage, stick my tongue out, and drool blood.
Life's too short to figure out what works by committee.''
</P>
<P>
   _The money making. Gene: ``Everybody wants to get money. I don't
know of any band that gets on stage and does it for free.
</P>
<P>
   _The merchandise. Everything at every level is up for sale.
Comics, dolls, T-shirts. Gene says there are ``a little over a
thousand'' licensed products. On the upper end of it, you can buy a
life-size KISS portrait by Peter Max, starting at $550,000. KISS
hopes to sell 100. Register for the drawing to win a $50,000 KISS
car, a chrome-and-black, 450 horsepower two-seater, with a light
that flashes ``KISS'' when you hit the brake. It will be given away
at Pontiac Stadium live on the ``Dick Clark New Year's Eve
Extravaganza.'' Just dial 1-900-CALL KISS. Cost? ``Oh, under $2,''
says Gene. ``The absolute truth is the more times you call the
better your chances of winning.'' You can also buy ``KISStory 2,''
their second coffee table book. Only $158.95. Dial 1-800-905-KISS.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; if,,.1l &LR;  _The KISS myth. Gene: ``Take Superman, if you believe
in the magic you say, `What a hero.' If you don't buy the premise,
you say, `It's pretty ridiculous _ the get-up, the red and blue
tights. It's silly.' If you believe, it's glorious and wonderful
and all encompassing. If people get what KISS is all about, then
it's magic and if you don't you're still fascinated by it. I mean,
I may not get opera but I still go, `Wow, look at that.'''
</P>
<P>
   _The fans. Paul: ``The majority of our audience is a real
mainstream rock 'n' roll audience, basicially in their 20s that has
no connection to the '70s and that experience. They come purely to
see if this holds up to what people consider contemporary or
current. If this (tour) were purely about nostalgia I'd still be
home. Everybody knows I'm too rich to go out if I don't like doing
this. Not only am I in the band, I'm one of the biggest fans. I
believe in Superman. I look in the mirror and I see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene: ``I believe in the great American dream. This is a
one-of-a-kind society _ of the people, for the people, by the
people. Not the intelligensia, not the `taste'-makers. It's really
people who decide and I believe in the great unwashed masses. The
roar of the greasepaint and the smell of the crowd. That's where
our constituency comes from. This is the country that rules the
world culturally, even though it's ironic 'cause it's supposed to
be the country with no culture.''
</P>
<P>
   _Ladies. Gene: Boston ``has some of the most beautiful women
I've ever seen.'' Reporter: ``Come on, you say that about every
city.'' Gene: ``That's true, but that's because I'm a guy and I
speak the universal language. It's called `Woof! Woof! Woof!'''
</P>
<P>
   _Drugs and booze. Gene: ``I never got the public's fascination
with cigarettes, booze, and drugs. The idea that you'd want to get
drunk, have a headache (and not be able to function sexually): I
don't get it and it costs money. Getting high numbs your feelings
and as far as I'm concerned, I'm so happy I have a taste of smell
and touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul: ``The idea of somebody getting a vicarious thrill watching
me walk on the edge of a building and secretly hoping I jump is of
no appeal to me. Being a dead legend sucks. I'm real clear on who I
am and I do the dancing. Nobody else pulls the strings. ... If
drugs don't kill your body they kill your spirit and your soul.
Look around: The message is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   _Opening up at the Super Bowl: Paul: ``I'm a big believer that
any time you can get into millions of people's homes and not use
the window, I'm there.'' Plans? ``Obviously, subtlety is not in our
vocabulary, so anything short of bringing down aircraft will be on
the menu. They play their national anthem and we get to play
ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene: ``The hell with the little pigskin. Forget that. We're
gonna blow the whole place up. They're gonna have to divert planes
to other landing areas.''

A SENSUAL DIP INTO GLAM-ROCK NOSTALGIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
VELVET GOLDMINE 
Directed and written by: Todd Haynes 
Starring: Ewan McGregor, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Christian Bale,
Eddie Izzard, Emily Woof, Michael Feast 
Running time: 123 minutes 
Rated: R (strong sexual content, nudity, language and drug use) 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' is a camp classic about classic camp, or
would be if it had that kind of energy level. As it is, it's about
nothing much, namely glam rock. Todd Haynes's film about the
flare-up of the in-your-face artifice of the '70s is easily his
most ambitious, but he runs smack into the limitations imposed upon
him by the intrinsically glitter-deep subject matter. Given that,
and the fact that his druggy protagonists spend liberal amounts of
screen time comatose, perhaps you will see why the film derives
most of its entertainment value from the music by the likes of
Brian Eno, Gary Glitter, Brian Ferry, and Iggy Pop.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes tries to apply the ``Citizen Kane'' approach to the story
of a Brit rock god of the '70s whose career falls apart when it's
revealed that a sensational windup to his stage act _ his being
shot dead by an assassin _ was faked. Fan outrage sends him into
hiding until the resonant year of 1984, when a reporter played by
Christian Bale is sent out to do a whatever-happened-to story on
the missing exile. The journalist's diggings conjure up in
flashback the glory days of glam rock over which Haynes, in a
prologue, appoints a patron saint _ Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what follows involves Brian Slade's sparkling, feathered
Brit falling from the full height of his platform shoes for a
counterpart from the United States, Curt Wild, who pushes the drug
envelope. Slade, as played by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, suggests a
David Bowie figure. Ewan McGregor, looking slightly more amorphous,
is, one supposes, meant to suggest a cross between Iggy Pop and,
anachronistically, Kurt Cobain. But I leave such antecedents to the
experts, considering it purely academic since more energy goes into
displaying the costumes than to bringing the characters to anything
that might be thought of as life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' is eye-catching in its production numbers.
But for a film supposedly running on nostalgia, it plays more like
an exhumation than a revival as the trans-Atlantic buddies float
into bisexuality on their way to sowing a few Wilde oats, before
the American rocker's career vanishes up his nose and the Brit
self-destructs onstage. The reporter's investigation into the rise
and fall of his onetime idol amounts to a pretty gloomy trudge,
too. About all that saves the film from vanishing into a black hole
of inertia is the performance of Toni Collette as Slade's
American-born ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the reporter tracks her down and meets her in a pub
to get her story, it has been seven years since she has seen her
ex. She hasn't much to add in the way of the narrative punch the
film so sorely needs. Yet she brings a sadder-but-wiser weight of
presence to the screen that has been conspicuously lacking in the
faceless earnestness of Bale's reporter and in Meyers's and
McGregor's birds of plumage. Eddie Izzard is a plus, too, as
Slade's savvy but sleazy manager. He manages to blast free from the
cliched nature of the role to supply another badly needed modicum
of vitality in the lugubrious nothingness surrounding the glam-rock
glitterbugs.

INTERNET GAINS MUSICIAN A BONUS ROUND AT LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just a few years ago, Steve Schalchlin was dying. He didn't
think he was dying, he was dying. This was the real thing: The fat
lady was warming up in the wings. The virus had taken over; his
symptoms were escalating; his weight was plummeting. So the lanky
musician with the Texas twang did what seemed logical at the time:
He borrowed a friend's computer, taught himself how to program a
Web site and launched an on-line diary, chronicling the daily
indignities of his battle with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   First only friends and relatives logged on, but then strangers
started trickling in, tracking his doctor's visits and drug dosages
the way armchair investors chart the Dow Jones average. And then
something happened: Steve Schalchlin didn't die. He started taking
the powerful new protease inhibitor called Crixivan, and his health
rebounded. Across the Internet, his on-line friends rejoiced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to die, but I wrote a musical instead,''
Schalchlin says cheerfully, informing a listener that his weight is
back to normal and he is looking, in his own estimation, ``just
plain gorgeous.'' Right now, he's thriving in the bonus round of
the game show called Life; that's the name he uses for his Web
site, which is at bonusround.com. ``The prizes are better, but you
never know when the buzzer is going to go off again, so you have to
do everything fast,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In Schalchlin's case, the prizes include an expanding network of
on-line friends, a new career as both a public health speaker and a
cabaret singer, along with the Grand Prize, the show that gives new
meaning to the term feel-good musical. It's called ``The Last
Session,'' and it has played sold-out engagements in New York and
in the Los Angeles area. Schalchlin is in Boston this weekend
performing a cabaret version of the show, and he's also headlining
a benefit on Sunday night for the Frontrunners Boston Charitable
Foundation and the AIDS Action Committee. Then he's off to other
engagements, which include lecturing to medical students at
Bucknell University before jetting back to Los Angeles, where
``Last Session'' reopens in early December.
</P>
<P>
   This is life in the bonus round, after all, and Schalchlin says
he owes it all to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1996, the man who eventually became the on-line Lazarus
was just another struggling musician eking out a living in Los
Angeles. He grew up in the small town of Buna, Texas, the son of a
Baptist preacher and a nurse. As a teenager, he played the piano in
his Daddy's church and performed briefly with a ``l'il Jesus
band.'' But the boys in the band were straight, not gay, and
Schalchlin needed to hit the road to come to terms with his sexual
identity. That search took him to New York, where he was the piano
man in smoky bars for a while before landing a gig on a cruise ship
headed for Bermuda. It was on that slow boat where he met his
partner, the playwright and director Jim Brochu. Together, they
moved to Los Angeles; Schalchlin started out volunteering for the
National Academy of Songwriters and ``ended up running the place.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he got sick. After spending years holding the hand of
aspiring musicians, he needed some TLC himself. As the disease
played its version of Doom in his body, he spent an awful lot of
time talking on the telephone with his brothers back in Texas, who
were calling daily for updates. The Web site seemed like a good way
to cut back on the phone bills, and he copiously chronicled his
bouts with pneumonia, his constant cough, his running diarrhea. But
then one of the search engines on line named him ``Cool Site of the
Day,'' and soon, thousands of strangers were wrapped up in his
story. They signed into his guestbook and read the lyrics from the
musical he was writing from his hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   One of those strangers turned out to be Don Kirkpatrick, a
soft-spoken radio ad salesman in Texas. He became a regular visitor
to the site. ``I became so involved in his story, and I sent him an
e-mail saying, `You have the love and prayers of an old man in West
Texas,''' Kirkpatrick recalls. When the ailing Schalchlin began
writing about his efforts to get his musical produced, Kirkpatrick
flew to Los Angeles to see a workshop production. And then he
simply wrote a check for $10,000. ``I'm not a rich man, but I've
put aside a retirement fund, and I did the calculation and figured
I could afford it,'' Kirkpatrick explains.
</P>
<P>
   The show opened at a tiny Off-Off-Broadway theater last year and
then tranferred to a larger Off-Broadway theater last October. The
show, with its uplifting message and soft rock tunes, received
warm, yet mixed reviews, but audiences flocked to the theater.
There was so much crying going on, Schalchlin says, the producers
assigned ``designated huggers'' to embrace audience members as they
exited the theater.
</P>
<P>
   One of those audience members was Bruce Dorsey, a senior
researcher at Merck Pharmaceuticals who was on the team that
developed the miracle drug Crixivan. Life in the bonus round, it
turns out, is full of serendipitous connections. Schalchlin started
taking the drug at the same time he was trying to get the musical
produced, and he wrote about his recovery in his Web site. Dorsey
happened to read that part of the diary, and he immediately fired
off an e-mail to Schalchlin. ``I'm trained as a medicinal chemist,
and in the laboratory, we deal with numbers, we don't deal with
patients,'' Dorsey says. ``For the first time, Steve put a face on
AIDS for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The two became fast friends, and Dorsey took a busload of Merck
employees to see the musical in New York. ``I don't want this to
sound like a cliche, but I'm a straight, East Coast Ivy-League
trained scientist,'' Dorsey says. ``How am I ever going to connect
with a gay Southern California singer-songwriter? You would think
those two worlds would never collide, but they can through the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of unlikely collision seems to happen all the time in
the bonus round, though. Jarvis Chen, a doctoral candidate at
Harvard's School of Public Health happened upon Schachlin's Web
site last year, and he invited the songwriter to speak to students
in a class called HIV Transmission and Social Behavior. ``It's
important for students to hear someone talk about living with the
disease and not just being a victim,'' Chen says.
</P>
<P>
   As for Schalchlin, he's just plain tickled with his new career,
and he will proudly tell you he was once described as ``somewhat
famous'' in Playbill Magazine. ``You have to understand that this
is just amazing for someone with my background,'' he says. ``I
didn't even know what Harvard was when I was a playing the piano in
my Daddy's church.''
</P>
<P>
   Schalchlin came out to his parents when he was on his deathbed,
and they've seen ``The Last Session,'' which is about a composer
who is dying of AIDS and contemplating suicide. He throws a last
recording session, and one of the musicians is a homophobic
fundamentalist Christian who eventually learns tolerance. ``The
message of the play is, `Don't judge someone until you know
them,`'' Schalchlin says. ``Preaching is not judging. It's
ministry. It's feeding and taking care of people's wounds. It's not
standing up on a mountain and yelling at people.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his other distinctions, this somewhat famous digital
diarist is simply a minister who delivers his message with both a
keyboard and a mouse.

AMERICAN HISTORY, ESPECIALLY FOR `LADIES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO BE LADIES 
Women and the Obligations of Citizenship 
By Linda K. Kerber 
Hill &AMP; Wang, 388 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Historian Linda Kerber decided to write this book on a
California day three decades ago when her husband went off to war.
Wearing olive drab and a buzz cut, he entered the center of a war
he felt was immoral; taking a taxi home, she began an intellectual
journey that would question the core meaning of citizenship and its
obligations. Kerber's research produced this book, ``No
Constitutional Right to Be Ladies,'' a history and critical
analysis of gender, difference, and equality.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the American Revolution and working her way
through the battles over the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s
and early '80s, Kerber takes a feminist tack, with a twist. Her
premise seems simple enough: The fight for women's equality should
be framed in terms of obligations, not rights and privileges. Just
beyond that simple premise, however, lie passion, struggle, and
controversy. Kerber, a professor of history at the University of
Iowa, is able to harness some, but not all, of the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Her book, and her search through American history, begins in
Massachusetts, shortly after the Revolutionary War. Kerber stumbled
upon a Supreme Judicial Court case argued in 1805, Martin v.
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, that involved ``coverture'' _ the
notion that a woman's entire civic identity is assumed by her
husband when she marries. Kerber notes the irony: America's
founding revolutionaries were challenging English law governing the
king's subjects, yet seemed determined to leave women in thrall to
a domestic master. ``But at the same time the founders maintained
in place a legal system which heightened differences between free
women and men, especially between married women and men. As the
suffrage was expanded to embrace more and more white men, the
difference between them and their wives, who could neither vote,
nor hold office, nor serve on juries, expanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerber's research is meticulous, and she is fascinated by the
country's founding fathers and mothers. She digs up a revealing
quote from Abigail Adams, in 1776: ``Do not put such unlimited
power into the hands of the Husbands,'' Adams urged. ``Remember all
Men would be tyrants if they could.'' Kerber reports that Abigail's
husband, John, laughed at this remark. The majority view, however,
was that the system did not oppress women _ it protected them and
awarded them privilege. That system created a tension that threads
through the history of the struggle for women's equality. Kerber
finds it at numerous junctures, wherever women bump against an
unsettled question of civic duty: rights to property and estates,
suffrage, jury duty, military service.
</P>
<P>
   Kerber leafs through case histories and legal decisions and
uncovers significant cultural unease over women's roles in society
at every turn. In 1961, for example, in Hoyt v. Florida, US Supreme
Court Justice John Harlan refused to reconsider earlier findings
that kept women out of the jury box. Women were not excluded from
jury service, they were exempted, because of their roles as family
nest-builders. Harlan wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the enlightened emancipation of women from the
restrictions and protections of bygone years, and their entry into
many parts of community life formerly considered to be reserved to
men, woman is still regarded as the center of home and family
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The thorniest question _ should women be drafted and serve in
combat _ was destined to emerge in public debate at the same time
as the effort to pass an Equal Rights Amendment. It made for a
volatile mix.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, a Philadelphia student named Andrew Rowland challenged
the Selective Service Act of 1967, citing moral and ethical
objections. The US Justice Department rebuffed these claims, and
Kerber notes that conscription laws had long stood up against a
range of constitutional challenges. Rowland's lawyer, Donald
Weinberg, refocused the case on sex discrimination. ``In the end,''
Kerber writes, ``it was the only argument that survived.'' The case
dragged on, plaintiffs dropped out, and the US pulled out of
Vietnam. But the issue of male-only draft remained. When President
Jimmy Carter proposed universal registration in 1980, questions of
military service and gender were infused with new political
vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Congress authorized a male-only draft registration.
Phyllis Schlafly and her allies in the Eagle Forum joined the
battle on the right flank, asserting that feminists wanted to push
women into combat. Kathleen Teague of the Eagle Forum wanted to
know what women would receive in return for giving up their
``constitutional right to be treated like American ladies.'' In
1981, a decade after the case began, the US Supreme Court left the
decision to register women up to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Kerber ably fuses contemporaneous scraps from court cases,
newspapers, and interviews. But her prose can be too densely worked
and needs a stronger narrative line to find a home in the
mainstream. In the end, it is a book for legal specialists,
historians, and those who lived through the movements that shaped
the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. In the end, the questions of gender,
equity, and difference that Kerber examines await new answers, new
movements, and new discourse.

BACK SEATS MOVE TO THE FORE AT AUTOMOBILE SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, November 08, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of horses up front took a back seat to the back seats
at the New England International Auto Show last week. While there's
plenty of horsepower under the hoods of the 1999 models on view,
it's innovation in the back ends that has drawn the most attention
_ as in how much stuff can one cram in there?
</P>
<P>
   Saturn literally stole the show at the press preview, unveiling
its new three-door SC coupe with the back seat chock full of stuff,
then opening the two doors on the driver's side and unloading. What
came out drew the same sort of amused gasps that greet the 28
clowns who spill out of the little circus car. First came some
modest-sized soft luggage, then a full-size tuba _ and then
another, somewhat larger tuba and a duffel about the size of what
the high school basketball team uses to haul equipment to practice.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason, though, when the public came pouring through
the doors on the opening Saturday, the Saturn SC1 and SC2 sat on
the Bayside turntable bereft of cargo to tickle the car buyers'
appetite for usable space _ the tubas and luggage that rammed home
the utility point so graphically are left to the imagination of the
Saturn spielers and their audience. But the rear door, modeled
after the small doors on extended cab pickup trucks, offers the
driver ease of loading otherwise difficult cargo for a small coupe.
Like the trucks, the rear door cannot be opened until the front
door has been opened and there is no ``B'' pillar to obstruct. With
fold-down rear seats for pass-through access to the trunk, the load
potential of the new Saturns is impressive. Perhaps more impressive
is the price list for these built-in-America cars _ $12,445 plus
$440 delivery for a manual-shift SC1 three-door; $15,005 for an
SC2, plus delivery. Add $860 for automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been some criticism of a back door on the street
side of the vehicle, the car drew praise from handicapped visitors
for innovative thinking _ no B pillar and that extra door make it
easier for the wheelchair user to slide the folded chair into the
car after taking a seat at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Station wagons, almost driven to extinction by federal
regulation and the rise and spread of the minivan, are making a
comeback. Saab unveiled its 9-5 Wagon, its first in two decades,
with some innovation borrowed from aircraft _ which should surprise
no one since SAAB began life as an aircraft company: Swedish
Aircraft AB, whence came the Saab name derivation. The cargo floor
of the Saab wagon employs moveable tie-downs in channels along the
sides, much like the cargo floor of an airliner. The tie-downs snap
out, are stored in an accessory pouch under the floor, and offer
secure fastening for breakable stuff and security for the front
passengers who will not be bruised by flying cargo in a sudden
stop.
</P>
<P>
   For heavy stuff, the Saab has a rollout panel that extends
beyond the bumper and, a Saab representative assured as two heavy
men sat on it, a capacity of 460 pounds. Instead of straining your
back to place heavy loads within, one may place them sans muscle
pull on the tray and slide the weight into the wagon. Saab has not
announced price but the wagon is to be available in two trim levels
_ figure price tags around $32,000 at the lower end, $37,000 at the
upper. The wagon is due out in the spring. For right now, the
Swedish maker is showing the new 9-3 five-door and the 9-3
convertible available with a new 2.0-liter 200 horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   BMW also introduced wagons, the 5 Series Sportwagons, billed as
sports car disguised as cargo carrier. It, too, has a slide-out
panel on the cargo floor for manhandling heavy loads, but the
stated capacity was less than half that of the Saab _ about 160
pounds, a BMW spokesman offered. Two versions are available, the
528i with V-6 engine and the 540i with a spirited 4.4-liter V-8.
</P>
<P>
   Wagons abound at the Bayside, ranging from the elite,
electronically enhanced Mercedes E Class all-wheel-drive model and
the sporty Audi A4 and A6 Avants, down through the workaday Ford
Taurus, Saturns, and smaller offerings. And there are what might be
called wagon types _ sport/utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep unveiled its newest Grand Cherokee at the show, a
new-from-the-ground-up SUV that, while it looks like a freshened
carryover from 1998, only carries over a handful of parts _ small
parts, at that. It is longer for more cargo room, an inch wider
with a wider track, and slightly higher. Handling and ride,
Chrysler says, have been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Most important is the new engine that Chrysler has needed; under
the hood of the new Grand Cherokee, you'll find either the proven
4.0-liter I-6 or a brand-new 4.7-liter, 235-horsepower replacement
for the venerable 5.2-liter, an engine that has been around in one
form or another since the '60s. The new engine is more fuel
efficient (20 miles per gallon in the new Jeep, Chrysler says) and
spews 30 percent cleaner exhaust.
</P>
<P>
   And while Chrysler was showing the new Jeep at the auto show,
its Jeep division was showing customers how to use it off road at
Jeep 101, an off-road driving school set up at the Topsfield
Fairgrounds Friday for a four-day session.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on the ability to carry stuff continued with trucks
_ not just stuff in the cargo compartment but people and things in
the passenger space. It's the year of the door. Pickups have three
and four doors; vans have a pair of sliding doors these days just
to gain entry into the main selling arena. And the competition is
fierce what with the new Honda Odyssey challenging Ford Windstar
and the van leader, Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot to see starting with a sand pile in the lobby
that was gradually shaped into a 1957 Chevy convertible with family
aboard, and ending, perhaps, with the new Jaguars in the back of
the hall. In between were new Beetles, new Porsches, new Lincolns,
Volvo's new convertible _ new cars and new technology of all sorts.
</P>
<P>
   The New England exhibition is the first major auto show of the
new model year _ this year underline the word ``major.''

 By DEBORAH STEAD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Consider the option offered to many working parents in the brave
new ``flexible'' workplace: the right to earn a part-time salary
for the privilege of leaving promptly at the end of a full day.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like a bad bargain, there are deeper compromises
to contemplate in today's corporate world of flex time, teams and
short-term projects, according to Richard Sennett.
</P>
<P>
   Sennett's provocative, and often persuasive, new book, ``The
Corrosion of Character: The Personal Consequences of Work in the
New Capitalism'' (W.W. Norton, $23.95), argues that for employees,
the re-engineered, routine-bashing workplace is just as bad as the
rigid bureaucracy it is replacing. Maybe worse.
</P>
<P>
   All this flexibility, says the writer, a sociologist at New York
University, may help feed the frantic product reinvention and
short-term gains that our economy now demands.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not about personal power or freedom, as advertised.
It's just another form of capitalist control: a confusing regime
that erodes employees' sense of work, place and self.
</P>
<P>
   To be nimble enough to succeed, he argues, employees are bending
themselves too far. Human character cannot develop in a culture
that worships risk, uncertainty and a plug-in work force, he says.
Character is formed from long-term mutual commitments _ from
sustained work, from a sense of purpose and, yes, even from steady
routine.
</P>
<P>
   Sennett, who with Jonathan Cobb wrote ``The Hidden Injuries of
Class'' in 1972, has been watching workers for a while. And he
stresses that he is not calling for a return to the days of
Draconian work rules and the endless repetition of the same few,
simple tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he wants Americans to retrieve some of the values that
stood alongside (or stood up to) the old, rigid way of management.
</P>
<P>
   His, of course, is a tricky business, and ``The Corrosion of
Character'' doesn't always pull it off. There's a whiff of
nostalgia here, despite the author's protestations.
</P>
<P>
   But Sennett's argument, which weaves the work of Denis Diderot,
Joseph Schumpeter and Daniel Bell into everyday life, is
illuminating. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The book begins with the author's accidental airport encounter
with a man he calls Rico, the son of a janitor he interviewed years
ago for ``The Hidden Injuries of Class.''
</P>
<P>
   Rico is a successful management consultant _ safe, it seems,
from the kind of dull job his father held and from a life measured
in small home improvements and savings.
</P>
<P>
   But independent consulting is unsatisfying, confesses Rico, who
was downsized out of an engineering position. He is weary of
drumming up clients, tired of pleasing them to the point of
distorting his MBA training, unsettled by his four relocations.
</P>
<P>
   His last move, he says, was for his wife's job, but now she,
too, is disappointed. She is a manager, but feels she has little
control: Some of her staff work at the office, some at home and
some a thousand miles away, where they are reachable only by
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her company's strict guidelines on cybersupervising,
her flexible workplace affords her no flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Rico also worries that his children have no ``ethical
discipline.'' They take his success for granted, he says, and seem
to be headed into Mall Rat mode. The couple's career paths are too
fragmented, he adds, to provide life lessons about sustained
endeavors, patience or loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Corrosion of Character'' introduces us to other
new-economy workers as well. The author returns to a Boston bakery
visited for his earlier book and finds its current employees _ in
sharp contrast to their predecessors _ to be indifferent to their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Their baking, which is now computer-supervised, is determined by
the temporary daily needs of their local market niche: they make
mounds of bagels one day, stacks of French bread the next. Sennett,
who seems to be simply cranky about the changes at a once-familiar
shop, doesn't make much of a case here.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Rose, a smart manager-bartender at the author's
favorite New York watering hole, proves more compelling. She
follows the siren song of risk-taking and accepts a job at an ad
agency. But she feels invisible working on a team that is always
collectively blameless and that values soft communication skills
over concrete ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Employees in the new economy are being cheated, the author
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   They lack a usable work ethic, because there is little long-term
planning in a work culture that thrives on uncertainty and denies
time's ``trajectory'' into the future. They lack social bonds based
on mutual trust because they're encouraged to hop from project to
project. And they lack a respect for sustained routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we stand on a historical divide on the issue of
routine,'' the author says, after a bracing dip into the differing
18th-century views of Diderot (it's dignified and necessary) and
Adam Smith (it's numbing). In our own century, the author notes,
routine, or rather escape from it, has been an ``arena of
empowerment'' for American labor as it fought for fundamental
changes in the way work is done.
</P>
<P>
   Are we sure, Sennett asks, that routine is inherently demeaning?
That long-term commitments are stagnating? That flexibility is the
same thing as freedom?

TO COUNTER STIGMA, HYUNDAI BOLSTERS WARRANTY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In an effort to bolster public confidence in the
quality of its Korean-made cars, Hyundai Motor America announced
this week what it calls the best warranty in the auto business.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyundai Advantage, as it is being advertised in a $25
million print and television campaign that runs for six weeks,
covers 1999 models with a five-year, 60,000-mile bumper-to-bumper
warranty on all parts, the longest of any automaker.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai's previous basic coverage, like that of most
manufacturers outside the luxury segment, was three years or 36,000
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Under Hyundai Advantage, major components like the engine and
transmission are covered for 10 years or 100,000 miles, up from
five years or 60,000 miles. Volkswagen is the only other
manufacturer to offer 10-year, 100,000-mile coverage of major
components, but VW's basic coverage on all parts is only two years
or 24,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai also stretched the coverage of its roadside assistance
program to five years and an unlimited number of miles, making it
the second-longest in the industry; Mercedes-Benz offers roadside
assistance for as long as the initial purchaser owns the car.
Hyundai's previous roadside assistance plan was for three years or
36,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai has been plagued by real and perceived quality problems
since it began selling cars in the United States in the mid-1980s.
Indeed, sales plunged after the poor reliability of early Hyundais
became widely known. The company said its recent data on matters
like warranty costs indicated that quality had improved but public
perceptions had changed little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought an improved warranty would make a statement about
our quality and get us on more people's shopping lists,'' Finbarr
O'Neill, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The new coverage comes as Hyundai is introducing a redesigned
1999 model of its midsize Sonata sedan.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, manufacturers made few changes in warranties
although many added features like roadside assistance. Long-term
warranties were widely promoted in the 1980s, but were trimmed
after consumers complained that many items were not covered and
that they often had to pay deductibles. O'Neill said Hyundai had no
deductibles on its new coverage.

   Q. I belong to two work teams that can't seem to get along. I am

into a corner until they learn not to turn their professional
differences into a midlife version of playground warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Barring such intervention, however, your best bet is to stay
neutral, said Andrew J. DuBrin, a professor of management at the
Rochester Institute of Technology's business college and the author
of ``Winning Office Politics'' (Prentice Hall Trade, 1990).
</P>
<P>
   Trying to appease both factions _ by pretending that you're on
the side of whoever happens to be grousing in your office _ only
fuels the conflict, and is likely to catch up with you eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to take sides should not be confused, however, with
ignoring the problem. When conflict arises, feel free to voice your
opinion of the merits and weaknesses of each side's position, he
said, but take pains to remain as detached as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In time, people will understand that you are putting the
company's interests first _ and they may even come around to your
way of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, by behaving like the one grown-up in this crowd,
you may ultimately shame your colleagues into better behavior. At
the very least, they'll realize that they can't use you as a
sounding board for their whining.
</P>
<P>
   If people continue to push you to take sides, gently push back,
DuBrin advised. Tell them you realize that the two teams don't get
along well, and ask them what they want you to do about it. This
will challenge them to come up with constructive proposals or,
failing that, to get off your case.
</P>
<P>
   Do not feel obliged to assume the role of playground monitor.
You shouldn't have to mediate among adults, said Elaine Duffy, a
psychologist specializing in organizational effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   You can talk with team members individually, telling them you've
noticed that the conflict is beginning to set them back in
achieving their goals, said Ms. Duffy, who is also a consultant
with Learning Systems International in Providence, R.I. But don't
confront them, because then you will only receive angry responses.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, don't beat yourself up if relations don't improve.
You've done your best, and blaming yourself for other people's
pettiness can only be self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the situation deteriorates to the point where you
fear that your own performance is suffering, don't hesitate to take
the matter upstairs. There's no reason that you should have to stay
after class just because the other boys and girls refuse to play
nice.

 &HT;    BOMBERS ATTACK ISRAELI MARKET, NO SHOPPERS KILLED BUT PEACE
PROCESS SHAKEN
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A suicide bombing on the edge of a crowded market
here Friday amazingly killed no Israelis, but did cause another
delay in the peace process worked out last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third attack on Israelis since the convening of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks three weeks ago that resulted in
the signing of the Wye Memorandum in Washington. One Israeli has
been killed in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest bombing, the agreement reached at last
month's nine-day summit was clearly not dead Friday. Indeed, by
late afternoon, Israeli leaders were calling for the process to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis had already been acting reluctantly to ratify the
agreement. The bombing shifts the focus from whether Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would persuade his right-wing cabinet
to belatedly approve the agreement to the question of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   If the bombers end up being sent by the Palestinian extremist
group Hamas, as an anonymous caller told Israeli police, it will
increase pressure on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to keep his
promises to crack down on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's cabinet might have voted on the agreement Friday
morning, but news of the bombing brought the meeting to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the bombers had struck the Mahaneh Yehuda produce
market, a shopping place frequented by blue-collar Israelis and
Orthodox religious Jews. Many vendors keep posters of right-wing
politicians, including Netanyahu, in their stalls. The same market
was the site of a bombing in September 1997, in which 16 Israelis
died.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and commentators called the events Friday a miracle.
But, the fact that so many escaped death could just as much be
attributed to keen reactions honed many times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   On the busiest shopping day of the week, bombers drove a red
Fiat just inside a pedestrian produce market at about 9:45 a.m.
(Israel Time) and apparently botched an attempt that could have
killed dozens.
</P>
<P>
   A small explosion, apparently accidental, and the shouts of
Israeli soldiers sent shoppers scurrying -- tripping over each
other -- toward stalls, and nooks in the market. Seconds later,
when a larger blast sent flames shooting from the car to the
awnings above, only the two bombers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses said soldiers, regularly posted in the market,
shot at the car, which had turned off the street into the narrow,
awning covered, path into the market.
</P>
<P>
   The bombers' bodies were left in pieces by the mangled car
wreckage and some of their flesh was blown against the walls. But,
no Israelis were killed and only about 20 were injured, almost all
lightly. Fruit and pastries just yards from the car were still
stacked neatly.
</P>
<P>
   Sigal Itchzer, a 28-year-old office worker, was hurrying to work
when a car let her cross the street against the light. Moments
later, the same car had pulled into the market and a small
explosion and puff of smoke came from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor guy,'' Itchzer said she thought at the time. ``I thought
his car broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   The next, more powerful blast, sent her to the hospital in shock
and with ear damage.
</P>
<P>
   Police blocked off the immediate area of the blast. Some
gathered to shout ``Death to the Arabs,'' heard often after
bombings. But shoppers resumed buying their fruit, vegetables and
pastries for the start of the Sabbath within a half-hour of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of gotten used to it,'' said Israeli Jacob Shaw,
25. ``Why not? That's life. You can't stop going out to buy food.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it appeared the bombing would not, by itself, cancel
the implementation of the peace agreement signed last month in
Washington. The agreement includes a withdrawal of Israeli troops
from some areas they occupy in the West Bank in return for
Palestinian commitments to fight anti-Israeli terrorists within
their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and his cabinet issued a statement saying they would
only consider ratifying the agreement once they see ``that the
(Palestinian Authority) is taking decisive steps in a determined
war on the terrorist organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question is, 'What are the Palestinians are going to
do?'' government spokesman Moshe Fogel said. He said, though, he
would not go as far as to say the peace agreement was in
``suspension.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders condemned the bombing. In recent days, after
an attempted bombing of two school buses in the Gaza Strip, Yasser
Arafat's security forces have been rounding up Hamas members and
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   But, it is unclear whether it was just part of the investigation
into the Gaza bombing, a charade for the Israelis and the United
States, or the start of a thorough effort to break Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by Friday afternoon, as shops closed and the streets
emptied for the start of the Sabbath, Israel's President Ezer
Weizman and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai were calling for the
peace agreement to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political scientist Barry Rubin, with Bar-Ilan
University in Tel Aviv, said there is little other alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the culmination of 50 years of history and both sides
need it,'' he said, adding that Netanyahu's hesitations over recent
days are because he returned from the peace talks to face more
right-wing opposition in Israel than he expected.

WHY CHRISTMAS WAITS UNTIL JANUARY  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill., Calif., Ga.)  (af) 
Mark Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, a
newsletter based in Alexandria, Va. His column on investment
strategies will appear every other week. E-mail:

 By MARK HULBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has all the makings of an investing whodunit. The so-called
January effect _ the tendency of small-capitalization stocks to
thrash their large-cap siblings in the first month of the year _
has occurred with such regularity over the last century that even
hard-nosed statisticians are impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, since 1926, small-cap stocks have returned five
percentage points more in January, on average, than large-cap
stocks. During the other months of the year, large caps have
outperformed small caps by a tiny amount.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that by now, researchers would have figured out the
exact cause of the January effect. But they haven't.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, investors who want to take advantage of the
phenomenon might think its explanation is irrelevant. Why not just
buy small caps on Dec. 31, sell them on Jan. 31 and be done with
it? Can't the philosophical debate be left to the ivory tower?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. The effect has become so accepted that unless there is
some strong, specific force that confines it to the first month of
the year, the effect should start occurring earlier and earlier _
before the new year even begins.
</P>
<P>
   That's because investors would start buying small caps sooner,
to beat others to the inevitable climb in prices. Over time, the
January effect would become the December effect, then the November
effect. Eventually, it would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, perhaps the most plausible explanation of the
January effect was the fact that many investors sell stocks to lock
in losses for tax purposes as the year winds to a close. Such
moves, the explanation goes, put intense downward pressure on the
relatively illiquid small-cap stocks, setting up the conditions for
a January rebound.
</P>
<P>
   But two economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Lucy
Ackert and George Athanassakos, recently wrote a working paper that
rejected this hypothesis. They discovered that the January effect
was a combination of two separate seasonal patterns: small-cap
strength as well as large-cap weakness. The tax-loss selling theory
really can't explain the latter.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is another hypothesis that can explain both
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Proposed over 10 years ago by two professors, Josef Lakonishok
of the University of Illinois and Robert Haugen of the University
of California at Irvine, it focuses on the practice of portfolio
hedging.
</P>
<P>
   Because most money managers receive performance-related bonuses
at year-end, many have an incentive to make their portfolios look
increasingly like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 as Dec. 31 approaches.
</P>
<P>
   A money manager whose portfolio is now outperforming the index,
for example, knows that he will receive a good bonus for beating
the market _ provided that he can hold on until year-end. So he
might aim to lock in his above-market performance by selling small
caps and buying the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   A manager who is lagging behind the market might do the same
thing, but for different reasons. As Dec. 31 nears, his desire to
take risks in order to bounce back is outweighed by another desire:
to not end the year at the bottom of the rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Come Jan. 1, however, the compensation slate of money managers
is wiped clean, and they are suddenly free to take risks again. So
they might dump many S&AMP;P 500 stocks they bought late in the
previous year and replace them with small caps.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that portfolio hedging is the cause of the
January effect is good news for those betting on it. As long as
managers continue to receive performance bonuses, the effect is
unlikely to either creep into December or to dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   But before deciding to make a short-term bet on the January
effect by buying a basket of small-cap stocks, investors should
remember that the difference between bid and ask prices on such
shares is typically high _ often 5 percent or more, versus 0.5
percent or less for large caps.
</P>
<P>
   That's a high hurdle for a short-term trade. A better tactic is
to buy a futures contract on a small-cap index like the Russell
2000 while shorting a large-cap index like the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from offering low commissions, the tactic is attractive
because it will make money even in a market decline, as long as
small caps don't fall as much as the S&AMP;P 500.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Low inflation, a driving force behind the nation's economic
boom, is having the perverse effect of making life harder for
millions of elderly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That is because increases in Social Security payments are based
on an inflation index _ the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage
Earners and Clerical Workers _ that may not accurately reflect
their expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that index, monthly Social Security payments will rise
an average of 1.3 percent next year. But the costs that drain the
resources of many retired people _ notably medical treatment,
prescription drugs and special housing _ are rising faster than
consumer prices in general.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the CPI-W, as the official index used to calculate
Social Security payments is called, or the more widely known
Consumer Price Index for urban consumers, designed to be an
accurate reflector of living costs for 80 percent of the
population, looks especially at needs of the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which calculates the
indexes, has devised an experimental index that does track some
spending habits of older Americans, and it has shown a widening gap
between cost increases for them and those for the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   Between December 1982 and September 1998, the experimental index
rose 73.9 percent while the official index rose 63.5 percent, said
Patrick Jackman, an economist at the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   And as inflation keeps a lid on Social Security payments, it
also reduces interest income from bonds and certificates of
deposit, the mainstay of many Americans' nest eggs. To retired
people, just a few dollars more or less a week can make a huge
difference in life style.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of seniors skimp on prescription medications, or they
don't eat well,'' said John Rother, director of legislation and
public policy for the American Association of Retired Persons.
``But this is a hidden phenomenon. It's not being discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Josephine Sayward, a retired bookkeeper from Fall River, Mass.,
said she was cutting back on daily blood-pressure and cholesterol
medications because Medicare doesn't cover the cost of prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I take all my prescriptions, it costs over $250 a month,''
said Mrs. Sayward, whose retirement benefits are about $12,400 a
year, most of it from Social Security and the rest from a small
pension. ``I told my doctor I'm going off several drugs because I
can't afford to buy them.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 increase in Social Security payments, the smallest rise
in 12 years, will average about $10 a month, raising the average
check for the nation's 44 million beneficiaries to $780 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But some costs for the elderly are often rising faster. Monthly
premiums deducted from Social Security checks for Medicare coverage
of doctors' office visits will rise by 3.9 percent, or $1.70, to
$45.50, in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And many prescription drug prices and deductibles for hospital
stays are climbing rapidly, while more health maintenance
organizations are cutting off Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The experimental index now being calculated by the statistics
bureau is really only a tweaking of the official index, and
statisticians say it is subject to more sampling errors.
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk, mostly from the AARP but also from some
members of Congress, of coming up with a well-designed and more
accurate index for calculating Social Security cost-of-living
increases. But no one in Congress is actively pushing for the
change, Rother said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackman of the statistics bureau said adjusting the payments
according to a more accurate index could end up costing the
government $40 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The official index ``is understating the true rate of inflation
for the elderly,'' said Dean Baker, an economist at the Economic
Policy Institute, an independent research organization in
Washington, and the disparity is likely to get worse over time.
</P>
<P>
   But Baker, the author of ``Getting Prices Right: The Battle Over
the Consumer Price Index'' (Economic Policy Institute, 1997), said
older people's higher spending for some goods and services was not
the only reason. The official index also considers price declines
for consumer goods that they rarely buy, like television sets and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress balks at the cost, he added, a separate CPI for
the elderly ``would be the way to go'' to correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sayward said higher medical costs would wipe out her
cost-of-living increase for next year, which she derided as ``so
slight, it's almost insignificant.'' Still, she was quick to point
out that she's better off than many other people. She considers
herself in pretty good health, and she owns the small two-bedroom
house where she has lived for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   A widow since 1978, she has four grown children she can call for
help in an emergency, though she doesn't want to resort to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all have kids,'' she said. ``Five are in college, and
there are three more to go.''
</P>
<P>
   So she skimps where she can to save for unexpected costs. A
recent ear infection required antibiotic drops that cost $28 for a
week's supply, she said, not including the $5 she paid to see a
doctor to get the prescription.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my food budget,'' she said. ``Does that mean I don't
eat that week?''
</P>
<P>
   She won't even think about buying new furniture or appliances.
She fills her free time largely doing volunteer work. ``That
becomes my entertainment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she is not about to take up the advice of Rother, who urges
older people who are in need to apply for food stamps, low-income
energy assistance, Supplemental Security Income and senior housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never asked for charity, and I really don't want to start
now,'' Mrs. Sayward said. She feels that her Social Security
payments should meet her needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my country owes me what it promised: to take care of
my health needs, to keep a roof over my head and to put food in my
belly,'' she said. ``If there ever comes a time when I can't pay my
way, I hope they legalize euthanasia.''

REVENGE OF THE INSURED  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Rhonda D. Orin is a partner at Anderson Kill &AMP; Olick, a New York
law firm. 
 By RHONDA D. ORIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many people have at least two jobs. One is doing whatever they
do all day; the other is fighting their insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   My situation is even worse than most. My first job is also
fighting with insurers. I'm a lawyer who represents corporate
policyholders in coverage disputes, often with millions of dollars
at stake. I'm also the mother of three sons, ages 2 to 10, who do
things like fall on rocks and break out in high fevers at 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   I am still fighting a yearlong fight with my health insurer over
our 1997 family deductible. The amount was supposedly $750, but our
insurer decided to keep nearly twice that much. After noticing the
problem last November, I gathered a year's worth of files and
prepared for frustration.
</P>
<P>
   First, I spoke to a reasonably nice female voice somewhere in
New Hampshire, who assured me we were owed about $600. She gave me
a claim number and told me to wait for the check. No check came, so
I called back in December. A male voice in New Jersey verified the
claim number, told me to keep waiting and wished me a happy
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The winter passed. I called again. I was told the order couldn't
be reprocessed because something called the ``accumulator'' had
been broken since October. Until it was fixed, no one could help me
or the million others with similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   The accumulator, apparently, is a computer at my insurer that
accumulates my money in its bank accounts. No wonder it wasn't
being fixed. Sometime in March, after much carrying-on, the company
finally started reprocessing my claims. The last payment was
approved in July. I'm still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   As a veteran of such wars, I have accumulated the following
techniques for fighting back at insurers: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KEEP RECORDS Make copies of everything, because sending
something to your insurance company is like tossing it in the
trash. Note every code number and the name of every person you talk
to.
</P>
<P>
   You will need this information, because after you get through
the automated phone system, wait on hold, explain your problem to a
series of baffled supervisors and hear their promise that it will
be fixed within a few weeks, they hang up, go to lunch and forget
they ever knew you. To get anything done, you need to prove you
have called or written many times before. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOLLOW UP ON CLAIMS A favorite tactic of insurers seems to be to
ignore claims. Every year, I find that no action has been taken on
some of my claims while amazing things have happened to others: The
company sends duplicate checks, for example, to doctors whom I
already have paid in full. If you persist, chances are you'll wear
the company down. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION EVERYTHING An insurer may reject a claim as being
``above the usual and customary charges.'' Well, maybe it is and
maybe it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Once, I got sick of this game and decided to fight. I needed a
special test for a pregnancy and assumed that the company would
reject the bill as too high. I priced this procedure, a chorionic
villus sampling, or CVS, at every location in my area and found
that prices varied by $800; I selected the cheapest place. The
insurer immediately rejected part of my claim, and I was loaded for
bear.
</P>
<P>
   I asked what the usual and customary charge was. I was told it
was confidential. I asked how the charge was calculated. Same
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Then I shared my research and dared the insurer to find a
cheaper place. The truth came out. The insurer explained that it
had compared the fee for the mandatory counseling concerning this
test, which involves a life-and-death decision about whether to
terminate a pregnancy, with an ordinary office visit involving,
say, a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, because all office visits take place in an office,
the insurer thinks they should cost the same. (The insurer and my
doctor worked it out, so I guess I won.)
</P>
<P>
   It's your duty to protect yourself against the broken
accumulators of the insurance world. So, congratulations on your
new job. The hours will be long. There is no salary. And of course,
the benefits are lousy.

</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (5): F Peppi Browne, F Payton Black, C
Michele VanGorp, G Nicole Erickson, G Hilary Howard.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomer: G Krista Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Blue Devils, coming off the best finish in school
history, have five starters back to make another push toward the
Final Four, although preseason injuries have taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   2. VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 19-10, lost to Arizona in second round of NCAA East
Region.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): F DeMya Walker, C Lisa Hosac, G Erin
Stovall.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomer: F Svetlana Volnaya.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The healthy return of F Monick Foote and G Tiffany
Bower, who missed last season with injuries, would do wonders for
Virginia, which relies heavily on Walker.
</P>
<P>
   3. NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 27-7, lost to Tennessee in NCAA Mideast Region
finals.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Last year: 25-8, lost to Louisiana Tech in NCAA Sweet 16.
</P>

<P>
   Top newcomers: F Datishella Byrd, G Amirah Leonard.

backcourt duo for Clemson, which has added several junior-college
prospects to a perennially unsung lineup.
</P>
<P>
   5. N.C. STATE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 25-7, lost to Louisiana Tech in NCAA Final Four.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G/F LySchale Jones, G Tynesha Lewis, G
Kristen Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Kim Smith, G Daphne Hutcherson.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Wolfpack, which reached the Final Four in a
surprise, moves on without ACC player of the year Chasity Melvin
and will need reserve C Summer Erb to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   6. MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 15-13, no postseason.
</P>
<P>

Tiffany Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Marche Strickland, F Deedee Warley.
</P>
<P>

project even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   7. FLORIDA STATE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 9-18, no postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Sue Semrau, 9-18 in one season at Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): F Brooke Wyckoff, F Latavia Coleman, G
Jen Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G April Traylor, F Tamara Gracey.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   8. GEORGIA TECH
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 11-17, no postseason.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Last year: 4-23, no postseason.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    ACC ready to challenge for title of best league
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After getting as close as anyone did to Tennessee last season,
North Carolina coach Sylvia Hatchell is more than eager to renew
her belief that the ACC has no equal in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Guffaws from the SEC usually ensue upon hearing such an
assertion, but Hatchell doesn't seem to mind. UNC had the mighty
Lady Volunteers on the ropes in the Mideast Region finals last
March before fading away in the final minutes in a 76-70 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like our league is the best league,'' said Hatchell,
who earned the ACC's first and only national championship in 1994.
``We had three teams with a chance to get to the Final Four. If you
take Tennessee out of the SEC, is there any question?''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the problem. While Carolina couldn't hold on against
Tennessee, Duke was losing to Arkansas in another Elite 8 matchup.
North Carolina State did earn its first Final-Four trip with a win
over Connecticut but had to go solo.
</P>
<P>
   The ACC has a history of coming close. Getting over that hump
and putting multiple teams in the Final Four _ something SEC
schools have done six times _ remain elusive. This season, at least
five teams should make another stab at NCAA success, and all of
them have the possibility of earning a spot in the Final Four in
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite
</P>
<P>
   A rash of preseason injuries _ including three starters _ has
hurt Duke early, but the Blue Devils should be able to prevail, if
everyone gets healthy. Freshman guard Krista Gingrich could vie for
time in a strong backcourt. Payton Black and Michele VanGorp
present a formidable front line, and Peppi Browne adds a versatile
athletic dimension.
</P>
<P>
   The darkhorse
</P>
<P>
   Clemson plucked five junior-college players to join guards Amy
Geren and Itoro Umoh. Also back from a plentiful rotation are
frontline players Nikki Blassingame, Erin Batth and Natasha
Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   The dividends of reaching the Final Four usually are returned
quickly on the recruiting trail, where N.C. State has verbal
commitments from four top prep stars, including 6-foot-3 center
Kaayla Chones, daughter of former NBA player Jim Chones. Coach Kay
Yow has just one senior this season, so the Wolfpack future appears
to be bright.
</P>
<P>
   Team on the decline
</P>
<P>
   Maryland has gone to the NCAAs just once in the last five years,
but the school has stuck with veteran coach Chris Weller, whom some
players wanted out a year ago. She insists her newcomers are her
best in some time; they must be, to help stop the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the year
</P>
<P>
   Clemson's name rarely shows up among the top recruiting groups,
but Jim Davis works wonders with role players, JUCO transfers and a
dizzying rotation that would make Dean Smith proud. If he can
integrate JC All-Americans Datishella Byrd and Joanie Mungro into
his lineup, the Lady Tigers might be headed for another big year.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer of the year
</P>
<P>
   Niesha Butler owns the New York City high-school career scoring
record, and Georgia Tech will need her to generate offense while
the Lady Jackets rebuild after finishing 11-17. She's got flair and
exuberance and already is forcing Tech into more of an up-tempo
style.

 &HT;    Clark Atlanta University will field a battle-tested squad
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lady Panthers of Clark Atlanta took a memorable ride through
the postseason eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
   After winning an SIAC tournament play-in game, coach Anglelyne
Brown's team defeated LeMoyne Owen by 21 in the quarterfinals and
shocked top-seeded Fort Valley State 77-75. Then, a two-point,
tear-jerker loss to Albany State in the finals ended Clark
Atlanta's 20-win season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to make another run for the championship,'' Brown
said. ``Only this time, we plan to get over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   In working toward that end, four starters from last year's team
return. Kisha Farmer of Palmetto, a three-year starter, averaged 11
points and 7 rebounds as a junior. Sophomore Kisha Burns averaged
12 points and 6 boards a game. The other two are Lauisha Rucker and
Sh'Mika Elder.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has 11 game-tested players on the roster, and she plans to
use them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Balance. That's what we try to achieve,'' she said. ``We want
to have balanced scoring, so no one will be able to concentrate on
any one or two players.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the tallest player was 5-feet-10. The Lady Panthers
were able to compensate for the lack of size with their quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've filled our needs (in the post),'' Brown said.
``We're going to have some surprises.''
</P>
<P>
   MORRIS BROWN: The Wolverines, who disappointed themselves by
finishing 17-10 in coach Phil Wallace's second year, have two
starters back. But Wallace, with 11 new faces on the team,
including nine freshman, plans to start neither leading scorer
Kasha Doomes nor low-post force Shantel Reddick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five of (the freshmen) are impact players, and as many as
three of them may start,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   The possible freshmen starters are Lee Gloyd, a 6-foot-0 forward
from Beach High in Savannah; Jennifer Wilcoxson, a 5-foot-9 guard
from Atlanta's Southside High; and 6-foot-2 post player Latonya
Sherman from Hampton, Va.
</P>
<P>
   One transfer expected to play a lot is 5-foot-7 point guard
Keisha Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to strengthen our bench,'' Wallace said. ``With so
many young players, we want to have our seniors coming of the bench
to give us a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace thinks the Wolverines will have as much talent this
season as any team in the SIAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only advantage any of them have on us now is continuity,''
Wallace said, ``since they have players who have been together for
a while.''

 &HT;    Tech to have tough time in conference
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not where Agnus Berenato wanted her Georgia Tech program
to be as she begins her 11th season on the job. An 11-17 finish
(3-13 in the ACC), her poorest since taking over for sister
Bernadette McGlade, was the best a decorated group of seniors could
achieve in an increasingly rugged conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a disappointment, because I had some seniors I was
really counting on,'' Berenato said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's got to start over with newcomers who have plenty of
spunk but neither the size nor the experience to match up with ACC
powers Duke, North Carolina, N.C. State, Virginia and Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Berenato is shaking up the way she does business.
She has thrown out a plodding, half-court style for an up-tempo
pace that will take advantage of some decent quickness and a
talented group of guards.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tech's needs up front are so great _ 6-foot-1 senior
Kenya Williams will be playing her third season in a row at power
forward, with little-used soph Candice McCallum the starter in the
middle at only 6-foot-1 _ that she's studiously avoiding a
half-court game as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like not to have to do that,'' Berenato said. ``I
don't think we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to making everything go is 5-foot-11 sophomore swing
player Regina Tate, who started the final 12 games of the season
and who, Berenato claims, can ``make everyone forget Kisha Ford,''
Tech's all-time leading scorer who now plays in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   But Tate, a two-time state high-jump champion at Shaw High in
Columbus and an all-ACC high-jumper last year, only averaged 5
points a game as a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be as tough as people think,'' Tate said.
``I think we could surprise some people.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman guard Niesha Butler, who broke Kenny Anderson's
high-school scoring records in New York City, is expected to join
Ashley Ebert in an all-rookie backcourt that has some promise but
will be thrown into the fray early against some top-notch ACC guard
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Backcourt
</P>
<P>
   Youth abounds, with Butler, Ebert and Millie Martinez, another
frosh. Junior Danielle Donehew is the veteran, along with soph
Betsy Foy and JUCO transfer Candi Fails. All of them should see
plenty of time, injuries permitting, in Berenato's fast-paced
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Frontcourt
</P>
<P>
   Tech has the smallest front line in the ACC, and when you take
out Williams, it's not very experienced. Aisha Howard, a talented
but thin 6-foot-3 soph, is being redshirted, leaving McCallum as
the only ``big'' body. Tate and Jamie Kruppa might see some action
in the low post, in rotation with Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Strengths
</P>
<P>
   Lots of quickness and a heavy dose of enthusiasm from the
newcomers. Williams has come back in superb physical shape and is a
quiet leader. Butler will struggle but has as much promise as any
guard Tech has had.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses
</P>
<P>
   In the ACC, 6-foot-1 point guards are becoming the norm, as are
6-foot-4 post players. Tech can't come close to either. The Lady
Jackets are extremely small, and only Williams and Donehew are
upperclassmen with considerable playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Final analysis
</P>
<P>
   Tech lost some serious ground last year in falling to eighth
place with a senior-oriented lineup. Given their youth and lack of
size and the improving quality of the ACC, moving up the ladder
looks like an especially tough order.

 &HT;    GSU shooting for NCAA bid
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After nearly tasting an NCAA Tournament berth in March, Georgia
State women's coach Lea Henry is ready to feast off what she has
toiled to put together for the past four years. And not just
because Florida International, the dominating force in the Trans
America Athletic Conference for several years, has moved on.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Panthers lost to FIU in the TAAC tournament final last
season, confounding their preseason seventh place projection and
ending up with a 17-11 record. Henry, who has all five starters and
several reserves back, suddenly finds her team the target after FIU
went to the Sun Belt Conference a year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   As host of the TAAC women's tourney this season, GSU understands
the realities of existing in a conference that normally gets just
one NCAA bid. If you don't win the tourney, you stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good pressure to be in this position,'' Henry said. ``But
it doesn't matter if you're No. 1 before the season. We want to be
holding that conference trophy in March.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry's fifth season at GSU could be the first that the Lady
Panthers go to the NCAAs. They've been projected to do just that by
other league coaches, who are glad to see more balanced competition
in the TAAC.After losing just twice in the last three seasons,
FIU's early departure was spurred in large part by a No. 7 seed in
the NCAAs after it had been ranked all season. The TAAC's low
conference power rating had a lot to do with that.
</P>
<P>
   The offseason regimen by GSU center Christine James is expected
to help immensely. The beefy 6-3 senior reported in much better
shape. She scored 14.4 points and pulled down 7.8 rebounds to lead
the team in both categories last season, but Henry wants more
consistency out of her.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore forward Leslie McElrath blossomed immediately,
averaging 13.3 points and earning the TAAC newcomer-of-the-year
award. Point guard July Mehaffey is a seasoned senior who should
benefit from the backup play of Marica Maddox, a freshman from
Gainesville. Also helping push the tempo is 6-0 redshirt freshman
guard Rene Hines, who is coming off a knee injury and probably will
see duty up front as well.
</P>
<P>
   Montrine Thomas and Ginny Brown are veteran, unsung starters who
round out a versatile attack. Guard Carmelia Layog and center
Lawana Johnson are usually the first two off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got nice talent, nice depth all around,'' Henry said.
</P>
<P>
   GSU has improved its non-conference schedule, hosting Conference
USA champion Memphis in a December tournament and taking on Georgia
Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we can beat anybody if we're playing well enough,''
Henry said. ``But the bottom line is we know what we have to do in
March, and we've got to be ready to handle it.''

   FIVE QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Seems like we just got back from San Antonio after watching
Tubby Smith (left) and his Kentucky Wildcats cut down the nets at
the Alamo Dome. On the verge of another college basketball season,
we wonder:
</P>
<P>
   -- What will Smith do for an encore? In his first season as
Kentucky's coach, Smith exceeded all expectations and won a
national championship with a team that was greater than the sum of
its parts. What will this guy do when he really gets some players?
</P>
<P>
   -- From 1986 through 1994, Duke was college basketball's most
consistent winner, with seven Final Four appearances and two
national championships. Kentucky kept Coach K and the boys out of
San Antonio last March. Will this be the season the Blue Devils
finally get back to the top?
</P>
<P>
   -- Stanford was a lot of fun to watch as a surprise team. But
will Arthur Lee and company fare as well now that everybody is
gunning for them?
</P>
<P>
   -- Who will be this year's Valparaiso? The Crusaders were the
feel-good story of the 1998 tournament, as Homer Drew and son Bryce
went to the Sweet 16. The hope of another Cinderella is the thing
that keeps bringing us back to the sport each season.
</P>
<P>
   -- Year 1 of the post-Dean Smith era at North Carolina resulted
in a 34-4 season and another trip to the Final Four. With the
departures of Antawn Jamison and Vince Carter, what will Year 2 be
like for Bill Guthridge and the Tar Heels?
</P>
<P>
   Those are just a few of the questions to be answered between now
and when we gather in St. Petersburg on March 27 for the Final
Four.
</P>
<P>
   ONE MAN'S OPINION
</P>
<P>
   If you're filling out an early bracket, keep these teams in
mind:
</P>
<P>
   Sweet 16: Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, Utah, Temple,
Rhode Island, Maryland, New Mexico, Washington, Xavier, Kentucky,
UMass, Stanford, Duke, UConn, Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   Elite Eight: Kentucky, Arkansas, Xavier, UMass, Duke, Michigan
State, UConn, Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Final Four: Duke, Kentucky, Michigan State, UConn.
</P>
<P>
   National champion: Duke.
</P>
<P>
   OVER-RATED TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   More hype than substance. Last year's record in parentheses:
</P>
<P>
   1. Washington (20-10): Some people have the Huskies reaching the
Elite Eight, but it says here they will finish third in the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kansas (35-4): The whole world has the Jayhawks penciled in
for the Sweet 16 or higher. But these guys couldn't get to the
Sweet 16 when they had Raef LaFrentz and Paul Pierce. Another early
exit for Roy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   3. Indiana (20-12): The Hoosiers finally won an NCAA Tournament
game last season, their first since 1994. It's one and out for
Bobby Knight's club this time.
</P>
<P>
   4. Cincinnati (27-6): Bob Huggins' (above) team is ranked No. 15
in the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll. The Bearcats are not that
good. A lot of unknown players are going to have to step up
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   5. Maryland (21-11): The Terps are going to be pretty good with
a nice mix of players led by LaRon Profit. But they are not the No.
5 team in the nation, as the coaches' poll would suggest. Sweet 16
maybe, but not Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   UNDER-RATED TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   More substance than hype:
</P>
<P>
   1. Xavier (22-8): The Musketeers haven't lost two in a row over
the past two seasons. A good combination of old and young players,
capable of reaching the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   2. UMass (21-11): The Minutemen haven't recaptured the
excitement of the John Calipari era, but Bruiser Flint, 33, has
done a very good job. A huge front line, led by Lari Ketner, gives
them a chance.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rhode Island (25-9): The Rams blew a chance at the Final Four
last year but will make another run at it, if Lamar Odom comes in
and gets his act together.
</P>
<P>
   4. Purdue (28-8): After losing Brad Miller and Chad Austin, the
Boilermakers will have some growing up to do. Gene Keady has his
problems in the postseason, but he knows how to build teams for the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   5. Arkansas (24-9): Nolan Richardson hit the road recruiting and
has some serious talent in Fayetteville again. Trust us: You don't
want to play these guys at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   BEST GAME COACHES
</P>
<P>
   Guys who come through when the heat is on:
</P>
<P>
   1. Tubby Smith, Kentucky: His performance in last year's NCAA
Tournament was the best coaching effort since Jim Valvano in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mike Krzyzewski, Duke: When the game is on the line, Coach K
convinces his players that they will win. And most of the time,
they do.
</P>
<P>
   3. Rick Majerus (left), Utah: Knows better than anyone how to
feel the pulse of his team during the course of a game.
</P>
<P>
   4. Denny Crum, Louisville: When he's got the guns, one of the
best, come tournament time.
</P>
<P>
   5. Nolan Richardson, Arkansas: The more the pressure's on, the
better he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   PLAYERS YOU'D DRIVE TO SEE
</P>
<P>
   1. Mateen Cleaves, guard, Michigan State: The best money player
in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   2. Andre Miller, guard, Utah: Silky smooth. Almost impossible to
stop when he goes down the lane.
</P>
<P>
   3. Khalid El-Amin, guard, UConn: Richard Hamilton's the star,
but this guy is the glue that holds the Huskies together.
</P>
<P>
   4. Ed Cota, guard, North Carolina: Toys with opposing defenses
and almost always gives the ball to a teammate in position to
score.
</P>
<P>
   5. Trajan Langdon, guard, Duke: One of the game's best
three-point shooters, particularly when the pressure's on.
</P>
<P>
   TOP CONFERENCES
</P>
<P>
   1. ACC: Duke, Maryland and North Carolina all are in the
preseason top 12.
</P>
<P>
   2. Pac-10: Stanford is good enough to win the national
championship. UCLA, Washington and Arizona will make some noise.
</P>
<P>
   3. Atlantic 10: Temple, UMass, Rhode Island and Xavier all will
be in the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   4. SEC: Kentucky is the defending national champion, but right
behind is improved Tennessee. Arkansas could be the surprise of the
league.
</P>
<P>
   5. Big Ten: Michigan State is the class of the field, but Purdue
and Indiana will keep things interesting.
</P>
<P>
   GAMES TO WATCH
</P>
<P>
   The regular season's toughest tickets:
</P>
<P>
   1. Duke vs. Kentucky, Dec. 22: A rematch of last March's
Southeast Region final, when the Wildcats rallied to beat the Blue
Devils 86-84 in St. Petersburg. They'll meet in the Jimmy V Classic
at East Rutherford, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   2. Duke vs. Michigan State, Dec. 2: Both teams are ranked in the
preseason top five and both are projected for the Final Four. Top
guards Mateen Cleaves and Trajan Langdon meet in the Great Eight at
Chicago's United Center.
</P>
<P>
   3. Kansas vs. Kentucky, Dec. 3: When it comes to tradition, it
doesn't get any better than this game, also in the Great Eight.
</P>
<P>
   4. Duke vs. North Carolina, at Duke Jan. 27, at Chapel Hill Feb.
27: This Tobacco Road battle never changes. It is the most intense
rivalry in college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   5. Stanford vs. UCLA, Jan. 16 at UCLA, Feb. 11 at Stanford: If
UCLA's Baron Davis can come back from a severe knee injury, he will
help one of the most highly touted freshman classes since
Michigan's Fab Five. These two games might determine the best of
the West.

 &HT;    MEN'S TOP 25 PREDICTIONS
 &HT;    FOR USE WITH AJC BASKETBALL PREVIEW PACKAGE
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By MARK BRADLEY
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. DUKE
</P>
<P>
   Steve Wojciechowski is gone. That, contrary to popular belief,
is a plus. William Avery, a sophomore, takes over at the point and
will make Duke better than Wojo ever could. Trajan Langdon is a
dangerous, if spotty, shooter. Elton Brand is the best post-up
player on any campus.
</P>
<P>
   2. STANFORD
</P>
<P>
   Quick little guards out front, big plodders underneath,
identical twins on the bench. Center Tim Young gets knocked for
being too docile. Power forward Mark Madsen, known as Mad Dog, does
not. Point guard Arthur Lee took over for Brevin Knight last season
and took Stanford even farther.
</P>
<P>
   3. MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   In Gary Williams' frenetic system, a slew of Terps run around
with none really sticking out. Joe Smith was the exception that
proved the rule. Now comes another _ JUCO transfer Steve Francis,
who figures to give Maryland the dexterity at point guard that
Terrell Stokes hasn't. Center Obinna Ekezie is an inside force.
</P>
<P>
   4. UCLA
</P>
<P>
   The ACC gets the big ink and teams from the SEC keep winning
national championships, but the Pac-10 might play better hoops than
any conference. The Bruins finally lost their longstanding nucleus
_ Toby Bailey, J.R. Henderson, Kris Johnson _ but welcome a
splendid freshman class. Dutchman Dan Gadzuric might be the best
UCLA center since Bill Walton. JaRon Rush seems a prototypical
small forward.
</P>
<P>
   5. CONNECTICUT
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people are betting that this is the season UConn
finally reaches the Final Four _ five starters back, big names all
around, an accomplished coach in Jim Calhoun. Look closer, though,
and you'll see the Huskies are all perimeter, essentially deploying
three guards. Granted, they're good guards. Khalid El-Amin is a
squatty and savvy point man, Ricky Moore a dauntless defender,
Richard Hamilton the reigning Big East player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   6. TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   No, not the UT women. The men.. Freed from Kevin O'Neill's
grind-it-out system, the Vols made the NCAA Tournament under Jerry
Green for the first time in the '90s. Now add two pieces to that
young and gifted squad _ forceful center Charles Hathaway, who
missed all but five games with a blood clot, and the heralded
recruit Vincent Yarbrough.
</P>
<P>
   7. KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   The defending champ has some holes. The 'Cats would have nothing
to defend if Jeff Sheppard hadn't had the month of his life, and
there's no holdover who seems cut from Sheppard's cloth. Much
depends on freshman Tayshaun Prince, a small forward about whom
recruiting analysts disagree. Point guard Wayne Turner made a few
more jumpers last season, and Scott Padgett showed an inside game
to offset his outside shot.
</P>
<P>
   8. UTAH
</P>
<P>
   Best point guard in the country? He's Andre Miller, who nearly
lifted the Utes to an astonishing national championship. A standout
turn in the summer Goodwill Games only augmented his reputation.
This season's designated Ute-down-low will be Hanno Mottola, who
isn't as strong as Michael Doleac or as gifted as Keith Van Horn
but who's good enough to balance Miller's thrusts.
</P>
<P>
   9. CINCINNATI
</P>
<P>
   This is one of those ``effort'' programs. In those years when
the Bearcats buy into Bob Huggins' prodding and play all-out,
they're very good. In those years _ such as 1996-97 _ when they
worry about who's getting the shots, they aren't. There are no big
names here, no Danny Fortsons or Nick Van Exels. There are,
however, a bunch of willing workers, chief among them the
high-bounding Melvin Levett and Kenyon Martin.
</P>
<P>
   10. MICHIGAN STATE
</P>
<P>
   Such is the depleted state of the Big Ten that the league title
was taken by a team with only one standout. Five starters return,
but point guard Mateen Cleaves is really the reason to watch.
Everything begins with him. In many ways the Spartans resemble
themselves circa 1990, when Steve Smith dazzled but nobody else
left an imprint.
</P>
<P>
   11. NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Antawn Jamison, Vince Carter and Shammond Williams left without
an NCAA title, which is really the only measure of a program this
exalted. By the time Jason Capel and Ronald Curry are done, they
might have one. Capel, brother of former Dukie Jeff, and Curry,
already pressed into service as Carolina's starting quarterback,
are freshmen who know one another well, having played on the same
AAU team.
</P>
<P>
   12. OKLAHOMA STATE
</P>
<P>
   Seasons change, but Eddie Sutton endures. What worked at
Arkansas in the '70s works for him still. Give Sutton some guards
and he'll win. This time he has three _ Adrian Peterson, the
Cowboys' leading scorer last year; Doug Gottlieb, a non-scoring
assists man; and Joe Adkins, an outside shooter. The second
semester will bring a fourth guard in Arkansas transfer Glendon
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   13. ARIZONA
</P>
<P>
   No Mike Bibby. No Miles Simon. No Michael Dickerson. Which isn't
to say there's no hope. The three players who served as the Wildcat
bench during the title run of 1997 _ Jason Terry, Eugene Edgerson
and Donnell Harris -- now become starters. For two years, center
A.J. Bramlett looked good in a supporting role. Now he gets to be
the star, and he's quick enough and skilled enough to handle it.
</P>
<P>
   14. TEMPLE
</P>
<P>
   The Owls' matchup zone and regimented offense provide both a
floor and a ceiling. Temple is never ever bad, but neither is it
quite as good as sometimes seems possible. Mark Karcher, a Prop
48er, joins Rasheed Brokenborough to form what could be the best
jump-shooting tandem in America, but certain Owls have a way of
losing their touch. (Think Mark Macon. Think Brokenborough last
season.)
</P>
<P>
   15. ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks have receded since 1995, slipping behind first
Mississippi State and then Ole Miss in the SEC West. Time for a Hog
revival. The incumbent guards form a nice partnership: Kareem Reid
penetrates and Pat Bradley shoots. Forward Derek Hood is a splendid
talent who hasn't been quite as good as advertised. Three freshmen
_ guards Brandon Dean and Jason Gilbert. plus wing Chris Jeffries _
figure to fit into Nolan Richardson's rotation immediately.
</P>
<P>
   16. NEW MEXICO
</P>
<P>
   Center Kenny Thomas is back, but not just yet. He'll sit out the
first semester because of a dispute over high school core courses _
which sounds sort of funny, Thomas being a college senior. He's a
powerful player who would inspire raves if he played, say, in the
ACC. As it is, Thomas gets labeled as one of those big WAC scorers
who pummel lesser opposition but fizzle come the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   17. WAKE FOREST
</P>
<P>
   Post-Tim Duncan, the Demon Deacons' hub was supposed to be
center Loren Woods. Didn't work out that way. Woods left the team
midway through last season and has transferred to Arizona; he's
sitting out this season. But Wake averted what might have been a
sad season by turning to a slew of earnest freshmen, the best of
whom, guard Robert O'Kelley, was named the ACC's top rookie.
</P>
<P>
   18. MEMPHIS
</P>
<P>
   This proud program was in disarray when favorite son Larry Finch
stepped down. New coach Tic Price, beginning his second season,
already has begun to set things right. The Tigers figure to have a
superb frontcourt. The 6-6 Omar Sneed averaged 20 points last
season and recalls Charles Barkley. Jermaine Ousley had back pain
eased by offseason surgery. Paris London is a high school
All-American who chose to stay and play for the hometown
university.
</P>
<P>
   19. PURDUE
</P>
<P>
   No big names here, unless you count coach Gene Keady. If the
basketball season ended on March 1, Keady would be regarded as the
best coach in the land. Nobody does better regular-season work.
Last year's team came within a game of giving Keady a fourth
consecutive Big Ten title. Brad Miller and Chad Austin are gone,
but the frantic Brian Cardinal returns.
</P>
<P>
   20. KANSAS
</P>
<P>
   Another March, another tearful Jayhawks exit. Kansas couldn't
win it all with All-Americans Raef LaFrentz and Paul Pierce, now
gone. Two things are working for this latest batch of Jayhawks:
(1.) Lowered expectations, and (2.) the expertise of Roy Williams.
The Carolina-style system, which Williams absorbed under Dean
Smith, may keep a gifted team from the highest heights, but it
tends to blend lesser talents into a nicely functioning whole.
</P>
<P>
   21. WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Huskies as Stanford Lite _ almost as big, almost as
good. Center Todd MacCulloch, a Canadian, has led this nation in
field-goal percentage two seasons running. Freshman Marlon Shelton,
the son of former Seattle SuperSonic Lonnie, weighs 260 pounds and
should start soon. Point guard Donald Watts, the son of former
Sonic Slick, had a big NCAA Tournament and is U-Dub's best
all-around player. Deon Luton supplements Watts' drives with
outside shooting.
</P>
<P>
   22. XAVIER
</P>
<P>
   Even at 22-8, the Musketeers disappointed slightly last season,
peaking with an early-season defeat of crosstown foe Cincinnati,
losing to Washington in Round 1 of the NCAAs. For a decade, this
consistently good program has turned recruits of modest portfolio
into something approaching stars. Now Xavier boasts its biggest
signee, maybe ever. He's Lloyd Price, a 6-5 wing from that prep
school pipeline Oak Hill Academy.
</P>
<P>
   23. AUBURN
</P>
<P>
   Four starters return, but they're not the news here. This
recruiting class, ranked as high as sixth-best nationally, has
created a buzz about Tiger basketball not felt since the heyday of
Sonny Smith. So deep is the new group _ six freshmen and a JUCO
transfer _ that opinions vary as to who'll help the most. Some say
forward David Hamilton. Others point to Mack McGadney, who spurned
Indiana. Still others figure power forward Chris Porter, a JUCO
All-American last season.
</P>
<P>
   24. MURRAY STATE
</P>
<P>
   At 61, Tevester Anderson finally gets to be a collegiate head
coach. The former Georgia and Auburn assistant was promoted when
Mark Gottfried left Murray to take the Alabama job. In Year 1 under
Anderson, the Racers move into a new arena, the Regional Special
Events Center, and they figure to pack the 8,500 seats. Marlon
Towns, a JUCO transfer by way of Arkansas, stands to be this year's
designated scorer. Anderson has waited a long time for this chance.
He won't waste it.
</P>
<P>
   25. RHODE ISLAND
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley and Tyson Wheeler, the guards who lifted the
Minutemen within a minute of the Final Four, are gone. No matter.
The wayfaring New Yorker Lamar Odom, who signed with UNLV but never
played there, is eligible. The 6-10 Odom, rated No. 2 to Tracy
McGrady among high school seniors of 1997, declared for the NBA
draft but recanted. Now he's in New England with Jim Harrick, who
has been around a bit himself.

 &HT;    GEORGIA WOMEN'S STORY FOR COLLEGE BASKETBALL SECTION

</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    Georgia looking `good'
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a couple of weeks in the summer, when it looked as if Andy
Landers might be packing his bags for the WNBA, the man who started
the Georgia women's program from scratch was taking deep stock of
the last 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   His first formal interview anywhere since arriving in Athens in
the spring of 1979 turned heads in women's basketball circles. The
Minnesota Timberwolves, who will unveil a WNBA franchise next
summer, wanted to hire a high-profile coach. And Landers listened.
Intently. Especially to his own inner drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process re-energized me. I got up there, and I
really liked it,'' he said. ``But the more time I took thinking
about it, the more I thought about why I was at Georgia to begin
with, and the more the pendulum swung.''
</P>
<P>
   And with his Lady Bulldogs returning all but three regulars to a
17-11 team that struggled with freshmen and still reached the first
round of the NCAA Tournament, Landers has all the exuberance of a
child opening a birthday gift. After surviving what he has called
``my worst year ever as a coach,'' he sees this group getting on
track soon to vie for the national championship that has eluded
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna be good. We're gonna be gooooood,'' he says. ``All
we've got to do is stay healthy, and we're gonna be pretty doggone
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all of Landers' accomplishments, he still must operate
in the shadows of the Tennessee juggernaut, seeking a
fourth-straight NCAA championship and gaining considerable national
media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't bother me,'' he said. ``I just wish we didn't
have to keep telling people how good we've been.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia keeps pace with Tennessee, Connecticut, Louisiana Tech
and Stanford as well as anyone. Landers continues to snare
impressive high-school talent; 6-4 freshman center Tawana McDonald
could end up surpassing the exploits of Katrina McClain and Janet
Harris.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't delve into why he talked to Minnesota, but the lack
of strong attendance and promotions at Georgia have been a
long-standing sore spot. For all their success _ four Final Four
trips, six SEC titles and an illustrious cast of All-Americans and
Olympians _ the Lady Dogs play before sparse crowds in Athens,
averaging around 2,500. Those are drawbacks in recruiting in an age
of better attendance and more televised women's games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Landers views his 20th season as a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surrounded by good people here,'' he said. ``We have a
great program and we want to win a national championship. That's
just as important to me today as it was when I got here 19 years
ago. I mean, what else is there?''
</P>
<P>
   Backcourt
</P>
<P>
   More than half the roster is made up of guards and swing
players, and Georgia will employ a three-guard set once again.
Twins and leading scorers Kelly and Coco Miller were thrust into
starting roles as freshmen and struggled. They've matured and have
more help. Kiesha Brown, who has played just eight games in two
years because of knee problems, finally is healthy. Pam Irwin is
the team's lone senior. Fleet sophomore Deana Nolan is trying to
gain eligibility at the semester break, and frosh Camille Murphy is
extremely quick.
</P>
<P>
   Frontcourt
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, whom Landers thinks can be one of his best post
players ever, has earned a spot down low, with soph Elena
Vishniakova joining her at power forward. Angie Ball had some solid
moments last year, and JUCO transfer Shavonda Willis can play
Georgia's up-tempo style. Starter Diana Lott was dismissed, and
Tawnya Nash left for personal reasons. Cormisha Cotton, who missed
last season because of pregnancy, returned home to Florida for good
earlier this week for family reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Strengths
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Dogs, who had just eight scholarship players last year,
now have enough numbers to play a pressing, fastbreak game. After
spending most of the season getting to know each other, they have
greater familiarity and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Weaknesses
</P>
<P>
   The vagaries of youth still exist. The Millers tend to display
their emotions all too often, and the lack of established returnees
up front could take some time to solidify. The schedule is
challenging, but Georgia has enough confidence-boosting contests
before the SEC crunch begins. Cotton's departure leaves only nine
scholarship players to start the season, making depth a concern, as
it was a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Final Analysis
</P>
<P>
   Landers mentions Final Four, harkening back to his 1995 squad
that went that far with a bevy of sophomores. It's conceivable, if
they stay healthy and don't crumble in big games, but the Lady Dogs
might be a year away from making it a reality.

<TEXT>
<P>
   1. DUKE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 32-4 overall, 15-1 ACC (1st).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Mike Krzyzewski (505-212 overall, 432-153 in 18 years at
Duke).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Trajan Langdon 6-3, Sr. (14.7 ppg); F
Elton Brand, 6-8, Soph. (13.4 ppg); F Shane Battier, 6-8, Soph.
(7.6 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: F Corey Maggette, 6-6, Bellwood, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Duke played four freshmen extensively, and they are
back, better than before. William Avery will take over the point
guard slot, while Brand, Battier and Chris Burgess form a strong
front line. Fifth-year senior Langdon is the team leader.
</P>
<P>
   2. MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 21-11 overall, 10-6 ACC (3rd).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Gary Williams (371-240 overall, 164-112 in 9 years at
Maryland).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): F Laron Profit, 6-5, Sr. (15.8 ppg); G
Terrell Stokes, 6-0, Sr., (5.4 ppg); C Obinna Ekezie, 6-10, Sr.,
(12.8 ppg)
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Juan Dixon, 6-3, Baltimore; G Danny Miller,
6-8, Mt. Holly, N.J.; G Steve Francis, 6-3, Takoma Park, Md.
(Allegany Junior College); F Lonny Baxter, 6-8, Silver Spring, Md.
(Hargrave Military Academy).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Terps look to be loaded and in a position to
challenge Duke for the ACC lead.
</P>
<P>
   3. NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 34-4 overall, 13-3 ACC (2nd).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Bill Guthridge (34-4 overall, 34-4 in one year at North
Carolina).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (2): G Ed Cota, 6-1, Jr. (8.1 ppg); F Ademola
Okulaja, 6-9, Sr., (8.0 ppg).
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Ronald Curry, 6-3, Hampton, Va.; F/G Jason
Capel, 6-8, Chesapeake, Va. F/C Kris Lang, 6-10, Gastonia, N.C.; F
Orlando Melendez, 6-8, Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico (redshirt).
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Tar Heels return only 27 percent of their scoring
and 17 percent of their rebounding from a year ago. The raw talent
is there. Brandon Haywood, a 7-0 center, could step forward, but
look for freshmen Curry and Capel to make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   4. WAKE FOREST
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 16-14 overall, 7-9 ACC (T-4th).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Dave Odom (220-135 overall, 182-93 in 9 years at Wake
Forest).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (4): G Robert O'Kelley, 6-1, Soph. (16.6
ppg); F Niki Arinze, 6-5, Soph. (7.0 ppg); F Rafael Vidaurreta,
6-9, Soph. (4.5 ppg); F Josh Shoemaker, 6-9, Soph. (3.0 ppg)
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Roderick Hicks, 6-1, Houston; G Jim
Fitzpatrick, 6-0, Fairfax, Va.; F/C Darius Songaila, 6-9,
Marijampole, Lithuania; G Ervin Murray, 6-5, Teachey, N.C.; F
Antwan Scott, 6-8, New Bern, N.C.; F Craig Dawson, 6-5, Kinston,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Wake started three or four freshmen for most of last
season, and five freshmen in two games, land still has the youngest
team in the league this year. O'Kelley led the Deacs in scoring
with a 16.6 average.
</P>
<P>
   5. CLEMSON
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 18-14 overall, 7-9 ACC (T-4th).
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Larry Shyatt (19-9 overall, first year at Clemson).
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): G Terrell McIntyre, 5-9, Sr. (13.9 ppg);
C Tom Wideman, 6-10, Sr. (4.4 ppg) F Tony Christie, 6-6, Sr. (8.0
ppg)
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Will Solomon, 6-1, East Hartford, Conn.; G
Tywan Harris, 6-0, Greenville, S.C.; G Dustin Bracklick, 6-4,
Charleston, S.C.; F Chuckie Gilmore, 6-8, Fayetteville, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Three starters and nine lettermen return. McIntyre was
the leading scorer last year and senior Harold Jamison grabbed 7.3
rebounds a game. Vincent Whitt, Johnny Miller, Mohamed Woni and
Adam Allespach all played plenty last season, to give Shyatt one of
the most experienced teams in the league.
</P>
<P>
   6. N.C. STATE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 17-15 overall, 5-11 ACC (8th)Coach.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3)Top newcomers:Outlook:The most notable
returnee is 6-8 forward Damon Thornton, who missed all but three
games last year with a foot injury. Archie Miller is one of the
best shooters coming off the bench in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
   7. GEORGIA TECH
</P>
<P>
   Last year:.
</P>
<P>
   CoachReturning starters (1):Top newcomers:Outlook:Sophomore
guard Dion Glover, who averaged 18.4 points per game last year, is
out with a torn ACL. Starting point guard Travis Spivey transferred
to Iowa State and backup center Pablo Machado transferred to Loyola
Marymount. With Matt Harpring and Michael Maddox graduated, Tech is
not overwhelmed with experience. Tech will return 15.8 points of
offense per game.
</P>
<P>
   8. FLORIDA STATE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: .
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Returning starters (1): Top newcomers:Outlook:Four of
Robinson's players have played at other Division I schools:
Crawford (Tulsa), Oliver Simmons (Kentucky), Anderson (South
Carolina) and Mott (Washington State). The problem for the
Seminoles is that few on the roster have played together as a team,
although forward Ron Hale and center Karim Shabazz saw plenty of
playing time last season.
</P>
<P>
   9. VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Coach:Returning starters (3):Top
newcomers:Outlook:Prospects for Gillen are not bright. The Cavs
return three starters, but they also happen to be the only three
with any experience. In fact, the Cavalier roster lists only eight
players, period.

 &HT;    Devils only test may be cohesion may get challenge from Terps,
Heels
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just three short years ago, Herb Sendek of N.C. State was the
head coach at Miami of Ohio, Pete Gillen was at Providence instead
of Virginia, Bill Guthridge was an assistant to Dean Smith at North
Carolina, Steve Robinson, now at Florida State, was the head man at
Tulsa and Larry Shyatt was Rick Barnes' assistant at Clemson, not
the head coach.
</P>
<P>
   In a little more than 1,000 days, the face of the Atlantic Coast
Conference has changed, and the ACC has a new group of coaches in
what many people consider the finest basketball conference in
America.
</P>
<P>
   But some things never change, and the preseason favorites have a
very familiar look. Duke, under Mike Krzyzewski, is the heavy
favorite. Maryland is a close second with Gary Williams at the
helm, and North Carolina follows in third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACC is unique, it's special, (and) that's why everybody
wants to get here,'' Gillen said. ``Its reputation around the
country is excellent. Who wouldn't want a chance to coach in the
ACC?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ACC matures you, no matter how old you are, because it's
at the top,'' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite
</P>
<P>
   Duke was the favorite last year because it had a dozen high
school All-Americas on the roster. The Blue Devils didn't
disappoint, compiling a 15-1 mark in the league and grabbing one of
the top regional seedings in the NCAA tourney. The Blue Devils are
favored again. They lost top-scorer Roshown McLeod and point guard
Steve Wojciechowski, but return 10 lettermen. Two of the Duke
veterans are legitimate candidates for national player of z (6-8)
and freshman Kris Lang (6-10).
</P>
<P>
   Team on the rise
</P>
<P>
   Dave Odom used 12 different starting lineups last year at Wake
Forest while compiling a guild a competitive team around 6-9 Colin
Ducharme, 6-5 Willie Dersch and 5-11 guard Donald Hand signals just
what kind of year the Cavaliers could be headed for.
</P>
<P>
   Player of the Year
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Langdon and Brand are the favorites, but the league has a
Who's Who In College Basketball list of talent. Maryland JUCO
transfer Steve Francis averaged 25 points, 8 assists, 7 rebounds
and 5 steals in leading Allegany CC to the NJCAA tournament. Wake's
O'Kelley can score against anybody. Clemson's Terrell McIntyre
might be the best little man in the country. North Carolina's
Entimov, according to his teammates, has become a terror on court.
But Brand can be the best of the best and might very well be in the
running for the national player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Coach of the Year
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski's chore is to take 10 veteran players, all
superstars, and the pre-season No. 1 ranking and somehow get his
players to realize that they must play as a team to grab the
ultimate prize of a national championship. The affable coach has
won every honor bestowed in college basketball, including being
selected as national coach of the year five times. A team of Brand,
Langdon, William Avery, Shane Battier and Chris Carrawell would be
a dream for some and a nightmare for others, who might let the
talent level overwhelm their coaching ability.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie of the Year
</P>
<P>
   The consensus pick among those who watch the league closely is
North Carolina's Capel. The 6-8 freshman from Chesapeake, Va.,
averaged 20.1 points and 12 rebounds for St. John's Prospect Hall.
That team was chosen No. 1 in the country by several publications.
Capel also can handle the ball and has an excellent outside shot
for a big man. Duke freshman Corey Maggette (6-6, 215) from
Bellwood, Ill., is a swingman who can score and bring an inside
toughness to the Devils' lineup.

   Cremins admits he doesn't know what's in the cards for the
Yellow Jackets this season. ``Last year, we were picked last, and
we finished sixth and needed only one more win to finish fourth in
the ACC,'' he said. ``I have no clue about this year. I had high
hopes going into the year after playing four freshmen last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Backcourt
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth consecutive year, Tech opens with a new point
guard, having gone through Travis Best, Stephon Marbury, Kevin
Morris and Travis Spivey. Now Akins gives it a try. Akins'
backcourt help will come from Vines and LaBarrie, but the former
Berkmar player prefers to bring the ball up by himself. Make no
mistake: Akins is the key to this team.
</P>
<P>
   Frontcourt
</P>
<P>
   With Collier eligible, Cremins should have a formidable front
court with two 7-footers inside. The small-forward position will be
split between Floyd and Babul. Jones has improved offensively and
is capable of double-digit scoring without taking away from his
defense. Collier has the potentiathe rigors of the ACC. Collier
could take up the scoring slack created by Glover's injury.. Jones'
production inside is another key. If Akins, Jones and Collier play
together, Tech might avoid a losing season.

   TEAM-BY-TEAM CAPSULES
</P>
<P>
   1. TENNESSEE

Catchings, G Semeka Randall, G Kellie Jolly.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: C Michelle Snow, C Shalon Pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The first women's ``four-peat'' is a definite
possibility for Tennessee, which is riding a 45-game winning streak
as Holdsclaw begins her last season.
</P>
<P>
   2. GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 17-11, lost to George Washington in NCAA first round.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (4): F Elena Vishniakova, G/F Pam Irwin, G
Coco Miller, G Kelly Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: C Tawana McDonald, G Deana Nolan.
</P>
<P>

the arrival of McDonald in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   3. ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 24-10, lost to Louisiana Tech in Midwest Region
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Rick Moody, 199-81 in nine seasons at Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (2): F/G Dominique Canty, C LaToya Caudle.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Kauna Williams, G Shondra Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Crimson Tide lost a lot to graduation, but Canty, a
sure-fire All-American, and an outstanding recruiting class could
keep Bama near the top.
</P>
<P>
   4. FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 23-9, lost to Duke in West Region semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Carol Ross, 165-77 in eight seasons at Florida.

   Returning starters (2): C Tamara Stocks, G Talatha Bingham.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Losses were heavy for the Lady Gators, but Stocks is a
rising star and F Tiffany Travis, a clutch player ofF Zuzana
Klimesova, G/F Jill Danker.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: A perpetually underachieving program might turn to the
5-2 Smith, a gritty point guard, to try and live up to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   6. AUBURN
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 16-11, no postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Joe Ciampi, 448-141 in 19 seasons at Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (4): F Kris Bernath, C Conswella Sparrow, G
Tiffany Krantz, G Tasha Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Kwameika Brown, F Shera Looney.
</P>

Ciampi is eager to return with Sparrow, an All-SEC player, and
Krantz, now starting her third season.
</P>
<P>
   7. ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 22-11, lost to Tennessee in Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Gary Blair, 99-55 in five seasons at Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (2): F Karyn Karlin, G Sytia Messer.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomer: G Amy Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Cinderella will look to Wright to lead the way now that
Christy Smith has departed. The Lady 'Backs must beef up their
undersized inside game.
</P>
<P>
   8. Penn, G Shaunzinski Gortman.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Walvius, upbeat and energetic, made impressive strides
to start turning around a downtrodden program, but rebuilding in
the SEC is a pretty tall order.
</P>
<P>
   11. MISSISSIPPI STATE
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 14-14, lost to Baylor in NIT first round.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Sharon Fanning, 38-45 in four seasons at Mississippi
State.

<P>
   Returning starters (1): G Angela Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomers: G Litisha Benson, G/F Jennifer Fambrough.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Doing as well as last season seems a long shot, with
four new starters in the lineup and one senior, a little-used
reserve, to provide leadership.
</P>
<P>
   12. MISSISSIPPI
</P>
<P>
   Last year: 12-19, no postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: Ron Aldy, 12-19 in one season at Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters (3): F Tarsha Bethley, G Becky Myatt, F
Stephanie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Top newcomer: C Frankie Boyd.
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: The Lady Rebels, who upset Georgia in the SEC
tournament, had little turnover, but making a big jump in the
standings won't happen anytime soon.

   NEW YORK _ Scott Ritter knows Iraq pretty well by now. A veteran
arms inspector for the U.N. Special Commission charged with
tracking Iraq's arsenal of weapons of mass destruction, Ritter, who
recently resigned his post, was intimately involved in the U.N.
effort to keep Saddam Hussein honest.
</P>
<P>
   Over an extended period, Ritter and other inspectors worked to
break the code Saddam was using to issue instructions involving the
movement of weapons Iraq wanted to keep hidden from inspectors.
Well into this year, the cat-and-mouse game being played in Iraq
made regular headlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
   What few know is that the U.N. inspectors, with Israeli help,
eventually broke the Iraqi code and were on the verge of a major
breakthrough in uncovering concealed weaponry. Then this summer the
inspections were halted. That's when Ritter quit his job _ out of
pure frustration, he says.
</P>
<P>
   In this conversation with David Makovsky, correspondent for
Ha'aretz, Ritter reveals how weapons were being moved around in
Iraq.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DAVID MAKOVSKY: How did Iraq conceal weapons from UNSCOM?
</P>
<P>
   SCOTT RITTER: In April 1991, Saddam Hussein issued a
presidential directive ordering that Iraq lie to the Special
Commission (UNSCOM) and to the IAEA (International Atomic Energy
Agency), (and that Iraq) would keep (its mass destruction)
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1991, the materials that were kept were turned over under
instruction of the president to the Special Security Organization
(SSO) and Special Republican Guard (SRG). These are presidential
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is this special organization?
</P>
<P>
   A: The SSO is one of the most secretive organizations in Iraq.
It probably numbers around 5,000 people. The SRG is the military
arm that had four brigades, around 15 battalions, and is about the
size of a division _ maybe 20,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the special organization set up for this purpose of
concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: The special organization was set up to protect the president
of Iraq. Back in the 1980s this special security organization also
had a responsibility for protecting Iraq's weapons. ... So they
have been linked from the very beginning with these weapons, but
today they have the responsibility of hiding them from the Special
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is their job basically to conduct one big shell game?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's right, it's a shell game. Now what you're getting to
is the problem I faced. We were beating our heads against the wall
going after the shell game. We're playing their game. I said to
(then) chairman (of UNSCOM, Rolf Ekeus, that) rather than going
after the shells, let's go after the man moving the shells.
</P>
<P>
   One reason why I went to Israel and started working with the
Israelis is because I believe that the methodologies that Israel
uses to hunt down terrorists are the same methodologies we needed
to use to go after the weapons of mass destruction. So I asked
Israel to help the commission formulate analytical models,
analytical techniques and to advise on operational issues.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When was that?
</P>
<P>
   A: I first approached (Israel) in 1994. We started working in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it helpful?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can honestly say that if it weren't for Israel, the Special
Commission would not have been able to carry out the
anti-concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was Israel's unique contribution?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can just say Israel had a good reputation of being
innovative, of being capable, of being good. And we approached
Israel due to all those factors. It's Tel Aviv that can be hit by
these missiles, not New York City, and we were actually, frankly
speaking, a little dismayed with the lack of intensity, the lack of
enthusiasm, that emanated from Washington on this issue. The U.S.
treated it more as an academic exercise and I thought Israel
treated it as it is _ a matter of life and death. So we came to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were your trips and cooperation with Israel authorized by the
head of UNSCOM? Was it also approved by the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ekeus started this, yes. It was all authorized by Ekeus. It
was a totally authorized thing and it was approved by the U.S.
government. Every aspect was approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who ran the Iraqi concealment program?
</P>
<P>
   A: Abed Hamed Mahmoud, the presidential secretary. He is
probably the most powerful man in Iraq after the president. He is
Saddam's bodyguard, confidant, right-hand man. Qusay Hussein
(Saddam's son) cannot go to the president without going through
Abed Hamed Mahmoud. He is the gatekeeper. He is the man responsible
for coordinating the national security policy of Iraq. He's the
secret power in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He runs what's called the joint committee, (which) coordinates
all the national security. ... He's the one who brings people in
and gives them concealment tasks. He's the one who (manages) the
concealment operation center that monitors all the stuff that is
moved around Iraq. Abed uses the special security organization
[SSO] as the tool for concealment.
</P>
<P>
   I can name officers within the special security organization who
did concealment, and I can tell (the UNSCOM) chairman, how, when,
where and why specific acts of concealment took place. That's how
good we got. I can't say how we did it. But I can say how good we
got. So we started with nothing and in the end we were down to
where we knew when, where, how, why, who and what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the frustration. It was not a single source of
information. We used everything that we had available to us. And
that's why what happened in July and August (when the U.S. halted
inspections) was so frustrating. Because now that we have
identified how they're doing it, and now that we get the kind of
information we need on the timely basis we need, we're inside their
decision-making cycle. We're reacting before Iraq can react.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does the concealment work?
</P>
<P>
   A: It basically works like a mafia organization. ... you have
cells. And ... the cells can rely on a larger infrastructure, the
Special Security Organization, the Special Republican Guard. These
elite organizations are populated by people loyal to Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Now they don't have a mission per se of concealment, but if you
need a truck, you can go to that Special Republican Guard and
vehicle resources. If you need 15-man working party, you can go to
that Special Republican Guard unit and get 15 soldiers to do
something for you.
</P>
<P>
   So you have the resources of the SSO and SRG at your disposal if
you want to hide these weapons. You're given vehicles, you're given
money, you're given a safe house. You're given the responsibility
to go out and find a location to hide this stuff. ... You go to
your uncle who has a farm in Samara, and you say on that farm, 'I
need to use that shed. I can't tell you what for, it's a family
business.'
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days later, they leave and he has a soldier on his team.
He asks: 'Do you have a relative near here?' They go to the cousin
and say, 'We need to use your farm and hide stuff on your farm.'
And that's how they move stuff around.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many people do you think are involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we are talking about hundreds of people involved. It
is probably several cells doing chemicals, several cells doing
ballistic missiles, several cells doing biological (components),
and a cell doing nuclear (devices). You might be talking 50, 60
sites in Iraq at any one time with all that. Then you have the
groups responsible for monitoring ... personnel. Then you have a
group responsible for monitoring UNSCOM _ trying to collect
intelligence on what UNSCOM is doing. And Iraq has this regime of
terror and control. ... They can tap into any resource in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Israel help crack the code of concealment?
</P>
<P>
   A: We used the methodology that Israel was considered to be the
best at in the world. We cracked the code, not Israel. Israel was
not in the lead on this, but I can say that UNSCOM could not have
solved this problem without the help of Israel. It's absolutely
essential. We could not have done what we did. We couldn't even
come close without the help of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   I was in charge when I went to Israel. Israel responded. My
requirements and my tasking came from the executive chairman.
Israel did not control the Special Commission. Israel didn't want
to control the Special Commission. Israel was a fair player on all
of this. It was extremely responsible.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1998, Al-Quds al-Arabi, an Arabic newspaper
published in London, printed the full text of a ``Declaration of
the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the
Crusaders.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the paper, the statement was faxed to them under
the signatures of Osama bin Ladin, the Saudi financier blamed by
the United States for masterminding the August bombings of its
embassies in East Africa, and the leaders of militant Islamist
groups in Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The statement _ a magnificent piece of eloquent, at times even
poetic Arabic prose _ reveals a version of history that most
Westerners will find unfamiliar. Bin Ladin's grievances are not
quite what many would expect.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration begins with an exordium quoting the more
militant passages in the Quran and the sayings of the Prophet
Muhammad, then continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since God laid down the Arabian peninsula, created its desert,
and surrounded it with its seas, no calamity has ever befallen it
like these Crusader hosts that have spread in it like locusts,
crowding its soil, eating its fruits, and destroying its verdure;
and this at a time when the nations contend against the Muslims
like diners jostling around a bowl of food. ''
</P>
<P>
   The statement goes on to talk of the need to understand the
situation and act to rectify it. The facts, it says, are known to
everyone and fall under three main headings:
</P>
<P>
   ``First _ For more than seven years the United States is
occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of its territories,
Arabia, plundering its riches, overwhelming its rulers, humiliating
its people, threatening its neighbors, and using its bases in the
peninsula as a spearhead to fight against the neighboring Islamic
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though some in the past have disputed the true nature of this
occupation, the people of Arabia in their entirety have now
recognized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better proof of this than the continuing American
aggression against the Iraqi people, launched from Arabia despite
its rulers, who all oppose the use of their territories for this
purpose but are subjugated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second _ Despite the immense destruction inflicted on the
Iraqi people at the hands of the Crusader-Jewish alliance and in
spite of the appalling number of dead, exceeding a million, the
Americans nevertheless, in spite of all this, are trying once more
to repeat this dreadful slaughter. It seems that the long blockade
following after a fierce war, the dismemberment and the destruction
are not enough for them. So they come again today to destroy what
remains of this people and to humiliate their Muslim neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third _ While the purposes of the Americans in these wars are
religious and economic, they also serve the petty state of the
Jews, to divert attention from their occupation of Jerusalem and
their killing of Muslims in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better proof of all this than their eagerness to
destroy Iraq, the strongest of the neighboring Arab states, and
their attempt to dismember all the states of the region, such as
Iraq and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Sudan, into petty states, whose
division and weakness would ensure the survival of Israel and the
continuation of the calamitous Crusader occupation of the lands of
Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   These crimes, the statement declares, amount to ``a clear
declaration of war by the Americans against God, his Prophet, and
the Muslims. ''
</P>
<P>
   In such a situation, the declaration says, the ``ulema'' _
authorities on theology and Islamic law, or ``sharia'' _ throughout
the centuries unanimously ruled that when enemies attack the Muslim
lands, jihad becomes every Muslim's personal duty.
</P>
<P>
   In the technical language of the ulema, religious duties may be
collective, to be discharged by the community as a whole, or
personal, incumbent on every individual Muslim. In an offensive
war, the religious duty of jihad is collective and may be
discharged by volunteers and professionals. When the Muslim
community is defending itself, however, jihad becomes an individual
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   After quoting various Muslim authorities, the signatories then
proceed to the final and most important part of their declaration,
the fatwa, or ruling. It holds that
</P>
<P>
   ``To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military,
is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country
where this is possible, until the Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) and
the Haram Mosque (in Mecca) are freed from their grip and until
their armies, shattered and broken-winged, depart from all the
lands of Islam, incapable of threatening any Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   After citing some further relevant Quranic verses, the document
continues:
</P>

   For holy warriors of any faith, the faithful are always right
and the infidels always wrong, whoever the protagonists and
whatever the circumstances of their encounter. The three areas of
grievance listed in the declaration _ Arabia, Iraq and Jerusalem _
will be familiar to observers of the Middle Eastern scene. What may
be less familiar is the sequence and emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, as we in the West sometimes tend to forget but
those familiar with Islamic history and literature know, the holy
land par excellence is Arabia _ Mecca, where the Prophet was born;
Medina, where he established the first Muslim state; and the Hijaz,
whose people were the first to rally to the new faith and become
its standard-bearers.
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, no piece of land once added to the realm of Islam
can ever be finally renounced, but none compares in significance
with Arabia and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Of these two, Arabia is by far the more important. The classical
Arabic historians tell us that in the year 20 after the hijra
(Muhammad's move from Mecca to Medina), corresponding to 641 of the
Christian calendar, the Caliph Umar decreed that Jews and
Christians should be removed from Arabia to fulfill an injunction
the Prophet uttered on his deathbed: ``Let there not be two
religions in Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, to most Americans, the declaration is a travesty, a gross
distortion of the nature and purpose of the American presence in
Arabia. They should also know that for many _ perhaps most _
Muslims, the declaration is an equally grotesque travesty of the
nature of Islam and even of its doctrine of jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The Quran speaks of peace as well as of war. The hundreds of
thousands of traditions and sayings attributed with varying
reliability to the Prophet, interpreted in various ways by the
ulema, offer a wide range of guidance. The militant and violent
interpretation is one among many.
</P>
<P>
   The standard juristic treatises on sharia normally contain a
chapter on jihad, understood in the military sense as regular
warfare against infidels and apostates. But these treatises
prescribe correct behavior and respect for the rules of war in such
matters as the opening and termination of hostilities and the
treatment of noncombatants and prisoners, not to speak of
diplomatic envoys.
</P>
<P>
   The jurists also discuss _ and sometimes differ on _ the actual
conduct of war. Some permit, some restrict, and some disapprove of
the use of mangonels, poisoned arrows, and the poisoning of enemy
water supplies _ the missile and chemical warfare of the Middle
Ages _ out of concern for the indiscriminate casualties that these
weapons inflict.
</P>
<P>
   At no point do the basic texts of Islam enjoin terrorism and
murder. At no point do they even consider the random slaughter of
uninvolved bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, some Muslims are ready to approve, and a few of
them to apply, the declaration's extreme interpretation of their
religion. Terrorism requires only a few. Obviously, the West must
defend itself by whatever means will be effective. But in devising
strategies to fight the terrorists, it would surely be useful to
understand the forces that drive them.

 By BERNARD LEWIS  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   On Feb. 23, 1998, Al-Quds al-Arabi, an Arabic newspaper
published in London, printed the full text of a ``Declaration of
the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the
Crusaders.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the paper, the statement was faxed to them under
the signatures of Osama bin Ladin, the Saudi financier blamed by
the United States for masterminding the August bombings of its
embassies in East Africa, and the leaders of militant Islamist
groups in Egypt, Pakistan and Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
   The statement _ a magnificent piece of eloquent, at times even
poetic Arabic prose _ reveals a version of history that most
Westerners will find unfamiliar. Bin Ladin's grievances are not
quite what many would expect.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration begins with an exordium quoting the more
militant passages in the Quran and the sayings of the Prophet
Muhammad, then continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``Since God laid down the Arabian peninsula, created its desert,
and surrounded it with its seas, no calamity has ever befallen it
like these Crusader hosts that have spread in it like locusts,
crowding its soil, eating its fruits, and destroying its verdure;
and this at a time when the nations contend against the Muslims
like diners jostling around a bowl of food. ''
</P>
<P>
   The statement goes on to talk of the need to understand the
situation and act to rectify it. The facts, it says, are known to
everyone and fall under three main headings:
</P>
<P>
   ``First _ For more than seven years the United States is
occupying the lands of Islam in the holiest of its territories,
Arabia, plundering its riches, overwhelming its rulers, humiliating
its people, threatening its neighbors, and using its bases in the
peninsula as a spearhead to fight against the neighboring Islamic
peoples.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though some in the past have disputed the true nature of this
occupation, the people of Arabia in their entirety have now
recognized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better proof of this than the continuing American
aggression against the Iraqi people, launched from Arabia despite
its rulers, who all oppose the use of their territories for this
purpose but are subjugated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second _ Despite the immense destruction inflicted on the
Iraqi people at the hands of the Crusader-Jewish alliance and in
spite of the appalling number of dead, exceeding a million, the
Americans nevertheless, in spite of all this, are trying once more
to repeat this dreadful slaughter. It seems that the long blockade
following after a fierce war, the dismemberment and the destruction
are not enough for them. So they come again today to destroy what
remains of this people and to humiliate their Muslim neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third _ While the purposes of the Americans in these wars are
religious and economic, they also serve the petty state of the
Jews, to divert attention from their occupation of Jerusalem and
their killing of Muslims in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better proof of all this than their eagerness to
destroy Iraq, the strongest of the neighboring Arab states, and
their attempt to dismember all the states of the region, such as
Iraq and Saudi Arabia and Egypt and Sudan, into petty states, whose
division and weakness would ensure the survival of Israel and the
continuation of the calamitous Crusader occupation of the lands of
Arabia.''
</P>
<P>
   These crimes, the statement declares, amount to ``a clear
declaration of war by the Americans against God, his Prophet, and
the Muslims. ''
</P>
<P>
   In such a situation, the declaration says, the ``ulema'' _
authorities on theology and Islamic law, or ``sharia'' _ throughout
the centuries unanimously ruled that when enemies attack the Muslim
lands, jihad becomes every Muslim's personal duty.
</P>
<P>
   In the technical language of the ulema, religious duties may be
collective, to be discharged by the community as a whole, or
personal, incumbent on every individual Muslim. In an offensive
war, the religious duty of jihad is collective and may be
discharged by volunteers and professionals. When the Muslim
community is defending itself, however, jihad becomes an individual
obligation.
</P>
<P>
   After quoting various Muslim authorities, the signatories then
proceed to the final and most important part of their declaration,
the fatwa, or ruling. It holds that
</P>
<P>
   ``To kill Americans and their allies, both civil and military,
is an individual duty of every Muslim who is able, in any country
where this is possible, until the Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem) and
the Haram Mosque (in Mecca) are freed from their grip and until
their armies, shattered and broken-winged, depart from all the
lands of Islam, incapable of threatening any Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   After citing some further relevant Quranic verses, the document
continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``By God's leave, we call on every Muslim who believes in God
and hopes for reward to obey God's command to kill the Americans
and plunder their possessions wherever he finds them and whenever
he can. Likewise we call on the Muslim ulema and leaders and youth
and soldiers to launch attacks against the armies of the American
devils and against those who are allied with them from among the
helpers of Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration and fatwa conclude with a series of further
quotations from Muslim scripture.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Ladin's view of the Persian Gulf War as American aggression
against Iraq may seem a little odd, but it is widely _ though by no
means universally _ accepted in the Islamic world.

whatever the circumstances of their encounter. The three areas of
grievance listed in the declaration _ Arabia, Iraq and Jerusalem _
will be familiar to observers of the Middle Eastern scene. What may
be less familiar is the sequence and emphasis.

land par excellence is Arabia _ Mecca, where the Prophet was born;
Medina, where he established the first Muslim state; and the Hijaz,

 THE IMF DID NOT PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE  
 By David D. Hale  
 &HT;    (1,400 words) Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were
imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

 By Michael Howard  
 &HT;    (1,300 words) No one is under oath when writing their memoirs,
but the joint account by former President George Bush and his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials
than most. By the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so
fast that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the
United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and
manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a
vision of a new world order.

 NATIONS HATE TO SAY `SORRY'

at the start and end of every conversation and many times in

more remarkable. If the Japanese regularly apologize for being a
nuisance, even when they are not, why will they not show regret for
the slaughter of millions?

   To most Americans, the success or failure of U.S. foreign policy
no longer seems a matter of life and death. We invest fewer

   &UR; TODAY'S KOSOVO CRISIS IS HARDLY A SURPRISE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Warren Bass &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to diplomacy in Bosnia _ including Richard
Holbrooke's memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996
official study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of
November 1995 _ show that American officials were painfully aware
of the shortcomings of U.S. policy. Dayton's lessons are grimly

</P>
<P>
   (1,300 words) After years of being tolerated with a mixture of
apathy, cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of
serious international action. Today corruption is harder to hide,
as the wave of bribery scandals involving high-level officials in
Europe, Asia and South America demonstrates. (slugged:

   &UR; WHAT IF WOMEN RAN THE WORLD? &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; By Francis Fukuyama &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   (1,400 words) Male tendencies to band together for competitive
purposes, seek to dominate status hierarchies, and act out
aggressive fantasies toward one another can be rechanneled but
never eliminated. The world scene will always be populated by
states led by the occasional Mobutu, Milosevic or Saddam. Even if
the democratic, feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a
zone of peace where struggles are more economic than military, it
will still have to deal with those parts of the world run by young,
ambitious, unconstrained men.

</P>
<P>
   Today, quietly, without most Americans noticing, a revolution
has turned the U.S. defense industry upside down. The idea that
every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a profit but
lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to a time when
CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet technology,
and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in top-secret
grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed exclusively
for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to America's
Cold War allies.

 THE IMF DID NOT PLAY RUSSIAN ROULETTE  
 By David D. Hale  
 &HT;    (1,400 words) Critics charge that the IMF's loans to Russia were
imprudent and wasteful. But the IMF failed to stem the Russian
collapse not because its reform package was flawed but because
Russia's domestic woes _ combined with its sensitivity to the
global slump in oil and commodity prices _ were too severe to
prevent market panic. Had the $22 billion IMF package for Russia
been as large as its $40 billion bailout of Mexico in 1995, it
might have helped.

national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, has better credentials
than most. By the summer of 1989, events in Europe were moving so
fast that ``the vision thing'' became largely irrelevant. All the
United States could do, in Bush's words, was encourage, guide and
manage change. This required seat-of-the-pants planning, not a
vision of a new world order.

   WASHINGTON _ David Horsey, editorial cartoonist for the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer, is the winner of the National Press
Foundation's 1998 Berryman Cartoonist of the Year Award, the
foundation announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Other NPF award winners were:

<P>
   _ Herb Block, the veteran cartoonist for the Washington Post,
named to receive the foundation's award for distinguished

CAR DEALERS SHIFT GEARS TO MAKE SHOWROOMS HOMEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JO-ANN JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horsepower is taking a back seat to hospitality in a new and
gentler world of auto retailing, and so showrooms are starting to
look like living rooms with soft chairs and potted plants.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealers also say they also want their salespeople to be
like friendly hosts, and not pushy opportunists, in dealing with
sales and service customers. That means when customers enter some
revamped outlets, they may be able to talk to an employee while
their child plays in a dedicated area, or get some work done on
their own laptop computer while waiting for a car to be serviced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been customer friendly, but not with the physical
facility. We want the physical facility to demonstrate this too,''
said Carl Touhey, who is in the midst of a $500,000 renovation at
his Ford and Mazda dealership, the Orange Motor Group in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Come January, Touhey said, customers will drive up to an Orange
dealership with a renovated waiting room that is equipped with a
fax machine for customer use.
</P>
<P>
   These days, car dealers have to start thinking a bit like Martha
Stewart to keep the customers coming back, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who does it will keep his business or maybe grow a
little,'' Touhey said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Albany suburb of Latham, drivers can see an even more
dramatic example of the new decor at a recently opened ``flagship''
Buick dealership. The Buick-only dealership is one of only three in
the nation so far of an anticipated 150.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the auto manufacturer, rather than the dealer,
conceived of the decor for the flagship stores.
</P>
<P>
   Store formats are adapted somewhat to suit individual locations
and zoning codes, said John Peterson, manager of flagship
operations for the Buick Motor Division of General Motors. But
there are consistent elements at each flagship dealer, he said,
including a park-like exterior with wooden benches, flowers, and a
bell-tower with a high-tech computer kiosk featuring product
information.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, a worker is seated at a reception desk to greet
customers, who can help themselves to the coffee and snacks on the
refreshment cart. Off to one side, there's a separate play area
equipped with at least two interactive, non-violent games for those
``future generation of Buick owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults can retreat to a den-like area to watch television, read
periodicals or work in another quiet setting on a laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   Buick steered away from really expensive fixtures, such as
leather chairs, after customers balked at the sight of such costly
overhead, assuming: ``It's in the price of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   While Buick's cars are not at the low end of the market, at
$18,000 to $39,000, they're not selling in the most expensive
segment of the market, either. So Buick scaled back the interior
decor to communicate something more modest: cloth chairs and ash
wood. Buick won't reveal the dollar investment in its dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   Still, soft chairs by themselves don't make for a friendly
business. Buick said its salespeople have been trained to listen to
what the customers say they want, instead of pushing particular
makes or models. And the Latham dealership has quit haggling with
customers over car prices, said general manager Paul Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers don't want to negotiate,'' he said. They'd rather
know there's a flat price that every buyer pays, he said.

   CAMBODIA-KHMER-ROUGE (RATTANAK MONDOL, Cambodia) Gen. Nhiem Kong
spent 26 years with the dreaded Khmer Rouge and has the battle
scars, icy stare and brutal demeanor to prove it. The 46-year-old
commander, who still cracks a twisted smile when he speaks of Pol
Pot's charisma and his radical ideology, defected to the government
side two years ago along with some 1,000 guerrilla followers.
Today, Nhiem Kong is a powerful warlord, given contol over a wide
swath of remote northwestern Cambodia where he and his men plunder
abandoned villages and log the rich hardwood forests in exchange
for fighting their weakened but still dangerous former comrades _
the last remnants of the genocidal Khmer Rouge.

TORTURE SURVIVOR SEEKS JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PEHN, Cambodia _ When he was 14, Youk Chhang was tortured
by the Khmer Rouge. His father and sister died in the killing
fields, along with hundreds of thousands of other Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stole my family and my youth,'' says Youk, now 38. ``They
tortured me and they beat me, but they couldn't hurt my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk ended up a refugee in the United States, where he earned a
degree in political science and vowed to return to his homeland and
seek justice for himself, his family and the millions of Cambodians
who suffered at the hands of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Youk is the executive director of the Phnom Penh-based
Documentation Center of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not after revenge,'' Youk said in the center's
air-conditioned office, filled with computers and filing cabinets
that hold more than 1.3 million testimonies of the Pol Pot years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prove the capability of human beings to persevere
for as long as it takes to achieve justice. If I wanted revenge, I
could have shot some of these people already. But I don't want to
use their tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   The center was created in 1995 as a field office for Yale
University's Cambodian Genocide Program, funded by the U.S. State
Department. Today, it is an autonomous Cambodian institute operated
entirely by Cambodians with support from U.S. and Australian
scholars and legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   Youk said the center has two main goals: to serve as a
repository of information on the Pol Pot regime for those who want
to pursue legal redress for genocide, war crimes or crimes against
humanity; and to ``prevent the return of the killing fields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Khmer Rouge is very weak right now physically, but their
ideology remains very strong,'' Youk said. ``They are very
committed. That's why we have to be careful. Remember, they started
with just one man and grew into a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk is uncomfortable with the Cambodian government's blanket
acceptance of thousands of Khmer Rouge defectors, many of whom were
absorbed into the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government brings back all these defectors, but they also
bring back among them some of the killers,'' he said. ``That's the
weakness of this system.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation is fine in some countries, Youk added, but the
many crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge require justice and
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more than a million dead in Cambodia. There aren't
words to describe the horrors that happened here,'' he said. ``We
need a court, we need justice, not reconciliation. Reconciliation
is not part of our life.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has compiled files on some 18,000 individual Khmer
Rouge leaders. Youk believes the top 20 should be tried for war
crimes or crimes against humanity, possibly in a U.N.-sponsored
tribunal. A U.N. legal expert is due in Phnom Penh this month to
investigate the possibility of such a tribunal and will then report
to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, center staff continue their interviews and
documentation. Youk said some of those who took part in the
genocide, including guards at the notorious Tuol Sleng detention
and torture center in Phnom Penh, have expressed guilt and regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've interviewed former Khmer Rouge prison guards and killers
who say they are willing to face the court,'' he said. ``They feel
guilty. A former Khmer Rouge prison guard from Tuol Sleng is
helping us. His own wife doesn't even know he worked there. His
conscience is bothering him.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk says he will not rest until the Khmer Rouge leaders are
brought to justice and the organization is confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was and it remains a curse on Cambodian society,'' Youk
said of the Khmer Rouge. ``It's like a virus. It has its own power,
its own life. I hope we can kill it.''

KHMER ROUGE BECOME NEW WARLORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RATTANAK MONDOL, Cambodia _ Gen. Nhiem Kong spent 26 years with
the dreaded Khmer Rouge and has the battle scars, icy stare and
menacing demeanor to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old commander defected to the government side two
years ago, along with some 1,000 battle-hardened guerrilla
followers.
</P>
<P>
   But Nhiem still cracks a twisted smile when he recalls the
charisma and ideological fervor of the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, whose 1975-79 rule turned Cambodia into a vast killing field
that left up to 2 million people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pol Pot was a very strong leader and he knew how to motivate
us,'' said Nhiem, waving a left arm pockmarked with huge scars from
bullet and shrapnel wounds. ``If you lost a battle, he would give
you some training and encouragement, and you were ready to get up
and fight again. I know, I experienced it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nhiem was wounded five times _ in the head, back, arms
and legs. Each time, he returned to fight for Pol Pot and his
crazed dream of a communist utopia.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, Nhiem said, it became obvious that Pol
Pot's days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fed up with war. My body hurt from all those wounds,''
he said. ``Communism was collapsing all over the world and I didn't
want to keep killing my own people, my own nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Khmer Rouge made two bad mistakes,'' he continued. ``They
killed many people after they took power in 1975 and they didn't
join the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. We commanders wondered
why. We were upset. We were told we were democratic. But Pol Pot
had dictatorial powers. I think in the world these days, there are
no more communists. Most have gone democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, but not all. Nhiem, for example, has become a warlord.
</P>
<P>
   Given military control by the cash-strapped Phnom Penh
government over a wide swath of remote northwestern Cambodia, Khmer
Rouge defectors are plundering abandoned villages and cutting the
rich hardwood forests. In exchange, the defectors fight _ or at
least contain _ the last vestiges of the Khmer Rouge, an estimated
1,000 guerrillas in two parts of the north and northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Nhiem commands the government's 17th Division. Before changing
sides, he was deputy commander of the Khmer Rouge's 690 Division.
He knows his enemy well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all of those hard-line (Khmer Rouge) commanders still
out there,'' Nhiem boasted at his modest wooden house along
recently reopened Highway 10, about 20 miles east of the former
Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin. ``I met Pol Pot every month for
years at commanders' meetings. I know all the top commanders of the
Khmer Rouge. Those men are good fighters, but they are getting fed
up with war. They have malaria. They are tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the estimated 1,000 Khmer Rouge fighters are
weakened by malaria and low morale, but remain dangerous. In the
north, they are believed to operate along the Thai border in
forests around the town of Anlong Veng, where Pol Pot died in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the northwest, more than 300 Khmer Rouge are believed to
be active in the remote mountains of the Samlot region, where many
of Nhiem's men are based.
</P>
<P>
   Overall command of the Khmer Rouge now rests with Ta Mok, a
one-legged veteran guerrilla known as ``The Butcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Nhiem said Ta Mok travels between both groups of guerrillas by
way of Thailand. Military officials say they often intercept Ta
Mok's radio messages to his troops. But Nhiem says The Butcher
lacks Pol Pot's leadership abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is mobile and these two groups always communicate with each
other,'' Nhiem said. ``Sometimes he comes here, traveling through
Thailand, and other times he is up north. But Ta Mok is not such a
strong leader as Pol Pot. We had hoped that after Pol Pot died,
they would just grow weaker and weaker until they died.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't happened. In fact, Nhiem acknowledged that
hundreds of his troops had returned to the Khmer Rouge side in the
past year. A few later redefected to the government side, always
looking for a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are greedy for power,'' Nhiem said. ``But I don't think
the remaining hard-liners will ever defect to the government. Ta
Mok himself will never defect, because he will lose face. He
devoted his life to the Khmer Rouge. He will fight until he dies.
He says he will fight until his body burns out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, civilians continue to suffer. In the Samlot region,
thousands of people have been displaced. Nhiem said bands of as
many as 30 Khmer Rouge still mount hit-and-run attacks in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those displaced by fighting live in makeshift
resettlement camps in the malaria-infested jungles just north of
Samlot. Some have returned from refugee camps in Thailand and have
received assistance from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). But life is extremely difficult, and danger keeps all from
returning to their home villages in Samlot.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the presence of millions of land mines has resulted
in a severe shortage of land for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are not promoting repatriation for those
refugees still in Thailand,'' said Johann Siffointe, head of
UNHCR's field office in the Cambodian city of Battambang. ``If they
insist, we will facilitate their return, perhaps to these temporary
resettlement camps. But it is still much too insecure in Samlot for
them to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Om Thy, a 35-year-old former Khmer Rouge fighter, stays with his
wife and two children in a jungle camp near the destroyed Dong Tong
Bridge on the north side of the muddy river that forms the boundary
with the Samlot region. The riverbank on both sides is heavily
mined.
</P>
<P>
   Although he knows it is too dangerous to take his family back to
Samlot, Om Thy recently returned on his own to check on his house.
It was no longer there, and it wasn't the Khmer Rouge who destroyed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government soldiers dismantled my home and took all the lumber
and tin roofing to the city and sold it,'' Om Thy said. ``Many of
us refugees have gone back to find our houses gone and everything
lost. The government soldiers are no good either. They intend to
dismantle all our homes and sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western aid worker said Om Thy's story is common.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the government in Phnom Penh pays people like Nhiem
Kong _ they let them loot,'' said the worker, who requested
anonymity. ``It's also why (Prime Minister) Hun Sen is a political
master. He has turned Khmer Rouge against Khmer Rouge and now
controls about 95 percent of the country. He does a deal with these
local warlords and then turns a blind eye to their activities, as
long they remain loyal to his government. He could control the
entire country within five years.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the remaining Khmer Rouge fighters, about 30,000
of their civilian followers are in two U.N.-assisted camps in
Thailand _ near the town of Trat, opposite Samlot, and at Phu Noi,
opposite Anlong Veng. Many are relatives of the guerrillas still in
Cambodia. Thai and UNHCR officials say the combatants are not
allowed in the camps, so they remain separated from their families,
who are in turn reluctant to return to Cambodia without their
menfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Nhiem said if the refugees could be persuaded to return to
government areas of Cambodia, most Khmer Rouge fighters would
defect and join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could get their families out of the refugee camps in
Thailand, I think they would stop fighting,'' he said. ``It will
end the war.''

ERNESTINE ANDERSON CELEBRATES HER 70TH BIRTHDAY IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERTA PENN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ernestine Anderson is in a tizzy, moving stacks of
clothes, papers and CDs from one chair to another, reaching across
the potatoes she's frying for her sister's lunch to grab the
constantly ringing phone and in between giving instructions to a
young woman who is helping straighten up the jazz singer's Central
Area home.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy is part of preparations for the biggest birthday
party Anderson has ever thrown. Family and friends are flying in
from Texas and California to join local fans in the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something significant on my 70th birthday. It's
a milestone if there ever was one,'' Anderson said putting the
phone on the hook and stirring the fries. ``Vivian Phillips,
Freddie Mae Gautier and the Paramount Theatre are helping put it
together. And it's a great opportunity to raise some money so it's
a benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the singer won't actually turn 70 until Wednesday the
11th, the Ernestine Anderson 70th Birthday Bash is at 8 Saturay at
the Paramount Theatre and benefits Children's Hospital and the Rise
n' Shine Foundation. The Experience Music Project, the Cole Youth
Trust, the Alhadeff Charitable Foundation and the Wyman Youth Trust
are also throwing support behind the concert.
</P>
<P>
   It features Anderson performing music from her latest CD,
``Isn't It Romantic,'' with the Garfield High School Symphony
Orchestra and a set of blues and pop tunes from the
Grammy-nominated ``Blues, Dues &AMP; Love News'' with the Rich Dangel
Band and middle and high school vocal ensembles. On one tune, there
will also be interpretive dancing by Kabby Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a white sweatshirt that bears both her name and that
of an auto detail shop, black tights and red mules, Anderson looks
like a teenager readying for a prom as she pulls out a long,
gorgeous purple velvet gown with beaded sleeves. This is what she
will wear for the romantic set, and her eyes sparkle with
excitement as she holds the gown up to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I will get into it,'' she says with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson comes from an era of glamorous gowns and big
orchestras. A Texas native who moved to Seattle in 1944, she went
on the road just after her 18th birthday with the Johnny Otis
Orchestra, a group that would also introduce R&AMP;B singers Etta James
and Esther Phillips to the touring life.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson was more of a jazz vocalist and her big break came
in 1952 when, backed by the Ray Charles trio, she auditioned for
Lionel Hampton's orchestra. Along with several other Seattle
artists, including Quincy Jones, Anderson took to the road with
Hampton for more than a year, playing clubs, concert halls and even
an inauguration party for President Dwight Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   For that important date, the singer had to redesign her
performance outfit because her arm was in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke my arm in an auto wreck,'' Anderson recalls. ``So I
wrapped it up in a scarf, and it looked like it was a new
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   After the stint with Hampton, Anderson was signed to Mercury
Records and her first release, ``Hot Cargo,'' landed her on the
cover of Time magazine as ``the best new voice in the business.''
Critics raved about her natural singing style, comparing Anderson
to Ella Fitzgerald and June Cristy and Sarah Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like many jazz singers of the era, Anderson was steered
toward pop music because as rock 'n' roll began to flourish, jazz
went on the decline. Record labels thought they could cash in with
Anderson the way they had with Dinah Washington and Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Mercury, they recorded us all to try to get a us
a commercial hit,'' Anderson explains. ``Rock 'n' roll became the
music of America and people doing jazz couldn't work. They released
me doing tunes like `I Don't See Me in Your Eyes' in Europe. They
sold there, but I was glad they didn't go anywhere here because I
did not want them to be heard. Now it's my karma that fans come up
and request them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Anderson tells this story with a laugh, karma plays a big
part in her life. She has been a Buddhist since 1959, a year in
which she found that fame had left her feeling empty and isolated.
Married and a young mother but still wanting to continue a life in
music, Anderson didn't know which way to turn so she turned inward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was suffering from depression so bad that I had become a
recluse, living in L.A. and scared to death,'' Anderson says.
``Several people had told me about chanting so I went to a meeting
and when I left I realized I no longer had that heavy anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Anderson chants twice a day and prays before an altar in her
living room. It has helped her come out of a crippling shyness and
given her the strength and focus to take care of her twin sister
Phinney (which is short for Josephine), who is developmentally
disabled and needs around the clock care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people in the arts are basically shy and that's a
way to express themselves. I'm happy when I'm on stage,'' Anderson
admits. ``But it is because I am a Buddhist that I'm able to take
care of my sister and have a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's career has continued to have peaks and valleys, but
along the way she has been nominated for four Grammies, was
featured in photographer Brian Laker's stunning book and exhibit
``I Dream A World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America,''
and has raised a lot of money for charities through her concerts.
</P>
<P>
   She has also made it back from a heart attack in 1994. But
Anderson wasn't terrified by the experience, and now she's too busy
to worry about dying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tidying the house up for party guests, rehearsing
for the birthday bash and caring for Phinney, whose art work will
be on display in the lobby of the Paramount for the birthday party,
Anderson is looking toward the future, writing new songs and a book
about her life and considering new recording contract offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost a lot of friends these last few years, Betty Carter,
Dizzy (Gillespie), we go way back to a closeness that developed
when we met in the '50s,'' Anderson says. ``But I believe that life
is eternal. And this is just a transition from one life to
another.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Anderson is off to another round of the dining room,
giving directions of where to put a stack of papers and grabbing
yet another batch of CDs, a new compilation from her years at
Concord Records. Then she dashs off a check to a workman and,
finally, delivers those fries to Phinney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew,'' Anderson says with a sigh. ``I am turning 70!''

RALPH LAUREN COMES THROUGH IN SPRING PREVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Designers inspired by 1960s hippies, military gear,
Las Vegas showgirls and Kandinsky's ``Point and Line to Plane''
previewed their spring '99 collections to retailers and media this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But leave it to talented, reliable Ralph Lauren to provide some
of the most usable clothes for real women.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren made it clear once again why he's voted ``best'' or
``most influential'' designer by his peers and the fashion press
year after year.
</P>
<P>
   His spring '99 collection will probably influence the way a lot
of women dress in the last year of this century. If they're not
wearing clothes with his label, they're likely to copy the looks.
</P>
<P>
   His A-line, bias cut skirts have flare. They're flattering. They
make sense for active women. His combinations of textures _ a
natural linen/silk sweater over herringbone linen pants, for
example _ have a luxurious, understated look.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren used lots of natural, neutral tones with dashes of sage
and khaki. For pure fun there were cargo pants of purple poplin or
pink silk faille.
</P>
<P>
   His collection includes a number of jackets _ short, fitted
three-button styles, a cropped ``Eisenhower'' jacket, and a silk
faille bomber jacket, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   And Lauren's tailoring is always impeccable. Put one of his
jackets with skirt or pants and it's a duo to go anywhere with
style.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mackie's flamboyant party clothes were modeled by seasoned
models _ in this business that means some appeared to be over 30 _
who really knew how to strut and have fun on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie, who is credited with some of Cher's more revealing
costumes, created a yellow, flowered brocade suit with green piping
that could have been a sofa in another life. His evening gowns
floated along with layers of tulle and chiffon. Glitter was rarely
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie even revived the decades-old tradition of closing the
show with a bride. While Bette Midler belted out ``Goin' to the
chapel and we're gonna be married,'' a model swathed in several
dozen yards of white and peach tulle strolled out wearing a
flower-studded headpiece worthy of a Vegas dancer.
</P>
<P>
   The other models reappeared in evening gowns, but for this final
appearance they were clutching demure little nosegays. The audience
applauded, sang along, and left the show in smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Sui is another designer who had the audience smiling from
the minute the first model appeared wearing a crocheted,
feather-trimmed halter and embroidered denim shorts that were truly
cheeky.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1960s hippie trip included embroidered chambray shirts,
tablecloths made into ponchos, fringed leather hip-huggers, white
cotton and lace garments reminiscent of Mexican wedding dresses,
and some of the most bizarre paisley prints ever invented.
</P>
<P>
   She even added a macrame necklace or two and a few peacock
feathers. Only the peace signs were missing.
</P>
<P>
   It might take a trip to the library to figure out what designer
Yeohlee was doing with Kandinsky and geometry.
</P>
<P>
   Yeohlee loves white cotton coated with DuPont Teflon. Her
geometric dresses look like laboratory or hospital uniforms. A
mechanic's jumpsuit, taffeta pants with Velcro closures and a
series of olive-drab cotton garments with insets of transparent
olive fabric were other geometric inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   The latter bring to mind tents with mesh bug screens.
</P>
<P>
   Extra triangles of fabric, inserted like gussets in the backs or
sides of skirts were also part of her geometry lesson. When dresses
with what the program described as ``rectangular side flags''
appeared, they looked sort of like rockets with flexible fins
mounted on the exterior of the skirts. Perhaps it takes a
mathematician or an engineer to understand them.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Rucci, designer for the Chado label, may be a relative
newcomer, but his exquisitely cut garments are like wearable
collectibles. His orange ``pagoda'' jacket of duchess satin, or a
quilted silk jacket were pieces that could be worn for years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors also created a very wearable, interesting
collection with emphasis on slim Bermuda shorts, airy anoraks,
lightweight parkas, chino skirts and shirts with
three-quarter-length sleeves. It had military overtones, but was
definitely street-wise.
</P>
<P>
   There were few shirts or anything else with sleeves being shown
for spring. There were some sweaters with sleeves, but tanks were
definitely the topping of choice for dresses, skirts and pants.
</P>
<P>
   Tanks make sense for warm weather and those with bodies to wear
them. So do beautifully tailored linen jackets.
</P>
<P>
   And it's important to remember there are a lot of people born
after 1960 who probably will be fascinated with macrame, crochet,
border prints and vivid paisleys.

NEW AGE HARP MASTER LIKES TO `STRING' AUDIENCE ALONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hands of Andreas Vollenweider, the heavenly harp becomes
a high-performance New Age hot rod.
</P>
<P>
   Using pedals, triggers, computers and other devices, the Swiss
harpist can turn a one-man performance into a symphony of acoustic
and electronic
</P>
<P>
   sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider, a pioneer of New Age music, is on his first solo
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The tour supports Vollenweider's new album, ``Kryptos,'' his
first instrumental release since the 1992 record, ``Book of
Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kryptos,'' which opens with an orchestral ``tuneup,'' features
a cast of international guests, among them Japanese percussionist
Leonard Eto, African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, saxophonist
Michael Brecker and vocalist Mindy Jostyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Vollenweider will be alone on stage at the Broadway
Performance Hall in Seattle, save for his custom-built
electro-acoustic harp, as well as the ancient kora (African harp),
cheng (Chinese harp) and Celtic and renaissance harps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a solo concert in the sense that I play one
instrument and then another instrument and so forth,'' Vollenweider
said by phone from a tour stop in El Cajon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tie them all together as if I had a whole orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider, who also plays sax, flute, chimes, gongs and
piano, will enhance his music with elements of theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all my pedals, I can trigger sound effects,'' he said.
``A horse riding across the stage, the sound of a flock of birds or
whatever. But they're natural sounds. It's a backdrop that creates
a certain environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider regards himself as a musical storyteller and sees
similarities between his shows and old-fashioned radio plays.
During a segment late in the show, Vollenweider plays the role of
minstrel, serenading concertgoers with an accordion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were these radio plays when I was growing up and I was
such a fan. They were so great . . . the sound effects and the
noise!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old-time radio shows, Vollenweider's performance is
designed to stimulate his fans' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep things as open as possible and try not be too specific,
in order to invite people to put a thought or emotion in the spot
where something seems to be missing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music thus becomes complete through the listeners
involving themselves and engaging themselves in the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider prefers darkened theaters for his performances and
chooses not to perform in venues that are too brightly lit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The darkness is such a great soil for the imagination,'' he
said.

TIME TO WAKE UP, TAKE THE SLEEPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL MULLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - This time of year, most fantasy leagues break into two
camps _ the guys stocking up on players for the playoffs, and the
guys starting Kerry Collins at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. Eight or nine losses will take the sizzle out of
any fantasy season. And after you lose interest, you tend to send
in some, uh, interesting lineups to the commissioner's office _ if
you send in any lineup at all.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still some fun to be had. It's always a great joy to
sneak up on one of those playoff-bound teams and knock it for a
loop. And if you're headed for the playoffs, there are still some
players out there to grab before the trading deadline hits.
</P>
<P>
   Some second-half sleepers, division by division:
</P>
<P>
   NFC EAST: Can anybody play this game? Actually, they can, just
not in the worst division in football. After watching an average
Cowboys team walk all over the Eagles on Monday night, I'm tempted
to warn you away from the whole division. But what fun would that
be?
</P>
<P>
   I'd take a look at the Davis brothers: Billy, the Dallas wide
receiver, and Stephen, the Redskins running back. (Dear Irate
Caller: Yes, I realize they are not really brothers. Please go back
to watching Wrestlemania XIX.)
</P>
<P>
   I also like Giants running back Gary Brown and his teammate,
wide receiver Ike Hilliard, as well as Washington running back Skip
Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   NFC CENTRAL: This is one talent-laden division. Most of the name
players have been grabbed up, but there are a few decent guys who
may still be out there in your league.
</P>
<P>
   I like Bucs receiver Reidel Anthony and Packers running back
Travis Jervey. On the Vikings, try tight end Andrew Glover or
running back Leroy Hoard, who gets the ball near the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   NFC WEST: If your league is anything like mine, every 49er with
a pulse has been picked. So try some of the other teams.
</P>
<P>
   On the Saints, I like tight end Cam Cleeland and former Arizona
State wide receiver Keith Poole, who has gotten open deep a few
times and had five catches for 90 yards against Carolina last week.
Falcons tight end O.J. Santiago is a keeper.
</P>
<P>
   AFC EAST: Buffalo Coach Wade Phillips finally wised up and named
Doug Flutie the starter over Rob Johnson, who has been playing bad
and getting hurt, not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   As for tight ends, how about a story about a man named Brady, as
in Kyle, who has been ripped in this space before but may be the
real deal. Buffalo's Jay Riemersma is worth grabbing as well. I
also like Jets running back Leon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   AFC CENTRAL: Receivers Courtney Hawkins and Charles Johnson have
come alive for the Steelers. If someone gave up on Johnson in your
league, it might be worth picking him back up.
</P>
<P>
   I also like Baltimore running back Roosevelt Potts, who's been
getting some reps for the Ravens lately. With Keenan McCardell
hurt, Jaguars receiver Reggie Barlow should get some action.
</P>
<P>
   AFC WEST: Carlester Crumpler lives! The Seattle tight end had
five catches against the Raiders on Sunday and should remain a
target for Warren Moon or for whoever subs for him after his broken
body is scraped from the turf.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Bam Morris may take away Donnell Bennett's starting
job in Kansas City. Chiefs wide receiver Derrick Alexander is
finally healthy and worth a look. I also like Chargers wide
receiver Mikhael Ricks, even if it is a chore to spell his name. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tip of the week &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stay away from Colts running back Marshall Faulk against the
Dolphins this week. Miami held the Colts to 64 yards rushing in the
opener. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiver wire &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dump Kansas City tight end Tony Gonzalez and pick up somebody
better. Saints wide receiver Sean Dawkins might be worth a look. &QL;

   ISRAEL-BOMBING _ JERUSALEM _ A suicide car bomb exploded Friday
in a Jerusalem market crowded with Israelis shopping for the
Sabbath. The blast killed two and wounded 21. It also prompted
Israel's Cabinet, which had already delayed been dragging its feet
on implementation of a new peace accord with the Palestinians, to
suspend it. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying
to sabotage the peace accord, claimed responsibility for the attack
in the Mahane Yehuda market, police said. Israel TV said the two
dead were the assailants, and not Israelis. Developing. (Kaplow,

   SHEINFELD _ As a teenager growing up in Kefar Sava, a town some

go across his house and destroy parts of nearby neighborhoods
during the Persian Gulf War. A few years later _ playing for the
18-and-under Israeli national basketball team that was touring
Europe _ he ended up at a game in Mannheim, Germany, where a mob of
skinhead thugs outside the gym jeered him and his teammates,
shouting, as he called it, ``threats and Nazi trash talk.'' And

   IBOGAINE _ WASHINGTON _ A hallucinogenic drug called ibogaine

``trip'' for 48-hours and wake up with no hunger for their junk.
Many also seem disposed by ibogaine to enter psychotherapy,
counseling they will need to stay clean. Research on rats indicates
ibogaine also eliminates hunger for cocaine, nicotine, alcohol and
amphetamines. A University of Miami researcher foresees an
addiction ``patch'' that would use ibogaine or some active portion
of it to help people leave their cravings behind forever. But a
nasty court fight between the University of Miami and the original
discoverer of ibogaine, former Beat Generation heroin addict Howard
Lotsof, over rights to the drug has stalled FDA-sanctioned human
trials. Addicts who believe it will work for them are forced to
either of to two off-shore ibogaine ``clinics,'' one linked to the
University of Miami scientists and the other run by Lotsof.

NETSCAPE'S BROWSER PULLS AHEAD, FOR NOW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget the phrase ``browser wars.'' When it comes to creating
software used to surf the World Wide Web, Netscape Communications
Corp. and Microsoft Corp. are playing a game of leapfrog.
</P>
<P>
   Each company's release of its respective browser is slightly
better than its competitor's _ that is, until the competitor comes
out with a new one. The last time I looked
(www.chron.com/content/chronicle/atchron/97/10/19/compute.html),
Microsoft was in the lead with Internet Explorer 4.01, the
top-notch browser that's also the interface for Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Netscape's turn to hop ahead. The Mountain View,
Calif.-based company has released version 4.5 of its Communicator
Internet suite (home.netscape.com), and it's a winner. Microsoft
has been sent back to the end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   I spent time with two different versions of Communicator 4.5 _
Windows 95/98/NT and one of the many variations of Unix. I did not
get a chance to review the Macintosh version.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4,000 changes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Netscape has made many changes _ more than 4,000, both internal
and external _ to the way the Communicator Suite works. The
Navigator browser, the Messenger e-mail/-Usenet reader and the
address book have been given overhauls.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Communicator's excellence is something called
Smart Browsing, and it's the way Web access should have been all
along. Instead of typing a full Web address into Navigator's
location field _ say, www.houstonchronicle.com _ all you need to
do, in most cases, is enter the name of the site _ in this case,
Houston Chronicle. Is that nifty, or what?
</P>
<P>
   This feature alone makes it worth adopting Communicator as your
primary Internet-access software. It's particularly good for novice
users who may be confused by some of the conventions used in
Universal Resource Locators, or URLs.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Browsing works this way. When you enter the name of a site
instead of a URL, Navigator sends the entry to Netscape's Netcenter
Web site. The name is checked against a large database of known
sites, and you're directed to what Netcenter believes is the
correct one.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not every location in cyberspace is listed. When
Netcenter can't find a match, it runs the entry through its own
search engine. For example, if you enter my name, you won't go
directly to my Web site _ I guess I just don't have that much
juice! _ but you will get the results of a Netcenter search, and
the first choice is my home page.
</P>
<P>
   A companion feature to Smart Browsing is What's Related, a
button just to the right of the location field. If you visit the
Houston Chronicle's Web site and click on What's Related, you get a
list of other newspaper and news sites. Visit a site that
specializes in shareware downloads, and you'll get a list of other
like archives. If there are no matches, you get the option to
search Netcenter for similar sites.
</P>
<P>
   All this adds up to a very powerful combination, making
Netscape's browser a far more useful tool than Internet Explorer
for getting where you need to go.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two windows rolled into one &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Netscape also has made some changes in the way the Messenger
client works and looks. In Communicator 4.0, Messenger was actually
two separate pieces _ a window that showed you all your message
folders, as well as any discussion groups to which you had
subscribed, and another window with the messages themselves. This
seemed like a lot of wasted real estate, so Netscape consolidated
these two windows into one.
</P>
<P>
   In 4.5, you now have a three-paned window, similar to the design
used by Netscape's 3.0 mail client, or Microsoft's Outlook Express.
To the left are the mail folders and news groups. At the top are
the message headers and below are the message bodies. This makes it
very easy to sort mail _ just drag a header from the top pane and
drop it into a folder in the left one.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you'd rather work with a two-pane message window,
just click a button and the folder pane disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The address book is now much friendlier. It will auto-complete
e-mail addresses for you. Type the first few letters of a mail
recipient's name, and Messenger will finish it for you. If there is
more than one address under a person's name, you'll get a list that
lets you choose which to use.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Communicator 4.5 is perfect. It's not.
</P>
<P>
   It still suffers from a serious case of bloat. While it launches
a bit faster than version 4.0, Communicator still has a bigger
footprint than Internet Explorer 4.0, and thus takes longer to
load.
</P>
<P>
   And while it seems to crash less than 4.0, it still dies more
often than it should.
</P>
<P>
   However, Netscape now has added a neat feature that almost makes
a meltdown worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   When Communicator crashes, it generates a detailed log of what
happened. A dialog box pops up that lets you dispatch the log
directly to Netscape, complete with any additional notes you choose
to add. Presumably Netscape's software engineers will use these
details to make the product more stable.
</P>
<P>
   Communicator 4.5 is available in several configurations for
Windows 95/98/NT, Mac and Unix users _ sorry, no Windows 3.1
version is planned. You can get a base, complete and professional
installation. I recommend the complete installation for most users
_ the base version lacks some handy features, and the professional
version is designed for users on corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hefty download, at about 14 megabytes for the Windows
version. But it's more than worth the effort.

PBS OFFERS 2D VIEW OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S MANY DIMENSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It is so tempting to dismiss Frank Lloyd Wright. He
was a monster of egotism. His taste could be appallingly bad. He
spoke in egregious platitudes. He abandoned children and wives. He
made life a misery for almost everyone around him.
</P>
<P>
   And what is worse: His roofs leaked. For an architect, that may
be the worst sin.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how irritating, Wright cannot be dismissed. It
matters not that he insisted he was the greatest architect in
American history. (``Why limit it to America?,'' he then asked.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that no architect of our time _ and probably
not of any other time _ has had so fertile an imagination or
produced so many outstanding buildings.
</P>
<P>
   That is undoubtedly the most infuriating thing about Wright: He
didn't only talk the talk, he walked the walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated him, of course,'' says architect Philip Johnson, ``but
that's only normal when a man is so great.''
</P>
<P>
   From his early ``Prairie Style'' homes near Chicago to his giant
spiral Guggenheim Museum in New York, Wright kept inventing new
ideas. ``Why, I just shake the buildings out of my sleeves,'' he
once said.
</P>
<P>
   You get a very good sense of Wright from the new documentary by
Ken Burns and his collaborator Lynn Novick, which airs Tuesday and
Wednesday on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   In its three hours, spread over two nights, Burns and Novick do
as good a job as you could ask in making both the man and his work
comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   It is a laudable accomplishment because both man and work are
difficult to capture.
</P>
<P>
   The man is difficult because, not only did he change constantly
over his 90-plus years of life, he also notoriously lied about
everything. He was always making orotund pronouncements and
declarations, but not a one of them stands without careful
checking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of him always as the great American confidence man who
is changing the world according to his own images _ who is wearing
many disguises all the time,'' says Yale Professor Vincent Scully
on the series. ``He's right out of Mark Twain; he's right out of
Melville.''
</P>
<P>
   And because Wright led such a sensational life, it would have
been easy for Burns and Novick to sensationalize it. There were ax
murders, insanity, adulteries, divorces, fires, earthquakes and
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But to dwell on such things would be to shortchange the work.
</P>
<P>
   The work has its own difficulties for television, which is not
an ideal medium to present architecture. Simply put, architecture
is 3D; TV is 2D. The missing dimension makes all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   What makes architecture work, and particularly Wright's
architecture, is the shape of its insides, the particular chunk of
air it surrounds with walls. To experience architecture is to walk
through it, sit down in it, see where the space seems to grow and
shrink as you pass through.
</P>
<P>
   So many of us live and work in simple boxlike rooms _ little
boxes inside bigger boxes _ we don't always remember that rooms
don't have to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break the box,'' was one of Wright's war cries. And in his
buildings, he constantly did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of boxes of rooms off a hallway, Wright created vast
open spaces, one room opening into another. In his own home, called
Taliesin, in Wisconsin, you can stand in the center of the house
and see out of it in all four directions.
</P>
<P>
   Wright recreated for us that sense we had more easily when
children that space can have emotional meaning. But you can only
have those emotions when standing (begin ital) in (end ital) those
places. Pictures of them don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers try to overcome this with a moving camera that
takes you through the interiors of several of his best buildings,
like the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Ill., which is a church that has
a main floor that seems to float in the air. Or Fallingwater in
Pennsylvania, which hangs out over a waterfall like an enclosed
diving board.
</P>

<P>
   It's not a perfect solution, but is as good as I've seen on

</P>
<P>
   The film may be the best work Burns has done since his
groundbreaking ``Civil War'' series. Since then, his work has taken
on a cloying sameness, with the techniques that seemed so fresh in
the ``Civil War'' turning to habit and shtick in such later series
as the ones on baseball, Thomas Jefferson and Lewis and Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The twin directors have avoided all the irritating ``Burnsisms''
in ``Frank Lloyd Wright'' to make one of the best documentaries of
the year, and the best I've ever seen on Wright. &QL;

PBS OFFERS 2D VIEW OF FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT'S MANY DIMENSIONS  
 (ADV: ADDS EMBARGO LINE: EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UNDATED - It is so tempting to dismiss Frank Lloyd Wright. He
was a monster of egotism. His taste could be appallingly bad. He
spoke in egregious platitudes. He abandoned children and wives. He
made life a misery for almost everyone around him.
</P>
<P>
   And what is worse: His roofs leaked. For an architect, that may
be the worst sin.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how irritating, Wright cannot be dismissed. It
matters not that he insisted he was the greatest architect in
American history. (``Why limit it to America?,'' he then asked.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that no architect of our time _ and probably
not of any other time _ has had so fertile an imagination or
produced so many outstanding buildings.
</P>
<P>
   That is undoubtedly the most infuriating thing about Wright: He
didn't only talk the talk, he walked the walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated him, of course,'' says architect Philip Johnson, ``but
that's only normal when a man is so great.''
</P>
<P>
   From his early ``Prairie Style'' homes near Chicago to his giant
spiral Guggenheim Museum in New York, Wright kept inventing new
ideas. ``Why, I just shake the buildings out of my sleeves,'' he
once said.
</P>
<P>
   You get a very good sense of Wright from the new documentary by
Ken Burns and his collaborator Lynn Novick, which airs Tuesday and
Wednesday on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   In its three hours, spread over two nights, Burns and Novick do
as good a job as you could ask in making both the man and his work
comprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   It is a laudable accomplishment because both man and work are
difficult to capture.
</P>
<P>
   The man is difficult because, not only did he change constantly
over his 90-plus years of life, he also notoriously lied about
everything. He was always making orotund pronouncements and
declarations, but not a one of them stands without careful
checking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of him always as the great American confidence man who
is changing the world according to his own images _ who is wearing
many disguises all the time,'' says Yale Professor Vincent Scully
on the series. ``He's right out of Mark Twain; he's right out of
Melville.''
</P>
<P>
   And because Wright led such a sensational life, it would have
been easy for Burns and Novick to sensationalize it. There were ax
murders, insanity, adulteries, divorces, fires, earthquakes and
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   But to dwell on such things would be to shortchange the work.
</P>
<P>
   The work has its own difficulties for television, which is not
an ideal medium to present architecture. Simply put, architecture
is 3D; TV is 2D. The missing dimension makes all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   What makes architecture work, and particularly Wright's
architecture, is the shape of its insides, the particular chunk of
air it surrounds with walls. To experience architecture is to walk
through it, sit down in it, see where the space seems to grow and
shrink as you pass through.
</P>
<P>
   So many of us live and work in simple boxlike rooms _ little
boxes inside bigger boxes _ we don't always remember that rooms
don't have to be that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break the box,'' was one of Wright's war cries. And in his
buildings, he constantly did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of boxes of rooms off a hallway, Wright created vast
open spaces, one room opening into another. In his own home, called
Taliesin, in Wisconsin, you can stand in the center of the house
and see out of it in all four directions.
</P>
<P>
   Wright recreated for us that sense we had more easily when
children that space can have emotional meaning. But you can only
have those emotions when standing (begin ital) in (end ital) those
places. Pictures of them don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers try to overcome this with a moving camera that
takes you through the interiors of several of his best buildings,
like the Unity Temple in Oak Park, Ill., which is a church that has
a main floor that seems to float in the air. Or Fallingwater in
Pennsylvania, which hangs out over a waterfall like an enclosed
diving board.
</P>
<P>
   They also use commentary by graceful and knowledgeable speakers
to describe the emotions, so we get a constantly guided tour.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a perfect solution, but is as good as I've seen on
film.
</P>
<P>
   The film may be the best work Burns has done since his
groundbreaking ``Civil War'' series. Since then, his work has taken
on a cloying sameness, with the techniques that seemed so fresh in
the ``Civil War'' turning to habit and shtick in such later series
as the ones on baseball, Thomas Jefferson and Lewis and Clark.

LEVI STRUGGLES IN FACE OF CONSUMER-SAVVY COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The past year has not been kind to Levi Strauss
&AMP; Co. After struggling through layoffs and declining sales, things
took another turn for the worse Thursday when the 148-year-old San
Francisco denim institution announced more belt tightening.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would halt all production of five-pocket
jeans for 60 days starting Dec. 1, a move that will affect 4,037
workers at seven of its 20 U.S. plants.
</P>
<P>
   The news comes barely a year after Levi announced it would close
11 plants in four states, eliminating 6,400 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Levi blames its latest problems on a flat market for its
trademark blue jeans. ``Levi is at a very critical juncture in our
history as we've been faced with unprecedented competition,'' said
company spokeswoman Tamara Churchman. ``My interpretation is the
entire denim market is flat.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not totally flat, however. On the same day Levi announced
the latest action, rival San Francisco-based clothier Gap Inc.
posted a 18 percent sales increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time Gap is doing double-digit increases, Levi's
is seeing double-digit declines,'' said Helen Bulwik, retail
specialist for Andersen Consulting in San Francisco. ``It is not a
decline in the denim market. It is a decline in the sales of Levi
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Retail analysts, who have been watching the decline of the
privately held jeans manufacturing icon for the past year, were not
surprised by this latest round of cuts at Levi.
</P>
<P>
   These analysts believe that the company, which saw sales fall
last year to $6.9 billion from $7.1 billion in 1996, has been
complacent and has failed to respond to its customers in the
increasingly competitive retail jeans market.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were feeling pretty comfortable being the king of the
hill,'' said Harry Bernard, partner with Colton Bernard Inc., an
apparel industry consulting firm based in San Francisco. ``When you
are so successful, it is difficult to believe you can be hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Levi has been hurt. While it continued to focus on its
classic jeans, other manufacturers have come up with jeans with
appeal to customers of all ages.
</P>
<P>
   Competition from both designer labels and old standbys has hurt
Levi. Private-label jeans at well-known retailers like J.C. Penney
Co. and Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. also have cut into sales.
</P>
<P>
   Bulwik said Levi was failing to focus on what the customer
wants. She said the company had a target market that is too narrow,
and that the company had missed the mark in some fashion decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, she said, the Gap appears to be designing clothes
that people want to wear.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Levi's recently introduced hard jean, which is
turning out to be a hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at a young audience, the hard jean is raw, unwashed denim
that has come out at a time when a dark jean is popular with
teen-agers. Even Levi has acknowledged the jean, advertised with
the tag line, ``So stiff you'll have to learn to walk all over
again,'' has not lived up to its expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of speculation that this was not the right thing
to do _ that the customer wants comfort,'' Bulwik said.
</P>
<P>
   This latest slowdown, which will suspend production at the
plants from Dec. 1 to Jan. 31, only affects the company's jeans
that begin with the number ``5,'' such as the classic 501s.
Production will continue for Levi's other brands such as Dockers,
Slate, SilverTab and Red Line.
</P>
<P>
   Churchman said Levi plants typically experience down time from
four to five weeks a year, but that this is the first time the
company has imposed downtime at a number of plants at the same
time. She said production overseas would not increase during this
period.
</P>
<P>
   The workers at the plants, who represent 36 percent of the
company's U.S. plant work force, will receive 90 percent of their
pay along with vacation and holiday pay. Four of the seven plants
are in Texas _ at McAllen, Brownsville, San Benito and Wichita
Falls. The others are at Murphy, N.C.; Mountain City, Tenn.; and
Valdosta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Churchman would not say how much the plant shutdowns would save
the company, only that it would trim production by 3.5 million
pairs of jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fundamentally changing our business model to build our
brand and reduce our operating expenses worldwide,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In July, the company said it would cut jobs to reduce costs by
$200 million. In September, the company announced it would close
two U.S. plants and fire 991 others workers and shut down four
European factories _ three in Belgium and one in France.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Levi slashed 1,000 jobs to cut $80 million in
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were doing bits and pieces of overhaul, I suspect, not to
rip the Band-Aid off the wound so it wouldn't hurt,'' Bernard said.
</P>
<P>
   Levi's latest overhaul plans look worse than they are, according
to Bernard. He said the company needed to develop new products,
revamp its distribution networks and recreate its image.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are caught up in this typhoon of change,'' he said. ``I
don't see them as a quitter and I believe they are prepared to bite
the bullet.''

`THE WATERBOY' SCORES WITH SOME GOOFY HUMOR 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adam Sandler is like the class clown whom teachers, in the
privacy of the teachers' lounge, admit they like. He knows when to
shut up and his jokes are smart.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler and his writing partner Tim Herlihy do not forget which
demographic pays the bills _ 16- to 29-year-old males _ so the
humor is easy. But, it is not entry-level. ``The Waterboy'' is
closer to ``commedia dell'arte'' than Jim Carrey.
</P>
<P>
   The co-writers and director Frank Coraci, who directed Sandler
in ``The Wedding Singer,'' structure the film as a parody of Big
Game sports movies of long ago. They fold in a little Tennessee
Williams, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sandler, with a nasal Cajun accent, plays Bobby Boucher, the
waterboy (or ``water distribution engineer,'' as he prefers) for a
big Louisiana college football team. He is endlessly picked on by
the players, and eventually fired by the coach. Driven to dispense
water, he seeks a job at the bedraggled South Central Louisiana
State University program.
</P>
<P>
   SCLSU has lost 40 games in a row. Home games draw 20 people, the
mascot swigs Jack Daniel's through his mask and Coach Klein (Henry
Winkler) suffers from an ongoing nervous breakdown. He also has a
tattoo of Roy Orbison on his right buttock.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby lives under the oppression of his mama (Kathy Bates), a
Southern Gothic gargoyle who serves Bobby alligators cooked whole
and resists every effort the 31-year-old makes to grow emotionally
past the age of 8.
</P>
<P>
   Then Coach Klein discovers a way to tap into Bobby's inner rage,
which turns the waterboy into a Dick Butkus-type football player.
He puts Bobby in as linebacker and the waterboy becomes a national
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   This is played, energetically, at such a high stage of hyperbole
and stylization that it kneecaps any point at criticizing its
writing. After about an hour, I did feel that the basic font of
humor _ Bobby's visualizing an opposing player as someone who's
been mean to him (morphing special effects makes that easier) and
then crushing him _ gets a little depleted.
</P>
<P>
   The film is amiably goofy. You can never tell when the next bite
of it will produce a joke you weren't quite expecting. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Waterboy'' &QL; 
Starring: Adam Sandler, Henry Winkler, Kathy Bates &QL; 
Rating: PG-13 (for language and some crude sexual humor) &QL;

`CABIRIA' RESTORATION ENHANCES FELLINI CLASSIC 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining the current crowd of important films to enjoy
restoration and rerelease is Federico Fellini's ``Nights of
Cabiria'' (1957).
</P>
<P>
   This was the film Fellini did just before ``La Dolce Vita,'' in
which he firmly established the trademarks and ambience now
universally known to be ``Felliniesque,'' and went from a European
director to an international one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabiria'' is more traditionally sentimental-Italian. Its
centerpiece is Giulietta Masina, Fellini's wife and frequent star,
in one of the roles that defined the template for the ``hooker with
a heart of gold.'' The Broadway musical comedy ``Sweet Charity''
was based upon ``Cabiria.''
</P>
<P>
   The restoration was the project of Canal Plus, the French
TV-film-production company, and Rialto Pictures, an American
distributor that specializes in reissues.
</P>
<P>
   Restorers went back to the original negatives (with mixed
results; in some reels, the film still looks worn and the contrast
flat). The sound _ music by frequent Fellini collaborator Nino Rota
_ has been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most importantly, a new translation was commissioned,
and the English subtitles were expanded and refined to improve
their accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The restorers found a sequence that Fellini has said he was
obliged to remove from the film by the Catholic Church. In the
``man with the sack'' sequence, Cabiria encounters a man who
distributes food to the homeless. Fellini said the church believed
the scene implied that the church was failing to perform its duty
of taking care of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cabiria is a prostitute, you would know it only by the
inference of seeing her stand among other tawdrily dressed women on
a stretch of road. She works the suburbs of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Cabiria's kind of luck is evident from Fellini's opening scene,
where her current boyfriend snatches her purse and pushes her into
the Tiber River.
</P>
<P>
   But the tiny woman with the immense eyes is indomitable. What
makes the character so poignant is that her final fortification is
not her street wisdom _ that's all surface _ but her innocence. Her
ultimate protection is our sympathy for her.
</P>
<P>
   By today's standard, and even by the standard of post-``8 {''
Fellini, the film is a bit arthritic. Masina's performance remains
fascinating. Age 35 when she played Cabiria, Masina came from the
tradition of Italian actressing, where you worked big and you
worked strong. &QL;

THRILLER MAY EVOKE DISTURBING THOUGHTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Siege'' is a cautionary thriller with an effectively
disturbing yield of disquietude.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox reveals the film's major plot points in ads and
theatrical trailers, draining much of the film's anxieties in
advance. But this practice is common. All we can do is recite the
Serenity Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Denzel Washington plays Anthony ``Hub'' Hubbard, who runs the
FBI's counter-terrorism unit in New York City. He must contain the
cadre of Arabs that has entered the United States and launched a
campaign of terrorist bombings.
</P>
<P>
   It would help Hub to have certain information about the wealthy
sheik who is the cadre's sponsor. But that data involves secret
government operations, Army and CIA doings, and the FBI is not on
the need-to-know list.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA is represented by Annette Bening's character, who is
known as both Elise and Sharon. She's in a turf war with Hub, who
is an American first and a cop second. As desperate as he is to
stop the terrorists, Hub believes the U.S. Constitution is written
in stone and shouldn't be violated to catch them.
</P>
<P>
   But after a bus is blown up, and then hundreds of the city's
rich and famous die in a theater bombing, the fear-and-loathing
factor increases. If the president were to evoke the War Powers Act
and put New York City under martial law, Gen. William Devereaux
(Bruce Willis) is the guy who would be the law.
</P>
<P>
   Willis makes him pretty scary. The trailers blab most of the
film's disturbing imagery: the Army vehicles rumbling down American
streets and the football-stadium centers where the government
detains legal-immigrant Arabs, then Arab-Americans, then anyone who
looks Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   But director Edward Zwick has several quieter moments that are
even more unsettling. One scene has Willis telling members of a
congressional committee exactly what to expect when they pop the
top on this martial-law jack-in-the-box. Another shows Hub
confidently telling commanders of the region's law-and-order
brigades that the situation is in hand, and then one by one,
beepers start going off.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, credited to Zwick, Lawrence Wright and Memmo
Meyjes, seeks to keep us interested by asking these questions: Is
Elise/Sharon a double/triple agent? Has Devereaux seen ``Seven Days
in May,'' and can't understand why Burt Lancaster is the bad guy?
When it gets personal for Hub, will he get with the program every
terrified American seems to want and get the U.S. Constitution just
a little bit pregnant to cope with this short-term clear and
present danger?
</P>
<P>
   Washington is fine as this stalwart fighter for truth, justice
and the American way. His repartee with Bening has snap and
crackle.
</P>
<P>
   When you shake this package, though, you hear the rustle of
Styrofoam packing pellets a bit more loudly than you'd wish. There
is much narrative-independent, thriller-standard material: car
chases, skulk sequences.
</P>
<P>
   When the film starts feeling plausible, though, it makes you
think. And you won't like what you think.

`VELVET GOLDMINE' CELEBRATES GLAM-ROCK EXCESSES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The glitter of glam rock is gloriously over the top in ``Velvet
Goldmine,'' writer-director Todd Haynes' visually intoxicating look
at a fictional group of people swept up in the early '70s musical
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes' film unravels as both a murky mystery and a tortured
love story propelled by Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), a reporter
assigned to investigate the rise and fall of temperamental
glam-rock superstar Brian Slade/Maxwell Demon (Jonathan
Rhys-Meyers). A misguided publicity stunt during a concert turned
fans against Slade, who subsequently seemed to drop off the face of
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   In his investigations, Arthur uncovers the anger, despair and
loneliness behind Slade's relationships with two key figures: his
wife, Mandy (Toni Collette), a small-town American who has
reinvented herself as a London party girl, complete with British
accent; and Curt Wild (Ewan McGregor), an intense American rocker
who serves as Brian's source of obsessive inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes has most likely modeled two of his key players after
real-life rock superstars. Though he never makes it specifically
clear anywhere, Brian seems an offshoot of David Bowie in Ziggy
Stardust mode, and Curt could be a slightly skewered reflection of
cult hero Iggy Pop.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes makes use of flashbacks to tell the story. To his credit,
much of the film bristles with a vigorous sense of originality and
sexually charged energy. Lust and longing connect most of the
characters, from kindly agent Cecil, who first discovers Brian at a
seedy club, to Arthur, whose investigation reignites his own
long-forgotten moment of sexual awakening.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Haynes' concepts are often astonishing. He stages
elaborate, otherworldly musical numbers at various points within
the film _ sometimes to propel the action, sometimes just because
he feels like it. In almost every case, the glitter and lipstick
sequences are perfectly in sync with the free-wheeling direction of
the rest of the film.
</P>
<P>
   Pouty-lipped Rhys-Meyers is another perfect match, nicely
balancing vulnerability and brattiness in his portrayal of the
troubled rock star. McGregor is equally affecting in a smaller,
though just as flashy, role. His moments onstage are a fiery blend
of rawness and free spirit, strengthened by the fact that the actor
did most of his own singing.
</P>
<P>
   The always entrancing Collette is very good in a deceptively
frilly role, perfectly capturing the infectious sensuality of a
giddy nightclub maven. When years of turmoil began to expose the
darker side of celebrity, Collette peels away the layers of makeup
and jewelry to reveal a lonely woman broken by the imaginary world
she once thrived upon. The only weak link is Bale, whose
straight-laced portrayal seems a bit dull in the face of so much
decadence.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes' concepts are a bit far-reaching at times, most notably
in his claim of Oscar Wilde as the original glam-rock god. More
often than not, though, ``Velvet Goldmine'' rides a sinfully
delicious balance between historical fact and sparkling fiction.

`PAIR GAIN' NO GAIN FOR MODEMS; UNISTALLER IS BEST WAY TO DELETE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I have been unable to log on to my ISP with a v.90 modem at
speeds faster than 26.4K with either my laptop or desktop. But on a
recent trip to the Boston area, I was able to log on much faster
than I ever have here at home using my laptop. The other day a
telephone repairman was working on a switching unit down the
street. I stopped and asked about log-on speeds. He tells me that
in our area where we have fiber-optic cables, that the phone
company uses ``pair gain'' for economic reasons, and that may slow
my connection down. What is pair gain, and is there anything I can
do about it?
</P>
<P>
   A. I asked a phone company executive about pair gain, and here's
a simplified version of his fairly complex answer:
</P>
<P>
   Pair gain is basically a way of getting more home phone lines
out of a larger trunk line. It uses digital technology to split one
line into two. In theory, a trunk that could carry, say, 64 single
lines can now carry 128 using pair gain.
</P>
<P>
   Pair gain can take place at the neighborhood switch box, or on
the connection box on the side of your home. The latter happens
when you have more than one phone line coming into your house.
</P>
<P>
   When you make a connection using a modem between your house and
your Internet provider's offices, it goes through several break
points. Sometimes the signal being sent between these modems is
digital _ as when it enters a fiber-optic cable, or a digital
switch at a central office _ and sometimes it is analog. Every time
it must be converted, your connection speed will drop by about two
kilobits a second.
</P>
<P>
   A pair-gain connection on the side of your house digitally
splits one line into two. So as the signal enters your phone's
wiring, it's analog, then hits the pair-gain box outside and is
converted to digital _ that takes it down two kilobits. As it makes
its journey across town to your provider, it may be converted
several more times.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that line noise, the quality of the wiring in your home
and at your provider's offices, and you can see that your
connection speed could drop precipitously. But having pair gain in
your neighborhood is not the sole culprit _ it only drops the speed
by two kilobits.
</P>
<P>
   Upon request, if there is an adequate quantity of phone lines in
your neighborhood, Southwestern Bell will remove a pair-gain
connection from your house and replace it with two separate lines.
However, there are no guarantees. Unfortunately, in Texas, the
phone company is only required to guarantee connection speeds of
2,400 bits a second _ an antiquated standard in the Internet Age.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently installed a demo program on my Windows 98 system.
I tried the program, didn't care for it and now I want to get rid
of it. However, when I went to look in the Add/Remove Programs
list, I didn't see it. I don't own an uninstall program. How do I
remove this safely?
</P>
<P>
   A. There's no easy way to remove software without an Add/Remove
listing or an uninstaller, but there may be an uninstall module
available for that program. Check the program group for the demo to
make sure there's not an uninstall feature there. If not, use My
Computer to go into the folder where the program itself is stored
and look for an uninstall module. It may be called REMOVE or
UNWISE, or something that gives you a clue that it will erase the
program from your drive.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't find it, you could delete the folder and use the
Registry Editor (REGEDIT.EXE) to delete all references to it from
the Windows Registry. You'd also have to check the WIN.INI,
SYSTEM.INI and possibly AUTOEXEC.BAT files for entries related to
the program. However, this kind of surgery is not for the faint of
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Your best bet _ do the right thing and get an uninstaller,
pronto.

HUNTER, DEVITO FIRST-RATE IN `LIVING OUT LOUD' 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Right from its first frame, we know that ``Living Out Loud'' is
going to be a movie for grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Hunter, as pushing-40 Judith, looks across the dining
table at her cardiologist husband and says, ``Don't treat me like
I'm stupid, Bob, that's all I ask.'' She begs a little with her
expression, asking him to respect her by telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Bob then treats her as if she is very stupid, denying in the
face of all evidence that he's been cheating with a pediatrician.
``She's 34,'' Bob finally admits. Judith's crumpled expression says
that the scene is over, and so is the 16-year marriage. She's not
going to win the 40 vs. 34 battle, not with this guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' is the directorial debut of its writer,
Richard LaGravenese. He is the maker of miracles who reached into
the goo that was ``The Bridges of Madison County'' and came out
with a screenplay Clint Eastwood could shoot. He also wrote the
screenplays for ``Beloved,'' ``The Fisher King,'' ``The Ref'' and
the little-seen heartbreaker ``Unstrung Heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   As a director, he can't quite pull off the ambitions of his
screenplay. In consequence, his quirky romance/comedy is a little
messy. But in the end, that somehow becomes endearing.
</P>
<P>
   In her luxury New York City co-op, Judith starts an involuntary
new life with open wounds and all by herself; the friends the
ex-couple had were Bob's.
</P>
<P>
   LaGravenese interpolates fantasy sequences. In one, Judith
arises from her bed and leaps out the window. When the camera pans
back to the bed, Judith is still in it, and her suicide is on the
TV news. ``By a bizarre coincidence,'' says the newscaster, ``she
landed on her ex-husband and his new wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one night, she notices a little man. We've already spent
some time with Pat (Danny DeVito), the co-op's night-shift elevator
operator and doorman. Enough time to know that his wife kicked him
out after 25 years of marriage, his teen-age daughter has just died
of cancer, and he has a gambling problem. But he's holding onto his
dream of running an import business.
</P>
<P>
   Judith and Pat become ears for each other. Friends when both
need friends. It will become complicated when Pat's feelings become
elevated beyond friendship and Judith's do not.
</P>
<P>
   LaGravenese gives his film a vinyl-LP ambience by often
following Judith, a fan of cabaret singers, to the joint where Liz
(Queen Latifah) sings her Billie Holiday-ish numbers. Liz becomes
for Judith a listening character, advice-giver and occasional
provocateur as Judith tries to get her life together.
</P>
<P>
   As he's often proved, LaGravenese writes funny and poignant
dialogue that gives actors easy and strong purchase upon their
characters. Hunter and DeVito are first-rate.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution LaGravenese has waiting for us is not what we
expect, and it feels exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living Out Loud'' should particularly resonate with women at
Judith's passage of life, especially any who have buried their
identities within their husband's.
</P>
<P>
   Judith is less bitter about being abandoned for a younger woman
than she is about having so little to show for the 16-year
investment of time. Bob didn't bother to give enough of himself to
have children with her. In 16 years as a ``cardiologist's wife'' _
that's how she identified herself _ she never learned to give
anything to herself.
</P>
<P>
   She's 40, and she's got only 24 years' equity in her own life. &QL;

FILMMAKER BURNS: WRIGHT CHANGED `THE WAY WE LIVE'  
 (EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVE WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - To PBS documentarian Ken Burns, architect Frank Lloyd
Wright's life and work are equally compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Calling him ``without a doubt our greatest architect,'' Burns
said Wright changed ``forever the way we look at human space, the
way we live, the way we consider our place in the grand scheme of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   And architecture ``is the most important of all art forms,''
added Burns, in a recent meeting with TV critics. ``Whether we know
it or not, architecture is working on us nearly every moment of our
lives, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We notice our surroundings sometimes, but usually fail to
understand the combination of oppressive and exhilarating forces
that speak to us, influence us and change us daily through the
choices architects, past and present, have made.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a timelessness to the Wright buildings that
you experience the second you walk into them. . . . It seems to me
that he asked a question that all of us want to ask and always
forget to ask, which is, `Why are we here and what is the purpose
of being here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And Frank Lloyd Wright actually answers it.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple Wright's achievements with what Burns called his ``long,
dramatic, turbulent, controversial, sometimes tragic roller coaster
of a life,'' and you've got the perfect subject of a Burns film,
which is actually the pivot piece of a five-part series of
(comparatively) short biographies that Burns began with ``Thomas
Jefferson'' and ``Lewis&AMP; Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Next in the series is a dual biography of suffragists Elizabeth
Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The capper, which likely won't appear
until 2001, covers Mark Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Burns and his collaborators are also working hard to complete
the third element in a trilogy of long-form documentaries that
started with ``The Civil War,'' then moved to ``Baseball.'' The
final installment, ``Jazz,'' is due to air in fall 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of the heavy workload, Burns, with ``Wright,''
shares a director's credit for the first time. She's Lynn Novick, a
Yale grad who has worked as a producer and interviewer with Burns'
production company, Florentine Films, since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Big pieces of ``Frank Lloyd Wright'' focus on its subject's
personal life, often in uncomplimentary detail. Novick said the
outrageous turns Wright's life took couldn't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt that we were making the film not for only an audience
of people who already know about Frank Lloyd Wright, or who were
already interested in architecture, but for a broad, general
audience who can, through understanding about Frank Lloyd Wright,
begin to consider some of these ideas about what architecture is,
and what it means to be a creative person in a society,'' said
Novick, who also met the critics. ``We felt that if we focused only
on the art, we would never be able to really reach that audience.
So it was impossible to avoid his personal life. And it was also
extremely fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most fascinating things about Wright's life was that
it had a second act, which perfectly fits the two-part structure of
the Burns-Novick film.
</P>
<P>
   At age 60, Wright is ``washed up and through,'' Burns said.
``And by the time he's 70, he's embarking on the most productive
part of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   You could even argue Wright's life had a third act, in the
flowering of stunning designs he did near the very end of his long
life. Whatever lessons John Glenn is teaching our culture about age
and accomplishment, Wright's life ought to be equally inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he never lost faith,'' Novick added. ``He never thought
his career was over just because everybody else thought so. He
didn't think that. So, he got up every day thinking, `Something
great's going to happen. I'm going to get a new commission.' '' &QL;

 &HT;    End of Life as we know it
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life University has had one of the nation's most successful
basketball programs this decade, averaging 31 victories a year
since the program was started in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But this season could be painful for the Eagles, who have the
nation's longest current home-winning streak, 87 games. All five
starters are gone from last year's 32-4 squad, and three of the top
newcomers are injured.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the misfortune, veteran guard Tony Phillips sustained
third-degree burns over most of the lower part of his body in a
grease fire and will be limited in what he can do for the Eagles in
the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is a healing session,'' coach Roger Kaiser said.
``Chiropractors can do things with the back, but we need healing in
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Eagles are to overcome some obstacles and enjoy moderate
success, three newcomers will have to ignore their own pain and
contribute _ Cincinnati transfer Marko Wright, a 6-2 junior guard;
Florida transfer Jamaal Horton, a 6-2 senior guard; and Conners
State (Okla.) Communty College transfer Torrin Hawkins (6-5).
</P>
<P>
   Senior Mark Christian (6-6, 220) is the Eagles' top returnee.
</P>
<P>
   OGLETHORPE: The Stormy Petrels seldom have had it this good.
</P>
<P>
   After working as an assistant to former coach Jack Berkshire for
17 years, Jim Owen has perhaps the most talented group of starters
during his time at the Division III school in north Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nine returning players who helped post a 17-8 record
last season are four senior starters who can play with the best in
the 10-team Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference (SCAC).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest impact player is Chris Wall, a 6-6, 220-pound post
player who has been named to the Division III preseason All-America
team. Wall averaged 20 points and six rebounds last season.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors Don Brown (6-4, 200), Mike Deckert (6-3) and Billy
LoPresti (6-0) combined for 34.5 points and 10 assists a game.
</P>
<P>
   EMORY: The Eagles, one of the top defensive teams in Division
III the past five years, will try to improve on last season's 14-11
record under the guidance of new head coach Brett Zuver. As Pete
Manuel's replacement, Zuver, who comes to Emory after four years as
head coach at Colorado College, returns 15 lettermen in the
non-scholarship program.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is Lewis Satterwhite, who averaged 9.2 points and 7.8
rebounds last season.

 &HT;    Complacency may be Clark's biggest worry this season
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several seasons ago, Clark Atlanta jumped into the national
spotlight when it started 15-0. Coach Anthony Witherspoon makes it
sound as if this current group of Panthers is capable of similar
feats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team reminds of the one that started 15-0 two years
ago,'' said Witherspoon, who has averaged 20 wins the past three
years at his alma mater. ``We're in situation where we've got all
our starters back, and a total of 11 guys who can play. They've
been in the system, and they know our philosophy. The only thing we
have to worry about is complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-sport standout Juan Gaston returns after averaging 21.3
points and 10.3 rebounds last season. Three seniors will help lead
the Panthers _ forwards Eric Jones (6-10, 220) and Juan Wharton
(6-7, 190) and guard John Sanders, along with sophomore Malcolm
Batchelor, who led the team in assists last season.
</P>
<P>
   Among the top newcomers are Horace Pollard, a 6-9, 245-pound
post player who transfererred from Northeastern Illinois. Glen
Catchings, a 6-10, 225-pound center who was redshirted last season,
returns.
</P>
<P>
   MORRIS BROWN: In his second year at his alma mater, Russell
Ellington is looking to the future of the Wolverines. After a 10-17
record last season, Ellington and assistant Wally West decided the
method of recruiting had to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and got seven freshmen, because it's important
that we have some retention in the program, which is something we
haven't had lately,'' Ellington said.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, the Wolverines will count heavily on the JUCO
transfers, including 6-2 guard Walter Lesure and post player
Launeze Thomas, 6-8, 220-pound center. Several players who were in
the program two years ago, but not on the roster last season,
return _ point guard Brandon Lewis and redshirt junior Chris
Pollard, a 6-4 forward.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard Quontell Harold is the lone starter returning. He
is being challenged by freshman Anthony Adams from Southwest DeKalb
High. Kareen Allison, a 6-5 freshman from Savannah's Beach High
School, has mounted a strong challenge for a starting post.
</P>
<P>
   MOREHOUSE: With one key player academically ineligible and
another sidelined indefinitely by knee surgery, coach Arthur McAfee
is having a hard time getting a fix on his 1998-'99 squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about every year I've been here, I've been able to pretty
much tell what kind of a team we were going to have heading into
the season,'' said McAfee, working with his 34th group of Maroon
Tigers. ``That's not the case this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Smith, a 6-6 forward who averaged 15.7 points and 4.3
rebounds last season, failed to amass enough credits to be
eligible. Atlantan Michael Harris, a 6-4 swingman and the team's
most consistent player the past two years, suffered ligament damage
in a knee and could be lost for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Those misfortunes have broadened the roles of returning starters
Justin Miller, a 6-5 senior, and junior James Teague (6-7). McAfee
thinks senior Darren Marshall (6-9) should have ``a breakthrough
year'' to help the Maroon Tigers' play inside.
</P>
<P>
   In the backcourt, where 6-5 junior Corey McBride might be forced
to play, freshman Courtney Edwards from Towers High could start
alongside sophomore Brian Delaney.

 &HT;    Driesell has high hopes for Morris, GSU this year
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lefty Driesell of Georgia State, 36 years deep into the coaching
business and one career victory shy of No. 700, has not enjoyed
many seasons more than he did his last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved last year's team. The kids were enthusiatic, and we
got the most out of them,'' Driesell said. ``It was a lot of fun
coaching them.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first year at the university in downtown Atlanta,
Driesell and his staff guided a bunch of overachievers to 16
victories.The 34-year-old program had recorded 16 wins only once
before.
</P>
<P>
   All-star point guard Rodney Hamilton, who led the Panthers in
scoring, assists and steals, piloted the 1997-98 squad. Shooting
guard Shellord Pinkett was the second-leading scorer. Both are
gone, but the Panthers are expected to be better in both the
backcourt and up front.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of Hamilton, Pinkett and company, this version of
Panthers will be led by Kevin Morris, the transfer from Georgia
Tech, and Anton Reese, the former Lithonia High star who
transferred from Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Stricker, a 6-11, 265-pound junior, is expected to be
Georgia State's impact player inside after he becomes eligible in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Morris and Reese will play the major roles for a team
picked to win the Trans America Athletic Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Morris impressed Driesell during the preseason, and the coach
compares him favorably with former Maryland players John Lucas and
Brad Davis, both of whom had long NBA careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a good point guard when I see him, and Kevin ranks
right up there with those two guys, only he's probably a better
defensive player,'' Driesell said. ``He's going to be terrific for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese, a 6-3 junior from Lithonia, showed his talent in a recent
40-minute scrimmage. Reese scored 49 points _ hitting on 11 of 18
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anton (has) got to work on his defense, but he can flat-out
shot the ball,'' Driesell said. ``But what's important is he and
Kevin really complement each other well.''
</P>
<P>
   Four players return from last year's team, including senior
forward Maurice Robertson (6-5, 215), junior forward Torquin
Gresham (6-7, 220), junior swingman Chad Searcy (6-5, 185) and
senior forward Quincy Gause (6-5, 185), who will be ineligible
until Decemeber. That foursome started a combined total of 73 games
and averaged 35.7 points and 21.4 rebounds, collectively.
</P>
<P>
   The bench is stronger with the arrival of Jarrod Hill, a 6-8
post player transferee from Pasco-Hernando Community College in
Florida, and AtlantanMarkeal King, a 6-9, 240-pound junior center
who last played at Coffeyville (Kan.) Community College. Freshman
Donnie Davis, from Collins High in Lawerenceville, could play a
lot. Even at 6-7, 195 pounds, Davis has shown enough versatility
and ball-handling skills to play the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can actually play four positions,'' Driesell said of Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia State, in a conference that saw perennial power College
of Charleston and Florida International exit for other leagues,
will play a schedule that includes Georgetown, Kansas State, Miami
and Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good schedule, not a great one,'' Driesell said.
``But the most important thing for us is to get to the NCAA
(tournament), and to do that in our league we'll have to win the
conference tournament. That's our biggest goal.''

NO FEAR, NEWT _ YOU'LL KEEP THE CHAIR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a prediction: Newt Gingrich will not be overthrown as
speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Forget all that punditry we've been hearing about a major revolt
resulting from the revolting results _ for Republicans _ of the
1998 congressional elections. Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick
Armey will surely do whatever it takes to retain their power.
</P>
<P>
   I'm guessing that none of the congressional malcontents has the
savvy or the fortitude to successfully challenge the Gingrich-Armey
team.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying that the GOP took a beating at the polls,
surrendering five of the 11 seats that would have enabled Democrats
to wipe out the Republicans' majority in the House. Republicans
settled for a standoff in the Senate, retaining their 55-45
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The troops may be justifiably dissatisfied with Newt's
leadership, but they have no viable alternative. If the dissidents
did manage to dump Gingrich, who would take his place?
</P>
<P>
   Armey won't jump ship, and even if he did, he'd never be chosen
as speaker. His surly, incoherent performance on ``Nightline'' the
other night proved to anyone who didn't already know it that Armey
lacks the PR skills to be speaker of the House.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains. Who replaces Newt if rebellious
Republicans muscle him out of the speaker's chair?
</P>
<P>
   The would-be mutineers are apparently hard-core conservatives
whose discontent with Gingrich stems from their belief that he is
not conservative enough. Can you imagine such a thing _ Newt
Gingrich not conservative enough?
</P>
<P>
   The House members who are screaming for Newt's head on a platter
would insist on a successor who would take a harder line than
Gingrich on everything from tax cuts to presidential impeachment.
More moderate Republicans would never go along with that; in their
minds, the main problem with Gingrich as speaker is the perception
among many just plain voters that he is an uncompromising
right-winger.
</P>
<P>
   Would it make sense to toss him out of the speakership and elect
someone who really is an uncompromising right-winger? Of course
not.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate House members are said to be upset with Gingrich
because of his last-minute decision to pollute some House races
with $10 million worth of anti-Clinton ads. But those members know
that the conservative rebels would never accept any successor to
Gingrich put forth by moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged uprising in the House is going nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Gingrich won't have to take some heat
for his role in frittering away the commanding position that the
Republican Party occupied after seizing control of Congress four
years ago. GOP majorities should be growing, not shrinking or
staying the same. The Republican agenda should be well on its way
to becoming the law of the land, not withering in the shadow of
proposals pushed through Congress by a scandal-plagued president.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich can legitimately be criticized by conservatives for
failing to carry on the Republican revolution of 1994. He can be
criticized by moderates for failing to jump onto the
``compassionate conservative'' bandwagon that carried Republicans
such as Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Florida Gov.-elect Jeb Bush
to spectacular victories.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow Gingrich must reconcile these competing views of
Republicanism and unite his troops behind an agenda that all
Republicans can support.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's too much to ask of an individual as naturally
combative and instinctively reluctant to compromise as Gingrich.
Maybe he simply lacks the flair for conciliation to bridge such a
vast philosophical gap. Or maybe he lacks the vision to see that
such conciliation is desirable.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich remains the House Republicans' best _ only _ hope
to bring about the needed unity. If he can't do it, it can't be
done.
</P>
<P>
   There may be potentially more effective leaders than Gingrich,
but none that would be acceptable to the disparate factions in the
House. For better or worse, the GOP is stuck with Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The troops may be revolted, but they will not revolt.

impeachable offense by 2000 remains to be seen. But the Texas
governor gladly bucks the ``official language'' movement, which
with flag-burning amendments and school-prayer amendments is a
favorite in the politics of people who need to get lives.
</P>
<P>
   If in fact Bush runs for president he'll have to deal with the
focus-group geeks who will seek to convince him that all of these
are issues that bear on the nation's sovereignty. He'll also be
informed that the sprinkling of holy water by the religious right
is the first initiation he will have to make.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't need it in Texas. What he did in winning his second
term by a landslide was tune out the most strident members of his
party.
</P>
<P>
   And so have other GOP governors who looked good Tuesday, while
some, like Bible-thumping Alabama Gov. Fob James, got sent packing.
</P>
<P>
   Pragmatic. Moderate. Careful to steer clear of tar pits of
ideology. Those are traits being ascribed to GOP governors who held
their seats Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any time for these ideological battles,'' said
Christine Todd Whitman, the pro-choice Republican New Jersey
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bush calls himself ``pro-life,'' but gives the abortion issue a
double-wide berth. He will divert the discussion to just about
anything else. His issues have been education reform, juvenile
justice and _ well, not a lot else. He wants it that way. An
attempt in 1997 to restructure the state tax system was his most
ambitious legislative initiative. It fell through and he's not
about to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   What key issue would Bush bring to the national debate? Good
question. I think Bush is asking that himself. Pending a release of
copyright from Rodney King, it might be, ``Can't everyone just get
along?''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has conveyed any overriding message in Austin it's been
one of political conciliation, a suggestion handled in Republican
leadership circles in Washington like ebola on a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Another area in which Bush has managed to do what his partisan
kin in Washington have not is to succeed in appealing to
minorities, principally Hispanics. Like his brother Jeb did in
winning the Florida gubernatorial race, he won over 50 percent of
the Latino vote. His calculated _ many will say perfunctory and
patronizing _ appeal to Hispanics included bilingual billboards.
But Bush also has managed to avoid big fights over hot-button
issues like ``official English'' and bilingual education, and he's
maintained impeccable relations with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1968 Republicans decided that the way to gain the White
House was to appeal subtly or directly to the racial fears of the
white majority: the so-called southern strategy. In many ways it
worked to help the party break the Democrats' stronghold on Dixie.
But in Tuesday's southern elections, the role of people of color
became clear in close races. In North Carolina, the black vote
helped defeat hard-right senator Lauch Faircloth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush doesn't consider himself a political genius, but he does
know his basic math skills. And the numbers in this country reflect
the growing presence of Hispanics and the importance of not
alienating whole seas of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the winning 'southern strategy' may be to play
less to the right and more to the non-white. We'll see if the GOP's
pale power brokers will ever allow that of the candidate who
carries their banner.

 &HT;    GRAMM WANTS MORE CUTS IN FEES PAID TO SEC
 &HT;    448 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Companies could find it cheaper to raise money
through stock and bond sales if the new chairman of the Senate
banking committee has his way.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who is in line to lead the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee after the election
defeat of Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said last week that he will
``continue to work'' to cut the fees collected on stock and bond
sales by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've really seen is these fees become a revenue source
for the government,'' Gramm said in an interview. ``Small companies
that are trying to raise capital and create jobs end up paying
taxes they ought not to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   The so-called registration fees pay for the SEC's operations,
including its review of corporate reports, enforcement of
securities laws, regulation of mutual funds and oversight of stock
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   But the fees generate an enormous surplus over the SEC's needs,
and that irritates Gramm, who called the excess an unfair tax on
business. The fee excess stays in the U.S. treasury, to be spent
wherever Congress and the president agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're collecting about three times as much money as we need to
run the SEC,'' Gramm said. ``And I just I think that's about as
inefficient a way to collect taxes as you can have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm was a key Senate supporter of a 1996 bill that set a
10-year timetable for phasing out the excessive fees. In 1997, the
first year the bill was in effect, companies paid $303 in
registration fees for each $1 million raised in a stock or bond
offering. From that total, $200 per $1 million went to the U.S.
treasury and $103 was dedicated to SEC operations.
</P>
<P>
   Under that formula, Austin-based Pervasive Software Inc. paid
about $5,635 in registration fees when the company raised $18.6
million in its initial public offering in September 1997. The
company's contribution to the SEC's operations was about $1,915,
and its contribution to the U.S. treasury was $3,720.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 legislation contains a plan to end the treasury
contributions by 2007 and leave a fee assessment that is just big
enough to keep the SEC operating. The formula for the current
fiscal year, which started Oct. 1, sets the registration fee at
$278 per $1 million in stock or bond sales. The fee should be no
more than $67 per $1 million by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   That may not be soon enough for the incoming chairman of the
Senate banking committee, which oversees the SEC and other
securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to oppose the collection of fees that are three
times as high as the cost of the SEC,'' Gramm said. ``I'm going to
continue to work to cut those fees.''

WRIGHT'S MIRAGES IN THE DESERT  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Frank Lloyd Wright had a long and fruitful love affair
with Arizona and the desert, and there are 11 of his buildings
extant in the metropolitan Phoenix area. But out of the three best
known and most innovative designs, one was never built, another was
really designed for the sands of Iraq, and the third isn't his at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was born in Wisconsin in 1867 and made his home there
near Spring Green in a fabulous piece of architectural
inventiveness he called Taliesin. But from 1938 until his death in
1959, he was a snowbird, making a second home in Scottsdale, which
he called Taliesin West, ``a look over the rim of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation still works at Taliesin
West during the winter, opting out of the snow and ice of the
Midwest. Taliesin West is also a prime tourist location, offering
tours every day.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wright site most people remember is the Arizona Biltmore
resort, which is not actually a Wright building. It was designed by
Wright disciple Albert Chase McArthur, with some kvetching and
nudging by his mentor, and using the so-called ``textile blocks''
that Wright had engineered.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Biltmore certainly has a Wright look on the outside,
but inside it is something more conventional than Mr. Wright would
have come up with. (His followers still refer to him deferentially
always as ``Mr. Wright.'')
</P>
<P>
   Kvetching was a Wright trademark. When power lines were being
constructed across North Scottsdale, Wright wrote a personal letter
to the president of the United States complaining that it was
ruining his view.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive design for an Arizona building was never
constructed.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 1957 design for the Arizona state capitol. Called
simply, ``Oasis,'' it was not a single building, but a complex of
governmental sites planned for Papago Park in Phoenix, where it
would sit in an ideal desert landscape.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been a copper-clad, hexagonal domed structure,
with a garden under a lattice canopy of precast concrete. Native
onyx columns would have supported the dome, which in turn was meant
to shelter six-sided House and Senate chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Wright wanted to make government accessible and inviting to the
public. Undoubtedly ahead of its time, Oasis was never close to
being adopted.
</P>
<P>
   His other major public building was Gammage Auditorium on the
campus of Arizona State University in Tempe. But it was not
originally designed for ASU.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957, he was invited to design the ``Crescent Opera, Civic
Auditorium and Garden of Eden'' to be built on the Tigris River in
Baghdad. It was a huge and typically visionary plan Wright came up
with, including a gigantic ziggurat to serve as a monument to
Haroun al-Rashid.
</P>
<P>
   It was never built, but when ASU came to Wright for a new
concert hall for the campus, he adapted his Baghdad design to come
up with Grady Gammage Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't completed till after the architect's death, but in the
dedication concert in 1964, Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia
Orchestra played Richard Strauss' ``Heldenleben,'' or ``The Hero's
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that Frank Lloyd Wright would have been tremendously
pleased,'' Ormandy remarked. &QL;

DEMOCRATIC SURGE AIDED BY CONSERVATIVE WINNERS IN HOUSE RACES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The stunning wave of Democratic victories on
Election Day was aided by the triumph of three unlikely candidates:
Conservative Democrats who oppose the party's position on abortion
and other social issues.
</P>
<P>
   These three new lawmakers _ Ronnie Shows in Mississippi, David
Phelps in Illinois, and Ken Lucas in Kentucky _ won in districts
where a liberal or moderate Democrat would likely have been
defeated by conservative Republican opponents. But without this
trio, the Democratic gain in the House would have been reduced to
two seats from five.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three _ Shows and Lucas _ represent pickups of
Republican seats for Democrats. Shows, a regional highway
commissioner, replaces retiring Rep. Mike Parker, R-Miss. His
victory was cemented by a higher-than-expected turnout of
African-American voters for Democrats across the South.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, a county judge, takes the seat of Rep. Jim Bunning,
R-Ky., who gave up his seat to run for a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps, a gospel singer and locally popular gospel singer, moves
into the seat of Rep. Glenn Poshard, D-Ill., who quit to run,
unsuccessfully, for governor of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   All three victors are abortion opponents. Their views on a range
of controversial issues from school prayer to gun control read more
like they come out of the Republican playbook than the Democratic
one.
</P>
<P>
   They also show that Democrats, like Republicans, are facing up
to the ``big tent'' phenomenon of American politics _ how to gather
diverse viewpoints under a common party banner.
</P>
<P>
   The wins reflect the recruiting efforts of Rep. Martin Frost,
D-Texas, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee, who was said to be dismayed by the recent wave of
Republican triumphs in southern and rural districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We very consciously sought out candidates who fit their
districts rather than fitting them into an inside-the-Beltway idea
of what a Democrat should be,'' said DCCC spokeswoman Olivia
Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan acknowledged that the price of victory would be a slight
chipping away of Democratic solidarity on core issues such as
abortion that are important to some Democratic constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to agree on everything, but we do agree that
progress is preferable to this partisan gameplaying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While conservative on social and economic issues, Lucas and
Shows backed the mainstream party view on Social Security: Rebuild
the system of guaranteed government retirement benefits rather than
construct a new one based on private accounts tied to financial
markets, a position favored by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps campaigned on two other Democratic themes: More money for
school construction and federal legal limits on campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative House Democrats rejoiced over the prospect of their
ranks swelling. ``We're tickled,'' said Jeff Fleming, press
spokesman for Rep. John Tanner, D-Tenn., chair of the Blue Dog
Coalition, an alliance of House Democrats built around a
conservative viewpoint on economic issues.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition had endorsed Lucas, Shows and Phelps as well as
three other fiscally conservative Democrats who won. Five
candidates backed by the coalition lost.
</P>
<P>
   While licking their wounds, conservative Republicans also tried
to look on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the degree there are more pro-life Democratic members in
the House, that's good news for the country,'' said Peter
Dickinson, executive director of the conservative Campaign for
Working Families, which raised about $3 million for over 200
conservative candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The group had backed Gex Williams, defeated by Lucas in
Kentucky, as well as Brent Winters, beaten by Phelps in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Democrats also won support from Christian-right
voters who have voted in the past for Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Christian Coalition found Democratic
congressional candidates in 1998 receiving 31 percent of the
religious right vote _ 11 percentage points higher than 1994.
Republican candidates, on the other hand, got 54 percent _ down 13
points from 1994, the survey found.

GORE ONE OF THE BIG WINNERS FROM DEMOCRATIC SUCCESSES 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One of the big winners during the election last
week was a man whose name never appeared on a ballot: Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   By campaigning tirelessly for Democratic candidates, many of
whom pulled off surprising upsets last Tuesday, Gore solidified his
position as the Democratic front-runner for president as the race
for 2000 begins.
</P>
<P>
   And despite polls showing Gore trailing Texas Republican Gov.
George W. Bush in a race for the White House, the incumbent vice
president will be a formidable force when the actual contest rolls
around in two years. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll showed Bush
leading Gore 57 percent to 39 percent if the vote were taken now.
</P>
<P>
   During a post-election appearance, Gore brushed aside a question
about presidential surveys. ``We just had one election. We're
focused on the agenda right here,'' Gore said after making an
announcement on domestic violence at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who had made no secret of who he favors for
the Democratic nomination, allowed Gore to appear first before the
media to give his post-election views.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big agenda and I think that part of the message from
the election (Tuesday night) was, get on with that agenda, focus on
the challenges that are confronting the American people and the
United States of America, and I hope and expect that the Congress
will hear that message,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   George Strong, a Texas consultant who helped Gore in his 1988
presidential bid, said, ``If I was Gore I would take a big sigh of
relief and focus on these issues that we know the American people
are interested in and be the party of new ideas in the next two
years ...''
</P>
<P>
   Strong said the early national polls pitting Bush and Gore mean
little because many people confuse the Texas governor with his
father who served as president. Still, Strong said if Bush were the
Republican nominee he would not be inclined to advise Gore or
another other Democrat that they would have a chance of carrying
Texas against the popular governor.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said Gore positioned himself well
during the 1998 elections. ``He covered a lot of ground out there
in the country. He really helped a lot of people. He was able to
make new friends. It was one of those wonderful situations where
helping other people helps yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Boyle, executive director of the New Hampshire Democratic
Party, said Gore played ``an extremely supportive role'' in helping
Democrats win in a state that holds the nation's first nominating
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped us raise money. He gave us visibility. He came into
the state whenever we needed it,'' Boyle said, adding Gore remained
sensitive to helping Democrats last week rather than appearing to
position himself for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle said the campaigning for the New Hampshire primary began
Tuesday night as Gore and other Democratic hopefuls called state
party winners throughout the night. Though a traditionally
Republican state, Democratic Gov. Jeanne Shaheen retained her
office and Democrats captured control of the state Senate for the
first time since 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle also noted an incumbent vice president has not lost his
party's nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a California political commentator, said
Gore also is well positioned to capture the nation's largest state.
Gore campaigned heavily for governor-elect Gray Davis and incumbent
Sen. Barbara Boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public face of campaign 2000, so far as the California
Democrats are concerned, is Al Gore,'' Jeffe said. ``He really
resonates with California Democrats, particularly on the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic victories also helped Gore in a number of
indirect ways, experts said. The wins pushed Republicans to retreat
from plans for lengthy impeachment hearings into President
Clinton's affair with an intern. Gore, hammered by Republicans for
his role in questionable fund-raising activities in 1996, may see
the burden of running with a scandal-ridden administration lifted
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really appears Gore right now can be comfortable running as
Clinton's heir apparent because to many people he could be Clinton
without the liabilities,'' said Robert Holsworth, a political
science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the increase of five Democrats in the House puts the party
within six wins of regaining control of the House for the first
time since 1994. The prospect of regaining control may give pause
to the presidential ambitions of Minority Leader Richard Gephardt,
the Missouri Democrat viewed as Gore's chief rival for the
Democratic nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who has stronger ties to the liberal wing, could focus
on becoming speaker rather than take a long-shot bid to become
president. And, for this mid-term election, Gephardt had to be more
concerned about helping Democrats win House seats rather that
positioning himself in key states.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gephardt has been out here (California) he hasn't been
visible,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   But the nominating process is still more than a year away and
it's a political lifetime until the election. The key for Gore in
both the nominating process and the election itself will be the
nation's economy, Holsworth said. &QL;

DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION: HOV 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DAN FELDSTEIN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Martin Ebeling, retired from maintenance at a candle
manufacturer, has never met the general manager of the Metropolitan
Transit Authority or any other transportation big shots. But the
Houston resident fancies himself as something of an expert in their
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think HOV lanes are a waste of the taxpayers' money,'' he
declares. ``The biggest part of the day, they're not being used for
anything!''
</P>
<P>
   Such free-lance critics of high-occupancy vehicle lanes have
existed for years, envious of the pavement they could not use. They
often are dismissed by Metro, the HOV landlord, as simply not
understanding how the lanes work.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the ranks of HOV skeptics have been growing
larger than the occasional retiree. Across the nation,
environmentalists, regular commuters and many bona fide
transportation professionals are beginning to pronounce HOV lanes a
well-intentioned policy that has failed.
</P>
<P>
   Ebeling believes the lanes are ``empty,'' and that's enough for
him. But he may not know assertions made by transportation
engineers:
</P>
<P>
   First, during the peak of rush hour, when they aren't empty,
most Houston HOV lanes may be saving only a few minutes driving
time compared to the regular freeway lanes. Second, HOVs may
actually do very little to clean the air or foster the creation of
car pools.
</P>
<P>
   But before Ebeling asks for a permanent spot on the Metro board
of directors, he should know one other thing. Even leading critics
say that Houston _ with $380 million &UR;  &LR; worth of HOV lanes snaking
along the median strips of 74 miles of freeways _ may have one of
the few successful HOV systems in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With another 40 miles under construction or planned, HOV lanes
are the centerpiece of the city's mass transit system.
</P>
<P>
   ``HOV lanes work in a limited number of corridors in a limited
number of cities,'' said Dennis Christiansen, deputy director of
the Texas A&AMP;M-based Texas Transportation Institute, who is widely
quoted by friends and foes of HOV alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``If HOV doesn't work in Houston, it's not going to work
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said he and others, is that not everyone has always
understood and endorsed what ``success'' is for an HOV.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Houston tried an experiment called the
``contra-flow'' lane on the North Freeway, Interstate 45 North.
Carrying only buses, it was a surprise transportation success in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to liberate buses from the delays of regular
freeway traffic, convincing people to switch from single-occupant
cars to shared vehicles and thus cutting the number of vehicles on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The first permanent bus lane opened in 1984 on the Katy Freeway.
Under public pressure, Metro quickly allowed four-person car pools,
and then three-person. It then allowed two-person car pools, so the
lanes wouldn't appear so empty.
</P>
<P>
   Even two people in a car is better than one, and construction of
car-pool lanes caught on all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   Today's national problem, however, seems to be that almost no
one is interested in sharing a ride _ even with one other person.
</P>
<P>
   With day care and errands to run, and rapid job growth in
sprawling suburbs, the percentage of commuters who car pool dropped
to 13.4 percent in 1990 from 19.7 percent in 1980, according to the
last available U.S. Census figures.
</P>
<P>
   Bus and train ridership dropped to 5.3 percent from 6.4 percent
of all commutes, although it was up in raw numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Driving alone, meanwhile, jumped to 73.2 percent from 64.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Car pools just haven't made sense for many workers. If you live
in Jersey Village, for instance, it might be a five-minute drive to
meet up with your ride mate.
</P>
<P>
   But the Northwest Freeway HOV lane barely makes up the five
minutes lost, according to the latest statistics for the height of
morning rush hour. Why would you bother with the hassle of a car
pool for no real time savings?
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't, say HOV critics. Instead, many car-pool lanes
nationwide are not creating car pools, but just ``sorting'' traffic
_ offering a lane for a lucky class of commuter that already has a
car pool.
</P>
<P>
   As anecdotal evidence, one need look no farther than the Katy
Freeway HOV from 6:45 to 8 a.m. on weekdays, when three people are
still required for entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Three people is a tough car pool to organize, even though the
Katy lane offers an excellent incentive _ at least 11 minutes of
time saved in just &UR;  &LR; 14 miles, and even more on days with accidents
in the main lanes.
</P>
<P>
   On two recent mornings, a Houston Chronicle reporter observed
that 47 percent of vehicles using the lane during the
``three-plus'' hour qualified for the lane because they carried
children.
</P>
<P>
   These commuters are not creating car pools. They are using the
lane to take their children to day care and school before
continuing to work alone _ a routine they would be following with
or without an HOV.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ark Children's Center on Antoine near the West Loop, up
to 20 percent of the students live nowhere near the neighborhood,
said owner Cristina Carcasson. Instead, the children are free
tickets for a parent onto the Katy or Northwest freeway HOV lanes,
which terminate nearby.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 9 percent of vehicles observed on the Katy HOV had
only one occupant _ a law-enforcement official. In practice, Metro
allows anyone who flashes a badge to use the lane, under the theory
that they can help out in any emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of them are on their way to work like everyone
stuck on the regular lanes. Indeed, it's probably the only place in
town that undercover drug enforcement agents are thrilled to
identify themselves _ as they pass Metro's enforcement checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   On other Houston HOV lanes, the percentage of children and
police is lower, although not necessarily the raw number. Those
lanes require two people. That's a much easier car pool to organize
_ often a husband and wife.
</P>
<P>
   There is a more academic way to chart an HOV lane's success or
failure, said Christiansen. To see if new car poolers and bus
riders are being created, chart the rise or fall of the ``average
vehicle occupancy'' of a freeway.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, before the HOV lane opened on the Katy Freeway,
Interstate 10 West, vehicles in morning rush hour were carrying an
average 1.23 people.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, for the regular lanes and HOV combined, it
was carrying 1.43 people per vehicle, an increase of 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That means that for every 100 people going to work, it is taking
roughly 11 fewer vehicles to carry them _ a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Using such a yardstick, Houston's HOV lanes have varying degrees
of success. The Northwest Freeway, U.S. 290, is doing nearly as
well as the Katy. It sees 10 fewer vehicles per 100 commuters since
its HOV lane opened in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf Freeway, Interstate 45 South, however, hasn't been so
lucky. It is carrying only one fewer vehicle per 100 commuters. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  HOUSTON: 100 commuters.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen would still argue that a flat number is a success,
in light of the huge drop in car pooling nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In a national statistic that excludes buses (which is different
from the Houston statistics above, which include buses), average
commuter vehicle occupancy dropped from 1.3 passengers in 1983 to
1.1 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   That's 14 extra vehicles to carry the same 100 commuters.
</P>
<P>
   For Christiansen, the ultimate success of an HOV lane is in
helping a freeway to move the highest number of people during rush
hour. Since only a finite number of vehicles can use a road each
hour, the natural goal is to get more people into each vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of congestion on the regular lanes is what should
force people to car-pool or ride the bus. In other words, an HOV
lane is not actually designed to reduce congestion, but hold
congestion steady in order to increase total movement of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have big-league congestion,'' Christiansen said.
``Traffic continues to grow in a pro-business, pro-growth city. HOV
is one of those tools that allows for continued growth without
increases in congestion.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, while Metro has touted its HOV lanes as
environmentally correct, they actually are tools of suburban
development, claim many environmental advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Constructing HOV lanes on long stretches of freeway encourages
urban sprawl and diverts resources from needed improvements to
transit within cities,'' three engineers wrote recently in a
national report called Re-thinking HOV.
</P>
<P>
   The report was funded by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation of
Annapolis, Md., and presented to the federal Transportation
Research Board.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Transportation Institute, using the Katy Freeway as an
example, asserts that adding an HOV was better environmentally than
either adding a fourth regular lane of traffic or doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation report says such analyses are simplistic.
Moving some drivers onto a new HOV lane just creates more space for
``latent demand'' on the main lanes, it says.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the main lanes fill up with even more polluting
automobiles and slow down again.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, about half of a car's pollution comes from its
start-up and cool-down. So if a commuter shortens his drive to meet
up with an HOV bus or car pool at a lot _ rather than driving all
the way to work _ he's not reducing as much smog as one might
think.
</P>
<P>
   HOV lanes are less cost-effective than other pollution-cutting
methods, the foundation said. It's clear many of them were built
simply because federal clean-air money was available for them, but
not for regular freeway lanes, it said.
</P>
<P>
   What better way for a local government to earn federal clean-air
credits and still promote unfettered suburban growth? it asked.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Dahlgren, a research engineer with the University of
California at Berkeley, isn't a fan of HOV lanes, but doesn't think
everyone would agree with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The foundation) thinks it would be good to have fewer vehicle
trips. Our air isn't that bad. We would have a much more limited
life if we didn't have good transportation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people just don't really want population growth,''
Dahlgren said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Christiansen: The reasons that people move to the far
suburbs are much more complicated than the availability of an HOV
lane.
</P>
<P>
   So an HOV is supposed to offer a time incentive to car pool or
ride a bus.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat shocking, therefore, that TTI, using daily
electronic measurements of morning rush hour, finds that only the
Katy Freeway HOV offers more than four minutes of time savings at
the height of congestion.
</P>
<P>
   (If you have a Harris County Toll Road Authority automatic toll
collector on your windshield, you are unwittingly tripping speed
counters for the study as you use the HOV or main lanes.)
</P>
<P>
   Metro is certainly shocked by TTI's numbers and insists they
cannot be accurate.
</P>
<P>
   TTI says that the North Freeway HOV offers a four-minute
savings; the Gulf Freeway offers one minute; and the Southwest
Freeway, U.S. 59 South, offers zero minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are both good and bad, said TTI researchers. On the
good side, a road like the Southwest Freeway was recently widened,
meaning it does not have quite the congestion of the Katy to
compare against its HOV time.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers assured that motorists should just wait a few
years. Traffic is growing to fill the new freeway lanes, and the
HOV will begin to compare more favorably.
</P>
<P>
   On the bad side, the HOV lane has choke points that aren't
apparent to main-lane drivers, both at the Hillcroft Transit Center
and the lane's merge back into the main freeway lanes. Vehicles
stack up and lose their time advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Southwest and Northwest freeway HOV lanes are
simply too crowded with two-person vehicles. While the Southwest
Freeway flows at 44 mph as it parallels the HOV, the HOV lane
itself, during the height of rush hour, is averaging only 48 mph,
says TTI.
</P>
<P>
   Metro says that a drive in morning rush hour on the Southwest
Freeway would convince anyone that the main lanes were much slower
than the HOV. Running parallel cars, it clocked a six-minute
savings early last week, not zero.
</P>
<P>
   But TTI says that is one vehicle test, compared to the hundreds
of thousands of times TTI takes automatically, throwing out days
when there is an accident either on the HOV or main lanes.
</P>
<P>
   While Christiansen seemed somewhat uncomfortable with the
accuracy of his employees' numbers, several of them did not back
down from their findings, no matter how counterintuitive they may
seem to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   They all agreed with Christiansen that a separate advantage of
HOV that shouldn't be forgotten is its reliability. When there is
yet another accident on the main lanes, HOV riders cruise right on
by.
</P>
<P>
   When the Katy Freeway HOV got too crowded in 1988, it became the
only HOV in the United States to be raised from two-person to
three-person _ to thin the herd and restore the speed incentive &UR; . &LR; 
But most lanes nationwide have seen occupancy requirements reduced
because of public outcry that they are ``empty.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, two recently built HOVs are being canceled this
month after a crusade by a local newspaper. With special permission
from Congress and an order from the governor, the lanes are being
converted permanently to general traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``reassessment,'' the New Jersey Department of
Transportation decided that the lanes had failed to create new car
pools or even attract much use at all. Unlike Houston, those lanes
connect suburbs to suburbs _ not fertile ground for ride-sharing _
and offer little bus service.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the greatest success of the Houston HOV lanes may be
because Metro greatly expanded its bus service to run along the new
HOVs, according to an analysis of TTI numbers. &QL;

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  HOUSTON: TTI numbers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the lanes themselves, Metro has spent more than
$120 million on Park &AMP; Ride lots and transit centers that feed the
lanes.
</P>
<P>
   In what Christiansen calls a textbook example of where to build
HOVs, the lanes run from sprawling suburbs into a tightly packed
downtown area, where 33 percent of the work force commutes by bus.
</P>
<P>
   In the best example of bus power, the Katy Freeway went from
carrying 32 buses with 900 passengers in morning rush hour before
its HOV opened to 80 buses carrying 2,728 passengers today. An
average of 34 passengers per bus does wonders for vehicle occupancy
rates and removing cars from the road.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at private automobiles and vans alone, the Katy's
average vehicle occupancy rose only slightly, from 1.23 to 1.28.
But factor in the increase in bus ridership and it rose to 1.43.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Northwest Freeway has seen even half of its growth in
vehicle occupancy due to car pool formation and not buses. The Gulf
and Southwest freeways have actually seen a decrease in occupancy
rates if buses are excluded.
</P>
<P>
   If Houston's HOV success is largely due to improved bus service,
a critic could wonder whether increases in roadway efficiency
should be credited to the buses instead of the HOV lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is mixed. In three TTI surveys from 1988-90, anywhere
from 54 percent to 76 percent of HOV bus riders said the opening of
an HOV lane was ``very important'' to their decision to ride a bus.
Between 22 percent and 39 percent said they would not ride if there
weren't an HOV lane.
</P>
<P>
   Metro meant for the increase in buses and HOVs to be a unified
transit system. Think of the lane as tracks and the buses as trains
_ only cheaper than a rail system.
</P>
<P>
   Bus lanes are something that even the Chesapeake Bay Foundation
would heartily endorse. They just don't want any cars on the lanes,
slowing down the buses.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream transportation experts, including those at Metro,
might like bus-only lanes in theory, but public opinion is
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empty'' lanes make for awful publicity, no matter how many
times you explain that they are only at their emptiest during
off-peak hours, when an extra freeway lane isn't needed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   A strategy, therefore, is to fill the lane with as many vehicles
as can be handled without slowing down the time advantage of the
buses. It makes the lanes look busy, and it helps squeeze every
inch of efficiency from the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   On the the Katy HOV, two-person simply was too crowded for the
peak hour, but three-person is a bit sparse. So Metro has started
selling an automatic toll collector that allows two-person vehicles
onto the lane during the three-person hours, for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   Even that apparently hasn't ``filled'' the lane, so Metro has
asked the Federal Transit Administration _ without a reply so far _
for permission to sell passes to single-occupant vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually the hottest new academic concept for saving HOV
lanes: Converting them to ``HOT'' lanes, for high-occupancy/toll.
</P>
<P>
   Buses and car pools would still use the lane for free. But just
enough paying single-occupant cars would be allowed on the lane to
fill it without overfilling it.
</P>
<P>
   When too many single-occupant cars started using the lane, there
would be a price increase, just like with any other valuable
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Metro and the Texas Department of Transportation are considering
a four-lane ``HOT lane'' for the median of the Katy Freeway when
the highway is widened in several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``HOT helps preserve HOV and defuse political attacks,'' said
Kenneth Orski, a Washington, D.C., consultant who chaired a
national task force on HOT lanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people object to is seeing those empty lanes when they're
stuck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston people object to other things as well. It's hard to
figure out how to get on the lanes, and many drivers don't like the
fact that they are barrier-separated _ not just an extra lane on
the left side of the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   The lanes are tough to get on except at their very ends because,
for the most part, they were designed for buses, not cars. They
have superb access from Metro's Park &AMP; Ride lots and transit
centers.
</P>
<P>
   They are barrier-separated, said Metro officials, because
enforcement against cheaters is easier and the lanes are safer.
</P>
<P>
   In places like California with longer stretches between freeway
exits, having a non-separated HOV is all right, they said. But
imagine HOV drivers on the Southwest Freeway weaving across five
lanes to exit at Chimney Rock, West Loop, Wesleyan, Buffalo
Speedway, Kirby and Shepherd, all a few hundred feet from each
other.
</P>
<P>
   As the HOV lanes are expanded farther outside of Houston, they
might indeed be non-separated. Such an extension is being studied
outside Texas 6 on the Katy Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Metro also is studying how to make signs clearer on the HOV,
hoping that will increase usage.
</P>
<P>
   When they are fine-tuned, said California's Dahlgren, HOVs can
help freeways carry more traffic than the addition of regular
freeway lanes.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a lot different than sweet dreams of reduced
congestion and reduced pollution, she said, which were the original
assumptions of many HOV fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a magic bullet that solves all problems,''
Christiansen said. ``It's one tool, and you have to do other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go back to Julius Caesar and every city that ever
existed had congestion,'' he added. ``You're never going to go 70
mph during rush hour in Houston. It just ain't gonna happen.'' &QL;

 &HT;    BERMUDA'S OPPOSITION PARTY LOOKS TO ATLANTA FOR HELP IN WINNING
POWER
 &HT;    EDs: Contains optional trim at 580 words.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Two black women are vying for power in a close election
scheduled for Monday(Nov. 9) in Bermuda, the upscale Fifth Avenue
of islands long dominated by white colonialists.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will decide whether to return Prime Minister Pamela
Gordon, 43, of the ruling United Bermuda Party (UBP) to power or to
replace her with Jennifer Smith, 51, of the opposition Progressive
Labor Party (PLP).
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Bermuda's history, the PLP -- historically
linked with the island's black population -- has a good shot at
winning.
</P>
<P>
   But to up the odds, the party has been flying Bermudian citizens
who are living and studying in Atlanta back to Bermuda this week to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   To a lesser extent, the party also has been targeting Bermudians
in Toronto, another popular spot with students, to maximize
turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a previous election, one of our candidates lost by only 41
votes, so this could make the difference,'' said Corey Butterfield,
spokesperson for the PLP.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Atlanta -- viewed as a black mecca -- attracts more
Bermudian students than perhaps any other foreign city and that,
currently, hundreds of Bermudians are earning degrees at
historically black institutions such as Spelman and Morehouse
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Using money donated by supporters, the PLP will help transport
at least 113 students back to Bermuda before Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the tactics always used by the ruling party is to call
elections when students are away at school, so we're trying to make
sure they can get back home to vote,'' Butterfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda allows residents who will be abroad on election day to
vote in advance, but -- unlike Britain on which the Bermuda
Parliament is modelled -- there is no provision for absentee
voting.
</P>
<P>
   The UBP has been in power since 1968, when limited self-rule was
implemented in Bermuda, a British colony.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show this race to be neck-and-neck, with the clear
possibility that the UBP -- traditionally linked with the island's
white population -- might lose control.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 65 percent of Bermuda's population of 68,000
people are black, while about 35 percent are white.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Winfield, the UBP's campaign chairman, denied that his
party only calls elections when students are away, and emphasized
that his party wouldn't help anyone return home to vote.
</P>
<P>
   He did add, though, that he knew of many Bermudians living and
studying in Atlanta who were making the trip on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of Bermudians in Atlanta because we have lots
of ties with that city,'' Winfield said. ``It is a favorite spot
for Bermudians to study, and even to go visit and go shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, political observers say that the ruling party has
been able to retain its hold on power for so long by preserving the
island's notorious wealth.
</P>
<P>
   While many of its Caribbean neighbors to the south battle rising
crime and widespread poverty, Bermuda has remained a safe island
with a high standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the per-capita income in Bermuda is $35,000 per
year, higher than even the U.S. average of about $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   With no corporate or personal income tax, Bermuda has become a
haven for insurance companies and offshore banks.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a popular spot with tourists, who are increasingly
drawn to the sophisticated, Nantucket-like atmosphere characterized
by yacht races, garden parties, and cricket matches.
</P>
<P>
   And, an astonishing 5 percent of the island's total land area is
covered by championship golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   All this has helped lure more than 400,000 Americans a year to
Bermuda, located about 586 miles east of Cape Hatteras, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim ends here.)
</P>
<P>
   But political observers say voters have grown increasingly
concerned about the quality of public education and the scarcity of
affordable housing, so that the time might be right for a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PLP used to be a working class party that appealed to
black voters, but now it's adopted a more-centrist policy and has a
wider appeal,'' said Walton Brown, a political science lecturer at
Bermuda College, a two-year institution.

   Others say voters are disenchanted with the ruling party because
they no longer see the island's success filtering down to the

   ``The question now being asked is whether the wealth is being

``There's a growing difference between the haves and the

 &HT;    HAITI'S FIRST CYBER-CAFE BRINGS INTERNET TO POVERTY-STRICKEN
COUNTRY

<P>
   PETIONVILLE, Haiti _ Think cafe. Think trendy. Think computers.
Think people with a penchant for khakis and loafers who live to
surf the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Starring on the menu: espresso and cappuccino, of course.
</P>
<P>
   What is this, Seattle? No, it's a cyber-cafe -- and it's located
in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The aptly-named Computer World is sandwiched between a pizza
parlor and a gas station in this tony suburb, high on a
mountainside overlooking -- but distanced from -- the squalor and
grime of Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   It's an understatement to say that the business looks keenly out
of place in this country, where phone and electric service is
spotty, and most people battle with the daily dilemmas of finding
safe water and decent sanitation.
</P>
<P>
   But, clearly, Computer World is a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen terminals with Internet access line the walls
inside this nondescript, two-story building, which is
air-conditioned -- a rarity here -- and decorated with space
age-style wallpaper covered with colorful drawings of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   The building includes a full-service coffee bar, as well as a
store, where everything from mouse pads to fax machines -- all
imported from discount chains in Miami -- is sold.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent weekday, the building was crowded with well-heeled
patrons who sent e-mail on computers that might cost the average
Haitian more than five years of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can e-mail my friends back in the United States so I don't
have to send a letter, which would take 15 days to get there,''
said Nadine Seide, 28. ``I also use the computer to do research on
all of the graduate schools in the United States, where I plan to
study one day.''
</P>
<P>
   Seide recently graduated from college here, but has never owned
a computer and, even if she did, she couldn't access the Internet
since the phone at her house hasn't worked in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Like Seide, many customers linger for hours at Computer World,
which has a cozy, living-room atmosphere, as part of a ritual that
has become as essential to the day's routine as combing hair.
</P>
<P>
   They sip java, play games on CD-ROM, nosh on chicken nuggets,
and catch up with old friends.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, Computer World's not the domain of Everyman, but is
clearly geared toward Haiti's moneyed elite and expatriate
community.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for Computer World's success goes to Jonas Guillaume, an
ambitious entrepreneur who opened the cyber-cafe in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And he'll take the credit with an American-style smile, proud of
opening the high-tech haven in such a low-tech environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in Haiti and I just wanted to give something back
by helping people,'' said Guillaume, 32, who studied computer
science at the University of Montreal before living a few years in
Miami. ``And the people are just so happy to have something like
this available to them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Western Hemisphere's poorest country, Haiti is generally
associated with malnutrition, not technology.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the population can't read or write, which explains
why, when computer networks were shrinking time and space in the
developed world, most folks here had never even heard of an
information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only some 5,000 Haitians have access to the Internet
through four main servers available through private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some fledgling efforts underway to expand the
use of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian government is currently developing an intranet to
connect their various ministries, which has been implemented across
corporate America at a feverish pace.
</P>
<P>
   And several computer schools have been opened in Port-au-Prince,
teaching crowded classrooms everything from Lotus to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly people are starting to understand that the computer is
the way of the future and that they will be left behind if they
don't know technology,'' said Michelle Karshan, a spokeswoman for
Haitian President Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, widespread use of the Internet has been
hampered by the phone service provided by Teleco, Haiti's aging
monopoly, which is so poor that there are fewer than 80,000 phone
lines to serve 8 million people.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the more than 100,000 people currently waiting for phone
service have been waiting for years.
</P>
<P>
   And those lucky enough to already have phone service may lose
their line for months after a big rain.
</P>
<P>
   Service costs $10 a month in a nation where the average
per-capita income is $250.
</P>
<P>
   Under the country's economic reform program, Teleco is supposed
to pass to private hands.
</P>
<P>
   But all such deals need the prime minster's signature and the
former prime minister, Rosny Smarth, resigned in June 1997 and has
yet to be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a political impasse that's going to continue to hold
up investment and privatization,'' said Ernest Preeg, U.S.
ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't stopped Computer World, which avoids Teleco's
ground-based phone lines by using a router that picks up satellite
signals to make connections.
</P>
<P>
   Computer World also uses a generator and battery-powered
inverter to avoid the common power outages plaguing the country.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has contributed to the cyber-cafe's rising
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   At Computer World, Guillaume has sold memberships to more than
120 people for about $35 a month, for which they receive an e-mail
address and mailbox, plus 20 hours of Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Non-members can access the Internet for about $5 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   He also offers six-week training classes, at a cost of about
$300, for Internet novices.
</P>
<P>
   And there are plenty of them.
</P>
<P>
   Even many professionals here, such as doctors, lawyers, and
engineers, know almost nothing about surfing the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have people come in from the university asking me what the
Internet is and about how to use it, and I'm happy to be able to
teach them,'' Guillaume said.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for people like Ida Morel, a nurse's aide eager
to learn how to use computers to do medical research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computers are not something we grow up with here, so having
Computer World is great,'' she said. ``I can come in, experiment
with computers, ask questions and get all the help I need.''

 &HT;    BOMBERS ATTACK ISRAELI MARKET, NO SHOPPERS KILLED BUT PEACE
PROCESS SHAKEN
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A suicide bombing on the edge of a crowded market
here Friday amazingly killed no Israelis, but did cause another
delay in the peace process worked out last month in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third attack on Israelis since the convening of
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks three weeks ago that resulted in
the signing of the Wye Memorandum in Washington. One Israeli has
been killed in those attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the latest bombing, the agreement reached at last
month's nine-day summit was clearly not dead Friday. Indeed, by
late afternoon, Israeli leaders were calling for the process to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israelis had already been acting reluctantly to ratify the
agreement. The bombing shifts the focus from whether Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would persuade his right-wing cabinet
to belatedly approve the agreement to the question of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   If the bombers end up being sent by the Palestinian extremist
group Hamas, as an anonymous caller told Israeli police, it will
increase pressure on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to keep his
promises to crack down on terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's cabinet might have voted on the agreement Friday
morning, but news of the bombing brought the meeting to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, the bombers had struck the Mahaneh Yehuda produce
market, a shopping place frequented by blue-collar Israelis and
Orthodox religious Jews. Many vendors keep posters of right-wing
politicians, including Netanyahu, in their stalls. The same market
was the site of a bombing in September 1997, in which 16 Israelis
died.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and commentators called the events Friday a miracle.
But, the fact that so many escaped death could just as much be
attributed to keen reactions honed many times in the past.
</P>
<P>
   On the busiest shopping day of the week, bombers drove a red
Fiat just inside a pedestrian produce market at about 9:45 a.m.
(Israel Time) and apparently botched an attempt that could have
killed dozens.
</P>
<P>
   A small explosion, apparently accidental, and the shouts of
Israeli soldiers sent shoppers scurrying -- tripping over each
other -- toward stalls, and nooks in the market. Seconds later,
when a larger blast sent flames shooting from the car to the
awnings above, only the two bombers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses said soldiers, regularly posted in the market,
shot at the car, which had turned off the street into the narrow,
awning covered, path into the market.
</P>
<P>
   The bombers' bodies were left in pieces by the mangled car
wreckage and some of their flesh was blown against the walls. But,
no Israelis were killed and only about 20 were injured, almost all
lightly. Fruit and pastries just yards from the car were still
stacked neatly.
</P>
<P>
   Sigal Itchzer, a 28-year-old office worker, was hurrying to work
when a car let her cross the street against the light. Moments
later, the same car had pulled into the market and a small
explosion and puff of smoke came from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor guy,'' Itchzer said she thought at the time. ``I thought
his car broke down.''
</P>
<P>
   The next, more powerful blast, sent her to the hospital in shock
and with ear damage.
</P>
<P>
   Police blocked off the immediate area of the blast. Some
gathered to shout ``Death to the Arabs,'' heard often after
bombings. But shoppers resumed buying their fruit, vegetables and
pastries for the start of the Sabbath within a half-hour of the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of gotten used to it,'' said Israeli Jacob Shaw,
25. ``Why not? That's life. You can't stop going out to buy food.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it appeared the bombing would not, by itself, cancel
the implementation of the peace agreement signed last month in
Washington. The agreement includes a withdrawal of Israeli troops
from some areas they occupy in the West Bank in return for
Palestinian commitments to fight anti-Israeli terrorists within
their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu and his cabinet issued a statement saying they would
only consider ratifying the agreement once they see ``that the
(Palestinian Authority) is taking decisive steps in a determined
war on the terrorist organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question is, 'What are the Palestinians are going to
do?'' government spokesman Moshe Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders condemned the bombing. In recent days, after
an attempted bombing of two school buses in the Gaza Strip, Yasser
Arafat's security forces have been rounding up Hamas members and
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   But, it is unclear whether it was just part of the investigation
into the Gaza bombing, a charade for the Israelis and the United
States, or the start of a thorough effort to break Hamas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, by Friday afternoon, as shops closed and the streets
emptied for the start of the Sabbath, Israel's President Ezer
Weizman and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai were calling for the
peace agreement to be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli political scientist Barry Rubin, with Bar-Ilan
University in Tel Aviv, said there is little other alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the culmination of 50 years of history and both sides
need it,'' he said, adding that Netanyahu's hesitations over recent
days are because he returned from the peace talks to face more
right-wing opposition in Israel than he expected.

NEW AGE HARP MASTER LIKES TO `STRING' AUDIENCE ALONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hands of Andreas Vollenweider, the heavenly harp becomes
a high-performance New Age hot rod.
</P>
<P>
   Using pedals, triggers, computers and other devices, the Swiss
harpist can turn a one-man performance into a symphony of acoustic
and electronic
</P>
<P>
   sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider, a pioneer of New Age music, is on his first solo
tour.
</P>
<P>
   The tour supports Vollenweider's new album, ``Kryptos,'' his
first instrumental release since the 1992 record, ``Book of
Roses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kryptos,'' which opens with an orchestral ``tuneup,'' features
a cast of international guests, among them Japanese percussionist
Leonard Eto, African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, saxophonist
Michael Brecker and vocalist Mindy Jostyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Vollenweider will be alone on stage at the Broadway
Performance Hall in Seattle, save for his custom-built
electro-acoustic harp, as well as the ancient kora (African harp),
cheng (Chinese harp) and Celtic and renaissance harps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't a solo concert in the sense that I play one
instrument and then another instrument and so forth,'' Vollenweider
said by phone from a tour stop in El Cajon, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tie them all together as if I had a whole orchestra.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider, who also plays sax, flute, chimes, gongs and
piano, will enhance his music with elements of theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all my pedals, I can trigger sound effects,'' he said.
``A horse riding across the stage, the sound of a flock of birds or
whatever. But they're natural sounds. It's a backdrop that creates
a certain environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider regards himself as a musical storyteller and sees
similarities between his shows and old-fashioned radio plays.
During a segment late in the show, Vollenweider plays the role of
minstrel, serenading concertgoers with an accordion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were these radio plays when I was growing up and I was
such a fan. They were so great . . . the sound effects and the
noise!'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old-time radio shows, Vollenweider's performance is
designed to stimulate his fans' imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep things as open as possible and try not be too specific,
in order to invite people to put a thought or emotion in the spot
where something seems to be missing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music thus becomes complete through the listeners
involving themselves and engaging themselves in the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Vollenweider prefers darkened theaters for his performances and
chooses not to perform in venues that are too brightly lit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The darkness is such a great soil for the imagination,'' he
said.

RALPH LAUREN COMES THROUGH IN SPRING PREVIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Designers inspired by 1960s hippies, military gear,
Las Vegas showgirls and Kandinsky's ``Point and Line to Plane''
previewed their spring '99 collections to retailers and media this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But leave it to talented, reliable Ralph Lauren to provide some
of the most usable clothes for real women.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren made it clear once again why he's voted ``best'' or
``most influential'' designer by his peers and the fashion press
year after year.
</P>
<P>
   His spring '99 collection will probably influence the way a lot
of women dress in the last year of this century. If they're not
wearing clothes with his label, they're likely to copy the looks.
</P>
<P>
   His A-line, bias cut skirts have flare. They're flattering. They
make sense for active women. His combinations of textures _ a
natural linen/silk sweater over herringbone linen pants, for
example _ have a luxurious, understated look.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren used lots of natural, neutral tones with dashes of sage
and khaki. For pure fun there were cargo pants of purple poplin or
pink silk faille.
</P>
<P>
   His collection includes a number of jackets _ short, fitted
three-button styles, a cropped ``Eisenhower'' jacket, and a silk
faille bomber jacket, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   And Lauren's tailoring is always impeccable. Put one of his
jackets with skirt or pants and it's a duo to go anywhere with
style.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Mackie's flamboyant party clothes were modeled by seasoned
models _ in this business that means some appeared to be over 30 _
who really knew how to strut and have fun on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie, who is credited with some of Cher's more revealing
costumes, created a yellow, flowered brocade suit with green piping
that could have been a sofa in another life. His evening gowns
floated along with layers of tulle and chiffon. Glitter was rarely
spared.
</P>
<P>
   Mackie even revived the decades-old tradition of closing the
show with a bride. While Bette Midler belted out ``Goin' to the
chapel and we're gonna be married,'' a model swathed in several
dozen yards of white and peach tulle strolled out wearing a
flower-studded headpiece worthy of a Vegas dancer.
</P>
<P>
   The other models reappeared in evening gowns, but for this final
appearance they were clutching demure little nosegays. The audience
applauded, sang along, and left the show in smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Sui is another designer who had the audience smiling from
the minute the first model appeared wearing a crocheted,
feather-trimmed halter and embroidered denim shorts that were truly
cheeky.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1960s hippie trip included embroidered chambray shirts,
tablecloths made into ponchos, fringed leather hip-huggers, white
cotton and lace garments reminiscent of Mexican wedding dresses,
and some of the most bizarre paisley prints ever invented.
</P>
<P>
   She even added a macrame necklace or two and a few peacock
feathers. Only the peace signs were missing.
</P>
<P>
   It might take a trip to the library to figure out what designer
Yeohlee was doing with Kandinsky and geometry.
</P>
<P>
   Yeohlee loves white cotton coated with DuPont Teflon. Her
geometric dresses look like laboratory or hospital uniforms. A
mechanic's jumpsuit, taffeta pants with Velcro closures and a
series of olive-drab cotton garments with insets of transparent
olive fabric were other geometric inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   The latter bring to mind tents with mesh bug screens.
</P>
<P>
   Extra triangles of fabric, inserted like gussets in the backs or
sides of skirts were also part of her geometry lesson. When dresses
with what the program described as ``rectangular side flags''
appeared, they looked sort of like rockets with flexible fins
mounted on the exterior of the skirts. Perhaps it takes a
mathematician or an engineer to understand them.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Rucci, designer for the Chado label, may be a relative
newcomer, but his exquisitely cut garments are like wearable
collectibles. His orange ``pagoda'' jacket of duchess satin, or a
quilted silk jacket were pieces that could be worn for years.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kors also created a very wearable, interesting
collection with emphasis on slim Bermuda shorts, airy anoraks,
lightweight parkas, chino skirts and shirts with
three-quarter-length sleeves. It had military overtones, but was
definitely street-wise.
</P>
<P>
   There were few shirts or anything else with sleeves being shown
for spring. There were some sweaters with sleeves, but tanks were
definitely the topping of choice for dresses, skirts and pants.
</P>
<P>
   Tanks make sense for warm weather and those with bodies to wear
them. So do beautifully tailored linen jackets.
</P>
<P>
   And it's important to remember there are a lot of people born
after 1960 who probably will be fascinated with macrame, crochet,
border prints and vivid paisleys.

ERNESTINE ANDERSON CELEBRATES HER 70TH BIRTHDAY IN STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERTA PENN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Ernestine Anderson is in a tizzy, moving stacks of
clothes, papers and CDs from one chair to another, reaching across
the potatoes she's frying for her sister's lunch to grab the
constantly ringing phone and in between giving instructions to a
young woman who is helping straighten up the jazz singer's Central
Area home.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy is part of preparations for the biggest birthday
party Anderson has ever thrown. Family and friends are flying in
from Texas and California to join local fans in the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do something significant on my 70th birthday. It's
a milestone if there ever was one,'' Anderson said putting the
phone on the hook and stirring the fries. ``Vivian Phillips,
Freddie Mae Gautier and the Paramount Theatre are helping put it
together. And it's a great opportunity to raise some money so it's
a benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the singer won't actually turn 70 until Wednesday the
11th, the Ernestine Anderson 70th Birthday Bash is at 8 Saturay at
the Paramount Theatre and benefits Children's Hospital and the Rise
n' Shine Foundation. The Experience Music Project, the Cole Youth
Trust, the Alhadeff Charitable Foundation and the Wyman Youth Trust
are also throwing support behind the concert.
</P>
<P>
   It features Anderson performing music from her latest CD,
``Isn't It Romantic,'' with the Garfield High School Symphony
Orchestra and a set of blues and pop tunes from the
Grammy-nominated ``Blues, Dues &AMP; Love News'' with the Rich Dangel
Band and middle and high school vocal ensembles. On one tune, there
will also be interpretive dancing by Kabby Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a white sweatshirt that bears both her name and that
of an auto detail shop, black tights and red mules, Anderson looks
like a teenager readying for a prom as she pulls out a long,
gorgeous purple velvet gown with beaded sleeves. This is what she
will wear for the romantic set, and her eyes sparkle with
excitement as she holds the gown up to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I will get into it,'' she says with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson comes from an era of glamorous gowns and big
orchestras. A Texas native who moved to Seattle in 1944, she went
on the road just after her 18th birthday with the Johnny Otis
Orchestra, a group that would also introduce R&AMP;B singers Etta James
and Esther Phillips to the touring life.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson was more of a jazz vocalist and her big break came
in 1952 when, backed by the Ray Charles trio, she auditioned for
Lionel Hampton's orchestra. Along with several other Seattle
artists, including Quincy Jones, Anderson took to the road with
Hampton for more than a year, playing clubs, concert halls and even
an inauguration party for President Dwight Eisenhower.
</P>
<P>
   For that important date, the singer had to redesign her
performance outfit because her arm was in a cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I broke my arm in an auto wreck,'' Anderson recalls. ``So I
wrapped it up in a scarf, and it looked like it was a new
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   After the stint with Hampton, Anderson was signed to Mercury
Records and her first release, ``Hot Cargo,'' landed her on the
cover of Time magazine as ``the best new voice in the business.''
Critics raved about her natural singing style, comparing Anderson
to Ella Fitzgerald and June Cristy and Sarah Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, like many jazz singers of the era, Anderson was steered
toward pop music because as rock 'n' roll began to flourish, jazz
went on the decline. Record labels thought they could cash in with
Anderson the way they had with Dinah Washington and Vaughan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was at Mercury, they recorded us all to try to get a us
a commercial hit,'' Anderson explains. ``Rock 'n' roll became the
music of America and people doing jazz couldn't work. They released
me doing tunes like `I Don't See Me in Your Eyes' in Europe. They
sold there, but I was glad they didn't go anywhere here because I
did not want them to be heard. Now it's my karma that fans come up
and request them.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Anderson tells this story with a laugh, karma plays a big
part in her life. She has been a Buddhist since 1959, a year in
which she found that fame had left her feeling empty and isolated.
Married and a young mother but still wanting to continue a life in
music, Anderson didn't know which way to turn so she turned inward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was suffering from depression so bad that I had become a
recluse, living in L.A. and scared to death,'' Anderson says.
``Several people had told me about chanting so I went to a meeting
and when I left I realized I no longer had that heavy anxiety.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Anderson chants twice a day and prays before an altar in her
living room. It has helped her come out of a crippling shyness and
given her the strength and focus to take care of her twin sister
Phinney (which is short for Josephine), who is developmentally
disabled and needs around the clock care.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people in the arts are basically shy and that's a
way to express themselves. I'm happy when I'm on stage,'' Anderson
admits. ``But it is because I am a Buddhist that I'm able to take
care of my sister and have a career.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's career has continued to have peaks and valleys, but
along the way she has been nominated for four Grammies, was
featured in photographer Brian Laker's stunning book and exhibit
``I Dream A World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America,''
and has raised a lot of money for charities through her concerts.
</P>
<P>
   She has also made it back from a heart attack in 1994. But
Anderson wasn't terrified by the experience, and now she's too busy
to worry about dying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to tidying the house up for party guests, rehearsing
for the birthday bash and caring for Phinney, whose art work will
be on display in the lobby of the Paramount for the birthday party,
Anderson is looking toward the future, writing new songs and a book
about her life and considering new recording contract offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost a lot of friends these last few years, Betty Carter,
Dizzy (Gillespie), we go way back to a closeness that developed
when we met in the '50s,'' Anderson says. ``But I believe that life
is eternal. And this is just a transition from one life to
another.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Anderson is off to another round of the dining room,
giving directions of where to put a stack of papers and grabbing
yet another batch of CDs, a new compilation from her years at
Concord Records. Then she dashs off a check to a workman and,
finally, delivers those fries to Phinney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whew,'' Anderson says with a sigh. ``I am turning 70!''

KHMER ROUGE BECOME NEW WARLORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RATTANAK MONDOL, Cambodia _ Gen. Nhiem Kong spent 26 years with
the dreaded Khmer Rouge and has the battle scars, icy stare and
menacing demeanor to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old commander defected to the government side two
years ago, along with some 1,000 battle-hardened guerrilla
followers.
</P>
<P>
   But Nhiem still cracks a twisted smile when he recalls the
charisma and ideological fervor of the late Khmer Rouge leader Pol
Pot, whose 1975-79 rule turned Cambodia into a vast killing field
that left up to 2 million people dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pol Pot was a very strong leader and he knew how to motivate
us,'' said Nhiem, waving a left arm pockmarked with huge scars from
bullet and shrapnel wounds. ``If you lost a battle, he would give
you some training and encouragement, and you were ready to get up
and fight again. I know, I experienced it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Nhiem was wounded five times _ in the head, back, arms
and legs. Each time, he returned to fight for Pol Pot and his
crazed dream of a communist utopia.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, Nhiem said, it became obvious that Pol
Pot's days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fed up with war. My body hurt from all those wounds,''
he said. ``Communism was collapsing all over the world and I didn't
want to keep killing my own people, my own nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Khmer Rouge made two bad mistakes,'' he continued. ``They
killed many people after they took power in 1975 and they didn't
join the U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. We commanders wondered
why. We were upset. We were told we were democratic. But Pol Pot
had dictatorial powers. I think in the world these days, there are
no more communists. Most have gone democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Most, but not all. Nhiem, for example, has become a warlord.
</P>
<P>
   Given military control by the cash-strapped Phnom Penh
government over a wide swath of remote northwestern Cambodia, Khmer
Rouge defectors are plundering abandoned villages and cutting the
rich hardwood forests. In exchange, the defectors fight _ or at
least contain _ the last vestiges of the Khmer Rouge, an estimated
1,000 guerrillas in two parts of the north and northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Nhiem commands the government's 17th Division. Before changing
sides, he was deputy commander of the Khmer Rouge's 690 Division.
He knows his enemy well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all of those hard-line (Khmer Rouge) commanders still
out there,'' Nhiem boasted at his modest wooden house along
recently reopened Highway 10, about 20 miles east of the former
Khmer Rouge stronghold of Pailin. ``I met Pol Pot every month for
years at commanders' meetings. I know all the top commanders of the
Khmer Rouge. Those men are good fighters, but they are getting fed
up with war. They have malaria. They are tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the estimated 1,000 Khmer Rouge fighters are
weakened by malaria and low morale, but remain dangerous. In the
north, they are believed to operate along the Thai border in
forests around the town of Anlong Veng, where Pol Pot died in
April.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the northwest, more than 300 Khmer Rouge are believed to
be active in the remote mountains of the Samlot region, where many
of Nhiem's men are based.
</P>
<P>
   Overall command of the Khmer Rouge now rests with Ta Mok, a
one-legged veteran guerrilla known as ``The Butcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Nhiem said Ta Mok travels between both groups of guerrillas by
way of Thailand. Military officials say they often intercept Ta
Mok's radio messages to his troops. But Nhiem says The Butcher
lacks Pol Pot's leadership abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is mobile and these two groups always communicate with each
other,'' Nhiem said. ``Sometimes he comes here, traveling through
Thailand, and other times he is up north. But Ta Mok is not such a
strong leader as Pol Pot. We had hoped that after Pol Pot died,
they would just grow weaker and weaker until they died.''
</P>
<P>
   But that hasn't happened. In fact, Nhiem acknowledged that
hundreds of his troops had returned to the Khmer Rouge side in the
past year. A few later redefected to the government side, always
looking for a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are greedy for power,'' Nhiem said. ``But I don't think
the remaining hard-liners will ever defect to the government. Ta
Mok himself will never defect, because he will lose face. He
devoted his life to the Khmer Rouge. He will fight until he dies.
He says he will fight until his body burns out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, civilians continue to suffer. In the Samlot region,
thousands of people have been displaced. Nhiem said bands of as
many as 30 Khmer Rouge still mount hit-and-run attacks in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those displaced by fighting live in makeshift
resettlement camps in the malaria-infested jungles just north of
Samlot. Some have returned from refugee camps in Thailand and have
received assistance from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). But life is extremely difficult, and danger keeps all from
returning to their home villages in Samlot.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the presence of millions of land mines has resulted
in a severe shortage of land for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we are not promoting repatriation for those
refugees still in Thailand,'' said Johann Siffointe, head of
UNHCR's field office in the Cambodian city of Battambang. ``If they
insist, we will facilitate their return, perhaps to these temporary
resettlement camps. But it is still much too insecure in Samlot for
them to go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Om Thy, a 35-year-old former Khmer Rouge fighter, stays with his
wife and two children in a jungle camp near the destroyed Dong Tong
Bridge on the north side of the muddy river that forms the boundary
with the Samlot region. The riverbank on both sides is heavily
mined.
</P>
<P>
   Although he knows it is too dangerous to take his family back to
Samlot, Om Thy recently returned on his own to check on his house.
It was no longer there, and it wasn't the Khmer Rouge who destroyed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government soldiers dismantled my home and took all the lumber
and tin roofing to the city and sold it,'' Om Thy said. ``Many of
us refugees have gone back to find our houses gone and everything
lost. The government soldiers are no good either. They intend to
dismantle all our homes and sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   A Western aid worker said Om Thy's story is common.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how the government in Phnom Penh pays people like Nhiem
Kong _ they let them loot,'' said the worker, who requested
anonymity. ``It's also why (Prime Minister) Hun Sen is a political
master. He has turned Khmer Rouge against Khmer Rouge and now
controls about 95 percent of the country. He does a deal with these
local warlords and then turns a blind eye to their activities, as
long they remain loyal to his government. He could control the
entire country within five years.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the remaining Khmer Rouge fighters, about 30,000
of their civilian followers are in two U.N.-assisted camps in
Thailand _ near the town of Trat, opposite Samlot, and at Phu Noi,
opposite Anlong Veng. Many are relatives of the guerrillas still in
Cambodia. Thai and UNHCR officials say the combatants are not
allowed in the camps, so they remain separated from their families,
who are in turn reluctant to return to Cambodia without their
menfolk.
</P>
<P>
   Nhiem said if the refugees could be persuaded to return to
government areas of Cambodia, most Khmer Rouge fighters would
defect and join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they could get their families out of the refugee camps in
Thailand, I think they would stop fighting,'' he said. ``It will
end the war.''

TORTURE SURVIVOR SEEKS JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RON REDMOND  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHNOM PEHN, Cambodia _ When he was 14, Youk Chhang was tortured
by the Khmer Rouge. His father and sister died in the killing
fields, along with hundreds of thousands of other Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stole my family and my youth,'' says Youk, now 38. ``They
tortured me and they beat me, but they couldn't hurt my soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk ended up a refugee in the United States, where he earned a
degree in political science and vowed to return to his homeland and
seek justice for himself, his family and the millions of Cambodians
who suffered at the hands of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Youk is the executive director of the Phnom Penh-based
Documentation Center of Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not after revenge,'' Youk said in the center's
air-conditioned office, filled with computers and filing cabinets
that hold more than 1.3 million testimonies of the Pol Pot years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to prove the capability of human beings to persevere
for as long as it takes to achieve justice. If I wanted revenge, I
could have shot some of these people already. But I don't want to
use their tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   The center was created in 1995 as a field office for Yale
University's Cambodian Genocide Program, funded by the U.S. State
Department. Today, it is an autonomous Cambodian institute operated
entirely by Cambodians with support from U.S. and Australian
scholars and legal experts.
</P>
<P>
   Youk said the center has two main goals: to serve as a
repository of information on the Pol Pot regime for those who want
to pursue legal redress for genocide, war crimes or crimes against
humanity; and to ``prevent the return of the killing fields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Khmer Rouge is very weak right now physically, but their
ideology remains very strong,'' Youk said. ``They are very
committed. That's why we have to be careful. Remember, they started
with just one man and grew into a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk is uncomfortable with the Cambodian government's blanket
acceptance of thousands of Khmer Rouge defectors, many of whom were
absorbed into the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government brings back all these defectors, but they also
bring back among them some of the killers,'' he said. ``That's the
weakness of this system.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconciliation is fine in some countries, Youk added, but the
many crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge require justice and
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had more than a million dead in Cambodia. There aren't
words to describe the horrors that happened here,'' he said. ``We
need a court, we need justice, not reconciliation. Reconciliation
is not part of our life.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has compiled files on some 18,000 individual Khmer
Rouge leaders. Youk believes the top 20 should be tried for war
crimes or crimes against humanity, possibly in a U.N.-sponsored
tribunal. A U.N. legal expert is due in Phnom Penh this month to
investigate the possibility of such a tribunal and will then report
to Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, center staff continue their interviews and
documentation. Youk said some of those who took part in the
genocide, including guards at the notorious Tuol Sleng detention
and torture center in Phnom Penh, have expressed guilt and regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've interviewed former Khmer Rouge prison guards and killers
who say they are willing to face the court,'' he said. ``They feel
guilty. A former Khmer Rouge prison guard from Tuol Sleng is
helping us. His own wife doesn't even know he worked there. His
conscience is bothering him.''
</P>
<P>
   Youk says he will not rest until the Khmer Rouge leaders are
brought to justice and the organization is confirmed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was and it remains a curse on Cambodian society,'' Youk
said of the Khmer Rouge. ``It's like a virus. It has its own power,
its own life. I hope we can kill it.''

   The GSU in Atlanta will have nothing on the GSU in Statesboro,
if coaches and publicists in their respective conferences got it
right in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Georgia State was the pick in the Trans America Athletic
Conference, Georgia Southern has been chosen as the Southern
Conference favorite.
</P>
<P>
   In his two years as head coach, Rusty Cram, who had been a
longtime Lady Eagles' assistant, has guided the team to the
league's tournament title twice.
</P>
<P>
   This year, junior forward Sharon Mitchell (14.1 ppg, 7.9 rpg)
and guards Svetlana Trjeskal and Rosie Arnold will lead the Lady
Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mercer: Although his team is not a favorite in the TAAC,
Bears coach Billy Holmes has enough veterans back from 9-18 squad
to muster a few surprises. Holmes' fifth team at the Division I
school in Macon has 11 returnees, including all five starters, led
by senior guard (14.5 ppg., 6 rpg.). Even so, Mercet is picked
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Division II
</P>
<P>
   -- Fort Valley State: Still hurting from last year's loss to
Clark Atlanta in the SIAC semifinals, Lady Wildcats coach Lonnie
Bartley thinks he has the cure for this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bartley has added several top players to complement fifth-year
seniors Tammy Daniels, Cherilyn Washington and Charlene Williams
and fourth-year senior Nakisha Reeves, a group that contributed
greatly to the 77.3 points-per-game average.
</P>
<P>
   One is Jamie McDonald, a 5-7 All-America point guard who led
Trinity Valley (Texas) Community College to a 34-1 record and the
NJCAA finals. Anotheris 6-3 forward Naterria Mitchell _ daughter of
former NBA player Mike Mitchell _ who last played at Trinity
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the veterans is point guard Anita Griffin from
Savannah High, the South Georgia AAAA player of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great feeling having so many veterans, (who have)
overcome obstacles and know what it takes win,'' said Bartley, who
has averaged 20 victories in eight of his 16 seasons at FVS. ``We
can't wait to get going. It should be a great season for us.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Columbus State: Picked to finish second behind Francis Marion
of Florence, S.C., in the 12-team Peach Belt, the Cougars are
hoping Furman transfer Haley Cook, a 5-9 wing player from Dalton,
will provide enough to put them into first.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jay Sparks, whose team was 26-6 last year and 16-0 in
league play, already had a solid nucleus returning. It includes
point guard Lashawn Mincey, who led the team in steals (830 ) and
assists (6.8 apg), and senior Reagan Housch, who made 93
three-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   Division III
</P>
<P>
   -- Emory: With 6-2 senior center Bea Arendt and 5-10 junior
forward Sally Goldberg of Lithonia inside, coach Myra Sims might
have another group headed for the Divison III Sweet 16. Under Sims,
who has compiled a record of 91-36 the past five seasons, the
Eagles are expected to improve significantly on last year's 17-7
mark.
</P>
<P>
   -- Oglethorpe: Former Auburn star Angie Milford, an assistant at
Shorter the last four years, will try to guide the Stormy Petrels
to a winning record in her first year. Milford has nine players
returning from a squad that went 9-15 last season, including
starters Lisa Foley and Kendra Rimbert, who combined for 22 points
and 15 rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   NAIA
</P>
<P>
   -- North Georgia: The Saints, featuring one the premiere players
in the NAIA ranks in 6-0 junior forward Morey Lefeve, will be the
team to beat in the Georgia-Alabama-Carolina Athletic Conference.
Along with Lefeve, who averaged 21.2 points and 11.3 rebounds last
season, coach Buffie Burson-Watson has five others veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Southwestern, conference tournament champions under
coach Kip Drowns last season, is expected to challenge North
Georgia, with All-GAC standout Kizzi Trawick (11.9 ppg., 7.8 rpg.)
leading the way.

side two years ago along with some 1,000 guerrilla followers.
Today, Nhiem Kong is a powerful warlord, given contol over a wide

38. ``They tortured me and they beat me but they couldn't hurt my
soul.'' Today, Youk is the executive director of the Phnom
Penh-based Documentation Center of Cambodia. ``I'm not after
revenge,'' Youk said in the center's air-conditioned office, filled
with computers and filing cabinets that hold more than 1.3 million
individual testimonies of the Pol Pot years. ``I want to prove the

MOMA'S JACKSON POLLOCK EXHIBIT IS AWESOME  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - Jackson Pollock was the big bald bear in the T-shirt
and jeans. He marauded his way through the art world in the 1950s
and managed, with a handful of his friends, to take New York City
from being just another big city to its place as the center of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   His large drip paintings _ cobwebs of splatters and drips, as
simple as a child's scribbles and as complex as nature itself _
redefined what art could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pollock broke the ice,'' said fellow artist Willem de Kooning.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock died in a drunken car wreck on Long Island in 1956 and
since then, his reputation has had its ups and downs. There were
those who held that Pollock was the last great heroic painter;
there were those detractors who thought he was simply an overrated
amateur.
</P>
<P>
   More than one viewer has complained, ``My kid could do better
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, he was the very model for the pop culture image of the
Modern Artist _ moody, both self-aggrandizing and self-torturing, a
drunken rebel: ``What are you painting?'' ``What you got?''
</P>
<P>
   The largest exhibition ever of Pollock's work _ and the first
major show in 37 years _ opened this past week at the Museum of
Modern Art in New York, with 167 pieces covering everything he did
from his early days as a WPA hireling to his final equivocal
paintings done under the influence of depression and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   It is an awesome show.
</P>
<P>
   A retrospective sometimes causes us to completely re-evaluate
the career of the artist, discovering in his life something that
eluded his contemporaries. This is not the case with Pollock; his
retrospective rather reinforces the prevailing view.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean there are no surprises; there are several, and
seeing so many Pollocks in one place greatly illuminates his
career.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the paintings jimmied in side by side, so that his
whole career can be swallowed in a gulp, one finds the standard
view of Pollock's career is the true one, only, perhaps, more so.
</P>
<P>
   That is, Pollock has always seemed like a once-lost soul trying
his damnedest to be a great artist, but with very little of what is
traditionally called talent. His early paintings are hardly more
accomplished than those of a moderately talented high school
student. They mimic, first his mentor, Thomas Hart Benton, with
bucolic agrarian landscapes, then they mimic the harder-edged style
of the Mexican muralists, especially the more surreal Siqueiros.
</P>
<P>
   But his mimickry was never very good.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1940s, his paintings became thicker with paint and
took on as subject matter a kind of Jungian symbolism, with crusty
paintings titled ``Moon Woman,'' ''Guardians of the Secret'' and
``She-Wolf.'' They were deeply felt, perhaps, but clumsy efforts at
best, lumpy with thickly applied gobs of paint.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late 1940s, he happened upon the idea of dripping
paint directly on canvas, allowing the spillage to form images. It
was as if Pollock discovered himself. What had been clumsy became
elegant. What had been derivative became authentic.
</P>
<P>
   He had found his ``adequate means of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every age finds its own technique,'' Pollock said. And he
found his.
</P>
<P>
   Aristotle had written ``art imitates nature,'' and for
millennia, that has been taken to mean ``art imitates the
appearance of nature,'' but with Pollock, it meant ``art imitates
the processes of nature.'' Pollock was himself a force of nature
and his paintings grew by the same accretionary method, layer on
layer, each evolution altering what went before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am nature,'' he once said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1946 to 1950, he produced some of his best-known and most
characteristic paintings: ``Lavender Mist,'' ``Autumn Rhythm,''
``One: Number 31.'' The last two were nearly 9 feet tall and more
than 17 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   But Pollock, who fought a lifelong war with depression and
alcohol, found himself faced with the intractable problem: where to
go now.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, the painter Lee Krasner, said, ``After the '50 show,
what do you do next? He couldn't have gone further doing the same
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next two years, he made what are called his ``black
paintings,'' which both eliminated color, and rediscovered
figuration. They were like giant ink drawings, calligraphic and
enigmatic. Faces began appearing.
</P>
<P>
   But the black paintings didn't lead anywhere and he began
returning to his earlier styles, culminating in 1952 with ``Blue
Poles,'' a thickly crusted plastering of color and line, saved from
oblivion by the eight straight blue lines, pressed in by inked
2-by-4s, which give it compositional cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Blue Poles,'' he seemed to find several new directions,
and his last paintings seem like presages of things to come, but
depression stepped on his throat and he hardly painted anything at
all through 1954 and 1955.
</P>
<P>
   And then, on Aug. 11, 1956, he drove his car into a tree on Long
Island and put an end to his misery and his productivity.
</P>
<P>
   The first several galleries of the MOMA exhibit are a chore to
work through. They are there to provide background and context.
Frankly, the early paintings stink.
</P>
<P>
   But as you enter the drip-painting galleries, the level of
inspiration _ and the level of accomplishment _ leap forward.
</P>
<P>
   Pollock normally painted with his canvas on the floor. He stood
over them, half crouched, with a can of commercial housepaint in
one hand and a stick or crusty dried brush in the other, dipping it
into the can and swirling the brush over the canvas, about 6 inches
above the surface. Back and forth he would move, like a caged
animal, repeating his arm motions, stepping a half-jig step to the
left and repeating, over and over. A change of color, or a new kind
of wrist-flick would make a different kind of drip. The paintings
built up slowly, so that the first drips were often completely
hidden by the later ones.
</P>
<P>
   And to call them drips is not to do them justice. He had a whole
repertoire of drips. Some were spread out like ink lines, others
were a kind of polka-dot splat. Sometimes the paint would puddle in
the middle; sometimes when the puddle began drying, he would yank
back its skin as if he were picking a scab. It left a torn, ridged
surface.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the revelations of the show to see just how many
different things Pollock found to do with his basic drip. You might
expect a show with so many drip paintings to get monotonous, and it
doesn't. Not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, you revel in its variety.
</P>
<P>
   In some paintings, the paint is thick on the canvas; in others,
he dripped thin paint on unprimed canvas, staining them rather than
painting them. The line would bleed, like a fountain pen on porous
paper.
</P>
<P>
   It says a great deal that the exhibit curator would dare put
three of his biggest, best-known and best paintings in the same
room. Normally, you would expect the best work to be spread out so
it wouldn't compete with itself.
</P>
<P>
   But there, in a single large room are ``Number 32, 1950,'' the
all-black muscular skein of lines owned by the Dusseldorf museum in
Germany; ``One: Number 31,'' is a muted, diffused series of drops
in tansand browns, with almost no lines showing, just small patches
of color. And finally, on the third wall, is ``Autumn Rhythm Number
30,'' a sweeping scrawl of blacks, whites and browns.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his most famous works, and they are three distinct
emotional presences.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this shouldn't be that surprising. Mozart used the same
patterns of notes to write the effervescent ``Marriage of Figaro''
and the stern, lamenting ``Requiem.'' You would be hard pressed to
find a phrase or cadence in one that would seem out of place in the
other, yet, in toto, the effects are utterly different.
</P>
<P>
   And with Pollock, with the variations he finds in the basic
drip, you find paintings of utter joy, and others as depressing as
a death in August. &QL;

VAST SPACES INFLUENCED `JACK THE DRIPPER'  
 (ADV: WITH POLLOCK)  
 (EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Jackson Pollock was the quintessential New York
artist, at the head of the school of painting carrying the name of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pollock was really a Western artist, born in Wyoming in 1912
and raised through the most formative years in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Roy, brought his family to Phoenix in 1913, partly
for reasons of his health and partly because he wanted to be a
farmer and thought the 20 acres of irrigated land he bought halfway
between downtown Phoenix and Tempe on Sherman Street would be the
perfect place. That land now sits under Runway No. 2 at Sky Harbor
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   On that plot, Roy operated a dairy farm, supplying milk to a
tuberculosis sanitarium, and also grew vegetables, to be sold at a
farmers' market. He also sold melons to Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The family of Roy, wife Stella and five young boys, along with
their dog Gyp, lived in an adobe house, although to say they lived
in it is a misstatement since they spent most of their lives,
including their sleeping hours, outside it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a family photograph of the seven of them with their
faces buried in long slabs of watermelon.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was the baby of the family and was treated as such,
dressed in dainty clothes and lace. The other brothers all had
their chores, but Jackson was considered too young to perform
meaningful work.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently feeling more left out than privileged by this
idleness, he once tried to help with chopping some firewood. A
neighbor boy raised an ax to cut wood, and 4-year-old Jackson
pointed to where he thought the cut should be. When the ax came
down, Jackson lost the tip of his right index finger. One of the
chickens gobbled it up.
</P>
<P>
   All was not well in the Pollock family. Roy was a good farmer
but a bad businessman, and money was scarce. And Stella hated the
farm life; she wanted a solid middle-class comfort that Roy
couldn't give.
</P>
<P>
   To try to make her happy, the Pollocks left Phoenix in 1917 for
several tries at making a living in California. A public auction
was held May 22, 1917, and everything that Roy Pollock had tried to
build up was sold off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the end of my dad,'' remembered older brother Frank.
The family first moved to Chico, Calif., but eventually Roy
wandered away to make a living by himself, sending money home when
he could.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923, the family made a brief attempt at reconciliation and
moved back to Phoenix. Jackson was enrolled in Monroe Elementary
School. After his father left again, his mother brought in some
cash by working as a housekeeper for the wealthy Jacob Minsch
family.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't go well, and the Pollock family took off for
California again in the fall of 1924.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the end of Arizona for young Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the state, Stella hired on as a summer cook at
the Carr Ranch in the mountains east of the city, north of Globe.
It was there that Jackson first became acquainted with the ruins of
prehistoric Indian cultures. He later maintained that his style of
painting, in drips and splatters on a canvas on the ground, was
inspired by Navajo sand paintings and the Indian ruins he visited
in Cherry Creek Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, he would sometimes press his inked palm onto the
canvas, making a sort of signature. This palm print he first
discovered in the masonry of the ruins.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years later, young Jackson Pollock found his first
meaningful employment, working alongside his father and brother,
making the new road to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. It was
also as part of this road crew that Jackson first began drinking.
He took to it immediately and heavily.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell,'' his brother said, ``You work all week, what
are you going to do for fun on the weekend?''
</P>
<P>
   When summer ended in 1926, Jackson returned to his family in
Riverside, Calif., and went back to school.
</P>
<P>
   His career after leaving Arizona for the last time is one of
aspiration and frustration, mixed with bouts of drinking and
depression, but when he finally found fame as ``Jack the Dripper''
in the late 1940s, he always maintained it was this experience in
the West that gave him his sense of huge spaces to fill. &QL;

BRANDYWINE FUND STILL HAS LONG-TERM APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 08, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What do you think about the Brandywine Fund? I invested in it
four years ago, and it did well up until a year ago. The fund was
highly recommended, but now I wonder if I should sell my shares and
invest instead in Vanguard Index 500. I am 20 years away from
retirement. What would you do with Brandywine -- buy, sell, or
hold?
</P>
<P>
   J.D., Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If the question is simply whether to switch from Brandywine
fund to Vanguard's Index 500, I'd be tempted to stick with what
you've got. As you noted, until 1997 the fund had a spectacular
record. It then stumbled to a12.02 percent total return in 1997,
and has a year- to-date loss of 14.9 percent as this is written.
According to Morningstar Mutual Funds, which had downgraded
Brandywine's overall rating from average to below average, the
troubles stem from attempts time the market, building a huge cash
position during the first quarter, and thus missing that quarter's
rally, and then getting fully invested again just in time to get
hammered in July and August.
</P>
<P>
   But it's also important to remember that the fund manager,
Foster S. Friess, has been at the helm since 1985, and thus was the
person responsible for its splendid longer-term record, which still
shows average annual gains of 16.30 percent over the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the tough results have brought a sharp drop in assets
under management. The fund entered the year with $8.41 billion in
assets, and it held $4.78 billion as of the Oct. 29 report from
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. When it comes to managing a fund in
the small and mid-cap arenas, smaller is not only easier, but from
the shareholder's point of view, it probably should be better.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you are going to consider a switch, why not consider
a somewhat tamer fund in the same category? The T. Rowe Price
Mid-Cap Growth carries a lower risk score in the Morningstar
tallies and is rated above average. This fund gained 18.33 percent
in 1997, and has a year-to-date total return of 6.7 percent as this
is written.
</P>
<P>
   I make this suggestion because it seems to me that for the next
five to eight years the prospects seem much brighter for the
mid-cap and small-cap sectors than for the large-cap stocks, which
dominate the Index 500 portfolio; not only have the large caps had
a spectacular run for the past few years, taking them to a level of
substantial overvaluation, but the small- and mid-caps have lagged
behind to a great extent -- thus leaving them with a lot of
potential for pulling even.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 30 and my husband is 39; we will have been married for
one year this coming May. We are not at all sure in which direction
to go, or how much to save for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time we need to save for a house, children, and so
forth. At present, we only make $30,000 a year combined, but next
year I will graduate from nursing school and then should begin to
make about $30,000 a year. My husband is in the second year of a
four- year program to get his journeyman's electrical license.
</P>
<P>
   I figure if we live on my salary and bank all of his -- about
$12,000 a year after all deductions -- we will be able to afford to
buy a $200,000 house four years from now, with a substantial down
payment of $48,000. We will be able to save a lot after I graduate,
because both our cars will be paid off. We have no other debt, and
our rent is low since our in-laws own the building. We would like
to be comfortable in retirement and not have to pinch pennies as we
do now. Presently we have $8,000 in an IRA, $10,000 in CDs, and
last year we began to contribute to a 401(k) plan available to my
husband, contributing $25 per week, which is the most we can
afford. Based on my projected earnings of $30,000, beginning next
year, how much do you suggest we should put away, and where should
we put it?
</P>
<P>
   C.B., Dracut, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you may be putting a little undue pressure on
yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's tough to keep things together while your salaries are
low and you're working so hard to save for your first home. But
with your graduation from nursing school next year, followed by
your husband completing his training a year later, you can
anticipate a substantial increase in your earnings at that point,
and a great deal more financial comfort as well.
</P>
<P>
   My first instinct is to suggest that the very ambitious savings
program for your first home is enough for the moment; even when
your incomes have increased, you'll discover you can't do it all at
once. If it's possible, it would be nice to maintain some token
contributions towards your IRA program, just to keep in the habit.
But I wouldn't worry about how little it may be; once you've
completed the home savings program there will be time enough to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to get your savings into the right kind of
long-term investment vehicles that should bring you a comfortable
retirement. How have you invested the funds in the IRA money and in
your husband's 401(k) program? You should remember that these are
very long term savings programs, and given your youth you should
have the funds invested fairly aggressively, which is to say almost
entirely in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For your IRA, for example, I'd suggest that about half of it be
in a good large-cap growth and income fund, with the remainder
divided evenly among a small-cap stock fund, an international stock
fund, and a health care fund. For example, if we look at Fidelity's
menu, you might chose Fidelity Spartan Market Index for the first
position, with Fidelity Low-Priced Stock, Fidelity Overseas, and
Fidelity Select Health Care filling out the portfolio. (You can
build similar fund portfolios using other fund families.) You could
seek to establish a similar balance within your husband's 401(k)
program, or, if the selections are limited, you could earmark that
money to fit in as all or part of one of the elements outlined
above -- combining the IRA and the 401(k) in your mind to get the
desired balance.
</P>
<P>
   I can hear the wheels turning in your mind. Is this the same guy
who was saying in the previous letter that the stock market is
overvalued? Yes, but remember, we're looking at an investment
program that will span more than 25 years, so you can comfortably
ignore the surges and ebbs of the markets. The important thing for
a truly long-term savings program is to have the right portfolio
balance and then stick to it, riding through both the bull and bear
markets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, you will want to take no risks at all with
the real estate savings. I suggest you use a money market mutual
fund such as Fidelity Cash Reserves, where you might project
average returns of about 5 percent. The effect of this would be
that if you invested $1,000 a month for 48 months, the interest
would have brought the account up to $52,910 after four years,
which would indeed represent a substantial down payment.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have suggested inveesting in a fund that holds
government-guaranteed mortgage securities, expecting a taxable
yield of about 6.5 percent. I am not an expert, and have never
heard of such a mutual fund. Can you suggest one?
</P>
<P>
   J.K., Salem, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Most of the mutual funds that invest in government-guaranteed
mortgage securities have the terms ``GNMA'' or ``U.S. Mortgage'' in
their names. These funds invest all or most of their assets in the
securities put together by federal entities such as Government
National Mortgage Association (hence GNMA, or Ginnie Mae) or the
Federal National Mortgage Association (hence FNMA or Fannie Mae).
Basically these agencies buy government- guaranteed mortgages from
the lenders, bundle the individual mortgages into securities, and
sell the resulting securities in the markets. The government stands
behind both the interest and principal payments on the mortgages,
guaranteeing that the owners of the mortgage securities will be
paid even if the borrowers default. But the government does not
guarantee the market value of the mortgage securities, and they can
fluctuate in value fairly sharply, usually as a result of interest
rate changes. Almost all mutual fund companies have a fund with a
portfolio dominated by such securities. Excellent examples are the
Fidelity GNMA and Vanguard GNMA funds.

EEF UP THAT BOND FUND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 52 and currently employed, earning $40,000 a year. Due
to an inheritance from my parents I now feel financially
comfortable. Enclosed is my portfolio information. Is my money in
the right place, doing the right job, to allow me to plan an early
retirement in 10 years? I feel I'm well diversified, but maybe a
little too aggressive for my age. At retirement, I will collect a
total of $700 a month pension from two current jobs, plus a
projected $300 a month from my current job and $900 in estimated
Social Security benefits. Will I have enough for retirement?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; K.K., Needham, Mass. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be in fine shape for retirement, especially if you
make a few fairly minor changes in your $293,415 portfolio. The
list you provided showed 14 different mutual funds, eight common
stock positions, and a variety of cash-type savings accounts,
providing a breakdown of 61 percent stocks, 38 percent cash, money
markets and government securities, and the insignificant balance in
bonds. It's the latter category I think you should beef up, either
by replacing some of the stock funds with bond funds, or by
building larger positions in the funds such as Vanguard Star and
Vanguard Wellington that hold significant bond positions.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is to move toward a portfolio that works out to 50
percent stocks, 25 percent fixed-income holdings, and 25 percent
cash and government securities. The easiest way to make this move
would be within your two IRAs and your 403(b) account, where you
have a total of $69,949. If you were to sell all of these holdings,
moving the proceeds to bond funds, this would mean you would have
$72,510, or 25.8 percent of the total portfolio, in fixed-income
holdings, which, as they say, is close enough for jazz. As a
replacement for the stock funds, I would advise Vanguard GNMA as
the mainstay of your fixed-income portfolio, with smaller positions
in short-term bond and high-yield bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   On the cash side, the current $111,699 position is dominated by
$50,000 in government securities and a $31,266 CD. No need to rush,
but when the CD matures, you could then transfer that money into
taxable positions in some of the stock funds you previously held in
those tax-deferred accounts, most notably Vanguard Index 500 and
Vanguard Specialized Health Care funds. These moves would bring you
roughly into that 50/25/25 breakdown I suggested. Also on the cash
side, nearly $20,000 of your cash position is in bank money market
accounts. The odds are that your returns from these are very poor _
entering this week, the national average yield from bank money
market accounts was 2.46 percent; you can achieve double these
returns from mutual fund money markets.
</P>
<P>
   You might set a target for such a portfolio of 8 percent average
annual returns. If you achieved that, after a decade your $293,415
would grow to $633,481. You anticipate $1,900 a month from pensions
and Social Security. Let's estimate that in early retirement, when
your cash requirements should be lower, you can live on the same
$40,000 you do now, although its buying power would be somewhat
sapped by inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean your savings would have to generate $17,200 a
year for you. If you have the same 50/25/25 portfolio balance at
that time, the cash and fixed income portions of the portfolio
should be ample to supply that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband is 51 and would like to retire at age 62. I am now
working, but eventually will receive a minimal Social Security
benefit. We receive a Navy retirement of approximately $1,200 a
month, which provides cost-of-living increases in the range of 1
percent to 3 percent a year. When there was a change in my
husband's 401(k) program, we rolled the funds into a Vanguard IRA,
which consists of $9,163 in Vanguard Windsor, $13,367 in Vanguard
Morgan Growth, and $9,633 in Vanguard Prime Money Market. We also
contribute to his company's new 401(k) program, adding the $600 a
month maximum, and we now have $13,000 in Raytheon common stock and
$16,000 in Fidelity Magellan. Finally, we have another IRA of
$10,000, invested in Monetta fund, and we try to contribute $100 to
$150 a month to that account. Do you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; S.L., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The major change I would suggest is some fund transfers in
the two IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   I would swap Vanguard Windsor to Vanguard Windsor II; the former
seems to have run off track pretty consistently since its storied
former manager John Neff retired almost three years ago. It's now
rated above average for risk, and below average overall. Windsor II
fishes in the same waters; both funds hold value-oriented large-cap
portfolios. But Windsor II, has done a much better stock picking
job. Over a decade, its average annual returns lead those of
Windsor, 15.97 percent to 12.09; over five years, the scores are
18.01 percent to 12.38 percent, again favoring Windsor II.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I think the money market position is too conservative.
This portfolio has 11 years to grow, and settling for money market
returns from nearly 23 percent of the portfolio will prove a
serious drag. I'd swap the money market for Vanguard GNMA, which
will probably have a couple of bad years before your husband
retires _ Ginnie Mae funds are whipped around by interest rate
changes. But the odds are overwhelming that the other nine years
will more than make up for those tough years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd look elsewhere than the Monetta fund for a small
cap value position. I like the idea of having a portfolio position
in the small caps, but this isn't the fund to do it with. As of the
last Morningstar Mutual Funds report, the fund has been in the
bottom quartile of its peer group for six of the last ten years.
Moreover, it's hard to determine who its peers are; the fund's
portfolio has migrated over the past three years from a growth
concentration to a blend between value and growth to, at present, a
value portfolio. The fund posted its first top-quartile performance
since 1990 last year, when it gained 26.18 percent, but as this is
written it has lost 19.1 percent year-to-date, and it is back in
the cellar with Morningstar. I would look for a well-established
small cap value fund, such as Fidelity Low-Priced Stock or Longleaf
Partners Small-Cap funds.

U.S. PUMPS AID INTO STORM-RAVAGED CENTRAL AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Americans across the country are donating money
and emergency supplies to help the Central American countries
ravaged by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Mitch, one of the deadliest hurricanes ever, triggered flooding
and mudslides last week that killed an estimated 10,000 people in
Central America, mostly in Honduras and Nicaragua. More than 6,500
remain unaccounted for, and in Honduras alone, 569,000 were left
homeless. Public health officials say the survivors are vulnerable
to starvation and outbreaks of disease.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government itself will send $70 million in
equipment, food and services for emergency disaster relief to
Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, Clinton
administration officials announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Central American Resource Center in San Francisco, Ciria
Yela, who usually runs the center's dental clinic, bustled around
gluing Spanish-language labels to packages of rice, baby food,
bottled water and diarrhea medicine, stacked high in every office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here is worried. We've all got family there,'' said
Yela, who grew up in Guatemala. ``So we watch the news on TV and we
just try to work hard. I spoke with my parents Tuesday night and
they're all right, but two of my brothers are incommunicado.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, other staffers discussed the logistics of shipping the
goods and distributing them in Central America. Karen Zamd, the
Central American Resource Center's development director, admitted
it would be easier to handle only financial contributions, but
money is in short supply among the center's clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten overwhelming support, a lot of it from people who
don't have very much,'' she said. ``People bring maybe just three
shirts they can spare.''
</P>
<P>
   In Emeryville, volunteers packed a shipping container full of
medical supplies at the warehouse headquarters of the Volunteers
for Inter-American Development Assistance. The shipment will leave
Sunday for Nicaragua, where it will be distributed directly to
hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross, which has an extensive disaster relief network in
Central America, accepts only money to buy what it needs in bulk,
rather than trying to process and ship material aid. But even the
Red Cross has been hamstrung by the lack of infrastructure in the
storm-battered areas, said spokeswoman Angie Carrillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergency relief organizations are as awe-struck as anyone
else by this,'' she said. ``There's no simple way to get stuff in.
There are no roads, the bridges are washed out. How do you run the
helicopters without gasoline?''
</P>
<P>
   Some Central Americans said they preferred to send aid through
relief organizations rather than through government agencies in
their home countries. Some of them told stories of emergency relief
being hoarded or siphoned off by corrupt officials after
earthquakes and other natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Perez, a Nicaraguan-born nurse at St. Luke's Hospital in
San Francisco, said her relatives had lost everything when the town
of Tipitapa was flooded out by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to send them money, but I don't know if they'll get
it,'' Perez said.
</P>
<P>
   She was pleased to learn that St. Luke's, which is run by the
Episcopal church, was coordinating donations that would be sent by
the diocese directly to bishops in Nicaragua and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably half our staff is Central American and half our
patients,'' said physician's assistant Catherine Cusic, who is
helping to coordinate the fund-raiser. ``Everyone cares when
there's a disaster in the world, but this is actually happening to
our friends and families.''

WESTERN ATTITUDES FUELED WOMEN'S RISE  
 (ADV: NELLIE TAYLOE ROSS AND BETSEY BAYLESS ARE CQ)  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)

   PHOENIX - It's been 220 years since Abigail Adams implored her
husband, John, the future president, to ``remember the ladies''
while drafting the legal code for the new nation: ``Be more
generous and favorable to them than your ancestors,'' she advised.
``If particular care and attention are not paid to the ladies, we
are determined to foment a rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a rebellion by increment. Two centuries later and the
United States has never had a woman president or vice president and
women make up less than 12 percent of Congress and just 6 percent
of the governorships _ despite constituting roughly half the
general population. Bottom line: A woman in politics is still the
exception rather than the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The increments have been slightly larger in the West, however,
which historically has been more hospitable to women in politics.
This runs counter to the East's myopic perception of itself as the
center of sophistication and gender progressivism, but it's true
nonetheless. And Arizona _ which made history Tuesday when it
elected women to all five of its top state offices _ has long
helped lead the way.
</P>
<P>
   Not convinced of the West's relative open-mindedness when it
comes to gender politics? Consider:
</P>
<P>
   - The Wyoming Territory gave women the right to vote and hold
office half a century before ratification of the 19th Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   - Montana was the first state to elect a woman to Congress,
shortly after the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   - Texas and Wyoming in 1924 elected the first women governors
(Miriam ``Ma'' Ferguson and Nellie Tayloe Ross, respectively).
</P>
<P>
   - The first woman on the U.S. Supreme Court, Sandra Day
O'Connor, came from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   - The four states with the most women in their state
legislatures are all in the West _ Washington, Arizona, Colorado
and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   - Five of the 13 states that ever have had women governors are
in the West, a proportion way out of line with the region's general
population.
</P>
<P>
   So with its election last week of five women to the five top
statewide spots, Arizona simply refueled an train that left the
station long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, no other state in the nation has ever even elected women
to its top two positions _ let alone five _ according to the Center
for the American Woman in Politics at Rutgers University. Until
now. Gov. Jane Hull and Secretary of State Betsey Bayless are
Arizona's dynamic distaff duo.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up right behind them in the constitutional order of
succession are Attorney General-elect Janet Napolitano (the only
Democrat among the quintuplet of women victors), Treasurer-elect
Carol Springer and Superintendent for Public Instruction Lisa
Graham Keegan.
</P>
<P>
   Little noticed Tuesday at the end of this parade of Y
chromosomes is the president of the state Senate, who is _ you
guessed it! _ also female. Meet Republican Brenda Burns of
Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   So why have women in politics fared better in the West and most
especially this year in Arizona? Nobody knows for sure. But experts
are nothing without theories, and here are the ones I've collected:
</P>
<P>
   - There has always been something of a free spirit out here,
where women were helpmates in founding and taming the Wild West.
This made their transition into politics less jarring.
</P>
<P>
   - The West, while generally conservative, also has a Libertarian
bent. This sense of individual liberty is often gender-blind.
</P>
<P>
   - The West doesn't have the same sort of political machines that
tend to dominate cities like New York and Chicago. As a result,
women don't have the same good-old-boy barriers to break.
</P>
<P>
   - Western states tend to have more statewide elective offices,
making it relatively easier for women to ascend to positions of
influence.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, for example, there are nine statewide elective
offices _ the five cited above, plus three seats on the Corporation
Commission and the state mine inspector. Most Eastern states have
closer to two or three.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona last week, a happy convergence of circumstances
resulted in the election of the Fab Five. Each of the top five
offices had women running for them who were exceptionally
well-qualified and experienced. Both Hull and Bayless ascended to
the positions a year ago and had comported themselves so well that
their opponents _ male and female _ had difficulty making a case
for their ouster.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano ran a superb high-road campaign _ rarely even
mentioning the name of her opponent in her TV ads _ and became the
first woman ever elected to the state's top cop job and the first
Democrat to do so since Bruce Babbitt in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being exceptionally competent, Republicans
Springer and Keegan also were the beneficiaries of a state
Democratic Party so dormant that it didn't bother to field anybody
opposite them on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   It's now up to Hull, Bayless, Napolitano, Springer and Keegan to
demonstrate that they can govern as well as they campaigned. I and
many other Arizonans have high hopes that they will prove
themselves strong, compassionate and effective leaders _ not so
much because they're women but because Arizona deserves it. &QL;

   The auto columnist has been mulling a letter to the governor of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Now that we know who the
governor will be come the new year, it's time to take pen in hand,
as they say, and let fly. Just so everybody knows, you can all look
over my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL; 
The Hon. Paul Cellucci &QL; 
Governor of Massachusetts &QL; 
State House &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Gov. Cellucci, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations on winning a close one and finally shedding that
``acting'' label. And my sympathy on being virtually the only
Republican up there in a sea of Democrats _ especially in view of
the way you folks have been mouthing off about one another. But
I've got something better than sympathy to offer, Guv; I've got the
issue to glue you people together in a common cause: saving
children's lives. Interested?
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to agree that saving young lives is certainly
nonpartisan _ it's a no-brainer. And my request for a course of
bipartisan action speaks to another of your pet issues, education,
particularly teacher qualification.
</P>
<P>
   While you guys have been fussing and fuming over SATs, reading
scores, and growing illiteracy (all vital issues), you have been
ignoring the most woefully underqualified class of teachers tending
to the most disgracefully inadequate curriculum that purports to
prepare young people for life-and-death decisions daily. I refer,
of course, to that most bitter of oxymorons, Driver Education.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, young people die needlessly on our highways, not
because no one cares, not because no one is doing anything, but
simply because no one is dealing with the real cause. Our children
are being issued license to drive without fundamental preparation,
without the knowledge to inform decisions, with no real
understanding of the machines with which they are to be entrusted.
</P>
<P>
   You've read the stories; you've seen the photos; you've
witnessed grieving parents.
</P>
<P>
   Guv, six hours in a car and 30 hours watching TV presentations
do not translate into driving preparedness. Where is the training
in proper braking technique, steering control? Where is the
discussion of physics of driving, the nature of skids? Where is the
practice in accident avoidance? Our kids are taught to parallel
park _ not exactly a life-and-death matter, even in Boston where
people occasionally still practice parallel parking, usually
parallel double parking.
</P>
<P>
   How come when the Commonwealth tests teachers, there are no
driver ed teachers being examined? But then who would test them?
And on what, where?
</P>
<P>
   So, Guv, what I'm proposing is a blue ribbon commission to find
the professionals (they're out there) to map a strategy, prepare a
curriculum, the men and women who can be the cadre to train the
trainers of our children. We desperately need to turn to driving
professionals to set the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The training facilities, by the way, are largely in place
already _ all those unused or under-used airports around the region
offer safe localesfor advanced training.
</P>
<P>
   This piece of the education pie can be bought on the cheap,
relatively speaking _ don't start whining about the cost of it
anyway lest I ask that embarrassing question: What's a
16-year-old's life worth in Massachusetts?
</P>
<P>
   And let's quit the bushwa about advanced training ``teaching
them how to misbehave on the highway.'' That's what I call the
``sex education'' argument. Knowledge does not incur risky
behavior, Guv. Ignorance does.
</P>
<P>
   Let's give them the tools to survive out there and cut down on
the number of grieving parents whose children never learned to cope
with hydroplaning or just steered ``in the direction of the skid''
as an incompetent driver ed teacher told them to do (you've got to
do more than that, Guv). There's a dividend, too. Well-trained
teens grow into well-trained adults.
</P>
<P>
   I know you care; I know the other pols up there care, too. So
let's do something that will really make a difference. Before some
more children ride ignorance to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to discuss the matter, Guv, I'll buy lunch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sincerely, &QL; 
John R. White &QL;

CALIFORNIA GOP FEELING ITS PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A man with the Dickensian name of Rob
Hurtt sits at ground zero of Republican rubble today, his fate
symbolizing the major hurtin' the GOP has endured in California.
The heir to a food container fortune, he organized the Allied
Business Political Action Committee in 1992, recruiting candidates
faithful to the notions of the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he ran for office himself, loaning his campaign
$200,000. Hurtt was a floor leader, a Sacramento powerhouse. Today,
at 54, he is an ex-politician, having lost his state Senate seat in
a Democratic flood.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtt represents Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, the heart of
Orange County and of the Golden State GOP. Although he lost to
lawyer Joseph Dunn by fewer than 3,000 votes, the wound to the
party's psyche is deep.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years, California Republicans have thought themselves
special, and for good reason. One of their number has been on the
national ticket in eight of the 13 presidential elections in the
last half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, Republicans gleefully expected to demolish the
Democrats. Attorney General Dan Lungren, running for governor
against the Democratic lieutenant governor, Gray Davis, would
surely triumph. State Treasurer Matt Fong would easily defeat
Senator Barbara Boxer, a Democrat with high negative ratings.
</P>
<P>
   But in the state, as in the nation, the party stood for little,
and the Republican disease of existentialism permeated the Sierra
Nevada. The role models were not Earl Warren, Richard Nixon, or
Ronald Reagan, but Jean-Paul Sartre and Jerry Seinfeld. Fong
thought it was enough to be not Barbara Boxer. He lost by 10
points. Lungren hinted that he might be Ronald Reagan. He lost by
20 points.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans grumble that Gray Davis seized the middle of
the road, which their party monopolized for 16 years. Davis does
not deny the charge. Amid partisan cheers at the Hotel Biltmore in
Los Angeles Tuesday night, he articulated a status quo message,
saying his election ``is a clear affirmation that Californians want
to take a moderate path to the future. That is who I am. That is
how I ran, and that is how I will govern.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Fairmont in San Francisco, Boxer was less centrist,
recalling how often she was written off and why: ``They said I was
a fluke of history ... that I was too progressive ... too
supportive of our president ... too feisty ... even too short!''
She is short, but so is a demitasse of espresso, which her
reelection resembles, a strong jolt to keep Republicans awake with
anguish for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're licking our wounds,'' says state Senator Jim Brulte, a
party stalwart. ``The Gray Davis campign was flawless, superbly
run. The Lungren campaign was the flip side, a disaster from day
one. When the top of the ticket runs 20 points behind, it's like
putting cement shoes on every Republican candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   A factor in his colleague Hurtt's defeat was a bloc of Hispanic
voters in Orange County eager to squelch the comeback of Republican
Robert K. Dornan against Representative Loretta Sanchez. ``The
entire Democratic party was mobilized in that race,'' Brulte says.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Schnur, a Republican consultant, agrees, but adds, ``not
only was there a high Latino turnout, but a lot of conservatives
stayed at home because of the national debacle and the lack of a
national agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren lost all but one coastal county, Orange County, lost
most other suburban counties, and even large patches of desert. The
GOP prevailed only in a few small counties in the Sierra foothills,
making the topography of California resemble Cuba's in the 1950s,
with scattered guerrilla action, but no Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Hurtt was recently regarded as a revolutionary leader.
``It's like taking out Newt Gingrich,'' chortles Senate president
John Burton, whose Democratic edge is now 25-15 and for whom the
hurt on Hurtt meant ``going from ginger peachy to peachy keen.''

THE WOMAN WHO CAME FROM THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Alexandria, La.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I met the most amazing lady in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it happened. Jack and I, our younger daughter,
Julie, and her husband, Chris, spent three days in Florence before
settling into a small Italian hill town called Vernazza for some
hiking. We were visiting the Cinque Terra, a series of five
medieval villages tucked into a mountain range at the edge of the
Ligurian Sea, and our only goal was to walk the donkey paths that
wind their way through olive groves and vineyards high above the
water, linking the towns by foot trails.
</P>
<P>
   Jack and I had been to Cinque Terra 15 years ago, and to our
amazement and delight, almost nothing had changed. Pastel buildings
still rose straight up from narrow passageways tiled with stone.
Outdoor cafes still dotted peaceful squares undisturbed by
automobile traffic. Fishermen still brought their catch into town
at dawn and the pesto, made from homegrown basil and olives pressed
locally, was even more delicious than we remembered. We noticed one
new device, a small wagon on rubber tracks that enabled citizens to
carry loads up the winding stone staircases without breaking their
backs. We could have used one when we dragged our luggage up the 82
steep steps to our room.
</P>
<P>
   Every day we had breakfast, hiked, dropped into one of the towns
for a leisurely lunch, caught the train or a boat back to Vernazza,
napped, and spent our evenings at El Castillo, a 400-year-old
fortification high above the town, now a restaurant with a
magnificent view of the coast at sunset. You can get the flavor of
the area from this warning, posted exactly this way by authorities:
``We take the liberty of submitting to your attention the
particular oreography of our villages which, constituting the
reason for its esteem and characteristic feature, cause a
narrowness of space and structure at everyone's disposal. The calm
and tranquillity of this places, common interest of tourists and
inhabitants, are entrusted to the behavioral modification of
everybody. For that reason during the hours after sunset all kind
of clamour and noise or every disturbance of people's repose ...
will be punished like an indictable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   We amused ourselves in the evenings by playing very quiet games
of Rummy Cub.
</P>
<P>
   I met this woman as we hiked the most challenging portion of the
trail between Vernazza and Monterosso al Mar, the only one of the
towns with a sandy crescent of beach. There was something about the
sparkling water below, occasionally disturbed by the splashing of
dolphins, that seemed to clear her mind. With a bathing suit in her
backpack and a burning desire to throw herself into the ocean the
minute they descended to sea level, she was conscious of little
beside the warmth of the sun on her face and the delicious smell of
the perfumed air.
</P>
<P>
   E-mails and faxes and a list of things to do half a mile long
seemed artifacts from some previous life, irritants that she had
shed as easily as her previous _ now ridiculous _ concern with
dieting. She couldn't remember why she'd ever entertained the
thought that the earth and every person on it was doomed. Not
having misplaced a valuable piece of paper for days, she was no
longer tormented by the quirks of her attention-deficit-disordered
mind. She was in tune with all that was important _ people she
loved, a body she could count on, a sense of well-being powerful
enough to ground her in the present moment.
</P>
<P>
   While others sipped cappuccino in a beachside restaurant, this
woman ran down to the almost-deserted beach and dived into the sea.
Salty and buoyant, it lifted her up and rocked her effortlessly, a
cradle powered by gentle waves. This is the knowledge from which
all action springs, she thought, feeling herself floating under the
sky, a mere speck in a universe of souls. With a wave of gratitude,
she felt beating within her body what Joseph Campbell calls ``the
rapture of being alive.'' She gave me that memory as a gift to
bring home with me.
</P>
<P>
   I also returned from Italy with a new pocketbook, but when I put
it into service, it had too many zippers for someone with so much
to do in a hurry. I was about to ditch it when this woman prompted,
``Use the zippers as an excuse to stop whatever you're doing and
breathe deeply. Let them slow you down enough to give you time to
remember why you're here.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm using it now, thankful for the inconvenience. Like a
seashell held to the ear, it brings me back to a moment in time
when I knew what truly mattered.

SOY SUPPER IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A group of us from the Marblehead Cancer Prevention Project went
into Boston in June to hear the author of ``Dr. Susan Love's Breast
Book'' speak. Love's book had been my bible while I was awaiting
the outcome of a biopsy years ago, and so I was eager to hear about
her experiences in treating women with breast cancer. Our group,
however, had its own agenda. We wanted to find out everything Love
knew about breast cancer prevention.
</P>
<P>
   She had three words to say on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Soy. Soy. And more soy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know a lot of you think you don't like soy products,''
Love said, ``but if I asked, you'd say you don't like flour,
either. Yet you like cake and cookies. It's the same with soy. It's
capable of taking on many flavors and it can be delicious if you
cook it right.'' She went on to explain that cultures like Japan,
where soy is an integral part of the diet, have very low levels of
breast and prostate cancer, not to mention that the Japanese don't
even have a phrase for ``hot flashes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the car on the way home, we groaned. Tofu. Tempeh. Soy milk.
Soy nuts. Soy powder. Yuck. Love had suggested we eat 40 grams of
the stuff a day. The thought of having to ingest such a large dose
of soy every day made death look attractive by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   We had Love's suggestion. We just didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't we have a potluck soy supper,'' suggested Kathleen.
We joked: soy appetizers, followed by soy salads, soy main courses,
soy desserts, soy milk for our coffee. ``I'm not kidding,''
Kathleen insisted. So recently we gathered our spouses and
significant others for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   This was the menu:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sandra's Cheese and Crackers &LR; . Sandra found a brand called Tofu
Rella, which comes in both cheddar and mozzarella. The mozzarella
was excellent and is supposed to melt well. I would have no problem
using the cheddar in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jane's Original Sweet Curry Dip &LR; . Blend 8 ounces light cream
cheese, 6 ounces soft tofu, 12 ounces apricot jam, and 3
tablespoons curry powder in a processor until smooth. Chill
overnight. Serve with chips, fresh vegetables, ham chunks, etc.
Delicious!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jane's Original Smoked Bluefish Spread &LR; . Blend in a processor
three-quarters of a pound smoked bluefish, 8 ounces soft tofu,
juice of one lime, 3 tablespoons olive oil, fresh herbs such as
chives or parsley, and ground pepper. Spread on crackers.
Outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jane's Original Stuffed Mushrooms &LR; . Crunchy breadcrumb filling.
You'd never know these contained tofu. Excellent!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teresa's Apricot Picante Tofu &LR; . This was a sweet-and-spicy
dish, using firm tofu, served on rice. My personal favorite.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teresa's Grilled Spiced Tofu Triangles &LR; . Because this dish
looked like tofu, it had one strike against it before it even hit
my taste buds. If you must grill something, I wouldn't choose tofu.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Christina's Peppers Stuffed with Corn and Tempeh &LR; . As good as
any stuffed peppers I've ever had. Tasted like hamburger. Great.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kathleen's Soybean Casserole &LR; . Mexican flavor and a wonderful,
chewy consistency. If you like frijoles, you'll be crazy about
this.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Doug's Salad &LR; . Along with organic greens, there were soy nuts,
which added crunch, and ``sweet bean'' green soybeans, which are
now available in the freezer section of most supermarkets. With an
Italian dressing and sections of grapefruit, this was a winner. I
gave it a 10.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Robin's Banana Fig Tofu Pie &LR; . It wasn't quite sweet enough
until we added whipped cream. Wonderful texture. Surprisingly good.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Linda's Chocolate Tofu Pudding &LR; . Made from a mix in under five
minutes. Sweet, smooth, and satisfying. Would be great poured over
fresh berries, with a dash of whipped cream.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the evening, we were sated and amazed. This meal
confirmed my belief that wonderful things result when creative
people put their heads together. Soy isn't part of what we usually
consider an American cuisine, but once you move beyond your
preconceptions, it's a wonderful high-protein addition to one's
diet. I've been happily having a fruit frappe made with frozen
berries, banana, skim milk, and soy powder for lunch ever since.

RUBYWATCH (Phoenix) - The Phoenix Zoo's artistic elephant, Ruby,
undergoes a risky operation to remove the dead calf from her body.
By STAFF. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PAYRAISE-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - Although Arizona voters thumbed their
noses at the Legislature in Tuesday's election over such issues as
medical marijuana and campaign finance reform, they also granted
lawmakers one surprise gift: their first pay raise in 18 years. But
some lawmakers are less than thrilled with the raise, and several
of them say they voted against it. Why are they whining over a
$9,000-a-year pay boost? ``Because some of us are going to earn
even less than we are now,'' one Mesa lawmaker says. We explain
why. By HAL MATTERN. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RUSSIA-VEGAS (Las Vegas) - And now, fine art is invading the land
of Liberace. The Treasures of Russia exhibition is opening at the
Rio hotel in Las Vegas, and the new upscale Bellagio hotel is
featuring Impressionists. By DAVE WALKER. Story will move in the
``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
PHOENIX-DOWNTOWN (Phoenix) - Living in downtown Phoenix is becoming
a possibility for people who want to be near the ballpark or
theaters as more than 1,000 apartment units in several complexes
are finally underway. The area has been void of new housing for
years. By CATHERINE REAGOR. Story will move in the ``F'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FANTASY-FOOTBALL (Undated) - This time of year, most fantasy
leagues break into two camps - the guys stocking up on players for
the playoffs, and the guys starting Kerry Collins at quarterback.
Let's face it. Eight or nine losses will take the sizzle out of any
fantasy season. But there's still some fun to be had. By BILL
MULLER. Story moved in the ``S'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WRIGHT-TV (Undated) - A review praising the new Frank Lloyd Wright
documentary by Ken Burns and his collaborator Lynn Novick. In its
three hours, they do as good a job as you could ask in making both
the man and his work comprehensible, which is great, because both
man and work are difficult to capture. With WRIGHT-BURNS and
WRIGHT-ARIZONA. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story moved in the ``E''
category. EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 8.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
WRIGHT-BURNS (Undated) - To PBS documentarian Ken Burns, architect
Frank Lloyd Wright's life and work are equally compelling. Calling
him ``without a doubt our greatest architect,'' Burns said in an
interview that Wright changed ``forever the way we look at human
space, the way we live, the way we consider our place in the grand
scheme of everything.'' By DAVE WALKER. Story moved in the ``E''
category. EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 8.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
WRIGHT-ARIZONA (Phoenix) - A reminder to folks of the years Wright
lived in the Phoenix area, and the highlights/lowlights of his
tenure. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story moved in the ``E'' category.
EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 8.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
POLLOCK (New York) - A review of the Jackson Pollock retrospective
at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Pollock grew up in
Phoenix; his house now resides under a runway at Sky Harbor
International Airport. He later became what Life magazine implied
was ``The Greatest Artist in the World.'' By RICHARD NILSEN. Story
moved in the ``E'' category. EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 8.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
POLLOCKSIDE (Phoenix) - Pollock's connection to Phoenix, where he
grew up and went to school and chopped off part of a finger in an
ax mishap. By RICHARD NILSEN. Story moved in the ``E'' category.
EMBARGOED FOR SUNDAY, NOV. 8.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARIZONA-WOMEN (Phoenix) - It's been 220 years since Abigail Adams
implored her husband, John, the future president, to ``remember the
ladies'' while drafting the legal code for the new nation: ``If
particular care and attention are not paid to the ladies, we are
determined to foment a rebellion.'' It's been a rebellion by
increment. A woman in politics is still the exception rather than
the rule. The increments have been slightly larger in the West,
however, which historically has been more hospitable to women in
politics. This runs counter to the East's myopic perception of
itself as the center of sophistication and gender progressivism. By
KEVEN WILLEY. Story moved in the ``K'' category. EMBARGOED FOR
SUNDAY, NOV. 8. &QL;

LIFEBLOOD OF STRUGGLING TEXAS TOWN GOES ON AUCTION BLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDERSON, Texas _ Microphone in hand, auctioneer Ken Norris
paused between a Hoover sign and a Tru-Color paint display for a
gravel-voiced personal comment to the 100-odd buyers waiting before
him in folding chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are participating in 97 years of history. I am very
saddened at the event. Kerr Mercantile, I assure you, will be
missed in Sanderson, Texas,'' Norris said on a recent Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Then, starting with a large, hot-dipped galvanized steel tub, he
began the rapid-fire, piece-by-piece dissembling of a regional
retail institution.
</P>
<P>
   The task used up two long days and three auctioneers, and when
the last piece of Kerr's was sold, the only general store in the
southwest Texas hamlet of Sanderson was no more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are big old tears running down my cheeks. It's the end
of an era. It's devastating,'' said the judge of Terrell County,
Dudley Harrison. ``Right now, you can't buy a piece of fresh meat
in Sanderson or fresh fruit. And I haven't really needed a
replacement battery for my answering machine or a faucet washer or
needed to get a key made for my wife's car yet, but all those
things are gone, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Kerr's succumbed to the same merciless economic
forces that in the past three decades have seen Sanderson, the
Terrell County seat, shrink from 2,700 residents to fewer than
1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson Kerr, 46, the last to run the landmark store, said the
liquidation of the business founded by his grandfather in 1901
became inevitable as Sanderson continued to lose residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 10 years ago, I had some studies done of my market. Both
times I was told the best thing I could do was move elsewhere. I
was too big for this community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once sustained by railroad crews, and the sheep and goat
industry, Sanderson now ekes out a living as a pit stop for
tourists bound for Big Bend National Park and occasional truckers
who chose U.S. Route 90 instead of Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a home terminal for the Southern Pacific. The crews
lived here and worked west to Valentine. At the peak, we probably
had 250 railroad employees here,'' Harrison said. ``The terminal
left here less than 10 years ago and we lost 51 high-paying jobs.
It cost us $3 million in payroll, just bang. And the sheep and goat
industry went down the tubes when they (the government) eliminated
the incentive payments.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Murdoch, a professor of rural sociology at Texas A&AMP;M
University, said the decline of Sanderson mirrors that of small
rural communities across West Texas, the Panhandle and vast areas
in other Western states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of what Calvin Beale, the chief demographer for the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, called the greatest migration in
human history, which is the movement from rural to urban areas in
America,'' Murdoch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1930, a quarter of the U.S. population was on farms. That
is now less than 3 percent. This is a pattern you see manifested
when you look at a place like Sanderson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Terrell County officials have tried to attract
a hazardous waste dump, a space port, a prison and an assisted
living facility, all in vain.
</P>
<P>
   They also have tried to create a tourist industry with an open
road race, bird-watching, bed-and-breakfast inns, and dude ranches,
with only slightly more success.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the loss of Kerr's Mercantile was almost unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerr's was Sanderson for years and years. Everyone who grew up
here remembers things happening here. And there used to be good
dances here in my day up there,'' said Lou Smith, 64. ``Sanderson's
history is right now on the auction block.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Weyerts, 31, an officer of the Sanderson State Bank, said
he came to pick up some hardware, but also to see the end of Kerr's
with his own eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad old deal. Kind of like a funeral,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, Kerr's was scattered, pickup load by
pickup load, across West Texas and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, from the old Beatles wigs to the 12-foot-tall Levi
display man, from the forklift to mousetraps, from Depression-era
cabinetry to wide-screen television sets, all was sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man out of Colorado bought the Levi man. He's gonna hang it
in his restaurant in Salida, Colorado,'' Hudson Kerr said. ``The
Levi Archive _ people wanted it, but he outbid them. It went for
about $2,700.''
</P>
<P>
   By sale time, there was little sentimentality left among some of
the Kerrs. ``I've watched my husband work 18 hours a day, seven
days a week, and it's kind of a relief to me. It's been that way
since I married him eight years ago,'' Maggie Kerr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only regret I have is for my boys, Banner and Ward.
They've been running around in this store since they could walk and
they know every corner.''

VIEWERS SAY THE DARNDEST THINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So Scott Sassa is NBC's new entertainment president.
</P>
<P>
   Hear he's smart and practical and ambitious and sly and reserved
and energetic and considerate and eager and so polished he's a bit
surreal in a creepy sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   Hear other networks are salivating and circling like scavengers.
Mayday, mayday: Change means network is wobbly at top.
</P>
<P>
   Should you care? Not really. It's like serving under a U.S.
president or the Titanic captain. Don't matter who's running the
ship. We're still going down.
</P>
<P>
   Network TV will remain in trouble. Lose money. Demanding
audiences will still leave and laugh (at it, not with it), question
its relevancy, re-evaluate time devoted to it.
</P>
<P>
   A new network president affects livelihoods, but not ours. For
us mere mortals, nestled quietly in fly-over country, all we care
about is what they should care about: funny sitcoms, compelling
dramas, original shows.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls haven't flooded the lines here, quizzing me about
Sassa's credentials. Or his agenda. Or anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   Never do. Never will. The public's pulse isn't in Hollywood; the
beats start here and end here.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers don't want to know which network is first or third,
making money or losing it. They want to know how can Sammo Hung run
so fast and jump so high while being so fat? Was ``Friends'''
Phoebe really pregnant? Is Chandler really gay? Where can I
actually buy a Pax TV, and does it come with HDTV? Is that
``Becker'' the Ted Danson from ``Cheers'' or the Ted Danson from
``Ink''?
</P>
<P>
   Why did they bring that kid on ``Early Edition''? Can they get
rid of him without getting rid of the mother? How can Bill Cosby do
his show and that talking kids show? Isn't he kinda old? Why are
Suzanne Summers' skirts so tight and short on ``Candid Camera''?
It's disgusting. Where is Channel 17? Why don't the Simpsons ever
look any older?
</P>
<P>
   The new woman on ``Ally McBeal'' _ is that her real hair? It
looks like a white mop. Ally is anorexic. I read it in The Star.
Didn't Tony and Angela ever get married on ``Who's The Boss.'' I
keep watching reruns but can't find the episode. Is the ``Smart
Guy'' really smart? Boy, he seems so real. Will Marcus Cable ever
get ``Seven Days?'' Does Oprah Winfrey hate men?
</P>
<P>
   Where is Channel 68? How short is Michael J. Fox? How is
``Fantasy Island'' doing? I love that show. Will ``Fantasy Island''
make it? I hate that show. Are the sisters on ``Sister, Sister''
really sisters? Or do they just look alike? Whatever happened to
``The Naked Truth?'' I haven't seen it in a while. Was it canceled?
</P>
<P>
   Do they have real sex on ``Dawson's Creek''? Would my
13-year-old get ideas? Have you noticed how ``Sabrina, the Teenage
Witch'' actress, is dressing sexier? What's up with that? What's
the dog's name on ``7th Heaven''? If ``Jesse'' is 26 and her son is
10, doesn't that mean she was 16 when she had him? Was she married
at 16? How can I call the show to find this out? So, is that guy
really Cupid or is he playing someone who is Cupid or does he just
think that he's Cupid?
</P>
<P>
   Do you know where Janine Turner lives? Why would someone name
their daughter Felicity? I just hate that ``Drew Carey Show.'' I
just love ``Vengeance Unlimited.'' Will it make it? I love that
name (Felicity). It means happiness, you know. That ``Will &AMP;
Grace'' guy. Is he really gay or just acting like he's gay?
</P>
<P>
   Where's Howard Stern? I can't find him. Will Jimmy Smits die? I
like ``Brimstone.'' But should I watch a show glorifying the devil?
You're one of those uppity critics who don't like Howard Stern,
aren't you? I can't believe there's one of those big-chested
``Baywatch'' women on ``Law &AMP; Order'' Is there someone I can call?
</P>
<P>
   Writing is better. Address it to Scott Sassa, NBC Entertainment,
3000 Alameda Avenue. Burbank, CA 91523.

TECHNOWEENIES NEED TO ROAM, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Having become frustrated with America Online,
would you please recommend a more effective, yet user-friendly,
server?
</P>
<P>
   _ American Offline
</P>
<P>
   DEAR AMERICAN: Gee, I hate to be the one to break this to you,
but it doesn't get much easier or effective than AOL, even for the
cerebrally challenged. I know what you're looking for, though.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is a nice little place to get used to the online world. You
can learn how to e-mail and browse and mouse-click your way around.
You can even learn to chat with other users, who will most
certainly want to know A) what you're wearing right now and B) if
you will send them a naked picture of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL is only one small part of the Internet, like a corral
out on the prairie. Horses can come and go through the gate,
providing the system wrangler can keep it open. Many of these
horses are happy just to stay in the corral, chatting amiably with
other horses, wondering what they're wearing and trying to get them
to send naked pictures of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   What you're looking for is a true ISP _ an Internet service
provider. These are the people who let you dial into their big,
expensive computer that's connected to the entire Net. In the olden
days, two or three years ago, it pretty much took a four-eyed,
Xena-worshipping technoweenie to hook things up right the first
time. Well, we can look back on those primitive times and burst out
laughing now. If you can set up AOL, you can set up a Web browser
and a dialer. The ISP should give you software, instructions and a
help line number.
</P>
<P>
   Will you use the Internet when you're on the road? Try some
national or statewide company with a long list of local access
numbers unless you can handle the long-distance bill. If it's just
for home use, you'll probably find a cheaper deal with a local ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Pick your ISP carefully, which is to say, do it when you're
sober. Don't sign a year-long contract right away, because the ISP
may stink or be otherwise unreliable. Find out how long the company
has been in business and how many users it has per available
connection. Nothing more frustrating than a busy signal. Talk to
tech support and pretend to be totally in the dark. Big stretch,
huh? If you're not comfortable with the help desk dweeb, take a
walk. Lastly, ask the biggest nerd at work what he uses. He may get
so excited that somebody actually talked to him he'll do that trick
where he shoots milk out of his nose. I never get tired of watching
that.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID SOFTWARE TRICK: Here's something to try if you have
Windows 98 and are really bored. Click the Start button, open the
Programs menu and go to Accessories. Right-right click on an
application (like Notepad), then pick Properties from the menu that
appears. Now click the Change Icon button. Double-click on the icon
already in use and then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the Start button again. Hover just between Shutdown and
the Start button and a scroll arrow appears. Now on the list:
``Eject PC,'' which is what many of you Win98 users would love to
do.
</P>
<P>
   This trick doesn't always work the first time, so please don't
whine about it. I'm very sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   (Noted computerologist Dr. Emilio Bombay is warning you: Send in
some software tricks or he won't be responsible for what happens.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was far from a landslide, as numbers went; but, politically,
it was stunning. With something resembling defiance, America's
voters on Tuesday returned a Congress containing five more
Democratic members of the House and exactly the same balance as
before between the parties in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   With a Democratic president, in his sixth year in office, facing
impeachment by a Republican Congress, this was not supposed to
happen. But even the Republicans' richly financed efforts in the
last week of the campaign to whip up contempt for Clinton fell
flat. The voters sent a message, through his party, that they liked
him and wanted him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Assessing what this means for Clinton is easy: it buoys him up
remarkably. What it means for his party is less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, candidates and voters did their best in the
campaign to blur or ignore party labels. In New York, Charles
Schumer won a Senate seat as a pro-death-penalty Democrat. In
Florida, Jeb Bush won the governorship as a Republican reaching out
to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere, Republicans were billed as ``moderate'' (read:
pro-abortion-choice), and Democrats as ``conservative'' (read: not
for high taxes). Growing numbers of voters, especially in outdoorsy
and heavily forested states, proclaimed that they were independent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, too, relatively few people -- about 37
percent of registered voters, much the same as in 1994 -- actually
voted. The reasons for this apathy were short-term, in part.
Americans in 1998 are satisfied and prosperous: the savings ratio
is now negative for the first time in a generation, and
third-quarter growth, at an annualized 3.3 percent, is still
comfortably robust.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors, however, are much longer-term. Party affiliation
has always been more tenuous in America than in Europe. The clash
of ideologies is not much appreciated, still less the political
log-jams that go with it. Most voters do not want partisanship:
they want politicians who keep taxes low, make the streets safe and
get things done. In short, to most people, party hardly matters any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is decidedly nothing to replace the two-party hegemony
of Democrats and Republicans. Except in states like Maine, where
the Independent governor, Angus King, won thunderous re-election,
or Minnesota, where a hulking pro-wrestler, Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura, won the governor's race as a candidate vaguely attached to
Ross Perot's Reform Party, there are no other parties remotely in
prospect. Even if there were, they would have no money unless their
founders bankrolled them privately.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-party mischief plays well on the hustings for all the
reasons given above; but almost all candidates, whatever their
pretensions, must be wired to a party money-machine like patients
to a drip-feed.
</P>
<P>
   As everyone now knows, the raising of such money in the 1996
elections took the party committees down some shady back-alleys.
But distaste only goes so far. Those who try to rip out their
money-dispensing tubes, as the Democratic Senate incumbent, Russ
Feingold, did in Wisconsin, are brave and lonely figures. (Feingold
won, but by the skin of his teeth.)
</P>
<P>
   Few candidates dare either to turn down the funds or to irritate
the party establishment. It is the strength of these
money-machines, above everything, that ensures that
campaign-finance reform is thrown out again and again in Congress,
which in turn ensures that the two main parties will keep their
grip on American political life.
</P>
<P>
   The party system in itself has virtues; in modern America, it is
always to be preferred to the alternative, which is the inherently
selfish pushing of policies by lobbyists and single-issue groups.
Yet the parties that approached the mid-term elections were
demonstrably in a shambles, disunited and contributing very little
to the progress or governance of the country. Hence the widespread
public indifference.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting is that, as a result of the elections, both
the shambles and the indifference may now start to change.
</P>
<P>
   Start, inevitably, with the Democrats, whose despair of a few
weeks ago has now been transformed into delight. Going into the
elections the party was adrift, afraid to embrace the tainted
president but equally afraid to condemn him. Now, suddenly, it
knows which way to go; it can treat Bill Clinton as an asset again.
</P>
<P>
   This warm re-embrace is crucial, and not just because he is the
president. Clinton is the most talented politician the party has (a
man who, even this autumn, could still outflank the Republicans to
get the budget he wanted), and its only visionary. For six years
now -- indeed for closer to ten, if one counts Clinton's reforming
work at the Democratic Leadership Council -- the party has come to
depend on his ideas of what it should be: in short, a party
unafraid to befriend business, support free trade and begin to snip
the apron-strings of the nanny-state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton does not have a great deal to show, in legislative
terms, for this bold shift to the center. The doomed attempt to
reform American health care in 1993 must now stand as the only big
reform that he tried on his own initiative. The reform of welfare
in 1996 and the balanced-budget agreement of 1997 came only after a
strong shove from the Republicans, who in 1994 had swept Congress;
and by then the president's reformist zeal had already become
miniaturist, revolving round school uniforms and V-chips in
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The tragedy of his reckless slide into possibly impeachable
conduct was that his party's reformist program capsized with him.
It will hardly recover now -- too late for that -- but he might at
least become the Democrats' leader again.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say he has not quite managed that yet. He was never a
politician with coat-tails, and he has never schmoozed with the
congressional Democrats as, say, Lyndon Johnson did. His lack of
skill in this department, combined with his shift to the center,
has given an opening to the diehard chunk of the party that never
went away: the ``old'' Democrats, speaking for the poor,
minorities, environmentalists, blue-collar workers, and all who
feel threatened or left behind by the modern world. This is the
rump of the party that Franklin Roosevelt made in the 1930s,
committed like glue to activist government.
</P>
<P>
   These people have a compelling argument: they have seen the
future, they fear it, and they want government to help. Five years
ago the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA) almost fell to
left-wing sniping, and last year Clinton's attempts to get
fast-track authority for trade-agreements were wrecked by it. The
old Democratic line proved so persuasive in that case that only one
in four House Democrats gave the president their support.
</P>
<P>
   This wing of the party, captained by Dick Gephardt, the House
minority leader, has not been soothed by good economic times. On
the contrary, it has seen them as a new reason to condemn the
colossal inequities in American incomes and in society at large.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has taken Tuesday's results as a vindication that ``the
people'' want to be heard. He said much the same when fast-track
fell. The labor unions, who contributed $37 million to the party in
1996, like his stand on trade, and may well finance Gephardt to
some extent if he decides to run against Al Gore in the Democratic
primaries in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He will probably still run, but Tuesday's results may have
changed his calculations. For some time, Gephardt has maintained a
frosty distance between himself and Clinton, even declaring in 1995
that the House Democrats were ``an independent organization.''
Subsequent efforts to bind them to the main party, including a
meeting last July chaired by Hillary Clinton at her most soothing,
failed to lead to the hoped-for entente cordiale.
</P>
<P>
   But the very people who were most motivated to vote on Nov. 3 to
show their support for Clinton were precisely ``old'' or
``liberal'' Democrats -- women, Latinos, and especially blacks, who
almost doubled their share of the total vote. Given that wave of
sympathy, and given the strength of Gore's probable Republican
rival, Gephardt may make himself less thorny for a while. He may
become, for tactical reasons, almost Clintonite.
</P>
<P>
   This will give a respite to Gore. The vice president can only
benefit from the boost to the fortunes of his leader, to whom he
has always been linked as closely as hand to glove. After a period
when he seemed as uncomfortable in his inevitable succession as
Britain's Prince of Wales, he jumped rip-roaring into the last
weeks of the campaign, as if he could sense the way the wind was
blowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats will now undoubtedly begin to close ranks behind
Gore as Clinton's heir. But this has a drawback, from Gore's point
of view; it makes it harder for him to be his own man.
</P>
<P>
   He has never offered his party a philosophy, beyond the vaguely
spiritual greenness that used to be his trademark. Nor has he given
much indication of how good a leader he is. He has none of
Clinton's consummate political talent or his ability, on occasion,
to stare down awkward friends.
</P>
<P>
   But the plain fact is that no Democrat (not Gore or Bill Bradley
or Bob Kerrey, or those other time-worn names with a toe in the
water) impresses as much as the man who, by his own folly, has
deliberately made himself smaller than he should be.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Democrats, how do the Republicans stand?
Since election day, the picture is more confusing. They have
become, and remain, the majority party in the sense that matters:
if America can be said to have a political complexion, this is now
Republican. In the past decade, almost all the social changes that
have swept America have moved it in a Republican direction.
Manufacturing industry, a rich source of Democratic votes through
the labor unions, has given way to the non-unionized service
sector.
</P>
<P>
   Whole regions have moved away, too. As the South has modernized,
abandoning its legacy of segregation, Republicans -- once spurned
as the anti-slavery party -- have not only gained a foothold there,
but have feasted on the region's natural conservatism. The
fastest-growing parts of the country, in California and the Rocky
Mountain West, are also natural Republican territory: gung-ho for
development, prosperous and suburban.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's elections do not alter that. The Republicans have very
slightly lost their grip on Congress, but they still control it.
Their position is even stronger at state level, where they hold 31
(previously 32) of the 50 governorships. This seems to underline
their supremacy well into the future, since it is governors who
will preside over the congressional redistricting that will follow
the census in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, too, the more pushy and interesting
political figures have come from the Republican side of the fence.
The party has had momentum; it has had money, and, for a brief
glorious spell, it also had ideas. In September 1994, just before
the last set of mid-term elections brought a Republican landslide,
Newt Gingrich presented his ``Contract with America'': a list of
ten policies which, he promised, would get through the House within
100 days. Amazingly, most of them did, and even got further.
</P>
<P>
   The shell-shocked Democrats found themselves agreeing to
deregulation, devolution of power to the states, the loss of
congressional perks, and the wholesale rearranging both of federal
subsidies to farmers and welfare payments to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, however, nothing of this fervor remained. The
Contract died long ago, and nothing has succeeded it. The
Republicans assumed that Americans backed their revolution, when
the vote of 1994 was really a slap at the Clinton Democrats; and
they were stalled by their own arrogance, which reached its apogee
when they shut down the government in the winter of 1995 rather
than compromise over the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, though they have held their slim majorities, they
have lacked the legislative skill to do much with them against a
Democratic president. As Gingrich told the Washington Post
recently, Republican leaders are still ``learning to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich himself, reviled by the public and almost the victim of
an internal party coup against his speakership in 1997, has still
not recovered, and Tuesday has made it worse. The once-brilliant
leader is now mocked not just for being clumsy over the budget and
allowing Democrats the advantage, but for misreading the popular
mood and calling the election wrong.
</P>
<P>
   There are curious parallels here with the Democrats. The one
Republican who could be called a visionary, whose eyes are fixed on
a future Utopia and how to get there, has been weakened by his own
folly. Gingrich has his batty side, and it is not clear what his
new idea, ``21st-century Reaganism,'' really adds up to, beyond an
assertive foreign policy and lots more computers. But he gave his
party, for a while, a blistering coherence, and that has
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Political pundits think Gingrich, who has a formidable
money-raising machine, may just possibly recast himself and run in
2000; but his congressional troops will be harder to reassemble.
Their shoulder-to-shoulder unity on the various inquiries into the
president's conduct, culminating with the inquiry into impeachment,
looks all the more vindictive because the party is divided on so
much else.
</P>
<P>
   The internationalist Gingrich (and, to a lesser extent, the more
parochial southerners, Trent Lott and Dick Armey, who lead the
Republicans in the Senate and the House) are still bothered by the
wilder elements who came into the House with the landslide of 1994.
These Republicans -- now revelling in the acronym CATs, for
Conservative Action Team, and centered round David McIntosh of
Indiana -- have not forgotten the Contract and, especially, the
moral dimension it was meant to have. In small print at the bottom
of the list were limits on abortion, support for prayer in schools
and -- ever since the appearance of Starr -- a crusade against the
nationwide depravity represented by the president.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results have been a decided slap in the face for that
crusade. Highly motivated conservative voters were balanced, to say
the least, by highly motivated Democrats. The public, which has
already told pollsters overwhelmingly that it does not want special
prosecutors to be preachers, does not want its politicians to be
preachers, either. Most Americans want abortion to stay legal. Most
prefer, too, to keep intact the wall the constitution has carefully
erected between church and state. And most think their sinning
president should be left alone.
</P>
<P>
   Every Republican nominee for president, down to Bob Dole in
1996, has struggled to incorporate the moralistic wing of the party
into some notional ``big tent'' where all opinions are ostensibly
respected. It is bound to do so, it supposes, because of their
legions of supporters outside Congress. Randy Tate's Christian
Coalition, Gary Bauer's Family Research Council, Jim Dobson's Focus
on the Family, are pressure groups the party hates to alienate,
even if they have nowhere else to go. Every time Dobson threatens
to flounce out of the party and take his people with him (as he
last did in February), the leaders must scramble to soothe him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they know now, for sure, that it is just as dangerous to
pander to these groups. Even throwing tiny bones in their direction
(as when Lott, in June, called homosexuality ``a sin'') gets them
into instant trouble with the great mass of voters who are tolerant
sorts.
</P>
<P>
   There have been strong signs, too, that the more the Republican
Party appears to be led by the nose by the religious right, the
more businessmen become unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   On China policy, for example, corporations were astonished that
the right cared more to make a point against religious persecution
than to secure open trade. It would be a disaster for the party if
business hands stayed in pockets. But the right is now so furious
with the party leaders' mistakes that they will now be more
disruptive than ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is also another problem to face: the cavalier way in which
the Republican Party has ignored or even antagonized the
fast-growing Latino electorate. Latinos, whose self-reliance and
old-fashioned morality would seem to make them natural Republicans,
have been enraged by Republican support for anti-immigrant
proposals, both locally and in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, sensing the drift, began last year to soft-pedal his
party's bids to restrict immigration and end job preferences based
on race. Several Republican candidates started Spanish lessons, and
governors in heavily Latino places (especially the Bush brothers,
George and Jeb, in Texas and Florida) made pitches for the Latino
vote. This worked in both states, with both Bush brothers winning
handsomely on Tuesday; but it made no difference in the most vital
contest, the governor's race in California, where two-thirds of
registered Latino voters are now Democrats. There, the Republican
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Republicans' hubris has come back to haunt them.
They are indeed still learning, and sometimes they learn too late.
Shouting in a vacuum It is strange, but no accident, that most
discussion of the present state of the parties ends up by focusing
on the most disaffected sectors. These are the parts that make the
noise and provide the color against the vapid centrism of everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   But, with their essentially backward-looking ideas, they also
keep Congress in an ideological log-jam in which little gets done.
If, for different reasons, the parties begin to unite and present
themselves more positively, matters might improve.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the parties have occasionally borrowed useful
ideas from each other and have even managed that American idyll,
bipartisanship. Indeed, the distinctions between the parties have
been blurring for a decade or so. President George Bush's brand of
Republicanism was advertised as ``kinder and gentler,'' caring
about the little man; Clinton's version of the Democratic credo
stressed fiscal responsibility and a certain social
hard-heartedness.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Gingrich eruption inspired, in the end, yet more
cross-dressing. Its apotheosis came in the agreement, last year, to
balance the federal budget; an agreement made easier for both sides
by soaring tax revenues as the economy boomed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this was almost all the last Congress produced. Old partisan
habits meant that, on most issues, the parties took up their
routine positions: in favor of spending the budget surplus on a tax
cut (Republicans), or for using it to save Social Security
(Democrats); against school vouchers (Democrats), or for them
(Republicans).
</P>
<P>
   Policies which require a certain amount of open-mindedness, or
which might be hard to explain in 30-second sound-bites to voters,
seem to sink in bipartisan indifference. This is what happened to
the attempt to reach agreement with the tobacco companies over
lawsuits against them; and it is what happened, almost needless to
say, over campaign-finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Debate did not simply evaporate because Clinton was distracted,
though that did not help. The parties were distracted, too. Their
job -- as they have seen it in recent years -- is not to tease out
policy, no matter how much the think-tanks on both sides ply them
with studies. Their job is to raise money continuously and on a
vast scale to make sure their candidates are kept in, or pushed
into, power.
</P>
<P>
   So, given that this remains their job, whom will the parties
push into power next? The answer is more encouraging than recent
history, with its record of carefully packaged and anodyne
presidential candidates, might suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, iconoclastic governors are the men to watch. Most
presidential campaigns contain a governor or two, and they have
often been the victors in recent years; but the present crop is
different. They have more power than their predecessors, because of
the devolution of social services that followed the 1994 Republican
sweep; and they have more money, because the economic boom has
filled their tax coffers. As it happens, every one of them is a
Republican: and they may offer precisely what the warring party
needs.
</P>
<P>
   The man on whom hopes have come to rest is George Bush, Jr., the
Republican governor of Texas, who was re-elected on Tuesday with 69
percent of the vote. He is a pretty mild version of the breed: a
man who is judged, and who sees himself, less as a great reformer
than a unifier of factions.
</P>
<P>
   But that is good enough. Bush has proved to have tremendous
coat-tails; so tremendous, that the Republicans won every statewide
race. He has a famous name, and he has -- at least on his Texas
showing, all cowboy boots and drawl -- a large dose of that
essential ingredient, charisma. Money pours after him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is merely the most-marketable tip of Republican talent
from the states and cities. Consider Tommy Thompson, the governor
of Wisconsin, a pioneer both in reforming welfare and streamlining
government services; brother Jeb in Florida, with his new, caring
brand of Republicanism; Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who has slashed
business taxes; and -- among the mayors -- New York's Rudolph
Giuliani, who has revelled in iconoclasm and showmanship as he has
cut crime and cleaned up the city.
</P>
<P>
   The energy of the Gingrich revolution, which has so notably
drained out of Congress, still survives at state level; and it is
this that has given America much of its present Republican
coloring.
</P>
<P>
   But here lies the irony. Voters overwhelmingly vote for these
men not because they are Republican, but because they get things
done. If a governor cuts taxes, draws investment and makes the
schools better, it does not matter what his affiliation is, just as
it does not matter what his race is. These men in their domains --
unlike the self-proclaimed ``free spirits'' among the congressional
candidates, who tend slavishly to vote with their party once they
get to Washington -- can seize or borrow any policy they choose,
pursue any group of voters they think useful, and have no
philosophy at all except what they like and what works. Their
wholehearted pragmatism also means that they either have little
time for the party's more moralistic policies, or give them a
gentler cast.
</P>
<P>
   This independence can cause occasional heartburn to the party
power-brokers. They do not know quite what these local Republicans
are up to, and are clearly afraid that on some issues, such as
education reform, they are getting way ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Republican governors have not forgotten how
the congressional party has blown hot and cold on block grants to
the states to fund social services. But the devolution of power to
the states is not to be reversed, unless a deep recession drives
the governors back into Washington's arms.
</P>
<P>
   The party therefore has to make an uncharacteristic leap of
faith: it can have its highly attractive Mr. Fixit candidates,
while accepting that they appeal directly to the voters' dislike of
partisanship and the party machines. But here an intriguing paradox
emerges. That same Mr. Fixit, if he can get past residual
suspicions, may end up uniting his disparate party behind him as he
has previously united his state. A George Bush, indifferent as he
may appear to political labels, makes his party stronger.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge, now that the elections have suggested greater
cohesion among both Democrats and Republicans, will be for stronger
parties to produce strong agendas and productive ideas. Eyes are
turning eagerly to the prospect of Bush v Gore: the new outsider
and the old insider, two potential soothers of party factions who
lead their rivals by miles -- but who are not noted for their
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   All that remains, if America is to enter the 21st century with a
two-party system that actually works, is for them to find the ideas
that will inspire their factions to unite rather than fight.

 &HT;    BRITAIN'S ANGST OVER SEARCH FOR NEW POET LAUREATE; A FAB CHOICE
IN MCCARTNEY?

   LONDON _ Sir Paul McCartney, her majesty's poet?
</P>
<P>
   Don't jeer -- or cheer -- so quickly. The name of the former
Beatle is floating among those of more orthodox bards as Britain, a
country that often has found its identity in poetry, seeks a new
laureate.
</P>
<P>
   A debate over an institution that seems slightly out of place
these days began almost immediately after last week's death of
laureate Ted Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 68, held the post since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   As with many discussions in Britain today, the theme of the
debate boils down to a struggle between revering the past and
pursuing the future.
</P>
<P>
   The poet laureate is one of Britain's oldest institutions,
dating to the 15th Century and remains part of the queen's official
household. The annual pay, which amounts to $100 and a large cask
of good canary wine, has changed little in more than 400 years.
(The wine was restored to the compensation package at the
insistence of Hughes' predecessor, Sir John Betjeman.)
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the poet laureate was required to write court odes
and to celebrate state occasions in verse. This part of the job has
all but disappeared, and Hughes, who is perhaps best known outside
Britain for his marriage to American poet Sylvia Plath, tended to
follow his own muse, occasionally dedicating a poem to the queen.
He wrote a few verses to commemorate the death of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the office of poet laureate is relatively
new, created by President Reagan in 1986. Before then, the chair of
poetry at the Library of Congress was recognized as the national
poet. American poet laureates serve one -year terms and have few
public duties. Robert Pinsky, the editor of an Internet poetry
magazine, holds the post now.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the position, which has been held by such giants as
William Wordsworth and Alfred Tennyson, is viewed by many with
considerable gravity. Hughes' death was treated as major news here,
and his book, ``Tales From Ovid,'' an interpretation of Ovid's
``Metamorphosis,'' is a runaway best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   Conventionalists fear the venerable post may be seized by Prime
Minister Tony Blair's culture savvy government as an opportunity to
make a statement about diversity or populism.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who has been pushing his countrymen to shed some of their
stuffy reserve, reportedly favors opening the selection to the
public by polls and even the Internet rather than leaving it solely
to Britain's literary establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowland, Blair's Northern Ireland secretary, caused a stir
last week when she suggested that McCartney, the author of such
works as ``Silly Love Songs,'' and ``Ebony and Ivory,'' was perfect
for the job. ``That's what we identify with,'' she told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   England's tweedy academics are alarmed. Michael Holyrood, the
head of the Royal Society of Literature, expressed little comfort
at the idea of throwing the matter open to the masses. ``Not
everything can be done by election,'' Holyrood said. ``The
government should use people that know most about poetry to advise
them -- and to avoid making fools of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A Downing Street spokesman said that Blair has made no decision
about how to proceed, but he added that the prime minister will
consult broadly before making his nominations to the queen.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be some agreement that this is an opportunity to
at least update the post, perhaps making it more like the American
model with set terms and duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought the time was right for a change,'' said
popular Liverpool poet Roger McGough. ``If there was one poet who
was head-and-shoulders above the rest, one obvious choice such as a
Tennyson, then there would be no need to tinker with the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people have put up widely different suggestions, and a lot
of people are going to be disenchanted,'' McGough said. ``If you
have a five-year fixed term then you can have your ethnic and
female poets and get a spread of people rather than a Welsh bard or
a Scottish laureate.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even a lad from Liverpool.

for the job. ``That's what we identify with,'' she told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   England's tweedy academics are alarmed. Michael Holyrood, the
head of the Royal Society of Literature, expressed little comfort
at the idea of throwing the matter open to the masses. ``Not
everything can be done by election,'' Holyrood said. ``The
government should use people that know most about poetry to advise
them -- and to avoid making fools of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A Downing Street spokesman said that Blair has made no decision
about how to proceed, but he added that the prime minister will
consult broadly before making his nominations to the queen.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be some agreement that this is an opportunity to
at least update the post, perhaps making it more like the American
model with set terms and duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought the time was right for a change,'' said
popular Liverpool poet Roger McGough. ``If there was one poet who
was head-and-shoulders above the rest, one obvious choice such as a
Tennyson, then there would be no need to tinker with the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people have put up widely different suggestions, and a lot
of people are going to be disenchanted,'' McGough said. ``If you
have a five-year fixed term then you can have your ethnic and
female poets and get a spread of people rather than a Welsh bard or
a Scottish laureate.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even a lad from Liverpool.

TREES THAT DAZZLE NOT ONCE BUT TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 8) 
(jt) 
 By PATRICIA A. TAYLOR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I call them two-season trees. They are the kind whose foliage is
aflame at this time of year and whose branches are decked with
beautiful, often fragrant flowers in spring or summer. They offer
shade and splendor, providing a handsome return from a
horticultural budget.
</P>
<P>
   My first two-season tree was a Japanese stewartia (S.
pseudocamellia). I chose it six years ago for its white,
camellialike flowers from late June into early July; its fiery
orange-red foliage from late September through October, and, as a
bonus, its reddish and orange-brown exfoliating bark in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Growing about a foot a year, it is now 20 feet tall and should
top out at about 35 feet. Its noninvasive root system allowed me to
place it about 12 feet from a back room with three large,
north-facing windows. I love to relax there and gaze out at the
tree's ever-changing scenery. And relax I can because, aside from a
weekly watering during its first year, the stewartia has required
no care.
</P>
<P>
   I thought it would be great to have more multiseason
attractions. My problem was how to stack them into my quarter-acre
lot in central New Jersey. I began by working backward. Two
Carolina silverbells (Halesia carolina) are now situated behind the
stewartia. In mid-May, I peer through the airy spaces between leaf
buds ripening on the stewartia and admire a vista of white flowers
dangling from the silverbell branches. These exquisite flowers do
resemble bells and hold for about two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There was room for just one more tree to anchor the row, and
selecting it was difficult _ there are just so many excellent
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A local street planting of Cumulus shadblows (Amelanchier X
grandiflora) convinced me that I had found the right choice. Though
most shad-blows are bushy, the Cumulus cultivar assumes a slim
columnar form, an apt shape for my small property. Its numerous
small white blossoms open among slate gray branches by mid-April
and, if hungry birds aren't too quick, become attractive red fruits
in summer.
</P>
<P>
   I have now created a four-tree row that comprises three
different species, which are unified by similar heights, flower
color and leaf size and shape. For my indoor viewing pleasure,
however, I have made sure that bloom times are staggered. From
April into early July, I can watch a tide of white flowers wash
down through the trees to my house. And then, shortly after Labor
Day, I am treated to spectacular foliage. It spreads from the
middle, starting with the splash of lemon yellow on the
silverbells.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, orange and scarlet flecks appear on the
Cumulus foliage, and then the stewartia picks up the beat, with
intense hues ranging from giddy orange to a voluptuous red purple.
</P>
<P>
   It was a challenge to work Forest Pansy (Cercis canadensis) into
my limited landscape, as its heart-shaped leaves and reddish-purple
flowers did not fit in with my mixed tree border in the back. In
what some may regard as heresy, I replaced an old lilac on the side
of the house with this stunning redbud cultivar.
</P>
<P>
   While I miss the lilac scent and flowers in May, Forest Pansy
provides much longer interest. In mid-April, its sleek, dark gray
branches are studded with tiny blossoms, and in fall this same
background color highlights lemon yellow leaves.
</P>
<P>
   It is during the warm months, from May well into August, that
Forest Pansy is especially appreciated, for its branches are
decorated with handsome foliage, starting as a rich dark purple and
eventually becoming blotched with dark green.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm trying to decide how to work in a franklinia (F.
alatamaha). This tree was discovered by the Pennsylvania botanist
John Bartram in the 1700's but has since disappeared in the wild.
Its leaves resemble those of magnolias, and like native magnolia
varieties, it features large white flowers throughout summer.
Unlike magnolias, however, it often blooms into fall when the
leaves turn a blazing scarlet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there are the beautiful, disease-resistant
Rutgers dogwood hybrids (Cornus kousa X C. florida) with abundant
flowers in late May and red and purple fall foliage. Yellowwoods
(Cladrastis lutea) are towering trees with sculptured slate-gray
bark, panicles of fragrant white flowers in early June and golden
yellow fall foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Nannyberry viburnums (V. lentago) are short trees with creamy
white spring flowers, blue summer fruits and purplish-red fall
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on. Hawthorns, especially Crataegus phaenopyrum
Princeton Sentry and C. viridis Winter King, have white spring
flowers, red-orange or purple fall foliage and red berries through
much of winter. Sourwood (Oxydendron arboreum) has sprays of white
pendulous flowers in July and stunning October displays of scarlet
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   While the selection of many-seasoned trees is rich, the supply
is not.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery why so many of these beautiful, low-maintenance,
multiseasonal trees are not more widely grown and offered.
</P>
<P>
   Now is an especially frugal time to begin a search, because
local nurseries are featuring end-of-season sales on woody plant
materials. If these offerings do not include two-season trees, ask
your nursery to locate sources during the coming months for early
spring planting.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still be getting a bargain: two or more seasons of
interest from just one easy-care plant.

<P>
   Disappointed in the United States, the Rev. Sun Myung Moon has
chosen a remote corner of Brazil as the latest launchpad for his
dream of uniting the world behind his divine leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Paraguayan border in Brazil's sparsely populated inland
state of Mato Grosso do Sul lies the town of Jardim. It's a dusty
no-place of 20,000 people. Yet near to it the 78-year-old
multi-millionaire Korean founder of the Unification Church, a
controversial religious sect with a worldwide business empire, has
found what he calls his Garden of Eden. He is so taken with it that
he is busy buying 800 square kilometers (310 square miles) of
farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Within its ant-hills and cattle pasture, Moon plans to build a
flourishing new community, called New Hope, creating jobs by
building hotels, new roads, even an airport. He has already spent
$25 million on land and two dozen buildings, including classrooms,
dormitories and a 2,000-seat dining hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reverend Moon's idea is to show the world how to end hunger
and bring world peace,'' says Yoon Sang, New Hope's president.
``Brazil is a big country, with unlimited resources -- enough to
feed all Latin America and the starving people of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonologists take a different view, seeing New Hope as the
latest, maybe last, bizarre entry in the reverend's long history of
spiritual and financial ventures. Moon has lived in the United
States since the 1970s. His empire there includes the Washington
Times, a nationwide cable-TV channel, a Connecticut university, a
recording studio and travel agency in New York, a horse farm in
Texas, a golf course in California, and a seafood business in
Alaska. But he is disillusioned, says David Bromley, a sociologist
at a Virginia university who has studied the Unification church for
more than 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s Moon was briefly jailed over a tax matter.
Recently a former wife of one of his sons published her version of
that marriage, claiming her ex-husband had abused her and been
addicted to cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Bromley says such problems have badly hit the church's
following, which is down to about 3,000 on one estimate. ``His
membership here has dwindled, so he is pulling resources out and
putting them where he can make more of a splash.'' Moon has
criticized the United States as ``the kingdom of free sex'' and
``the country that represents Satan's harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   His energies now appear to be focused on Latin America. He
commutes between Brazil, his mansion in New York and a luxurious
estate in Uruguay. His organization already owns newspapers in
South America, a bank and a hotel in Uruguay, and large
land-holdings in Argentina and Brazil. At the 1996 launch in
Argentina of Tiempos del Mundo, a Spanish version of his Washington
newspaper, ex-President George Bush called Moon ``a man of
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   New Hope, which he discovered on a fishing trip in 1994, might
be just the place to make a splash: it lies on the edge of the lush
Pantanal, a still vast though endangered wetland. But what sort of
a splash? For the vision is changing.
</P>
<P>
   Moon's organization has lately shed much of its spiritual
identity, to concentrate instead on such issues as family values
and world peace. Indeed it recently dropped the word ``church,''
renaming itself the Association of Families for Unification and
World Peace. When Hideo Oyamada, continental director of the
association, calls New Hope ``the real center of the Americas,'' it
is not millions of potential converts that seem to interest him but
its proximity to markets in Paraguay, Bolivia, Argentina and
Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
   As a business proposition that is pie in the sky. Ranchers in
Mato Grosso do Sul were only too eager to sell him their
uncultivated land. Jardim's citizens were more than happy to accept
his largesse. Large it was: Moon has not spared expense in winning
friends. New Hope regularly opens its doors to the locals, laying
on free barbecues. Moon offered new ambulances to 32 local mayors.
He is also said to have provided a helicopter to one candidate in
the recent state-governorship election.
</P>
<P>
   Jardim residents know little about the Moonies. Brazil has
plenty of bizarre groups of its own, such as the miracle-working
and money-raising Universal church, and the media have given little
coverage to the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   The only disapproval has come from the local Roman Catholic
church. ``Moon says Jesus Christ was a failure because he was
single and had no children,'' says a Jardim priest, Father Bruno
Brugnolaro. ``I don't think he knows much about the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Bruno says he knows of no converts won by the Moonies.
Indeed locals seem more interested in Moon's money than his
beliefs. So far, almost all New Hope's students are from Japan or
Korea; and only a handful have shown up from Brazil, the United
States or Europe. Moony missionaries have recently been kicked out
of Venezuela and Honduras, allegedly for violating visa
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does New Hope's economic future look secure. Moon's South
American empire already has its troubles. His Banco de Credito in
Uruguay was recently put under central-bank supervision. Neither
his newspaper there, Ultimas Noticias, nor his 5-star Montevideo
hotel, the Victoria Plaza, have thrived.
</P>
<P>
   And Moon's much-heralded plans to build a large industrial
complex on the outskirts of the Uruguayan capital, complete with a
car plant and a deep-water port, appear to be heading nowhere.

<P>
   Yes, he has done it again. You can try to put the man down, load
him with inquiries, show him to be a liar and a philanderer, push
him into public apologies -- and still he comes back laughing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1822, the party of a Democratic
president in his sixth year in office has picked up seats in the
House of Representatives. The Democrats gained two governorships,
too, and lost no ground in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   All across the country, the people most motivated to vote were
not Revolted Republicans but Democrats who, for months, had been
trying to tell anyone who would listen that they liked Bill Clinton
and intended to stick with him.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, putting a brave face on these results, can say that
the status quo ante is more or less preserved. In Congress, the
Democrats have not retaken anything; for the first time in 70
years, Republicans have kept control of both chambers for three
consecutive elections. In the governorships, Republicans still
control most states (and therefore, crucially, the congressional
redistricting that will follow the census in 2000).
</P>
<P>
   They can point out -- as is true -- that stirring Democratic
victories like those of Gray Davis in the California governor's
race, or Charles Schumer in the Senate race in New York, can be
mostly attributed to local gripes and aspirations. They can insist
-- as is also true -- that turnout was much as usual, 37 percent of
the electorate, meaning that almost two-thirds offered no
particular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the unavoidable message from these results is that the
Republicans have not been given the mandate they hoped they would
get to proceed with their impeachment inquiry into the president's
conduct. When all the local factors are factored out, the message
is clear: lay off.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the publication of the Starr report, the
possibilities of a popular backlash in favor of Clinton had been
growing. His lowest point, in retrospect, was the non-apology to
the nation on Aug. 17. After that, all trends were subtly upward.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans had loathed Kenneth Starr, the special
prosecutor, from the outset. Even those, like this newspaper, who
supported his inquiries, thought his powers to probe every corner
of the president's life were excessive beyond the cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The public, as polls consistently showed, went much further than
this. They did not think a president should be removed either for
adultery, or for lying about sex in public and in a civil lawsuit;
and they thought the press (hardly an institution glowing with
virtue) was deeply hypocritical to suggest that he should.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this fundamental sentiment came the growing perception
of unfairness. The public did not like the way that the Starr
report was rushed out, with the president given no time to peruse
it first. They hated the airing of the videotape of Clinton's
testimony to the grand jury, the publication of Linda Tripp's and
Monica Lewinsky's bizarrely rambling conversations, the lopsided
vote in favor of the impeachment inquiry. Everything screamed
``Witchhunt.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton did impressive things -- outmaneuvring the
Republicans on the budget, brokering the Middle East peace talks --
the papers seemed to report them churlishly, still hoping for more
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Since the chattering classes in Washington were determined to
break this man, a fair number of Democratic voters round the
country -- especially, as it turned out, women, Latinos and blacks,
groups ever-sensitive to unfairness -- angrily determined to save
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were well aware of this. Every step toward the
impeachment inquiry was accompanied by agonizing over how the
public would take it. During the campaign, Republicans avoided the
Lewinsky matter until the very last week. Their commercials, when
at last they appeared, were subtle in the extreme, never mentioning
the scandal overtly and airing only in districts that were full of
angry Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, on Wednesday morning, even that much milking of
the scandal seemed to have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? The impeachment inquiry is already under way in
Congress; on Nov. 16, the full Judiciary Committee of the House
will begin formal deliberations into whether Clinton committed
perjury or obstructed justice to conceal his affair with Miss
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election, however, members were hoping the
inquiry could be short, with a limited list of witnesses, and that
a vote on whether to proceed to impeachment could be taken quickly
before the new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   They will want to be all the quicker now, since the new Congress
will have a slightly more Democratic complexion, and the public
mood is so clearly against them. Their very haste suggests a
growing embarrassment: lumbered with this ungainly process, they
too would probably like to be rid of it and to settle for some
swift, simple reprimand, such as censure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to rush would be a mistake. Having decided on this laborious
process, Republicans must treat it seriously, or further damage
both themselves and the rule of law. If they believed that they had
grounds for an inquiry, it should be a thorough one, for this
election has no effect on those grounds. If they thought they had a
case to make, they have to make it now all the more persuasively.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that, after all, nothing impeachable is found; but,
against all their populist vote-catching instincts, they must not
opt for a short-circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The next political year, with the presidential race of 2000
looming ever-larger in everyone's minds, will not be as the pundits
expected. Instead of a limping president keeping his distance from
a demoralized Democratic Party, there may well be a re-energized
leader with his troops more or less united -- both behind him and
behind his heir-apparent, Al Gore -- in sympathy and defiance.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of a comfortable Republican ascendancy, in
Washington and outside it, there will be a party watching the polls
with trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Could anyone have predicted it? One man, at least: the
Incredible Rebounding President, whose career will leave in the
history books a trail inscribed in rubber.

<P>
   Yes, he has done it again. You can try to put the man down, load
him with inquiries, show him to be a liar and a philanderer, push
him into public apologies -- and still he comes back laughing.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1822, the party of a Democratic
president in his sixth year in office has picked up seats in the
House of Representatives. The Democrats gained two governorships,
too, and lost no ground in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   All across the country, the people most motivated to vote were
not Revolted Republicans but Democrats who, for months, had been
trying to tell anyone who would listen that they liked Bill Clinton
and intended to stick with him.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, putting a brave face on these results, can say that
the status quo ante is more or less preserved. In Congress, the
Democrats have not retaken anything; for the first time in 70
years, Republicans have kept control of both chambers for three
consecutive elections. In the governorships, Republicans still
control most states (and therefore, crucially, the congressional
redistricting that will follow the census in 2000).
</P>
<P>
   They can point out -- as is true -- that stirring Democratic
victories like those of Gray Davis in the California governor's
race, or Charles Schumer in the Senate race in New York, can be
mostly attributed to local gripes and aspirations. They can insist
-- as is also true -- that turnout was much as usual, 37 percent of
the electorate, meaning that almost two-thirds offered no
particular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the unavoidable message from these results is that the
Republicans have not been given the mandate they hoped they would
get to proceed with their impeachment inquiry into the president's
conduct. When all the local factors are factored out, the message
is clear: lay off.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the publication of the Starr report, the
possibilities of a popular backlash in favor of Clinton had been
growing. His lowest point, in retrospect, was the non-apology to
the nation on Aug. 17. After that, all trends were subtly upward.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans had loathed Kenneth Starr, the special
prosecutor, from the outset. Even those, like this newspaper, who
supported his inquiries, thought his powers to probe every corner
of the president's life were excessive beyond the cause of justice.
</P>
<P>
   The public, as polls consistently showed, went much further than
this. They did not think a president should be removed either for
adultery, or for lying about sex in public and in a civil lawsuit;
and they thought the press (hardly an institution glowing with
virtue) was deeply hypocritical to suggest that he should.
</P>
<P>
   On top of this fundamental sentiment came the growing perception
of unfairness. The public did not like the way that the Starr
report was rushed out, with the president given no time to peruse
it first. They hated the airing of the videotape of Clinton's
testimony to the grand jury, the publication of Linda Tripp's and
Monica Lewinsky's bizarrely rambling conversations, the lopsided
vote in favor of the impeachment inquiry. Everything screamed
``Witchhunt.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton did impressive things -- outmaneuvring the
Republicans on the budget, brokering the Middle East peace talks --
the papers seemed to report them churlishly, still hoping for more
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Since the chattering classes in Washington were determined to
break this man, a fair number of Democratic voters round the
country -- especially, as it turned out, women, Latinos and blacks,
groups ever-sensitive to unfairness -- angrily determined to save
him.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans were well aware of this. Every step toward the
impeachment inquiry was accompanied by agonizing over how the
public would take it. During the campaign, Republicans avoided the
Lewinsky matter until the very last week. Their commercials, when
at last they appeared, were subtle in the extreme, never mentioning
the scandal overtly and airing only in districts that were full of
angry Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, on Wednesday morning, even that much milking of
the scandal seemed to have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   So what now? The impeachment inquiry is already under way in
Congress; on Nov. 16, the full Judiciary Committee of the House
will begin formal deliberations into whether Clinton committed
perjury or obstructed justice to conceal his affair with Miss
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the election, however, members were hoping the
inquiry could be short, with a limited list of witnesses, and that
a vote on whether to proceed to impeachment could be taken quickly
before the new Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   They will want to be all the quicker now, since the new Congress
will have a slightly more Democratic complexion, and the public
mood is so clearly against them. Their very haste suggests a
growing embarrassment: lumbered with this ungainly process, they
too would probably like to be rid of it and to settle for some
swift, simple reprimand, such as censure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to rush would be a mistake. Having decided on this laborious
process, Republicans must treat it seriously, or further damage
both themselves and the rule of law. If they believed that they had
grounds for an inquiry, it should be a thorough one, for this
election has no effect on those grounds. If they thought they had a
case to make, they have to make it now all the more persuasively.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that, after all, nothing impeachable is found; but,
against all their populist vote-catching instincts, they must not
opt for a short-circuit.
</P>
<P>
   The next political year, with the presidential race of 2000
looming ever-larger in everyone's minds, will not be as the pundits
expected. Instead of a limping president keeping his distance from
a demoralized Democratic Party, there may well be a re-energized

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Friday, over a half foot of snow fell in the Black Hills of
western South Dakota as a developing low pressure system moved east
from the northern Rockies. Saturday, as moist air from the Gulf of
Mexico is lifted up and over a warm front attached to the low, a
swath of moderate snow will fall from southern South Dakota to the
northern half of Iowa. Three to six inches of snow is expected in
this region.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bands of showers and a few thunderstorms will form
farther south across the lower Mississippi Valley as the humid air
intercepts an approaching jet stream disturbance. Behind the
disturbance, warmer and drier conditions will spread into western
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A sprawling high pressure system will continue to promote dry
and cool weather in much of the East. However, as the cool air
gathers moisture in transit over the Great Lakes, a few flurries
will form southeast of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Snow flurries will
also speckle the mountains of interior New England as a weak jet
stream disturbance passes overhead. Farther east, intervals of
sunshine will occur near the Northeast coast as breezes from the
northwest dry on decent from the Appalachians. In the meantime,
ample sun will persist across the Southeast, including Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful Pacific storm will lash the Northwest and northern
California coasts Saturday with windswept heavy rain from near San
Francisco to Portland, Oregon. Meanwhile, as the moist air is
lifted and cooled in the northern Sierra and southern Cascade
mountains, heavy snow will fall above 6,000 feet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: AN ODD TWIST
</P>
<P>
   There was evidence of an odd twister among the ten that
accompanied Tropical Storm Mitch in southern Florida. The pattern
of damage showed that clockwise winds surrounded the center of the
tornado. Over 90 percent of tornados spin counterclockwise. A
tornado develops when the motion in large, slowly rotating
thunderstorms is concentrated into a narrow violent swirl. Since
larger scale storms are affected by the earth's rotation, the slow
spin is usually counterclockwise. Rarely, the turbulent motions
near thunderstorms can make small areas of clockwise rotation that
lead to tornados that spin in reverse.

GIMME QUICK SHELTER: A BASIC LEAN-TO CAN TAKE JUST AN HOUR AND AN

   Time to don the orange apparel of the intrepid woodsman: The
first week of November marks the return of hunting season.
Acknowledging this seasonal rite of marksmanship, we recommend the
book ``Rustic Retreats'' by David and Jeanie Stiles (Storey Books,
$19.95).
</P>
<P>
   While the book won't help you with your aim, it does provide
instruction on building a shelter targeted at survival. There are
plans for tepees, wigwams, yurts and bent-pole huts, as well as
directions for thatching a roof, tying knots and building a
campfire circle. When you answer the call of the wild, pack this
decidedly handy little book at the bottom of the duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The basic lean-to
</P>
<P>
   The basic lean-to can last several seasons or one night,
depending on how well it is made. It is fairly easy to construct
and can be made without chopping down any live trees. A very crude
lean-to can be built in less than an hour, using only an ax. One
that will last more than one season and repel rain may take two or
three days. Better call the office and tell them you won't be back
till Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Materials needed:
</P>
<P>
   Locate two trees that stand 6 feet to 8 feet apart
</P>
<P>
   Two forked side poles, 8 feet to 9 feet long
</P>
<P>
   One ridge pole, about 10 feet long
</P>
<P>
   Three rafter poles, 8 feet to 9 feet long
</P>
<P>
   Two side posts, about 4 feet long
</P>
<P>
   About 25 cross pieces, 1 inch in diameter and 5 feet long
</P>
<P>
   Hemp string, light rope or baling wire for lashing
</P>
<P>
   Evergreen boughs for thatching
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Construction:
</P>
<P>
   1. Use the two forked side poles to prop up the ridge pole
between the two trees. Lash the three poles together.
</P>
<P>
   2. Lay three more rafter poles against the ridge pole. If there
are any small offshoot branches, position them to protrude up. They
will assist in supporting the smaller cross pieces. Cut off any
that point down.
</P>
<P>
   3. Using a small hand saw or brush cutters, cut cross pieces and
weave them between the rafter poles.
</P>
<P>
   4. Add a vertical post on each side of the lean-to and bend in
cross pieces.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thatch the roof and sides with evergreen boughs, starting at
the bottom and overlapping them all the way to the top.
</P>
<P>
   You can add to your lean-to by making a half-roof. On cold
nights, make a back-log fire. The warmth of the fire will be
reflected into the lean-to by the green logs stacked behind the
blaze.
</P>
<P>
   To protect against the danger of fire, re-cover the lean-to with
fresh green boughs each year.

`MAMA FLORA' IS A MOVING FAMILY SAGA _ WHETHER ALEX HALEY WROTE IT
OR NOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alex Haley's ``Mama Flora's Family,'' the CBS miniseries that
airs Sunday and Tuesday, began its literary life as a fictional
collage of Haley's mother and producer Jon Avnet's longtime nanny.
Both were proud, loyal, strong black women who carried the
emotional weight of everyone else's troubles high upon their backs.
</P>
<P>
   But who actually wrote the book, conceived in the late '80s but
released last month, is a bit unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Haley and Avnet are said to have collaborated on the book idea,
which was then to be followed by a blockbuster miniseries in the
vein of Haley's other ratings-rich productions ``Roots,'' ``Roots:
The Next Generation'' and ``Queen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Haley died in 1992, and it's impossible to tell exactly how
much of ``Mama Flora's Family'' he wrote. It was co-authored by
David Sterns, who managed to script ``Queen'' from Haley dictation
tapes, handed to him after the author died. (Which always made me
wonder how Haley might have reacted to Queen, his paternal
grandmother, being given only two children, sons, when she actually
had four, one a girl.)
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``Mama Flora'' project, it also was iced when Haley
died, forcing Avnet to turn to Sterns again. But did he write it
completely from ideas or an outline, or did Haley rifle off several
chapters?
</P>
<P>
   Just asking, because this miniseries (8 p.m. CST Sunday and
Tuesday, CBS) promoted by CBS as ``From the author of `Roots' may
not be from that author at all. Not unless you count the writer's
influence in the way he weaves history into compelling, mainstream
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Avnet, known for dramatically tender productions like ``Fried
Green Tomatoes'' and more shallow formula films such as ``Up Close
and Personal,'' insists that Sterns ``came in and finished the
book'' even though it was different from what he, Haley and
co-producer Jordan Kerner had outlined. (At least one CBS
spokesperson also said it was from a Haley outline.)
</P>
<P>
   At least ``Mama Flora's Family,'' about a woman who presides
over three generations of her family as its emotional rock and
enforcer of truth, follows the Haley formula well, even though
Avnet admitted to finding it ``unique'' that ``a bunch of white
people'' were ``doing a black story.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness, he admits, for long rehearsal periods that gave
cast members Cicely Tyson, Mario Van Peebles and Blair Underwood
time to contribute to a script that at times is a bit overwrought
and cliche-ridden, especially in its forced attempts to tie the
movie neatly around major historical events.
</P>
<P>
   The result is as uneven as its pedigree. Opening in Baltimore in
1970, the story finds 74-year-old Flora Palmer (Tyson) bursting
into the rundown tenement of her granddaughter, Diana (Queen
Latifah), and Diana's 2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Flora forces her granddaughter to return with her to Stockton,
Tenn., where, in an effort to set her straight, she gives her the
lowdown on the family history. This begins on a cotton farm in 1912
with her 17-year-old self, played by a splendidly cast Erika
Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   From there, ``Mama Flora'' flip-flops from past to present, and
not always seamlessly. But the dramatic quotient aims high.
</P>
<P>
   Young Flora falls for the light-skinned son of the town's
plantation owner, and after accepting a job tending to his
grandmother, she becomes pregnant and quickly discarded. (The twist
that blacks owned land and treated other blacks who rented from
them with about as much disdain as white masters had during slavery
is only touched upon.)
</P>
<P>
   The powerful family takes Flora's baby boy, names him Luke (Van
Peebles), and forces her to leave town.
</P>
<P>
   Flora ends up in Stockton, where she finds comfort in church.
She marries and has another son, Willie (Underwood), but her
husband is fatally shot after stealing to feed his family. Willie
grows up to be something of a hoodlum, and his sons and daughter
also find life difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the various crises, there's little doubt who saves
the family. Flora is a God-fearing woman with positive resolve, a
woman who has the nerve to sit at the counter of a whites-only
diner and stare down racists. As her family crumbles around her,
she remains steadfast, picking them up and putting their lives back
together. The only thing missing is her cape.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of ``Mama Flora'' is the
prickly relationship between Luke, whom she finds after 30 years,
and his half brother Willie. Luke, dignified, uptight and rigid,
became an attorney, and at one point is called upon to help when
Willie is falsely accused of a robbery. Upping the dramatic ante:
Luke is a black Muslim with intolerance for those (especially his
black brothers) unwilling to pick themselves up.
</P>
<P>
   His presence affects their lives in surprising ways, but it's
Mama Flora, of course, who softens his heart.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Mama Flora'' delivers its share of warmth, thanks
to splendid performances from Alexander, Peebles and particularly
Underwood, who brilliantly realizes the character of Willie as a
proud man who woke up too late to save himself. He's nearly
unrecognizable as he ages, wearing a scraggly salt-and-pepper beard
and flashing crooked teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, Avnet says, was champing at the bit to play Willie,
to wear the zoot suits, to be a gambler, to go to hell and back. It
suits him.
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie, its preoccupation with the way the family
accommodates the love, frustration and pain that the matriarch's
care inspires is pure Haley. The only question is whether it is
Haley or an awfully good facsimile.

 &HT;    SKETCHES OF A CROP OF CHALLENGERS FOR GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP
 &HT;    Eds: Livingston sketch is condensed from a Dart story moved
Thursday.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are personality sketches of Republican House
members who have declared their candidacy for, or interest in,
running for leadership positions in the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   BOB LIVINGSTON
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, few doubt that Bob Livingston is tough enough
for the job of House speaker, for which he declared his candidacy
Friday. At 6 feet, 5 inches in height, the 55-year-old conservative
is an imposing figure.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for a fast and fiery temper. Congressional
Quarterly's ``Politics in America'' describes a 1995 incident when
Livingston nearly came to blows with an aide to Rep. Pat Roberts,
R-Kan., then the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some son of a bitch on your staff has been saying bad stuff
about my staff to the press and I'm tired of it,'' Livingston
reportedly told Roberts before being physically restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is not without a sense of humor, albeit one that is
sometimes pointedly political. On his first day as chairman,
Livingston came to an Appropriations Committee meeting armed with a
machete and a alligator-skinning knife _ ready to cut the federal
budget. In 1993, he wore a clown's hat and a red plastic nose to
ridicule what he called a ``goofy'' Democratic bill to change
campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   As a three-term chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he
holds the federal purse strings and can help Republican colleagues
with funding for projects in their home districts. His position
also is a magnet for hopeful political contributors, so he channels
campaign funds to needy Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1977, Livingston has represented the First
District of Louisiana for 10 terms. Born in Colorado, Livingston
grew up in New Orleans. His parents divorced with he was 7, and he
and a younger sister were reared by their mother. After dropping
out of Tulane University, Livingston joined the Navy. After his
hitch ended, he married in 1965 and returned to Tulane to earn a
bachelor's degree and then to graduate from law school.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to the former Bonnie Robichaux, and they have four
children.
</P>
<P>
   STEVE LARGENT
</P>
<P>
   Steve Largent is ready for the next chapter in his all-American
life.
</P>
<P>
   When he was born in Tulsa, Okla., 43 years ago, a nurse put a
toy football in his hospital crib. Sure enough, that blue-eyed baby
grew up to be a Hall of Fame wide receiver for the Seattle
Seahawks. ``People'' magazine proclaimed him one of its ``50 Most
Beautiful People in the World'' and Wheaties put his face on a
cereal box. He's been married to his high school sweetheart for 23
years and is devoted to their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an easy re-election to a third term as a Republican
congressman, Largent has decided to take on Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, in a battle over the leadership and direction of
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are hardly new for Largent. After attending the
University of Tulsa on a football scholarship, he was deemed too
small and too slow for the National Football League. He signed as a
free agent with the Seahawks and retired 14 years later with the
NFL career records for receptions, receiving yards and touchdown
catches.
</P>
<P>
   After working for several years as a marketing consultant and
appearing in TV commercials, he ran for Congress in 1994 as a
Christian conservative promising ``my faith, my family and my
values will give me the strength to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he has stubbornly set his own course _ voting
against the 1997 GOP budget deal and sparking headlines by
denouncing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE RADANOVICH
</P>
<P>
   A banker by trade, George Radanovich long dreamed of setting up
a winery amid the fertile fields and rolling pastures of
California's Central Valley. So in 1983, while working days as an
assistant bank manager, he founded the first winery in his native
Mariposa County. Each year, Radanovich Winery now produces several
thousand cases of sauvignon blanc, merlot and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   The vintner, meanwhile, has turned his attention from grapes to
the GOP. First elected to Congress in 1994, Radanovich is
challenging Rep. John Boehner of Ohio to be chairman of the House
Republican Conference, the caucus of all GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Croatian immigrants, Radanovich is an avowed
conservative who believes cutting taxes and easing environmental
restrictions on farmers and ranchers are keys to economic growth.
He wants to limit the scope of both the federal government and the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Cal Tech graduate with a degree in agriculture business
management, the 43-year-old Radanovich is married to the former
Ethie Weaver, and the couple has one child.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER DUNN
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins the Republican rebellion, Jennifer Dunn of
Washington is unlikely to lose her position as the highest-ranking
woman in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   All sides know the party can't afford an all-male top team.
After her election as vice chairman of the House Republican
Conference in 1996, Dunn declared the vote ``a validation of the
fact a woman has a place not only in the Republican Party but in
the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Active in GOP politics since the 1960s, Dunn is a Stanford
graduate, a former IBM systems engineer and divorced mother of two
grown sons (one of whom is named Reagan). In 1992, she was elected
to Congress from a district made up mostly of Seattle's affluent
suburbs and has sought to put a kinder face on her party since her
arrival in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a proponent of softening our rhetoric,''
she said before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a steadfast supporter of Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., who in return has backed her rise in the Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally conservative and pro-business, she has supported free
trade policies that benefit exporters around Seattle and policies
to advance Microsoft and other high-tech industries in her
district.
</P>
<P>
   JIM McCRERY
</P>
<P>
   Grits vs. Gumbo? Not really. In the fight for the chairmanship
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, incumbent Rep.
John Linder of Georgia is no good ol' boy, and his challenger, Rep.
Jim McCrery of Louisiana, is no Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   While Linder grew up in Minnesota, though, McCrery was reared
amid the piney woods and oil refineries of northern Louisiana _ a
strait-laced Protestant region more akin to Alabama than to the
free-rolling Catholic bayous of southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from Shreveport, McCrery has been both a social and
fiscal conservative since he left his job as a regional manager for
Georgia-Pacific Corp. in 1988 to win election to Congress. He is a
steadfast opponent of abortion and a supporter of gun owners'
rights and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In his votes, he has been generally loyal to the GOP leadership,
although he voted against the 1990 tax increase backed by the Bush
administration and questioned the $500-per-child tax credit in the
1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
   McCrery, 49, is a graduate of Louisiana Tech and the Louisiana
State University law school. He is married to the former Johnette
Hawkins, and the couple has two children.

`MAMA' OFFERS A MIXED BAG OF MELODRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
MAMA FLORA'S FAMILY 
Produced by: Joncq Avnet 
Directed by: Peter Werner 
Written by: David Stevens and Carol Schreder 
On: CBS 
Date: Time: Sunday and Tuesday night, 9-11 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six years after his death, Alex Haley is represented on TV by
yet another miniseries, actually a kind of sequel to the
blockbuster 1977 adaptation of his book ``Roots.'' ``Mama Flora's
Family,'' airing Sunday and Tuesday on &UR;  &LR; CBS 9 p.m. to 11 p.m., is
likewise based on a thick novel, begun by Haley but finished after
his death by David Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The CBS miniseries is a big mixed bag of a production, weighted
with obvious imperfections, but containing a lot of compensatory
gratification.
</P>
<P>
   For example, much of the acting in the lustrous-looking
two-night telemovie is terrific. The surprise is that Cicely Tison,
as appealing a matriarch as she makes in the title role, isn't the
most riveting member of the talented ``Mama Flora's Family''
ensemble. That distinction belongs to Blair Underwood, who turns in
a powerful performance as Flora's son Willie, by far the most
complex character in the decades-spanning, episodic teleplay.
</P>
<P>
   Willie rises and falls _ like the action of the miniseries
itself _ with the fortunes of black America. After his hard-working
father is murdered in the Jim Crow South for stealing cotton to
help feed the family, young Willie goes to work rather than follow
his father's dream for him of getting an education. He toils; he
sinks and drinks; he rises again. After distinguishing himself in
World War II combat, he returns to a segregated, often turbulent
America and a career pushing a mop as a night janitor. Handsomely
aging Willie presses on, honorably if edgily raising a family,
doing the right thing often against bitter odds.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, ``Mama Flora's Family'' is a melodramatic survey of
60 years of African-American life, a sprawling blend of moderately
entertaining fiction distributed around and through major historic
events. As such, it accommodates stylish performances, but hardly
invites acting of sustained depth or subtlety. Yet Underwood
manages to evoke an emotional density and color rarely provided by
the event-heavy Cliff-Notes-like teleplay.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful throughout, he's especially moving in Part 2,
painfully struggling to correct the course of his troubled,
drug-dealing son Don. Beneath his just-out-of-control anger,
Underwood generates currents of self-lacerating guilt that
electrify the father-son scenes with anguishing reality.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Van Peebles, on the other hand, is merely stylish in the
role of Willie's long-lost, affluent, and educated older brother,
Luke. The smoothly handsome Van Peebles meets but never exceeds the
demands of the broad yet comparatively shallow Haley-Stevens
chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson is fine in the series-dominating role of the older,
indomitable Flora, repository of Christian faith, folksy wisdom,
and enough tough love to infuse four multiplying generations of
family. But since she's saddled with a character too good to be
true, her stubbornly good-natured striving is predictable, however
persuasive her rustic dialect or ache-ridden gait.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the slickly polished action in ``Mama Flora's Family''
is unfortunately cliched, whether it's the battle in which Willie
earns his medal or the early scenes in which Mama Flora invades a
seedy Baltimore rooming house to rescue her missing granddaughter.
(Flora brings the self-destructive young woman back to Tennessee
with her and straightens her out by making her split firewood and
listen to the family saga.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama Flora's Family'' seems compelled to introduce virtually
every popular movement in the black American experience, however
briefly, into the dynamics of the story. The results are decidedly
mixed, often creating something more like a glossy lesson plan than
flowing drama. Not surprisingly, the movements themselves, like the
surges of black nationalism represented by the Nation of Islam and
the Black Panthers, are trivialized in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's the nature of contrived epics like this to touch us
now and then, if not by the force of a fortuitously splendid
performance, then by sentimental allusion to touchstone historic
events.
</P>
<P>
   In one scene in the more supple Part 2, for instance, Flora
single-handedly desegregates a Southern lunch counter. Unlike most
courageous civil rights activists of the day, she gets the coffee,
and respect, she sternly demands. Here perhaps it's the very
absence of realism, the noble seizure of grudging civility, that
moves us. In any case, this scene and several others succeed on a
gut level, in part by capitalizing on our shared knowledge of the
ongoing history of racism in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes merely a kind of animated tableau, at others ``Mama
Flora's Family'' rises to good, socially relevant pop melodrama.
There are always those fine performances to compensate for the dry
spells. Beside Underwood, other players deserve considerable
credit: Erika Alexander as the young Mama Flora, Queen Latifah as
Diana, David Ramsay as Flora's ill-starred young husband, Booker.
That leaves still another half-dozen or so actors whose gifts will
be self-evident to anyone who invests four hours in this
up-and-down miniseries.

GM RESISTS IMPULSE TO FOLLOW DODGE, FORD WITH REDESIGN OF FULL-SIZE
TRUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bigger, faster, stronger and smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   That's how Chevrolet describes its redesigned 1999 full-size
pickups, whose new name is Silverado.
</P>
<P>
   The rollout of the new trucks is accompanied by one of General
Motors' largest advertising campaigns ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reference in promotional materials to ``bold, new
styling,'' however, because there isn't any.
</P>
<P>
   While virtually everything else about them is brand new _ from
the chassis to the seats _ General Motors resisted the impulse to
follow Dodge and Ford with drastic restyling of the full-size
trucks, the company's bread-and-butter vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Although some critics say the restyling didn't go far enough,
Chevy says research showed that loyal Chevy truck owners and other
potential buyers didn't want a drastic change in the vehicles'
looks.
</P>
<P>
   Good. I've never been a fan of the ``muscular'' styling of the
current Dodge Ram, although many people are. And while I like the
looks of the Ford F-150, the looks alone wouldn't lead me to choose
it over a competing vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   What the critics are going to find is that consumers will admire
the mild redesign of the Silverado, but they will absolutely love
the rest of the changes _ such as the roomier cab, tougher frame,
bigger box and much improved performance.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in recent history, I believe, Chevrolet has
the opportunity to overtake Ford to claim the best-selling-vehicle
title. The F-150 has been the top-selling vehicle overall in both
Texas and the nation for the past several years, outpacing even the
sales of the Ford Explorer, which has been the best-selling
passenger vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The frame is stronger than before, the V-8 engines are all new
and more powerful than ever, and even the brakes are far superior
to those of the previous Chevy trucks and any of the competition.
Four-wheel disc brakes are now standard across the line.
</P>
<P>
   The base engine is a 4.3-liter V-6, standard on two- and
four-wheel-drive 1500 models. It cranks out 200 horsepower and 260
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   There are three Vortec V-8 engines to choose from, all new but
based on the legendary small-block V-8 design. The 4.8-liter engine
is rated at 255 horsepower and 285 foot- pounds of torque; the
5.3-liter at 270 horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque; and the
biggest, the 6.0-liter, at a whopping 300 horsepower and 355
foot-pounds of torque.
</P>
<P>
   To me, though, the interior is the Silverado's best attribute.
The extended-cab models have a back seat that is really a seat and
not some short, ill-designed attempt at one. There is support for
the thighs and plenty of leg room even for adults. About two-thirds
of pickup buyers choose extended-cab models because they need the
extra passenger space, but only the Silverado (and its clone, the
GMC Sierra), offers a truly practical rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback is that only three doors are available, but a
fourth door apparently is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   There is a variety of Silverado models available, ranging from
regular to extended to crew cab, short- or long bed, two- or
four-wheel-drive, and standard (Fleetside) or step-side (Sportside)
styles. Most models are available in three trim levels _ base, LS
and top- of-the-line LT, and in half-, three-quarter and one-ton
versions (1500, 2500 or 3500).
</P>
<P>
   The base truck (1500 regular cab, two-wheel drive) lists for an
affordable $15,995, about $150 less than a comparably equipped 1998
model. The new trucks include $500 worth of equipment that was
optional last year, such as four-wheel disc brakes, tilt steering
wheel, 16-inch wheels and tires, automatic halogen headlights, and
40/20/40 split front bench seat.
</P>
<P>
   Our test vehicle was a long-bed, four-wheel-drive LS 1500
extended-cab model with the Z71 off-road package, in meadow-green
metallic paint with a graphite custom-cloth interior (list $25,895
plus $640 transportation).
</P>
<P>
   The engine was the 5.3 liter V-8 ($700 extra), and the vehicle
came with the new four-speed automatic transmission ($995) with
tow-haul mode. The power was astounding for such a heavy vehicle; I
can't imagine needing any more than this, although I suppose some
people would need the 6.0-liter engine for heavy trailering.
</P>
<P>
   This truck was so refined and smooth-riding that it was almost
like a premium sport-utility vehicle. Luxury features (some adding
to the price tag) included six-way power driver and passenger seats
($480), AM/FM/cassette/compact-disc stereo ($100), and front fog
lights.
</P>
<P>
   Extras that come with the LS model include air-conditioning,
dual outside power mirrors, chrome grille, cruise control, power
windows and door locks with remote key-less entry, leather-wrapped
steering wheel, and body side moldings.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cool Z71 graphics, the package ($295) included skid
plates underneath for serious off-roading. The four-wheel-drive
system came with Chevy's Autotrac active transfer case ($375), and
the vehicle also had the optional trailering package ($285), which
added a hitch platform and wiring harness. Maximum trailer weight
with this model is 8,200 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Total sticker on our test truck was $30,987, including
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   The off-road capabilities of our Silverado were impressive; this
is truly a go-anywhere truck.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high-tech features on the new Silverado are a
self-dimming rearview mirror, security system, engine hour meter,
driver message center (monitoring vital functions), intermittent
wipers, lockout protection (doors won't lock with keys left in
ignition), next-generation driver and passenger air bags (with
passenger air-bag cutoff switch), and the ability to run 50 miles
after the radiator loses its coolant.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings for the 5.3-liter V-8 are 15 miles per
gallon in the city and 18 mpg on the highway. That's only slightly
better than the 16 city/20 highway estimates for the V-6 models.
</P>
<P>
   The tank in our long-box test model held 34 gallons of fuel;
short-box versions have a 26-gallon tank.
</P>
<P>
   Impala coming back: The Chevrolet Impala, introduced in 1958 and
then reintroduced as a high-performance model of the Caprice in
1994, will return to the Chevy lineup as a completely new model for
the 2000 model year.
</P>
<P>
   It will make its debut in January at the 1999 North American
International Auto Show in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent model was discontinued after 1996.
</P>
<P>
   No details are available yet, but Chevrolet's ``first car for
the new millennium'' promises to ``re-create the same magic formula
that brought success to generations of Impalas before it: A
good-looking car, with more performance, amenities and value than
you might expect, at a Chevrolet price,'' Chevy says.

TWO MEN ARRESTED IN PRIVACY OF HOME, CHARGED UNDER TEXAS SODOMY
LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.A. DYER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In a case that could have broad legal implications,
two area men have been charged under the state's sodomy statute for
engaging in consensual sex in a private residence.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County sheriff's deputies, responding Sept. 17 to a false
report of an armed intruder in a northeast Harris County apartment,
found two men engaged in sex and charged them with ``homosexual
conduct.'' One of the men lived in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The two men spent several hours in jail before being released on
$200 bail. They are to be arraigned in a justice of the peace court
on Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 119-year-old sodomy law, which was modified by the
1995 Legislature, makes homosexual oral and anal sex a class C
misdemeanor, which carries a fine of up to $500.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, who are 31 and 55, could not be reached for
comment. But one of their attorneys, who declined to discuss the
specifics of the case, said they appear willing to fight it in
court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just unbelievable that in 1998, this sort of arrest
could happen,'' said their other attorney, Mitchell Katine. ``All
those people who have said over the years that this statute is
never enforced need to realize that that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, such prosecutions are rare. Activists and attorneys
could cite no Texas case in which consenting adults were prosecuted
for engaging in private sexual conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. said two or
three sodomy law cases had been prosecuted over the last 30 years,
although those involved homosexual contact witnessed by others in a
public jail.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists have tried for years to have the sodomy statute
struck from the books, arguing that it is often used to justify
anti-gay discrimination in such areas as hiring and adoptions. But
with no defendant in a criminal case, efforts to remove the law
have met with mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, for instance, the Texas Supreme Court ruled it did not
have jurisdiction over a civil challenge to the sodomy law because
the plaintiffs never had been prosecuted under it. However, in a
separate civil case, a lower court had ruled the statute was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say this new case could sink the sodomy statute.
Though outraged over the arrests, several appeared eager for the
case to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that's what we're hoping,'' said Clarence Bagby,
president of the Houston Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus. ``We
certainly hope to move this forward, and we'd love to see it move
all the way up the ladder and be declared unconstitutional. We need
to get this off the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes also questioned the fairness of the law, but said his
office is obligated to try to uphold it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're supposed to presume that these laws are
constitutional,'' Holmes said. ``If we just say, `Let this thing go
away,' then we're not really complying with the law and I'm not
comfortable with that. But I've always said that the best way to
get rid of a bad law is to enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said there have been no such cases because police rarely
find themselves in a position to witness private sexual contact in
people's homes. Typically, he said, police make arrests for public
lewdness _ a more serious class B misdemeanor _ for sex acts in
such places as parks and public restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports and government sources, officers
from the Harris County Sheriff's Department were dispatched to a
northeast Harris County apartment complex around 11 p.m. on Sept.
17 after receiving a report that an armed man was in the apartment.
Upon arrival, the officers met a man in the parking lot who told
them of the armed intruder and directed them to an upstairs unit.
</P>
<P>
   The man told the police dispatcher that the intruder ``was going
crazy in the apartment and was armed with a gun,'' states an arrest
report, signed by Deputy J.R. Quinn. ``Upon entering the apartment
and conducting a search for the armed suspect, officers observed
the defendant engaging in deviant sexual conduct ... with another
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputies found no armed man in the apartment and the man who
reported it later admitted that he was lying. A government source
said the man was convicted of making a false report to officers and
sentenced to a jail term.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are scheduled to be arraigned two weeks from Friday
before Justice of the Peace Mike Parrott, whose court is at 14350
Wallisville. For the constitutionality of the case to be tested, it
must first make it to county court and then into the state's
criminal court system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want a good case to throw this law out on, they may
have their opportunity,'' Holmes said. ``We plan to go forward.'' &QL;

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In 1844, thousands of American evangelicals fully expected Jesus
to return. When the predicted moment passed with no Lord in glory
appearing in the clouds, his saddened followers dubbed it ``The
Great Disappointment.''
 &HT;    For conservative Christians, the 1998 midterm elections may be
the second Great Disappointment.
 &HT;    The Republican party -- heavily dependent on a base of
evangelical voters -- failed to capitalize on the biggest
presidential scandal since Watergate. Even in the South, religious
right candidates like Alabama Gov. Fob James lost.
 &HT;    In the morning-after spin, Randy Tate, president of the
Christian Coalition, and his boss, Pat Robertson, accused
mainstream Republicans of ignoring their moral concerns -- thus
alienating the party's religious right base.
 &HT;    William Bennett used the moment to hawk books -- moaning about
the ``death of outrage'' and accusing a lax electorate of caring
more about money than morals.
 &HT;    Overall, it was a bad year for religious conservatives.
 &HT;    It did not start that way. In January, as rumors of a
presidential affair circulated, Christian conservatives could
barely contain their glee: Clinton's been caught with his pants
down! As the sordid details became public, America's neo-Puritans
predicted a religious right electoral landslide in November.
 &HT;    On television and radio, Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, Gary Bauer
and Pat Robertson self-righteously smirked over sin while privately
tallying impeachment votes.
 &HT;    What happened? Most of the die-hard religious right candidates
lost.
 &HT;    In 1996, I covered the Republican National Convention for a
local newspaper. Standing on the floor -- surrounded by true
believers -- I felt I'd witnessed Gettysburg. Although half of the
delegates in attendance claimed allegiance to some conservative
religious cause, it seemed evident that they had reached their
numerical limit in the party -- and were trying the patience of
more politically skilled mainstream Republicans. They could not go
any further than this, I mused.
 &HT;    That year, they failed to deliver for Bob Dole. This year, they
failed to deliver once again. In spite of getting Christian
conservatives to the polls, they lost.
 &HT;    The problem? Numbers. Quite simply, there are not enough
religious conservatives to actually win an election. Candidates may
win with them as part of a broader constituency. But the religious
right can not win alone.
 &HT;    University of Chicago historian Martin Marty has noted that,
since the 18th century, evangelicals make up somewhere between 25
to 33 percent of America's religious population -- rarely less and
never more. Therefore, evangelical political movements depend on
the appeal their causes have for people outside their churches. In
order to succeed, they must build coalitions around common American
concerns.
 &HT;    In Texas and Florida, the Bush brothers recognized this fact.
They won with the support of the religious right, but also the
support of Hispanic, African-American, women, and some Democratic
voters to whom a more moderate agenda -- like George Bush's
``compassionate conservatism'' -- appealed.
 &HT;    The Bush brothers are not themselves evangelicals -- a crucial
fact. Conservative evangelicals generally see the world in black
and white terms and are unable, by virtue of their own theology, to
compromise with anything they view sinful. By nature,
coalition-building is difficult for them -- leaving them dependent
upon Christian conversion for new voters.
 &HT;    Therefore, conservative evangelical candidates such as Fob
James, whose political agendas were lock-step with religious right
concerns, lost. They failed to reach beyond a particular ideology
and include voters not identified with those causes. In short,
their beliefs make them unable to build a constituency -- a crucial
failure for any politician.
 &HT;    Thus, single-mindedly waving their Bibles, these darlings of the
religious right became Tuesday's biggest losers.
 &HT;    Because they hold such clear beliefs, however, when voters want
ideology evangelicals deliver. But idea-motivated elections -- such
as the 1994 midterms -- are rare events in American history.
Instead, the electorate usually casts votes for local concerns and
economic prosperity -- and it is difficult for most people to trust
television preachers with their money.
 &HT;    An economically contented electorate will be predisposed to vote
against religious right candidates -- popularly perceived as
narrow-minded and dangerous. Their moral crusades -- including
impeaching a repentant president -- frighten many Americans who
believe conservative evangelicals would undermine individual
freedoms and derail economic prosperity. Their moral agenda strikes
most of us as preachy and somehow un-American.
 &HT;    Thus, 1998 is a great disappointment. The religious right should
now realize their 1994 victory was a fluke. If Fob James can not
even win Alabama, they must understand their agenda is not
America's agenda. And Jesus did not even return to rescue the
cause. After all that work and prayer, their ``Christian'' America
is not to be.
 &HT;    What a relief for the rest of us. Thanks be to God.

IN MCCARTNEY?

   LONDON _ Sir Paul McCartney, her majesty's poet?
</P>
<P>
   Don't jeer -- or cheer -- so quickly. The name of the former
Beatle is floating among those of more orthodox bards as Britain, a
country that often has found its identity in poetry, seeks a new
laureate.
</P>
<P>
   A debate over an institution that seems slightly out of place
these days began almost immediately after last week's death of
laureate Ted Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 68, held the post since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   As with many discussions in Britain today, the theme of the
debate boils down to a struggle between revering the past and
pursuing the future.
</P>
<P>
   The poet laureate is one of Britain's oldest institutions,
dating to the 15th Century and remains part of the queen's official
household. The annual pay, which amounts to $100 and a large cask
of good canary wine, has changed little in more than 400 years.
(The wine was restored to the compensation package at the
insistence of Hughes' predecessor, Sir John Betjeman.)
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the poet laureate was required to write court odes
and to celebrate state occasions in verse. This part of the job has
all but disappeared, and Hughes, who is perhaps best known outside
Britain for his marriage to American poet Sylvia Plath, tended to
follow his own muse, occasionally dedicating a poem to the queen.
He wrote a few verses to commemorate the death of Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the office of poet laureate is relatively
new, created by President Reagan in 1986. Before then, the chair of
poetry at the Library of Congress was recognized as the national
poet. American poet laureates serve one -year terms and have few
public duties. Robert Pinsky, the editor of an Internet poetry
magazine, holds the post now.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the position, which has been held by such giants as
William Wordsworth and Alfred Tennyson, is viewed by many with
considerable gravity. Hughes' death was treated as major news here,
and his book, ``Tales From Ovid,'' an interpretation of Ovid's
``Metamorphosis,'' is a runaway best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   Conventionalists fear the venerable post may be seized by Prime
Minister Tony Blair's culture savvy government as an opportunity to
make a statement about diversity or populism.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, who has been pushing his countrymen to shed some of their
stuffy reserve, reportedly favors opening the selection to the
public by polls and even the Internet rather than leaving it solely
to Britain's literary establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Mowlam, Blair's Northern Ireland secretary, caused a stir
last week when she suggested that McCartney, the author of such
works as ``Silly Love Songs,'' and ``Ebony and Ivory,'' was perfect
for the job. ``That's what we identify with,'' she told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   England's tweedy academics are alarmed. Michael Holyrood, the
head of the Royal Society of Literature, expressed little comfort
at the idea of throwing the matter open to the masses. ``Not
everything can be done by election,'' Holyrood said. ``The
government should use people that know most about poetry to advise
them -- and to avoid making fools of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   A Downing Street spokesman said that Blair has made no decision
about how to proceed, but he added that the prime minister will
consult broadly before making his nominations to the queen.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be some agreement that this is an opportunity to
at least update the post, perhaps making it more like the American
model with set terms and duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have thought the time was right for a change,'' said
popular Liverpool poet Roger McGough. ``If there was one poet who
was head-and-shoulders above the rest, one obvious choice such as a
Tennyson, then there would be no need to tinker with the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``But people have put up widely different suggestions, and a lot
of people are going to be disenchanted,'' McGough said. ``If you
have a five-year fixed term then you can have your ethnic and
female poets and get a spread of people rather than a Welsh bard or
a Scottish laureate.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even a lad from Liverpool.

<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ The wildfire success of ``Listening to
Prozac'' made Dr. Peter Kramer possibly the best-known psychiatrist
in America _ and, with the headlines pigeonholing him as the ``Pied
Piper of Prozac,'' possibly the most misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's 1993 book captured a revolutionary moment in
psychiatry, the advent of an exciting new class of
anti-depressants. But he was never painting the portrait of a
panacea. He never would. For as his work since then _ a nuanced
book about relationships and a novel-in-progress about an anarchist
_ bears out, he, like psychotherapy itself, is neither smooth nor
easy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Listening to Prozac,'' Kramer was raising knotty questions,
in part about what he called ``cosmetic psychopharmacology'':
whether new drugs should be used not only to help mentally ill
people, but to take essentially normal people and make them
psychologically ``better than well,'' more confident, more
assertive, more attractive.
</P>
<P>
   But in sound-bite America, at a moment when millions were trying
out the new, low-side-effect anti-depressants, his message somehow
morphed into a one-dimensional ``Prozac is good.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Dr. Harold Alan Pincus, director of the office of
research of the American Psychiatric Association, ``Peter is as far
away from being a simple pill-pusher as anyone I can imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   In a morning's conversation in his office by the Brown
University campus, where he teaches, Kramer seemed strikingly
incapable of choosing the easy way or the unambiguous message,
especially, the take-two-aspirin solution.
</P>
<P>
   He says his role is rather to raise arguments and then undermine
them, to offer hard two-handed criticism of contemporary culture at
large, discussing, for example, how attitudes toward Prozac reflect
the society that fell in love with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a highly analytic side where analytic means critical,''
he said. ``I seem to be built to see the flaws in the argument on
either side, and that might be a different talent than
theory-building.''
</P>
<P>
   Combine that with a knack for choosing hot or about-to-be-hot
topics on the psychiatric scene, and the topics of his books begin
to make a certain kind of sense, dovetailing with a moment when new
scientific understanding of the brain is seeping into the practice
of psychiatry and into the general consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Kramer came out with ``Should You Leave?'' a book
whose cut-and-dried title was belied by its nuanced discussion of
the serpentine complexities of couple relationships. Though not a
blockbuster like ``Listening to Prozac,'' it has won broad
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Before ``Listening to Prozac'' he wrote ``Moments of
Engagement,'' subtitled ``Intimate Psychotherapy in a Technological
Age.'' In that book, Kramer describes enlightening moments in his
professional life, allowing the reader ``to look over the doctor's
shoulder.'' He raises a cluster of issues including the biological
basis of personality, with accompanying questions about, say, the
chemical basis of adolescent angst.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Moments of Engagement' is about the therapy process,'' said
Dr. Jeffrey Blum, a psychologist and old friend of Kramer's. ``
`Listening to Prozac' is about the use of medication in psychiatry
and `Should You Leave?' is really a book about family therapy or
couples therapy; so the three books are dividing up the main parts
of the field. It's somebody going through our whole body of
knowledge in psychology and psychiatry and pulling out what's
relevant and helpful now. Freud wrote in the year 1900; we're
entering the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   In that mode, Kramer has used his prominence as something of a
psychiatric public-health booster. (This, despite the conflict he
sees between his obligation as a physician to inform and ``the
obligations of a writer, where I think the prime value is
ambiguity, elusiveness, being more disturbing than conclusive.'')
</P>
<P>
   Among the points Kramer explores in ``Should You Leave?,'' for
example, is his sense that ``depression causes divorce as often as
divorce causes depression.'' He has found himself emphasizing the
point that depression is often under-diagnosed, he said, partly
because he has been disturbed by how often break-ups could have
been avoided if only a depressed person had received treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter has had both a public and a professional impact,'' said
Donald Klein, director of research at the New York State
Psychiatric Institute and author of ``Understanding Depression''
(Oxford, 1993). ``The public impact was to legitimize the use of
medications in a broader range of conditions, because the general
feeling had been that if you take medication, you've got to be
crazy. The idea that medication could have more subtle effects _
people didn't know that. And the profession also has benefited from
that realization.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein added that Kramer's work also walks a middle road in
psychiatry between the two principal camps: those who favor
medication and those who favor talk therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's commentary on psychiatry is almost invariably
interlaced with a broader critique of American culture. With the
novel he is now writing about an anarchist, he seems to be shifting
further in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   The story ``very much has to do with values of the 60's and what
happened to them,'' he said. ``And could one logically have held
them for a longer period of time and not betrayed them the way
everyone in my generation seems to have done?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An underlying question, he said, is ``What has happened to us in
this excess of acquisition that seems to be a characteristic of the
productive middle class? Everyone who can afford it has the second
house and the fancy car and the boat, if possible, and maybe not
all those things but one of them. And again, is that where
happiness lies? And if you believed it lay elsewhere, could you
actually enjoy that happiness and in particular, could you raise a
child outside the frame of McDonald's and the Gap and Nike?''
</P>
<P>
   So, then, is Kramer _ married, with three children and having
just turned 50 _ really a subversive at heart? Not quite: ``I'm
someone who enjoys all the pleasures of ordinary life at the mall,
but wonders about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That wondering comes in part from his formative undergraduate
years at Harvard during the student unrest of the late 1960s
(though, joked Blum, who knew him then, Kramer was not a radical
leader because that would not have allowed his usual thoughtful
back-and-forth). Then came a scholarship to University College in
London, where he was exposed to a potent mix of cutting-edge
literary theory, art history and cultural criticism while being
psychoanalyzed to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fruits was a model he adapted from a Roland Barthe
essay on tag-team wrestling as a phenomenon that shed light on
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the method, many years later, of `Listening to
Prozac,' '' he said. ``Which was, take this little product in the
culture and look at it from lots of angles, and hope that just by
being very focused on that one product of the culture or object we
use in the culture, it would say something broader without having
to belabor the subject, but just resonate in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   In that vein, when Kramer looks at relationships in ``Should You
Leave?,'' he examines them for their own value but also as a
reflection of what is going on in American society at large: ``How
the culture decides what happiness is, and whether your wife is an
adequate commodity for you _ the trophy wife _ and so on. Your
status in the workplace very much determines your status at home.
Intimate life has been invaded by materialism.''
</P>
<P>
   His approach has not pleased everyone. ``Listening to Prozac''
drew criticism in reviews that he had allowed himself to be seduced
by the drug's promise, like many doctors with many past ``miracle
drugs,'' and that its gloss would fade with time and more
information.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics complained that he played down problematic side
effects experienced by 10 to 20 percent of Prozac users _ edginess,
drowsiness, headaches, sexual problems and more. Still others, like
Glen Gabbard, a professor at the Menninger Clinic and the author of
``Psychodynamic Psychiatry in Clinical Practice'' (1994, American
Psychiatric Press), questioned his suggestion that drugs like
Prozac alone could transform not only a patient's mood but also his
personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would conceptualize medication as toning down anger and
other negative emotions so that psychotherapy can be more
effective,'' Gabbard said. ``My experience with many patients who
have personality disorders is that medication alone does not make
substantial changes in their personality; what does work is the
combination of medication and psychotherapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said that his success may also have raised some hackles
because psychiatric fame has come to him as a writer. Traditionally
laurels have gone to the great researchers or administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, said Dr. Paul McHugh, chairman of the Johns Hopkins
department of psychiatry, Kramer will probably be remembered as a
psychotherapist who pinpointed a major shift in psychiatry through
his own painstaking observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a psychotherapist make this point, rather than
somebody who's been making his whole livelihood talking about
medications, I suppose that galls some people,'' McHugh said.
``That the guy who captures a new time is a person who's listened
to his patients, not simply been seeing them for five minutes and
giving them a pill.''

SOFTWARE THAT CAN MAKE A GROWN COMPANY CRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 8) 
(editors: 3rd take is optional sidebar) 
(bl) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Corporate root canal.
</P>
<P>
   It's an apt phrase for the pain of installing those monster,
run-the-whole-show software packages that coordinate a
manufacturer's entire business from the time raw materials come in
the door to the time the customer pays the invoice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet companies find the software's promises of slashed costs and
supercharged productivity irresistible, so the programs, known as
enterprise resource planning software, or ERP, are spreading fast.
AMR Research, a research firm in Boston, estimates that worldwide
sales of enterprise software and related services like maintenance
and training totaled $10.9 billion last year. And the Gartner
Group, a research firm in Stamford, Conn., expects sales to keep
growing by at least 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ERP programs are pricey, costing a minimum of $300,000 for a
tiny shop and rising into the hundreds of millions for a global
giant like Coca-Cola or General Motors. But analysts say that
nearly every sizable manufacturer in the United States and Europe
either has ERP, is getting it or is considering getting it soon.
</P>
<P>
   The boom has meant big business for consultants like Arthur
Andersen and for software vendors like Peoplesoft and Oracle from
the United States and Baan of the Netherlands. And it has been a
bonanza for the German giant SAP AG, which owns more than a third
of the enterprise software market. Its sales of ERP products
ballooned to $3.35 billion last year, from just $633.6 million in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   But popularity does not mean painlessness. Like oral surgery,
the process of installing enterprise software is never quick or
easy and can often be a scary mess. Whole departments must be
retrained, jobs redefined, and procedures discarded or rebuilt from
scratch. The inevitable glitches and unforeseen consequences can
drive workers crazy for months. And no two installations are
exactly alike.
</P>
<P>
   Though its core is packaged, off-the-shelf computer coding, an
ERP program lets a company choose from a myriad of preset
configurations and options. Should customers be tracked by name,
location or account number? Should sales reports be generated
weekly, daily or hourly? Should labor costs be aggregated plant by
plant or apportioned among product lines?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 8,000 switches that you can flip to manipulate the
software to handle business processes your way,'' said Mark
Gulling, ERP program manager for Eastman Kodak, which began
installing ERP software from SAP in September 1997 and does not
expect to be finished until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   SAP is trying to make the process easier for its customers. It
now offers a product called Asap _ officially, Accelerated SAP, but
the pun on ``as soon as possible'' is quite intentional _ that uses
a methodical question-and-answer format to guide customers through
the software's many options. ``The big goal is to have no
surprises,'' said Werner Dilzer, SAP's global director of
implementations.
</P>
<P>
   But that goal is still some distance off, as can be seen in the
experiences of three SAP customers in the ERP front lines. One made
just about every mistake in the book; another succeeded from the
start, and the third is only starting _ but trying to learn from
predecessors' mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   BROTHER INDUSTRIES: Learning the Ropes, The Hard Way
</P>
<P>
   Back in early 1996, Brother Industries (USA) in Memphis, the
American typewriter- and word processor-making arm of Brother
Industries Ltd. of Japan, figured that installing SAP's enterprise
software in eight months, tops, would be a snap.
</P>
<P>
   Brother would simply dump all the data from its existing
software systems into the new data base. And while the company was
at it, why not simultaneously change over from a big mainframe
computer to a client-server system, based on desktop computers,
that nobody in the company had yet been trained to use? And of
course, the information technology people could run most of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   ``They figured, it's packaged software, they didn't have to
train anyone _ four information systems folks could easily teach
250 users how to run it,'' said Samuel A. Cox, the chief
information officer hired by Brother in mid-1997 to clean up the
resulting mess.
</P>
<P>
   Everything that could go wrong did.
</P>
<P>
   Plants chronically ran low on raw materials because no one had
fed vital data to the new system about how long it took to get
parts from Brother's suppliers in mainland China _ often six weeks
or longer by the proverbial slow boat. Emergency air-freight
shipments, though expensive, might have been a solution, except
that all the pertinent vendor information was now locked up in new
computers that no one had thought to equip with surge protectors;
they kept crashing with every thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a real case of garbage in, garbage out,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   The project team was made up almost entirely of technologists
who did not really understand what the system was supposed to
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the team added up how many people worked on each
assembly line and the volume of parts and materials ordered by each
plant, figuring that the arithmetic was nuanced enough to account
for costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers proved far too broad-brush for operations
executives who needed an accurate gauge of the cost of making each
product. They needed to know how employees' time was divided over
work on the line, coffee breaks and training; how many parts were
actually used and how many wound up as scrap. Safety glasses, work
gloves and other general-use materials needed to be factored out.
</P>
<P>
   So did a lot of obsolete data. For years, employees had added
new parts numbers to the data base but never bothered to delete the
out-of-date ones. When the time came to switch to the SAP system,
half the 10,000 capacitors, screws, resistors, and such listed in
the data base were inactive. But the information was still dumped
into the new system.
</P>
<P>
   The huge amount of deadwood data slowed down everything from
checking for duplicate parts orders to analyzing the supplier list.
Even worse, when Brother's employees started adding the additional
information that the SAP software required _ the time that each
part sits in inventory before it is used, say, or the ratio of bad
to usable parts in each shipment _ they labored to find data for
twice as many parts as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Cox arrived, the new system was far over budget and
months behind schedule. He immediately joined forces with Douglas
Price, who at the time was Brother's vice president for
manufacturing, to figure out what the company's operations people
actually needed. ``Sam understood that SAP is not about hardware or
systems or software, but about the user community and its needs,''
said Price, who was later wooed away from Brother to become a
consultant on SAP software for Pricewaterhouse Coopers.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Cox and Price did the groundwork that should have been
done at the outset, analyzing labor and unit costs and waste rates
at each plant and feeding the data into the system. Finally, Cox
said, the program began doing what it was meant to do: keeping
materials flowing, logging orders in, sending bills out,
highlighting the most efficient operations and red-flagging the
least.
</P>
<P>
   Once the system was debugged, Brother found, for example, an
inefficiency in its keyboard assembly line that it could correct by
giving line workers a simple insertion tool. And it learned that
productivity was greater in areas of its plants that did not
arbitrarily shift workers from line to line, so it now keeps teams
of people working together on the same models.
</P>
<P>
   Now that it has tamed manufacturing control functions, Brother
is expanding the program. Starting in November, a sales and
distribution module will rapidly convert sales orders to production
orders. Next on the agenda are production planning and warehouse
management.

   CULTOR FOOD SCIENCE: Getting It Right The First Time
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Cultor Food Science in Ardsley, N.Y., a subsidiary
of Cultor Ltd. of Finland, was a shoo-in for getting a workable ERP
program up and running in just six months. In early 1996, the
company acquired the food ingredient division of Pfizer Inc.,
sending Cultor Food's annual sales from $150 million to $400
million in one big jump and challenging it to integrate a much
larger operation into its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, there's always resistance to change, but it helps when
there's no entrenched system to replace,'' said Richard Baratta,
the company's director of finance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest factor in Cultor's successful adoption of
enterprise software was probably its extensive preparation.
Cultor's management began by figuring out which specific sorts of
data, reports and control systems it needed and then challenged
software program vendors with a kind of test: Show us how your
program processes orders overseas, prove that it can track our
product from our shipping dock through a European middleman to an
ultimate user, and show us how you account for on-paper profit
transfers among plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what information we needed, and we weren't buying any
program until we were sure it could provide it,'' Baratta said.
</P>
<P>
   SAP got the highest marks on the test, so in mid-1996, Cultor
assumed the role of student: It bought the SAP package and became
one of the first companies to try its Asap product.
</P>
<P>
   The company assembled a team of six, drawn from both the newly
acquired Pfizer division and the old Cultor and including both
technical and operations managers. Cultor gave the team a separate
project room and established 48-hour deadlines to make decisions.
Team members talked frequently with operations people to see
whether the evolving program was really meeting their needs.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't always. The human resources department dropped out of
the project when it became clear that the system could provide only
40 percent of the data it needed. Manufacturing, on the other hand,
signed up for the program late in the game. ``If you're already
setting up systems to track raw materials coming in and product
going out, it makes no sense to have this production planning gap
in the middle,'' Baratta said.
</P>
<P>
   Other departments made bad choices and had to backpedal. Sales
initially insisted that the system account separately for orders to
each of Cultor's three product divisions, even if the orders came
from the same customer. Within a few weeks, sales managers saw that
this method caused duplication and made the company miss chances to
combine orders into one shipment. Cultor returned to accounting for
orders by customer, not by division.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a training blitz that did not stop with just a few
department heads. It reached, for example, to the quality manager
who for years had set aside Friday afternoons to enter a week's
worth of quality test results but now would have to enter them as
soon as the tests were completed. ``The SAP program won't add
product to the inventory list unless it's passed inspection, so our
inventory records wouldn't make sense otherwise,'' Baratta
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Cultor also learned the importance of keeping all its plants and
divisions in the loop. Many Cultor plants use one another's
products as ingredients and were accustomed to faxing orders back
and forth. When the North American plants became the first to
implement the new software, they stopped the practice, assuming
that the system would handle internal order processing
electronically. It does _ but the European plants, not yet on the
new system, weren't alerted to check for incoming electronic
orders. ``We didn't do a great job of communicating,'' Baratta
acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Cultor managed to get five plants in three countries
running on ERP software in just six months.
</P>
<P>
   Its advice to others? ``Remember that time is money with SAP,''
Baratta said. ``So get it up, get it running, tweak it if you have
to, but don't discuss, discuss, discuss. If you make a wrong
decision, you can always change it later.''
</P>
<P>
   VISTEON AUTOMOTIVE: Taking It Slowly, To Dodge Pitfalls  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most veterans of ERP installations say two important ingredients
for success are narrowing scope and bringing users on board. If so,
Visteon Automotive Systems should do just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Visteon, the $17 billion, 80,000-employee automotive components
unit of Ford Motor Co., started installing SAP enterprise software
only in late August and is early in the process.
</P>
<P>
   But for a year now, Stephen Delaney, Visteon's vice president
for supply and process leadership, has eaten, breathed and slept
ERP He and his project team built an extensive wish list by
interviewing every employee who would use the new software. Then
they drafted 50 specific goals related to speeding up the
order-to-shipment process, cutting costs and increasing
productivity. They dropped any request that did not directly
advance those goals.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Visteon's system will not bother with data about
tariffs and customs procedures, nor will it include manufacturing
data. Why? Feeding those masses of information into the system
might distract attention from the need to improve the handling of
costs, materials planning and order processing. ``Manufacturing is
not a weak area for us,'' Delaney said. ``We know we have to fix up
our transaction analysis first.''
</P>
<P>
   Users made 115 requests for data reported in ways that deviated
from the program's standard formats, but the project team whittled
those down to a handful. The accounting department wanted to stick
with software it had grown to love; the ERP team said no.
``Accounting transactions are the blood cells running through the
veins of the business transactions, and doing it outside SAP would
take away from the business process,'' Delaney said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the company bought the SAP package, Delaney assembled 60
people from Visteon operations and 40 from information technology
and set them to configuring the software full-time. He sequestered
them in a leased building across the street from Visteon's
Dearborn, Mich., headquarters and declared it off-limits to their
old bosses and colleagues, except for ERP business. The group
reports to Delaney, who in turn reports to Visteon's president.
</P>
<P>
   The team is setting what Delaney calls ``inchstones'' instead of
milestones. The team sets weekly goals for configuring the system
and tracks the hours spent on each goal. As each portion of the
program is installed, the productivity gains or cost savings are
measured against expectations. ``We will be able to see, almost
person by person, what we are doing right and what we have to
rethink,'' said Dave Bent, director of processes and systems. In
the works is a bonus system for team members who consistently meet
their inchstones.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Visteon is installing SAP software only in its smallest
division, a $700 million glass unit that employs about 400 people,
does most of its business in North America and does not have
thousands of permutations and combinations of its product to
account for. But representatives from other plants are
participating in the glass project to make sure it incorporates
functions that their operations will need.
</P>
<P>
   The glass division is scheduled to switch to the new system next
July, and Delaney wants it to run for at least six months before he
starts rolling out the SAP software to other units.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? Ask him in 2002, when the whole company is
supposed to be up and running.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS IN 3RD TAKE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The pitfalls of installing enterprise resource planning programs
_ software packages that coordinate a manufacturer's entire
operation _ are legion. Technology and operations workers may find
themselves working at cross-purposes, for example, or management
may fail to set or enforce deadlines. Or maybe the company is
biting off more sweeping changes than it can chew.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors, consultants and rueful been-there, done-that customers
say the companies that avoid the worst headaches have these
characteristics in common.
</P>
<P>
   _ The project has a high-level sponsor. ``Middle management
makes the system work, but middle management takes its clues
heavily from senior management,'' said David Alschuler, a vice
president of the Aberdeen Group, a market research firm in Boston
that has studied ERP installations.
</P>
<P>
   _ The goals are specific and manageable. For example, a program
can be set up to allocate inventory efficiently _ to large
customers first, to high-priority countries first, or to fill
orders as they come in. But it can't do all three at once.
</P>
<P>
   _ Business changes are made before the software is configured.
If the company is about to start selling over the Internet, for
example, the new sales system is put in place before locking in the
way the ERP software will handle sales and distribution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ End-users are on the project team. The system has to do what
operations managers need, not what technologists think they need.
``The IT department may be facilitating this, but it is the
operations people who will really drive it,'' said D. Michael
Travis, head of Arthur Andersen's ERP consulting practice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The team is sequestered. Freed from regular duties, team
members work in a separate project room where they can kick around
ideas without distractions from regular bosses and colleagues. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The team can make final decisions, but on short deadlines. ``A
wrong decision is better than no decision, because at least
something is getting done,'' said Werner Dilzer of SAP, the German
software giant.
</P>
<P>
   _ Implementation is gradual. Madness lies in trying to roll out
a system simultaneously to every plant in 20 countries. Taken one
country or business unit at a time, it becomes manageable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Ample time is spent on training. An administrative assistant
who enters a purchase order once a month might need only a day's
lesson; a person responsible for the checking and recording of
inventory probably needs at least a week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Old security blankets are discarded. Companies may be tempted,
for example, to force the system to keep generating paper reports
just because the staff is used to them. Inevitably, though, people
will make changes on paper and forget to enter the changed data in
the system. Better to scrap the paper reports entirely.

THE BUSH BROTHERS REPRESENT NEW, IMPROVED REPUBLICAN PARTY: MORAL,
INCLUSIVE, COMPASSIONATE 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ It's the new, improved Republican. Conservative but
compassionate, moral but not mean, inclusive not divisive. A
winner.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day 1998, that optimistic package sold big for Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, an early front-runner for a GOP presidential
bid, and brother Jeb, governor-elect of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brothers focused on issues that appeal to
middle-of-the-road voters _ lower taxes, economic opportunity,
better schools for kids and personal responsibility. Both
successfully attracted greater numbers of minorities to their
moderate vision of conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're beginning to see here is the emergence of the new
Republican,`` said Robert Holsworth, director of the center for
public policy at Virginia Commonwealth University. ``Are you going
to fight a cultural civil war or are you going to include everybody
under one umbrella?''
</P>
<P>
   Republican politicians embraced by the social conservative wing
of the party, meanwhile, too often dwelled in the past to their
peril, analysts say. The White House sex-and-lies scandal might
have provided an entertaining diversion on television talk
circuits, but it turned voters off at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Weary from harsh rhetoric and the sting of fire-and-brimstone
politics, voters turned their backs on numerous favorites of social
conservatives Tuesday in upsets almost unimagined just weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, staunch Southern Republicans such as North Carolina
Sen. Launch Faircloth, Alabama Gov. Fob James and South Carolina
Gov. David Beasley were sent packing. In California, Democrats
successfully painted GOP candidates as out of touch to take back
the governor's mansion after 16 years and to return Barbara Boxer
to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where Republicans swept the statewide slate in the
first such victory since Reconstruction, social conservatives in
the party failed to take over the State Board of Education, an
ideological battleground for curriculum standards, mandatory
testing and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the (Republican) party has to move to the mainstream
if they're going to be successful, and the party has to show the
kind of compassion and tolerance that was demonstrated in the
campaigns of Governor Bush and Governor Bush,'' said Marlin
Fitzwater, White House press secretary in the Reagan and George
Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to reach out to Hispanics and other minorities.
They used plain language to explain their policies and programs in
terms people could understand how they would benefit from them.
They made it clear that they wanted government to be a source of
strength and support for the people of their states. I think those
are approaches Republicans need to emulate.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democrats found voters were turned off by social
conservatives' hot-button issues, particularly abortion, said
Leslie Goodman, a Sacramento-based political consultant with ties
to the George Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly say that there's a trend against
stridency,'' she said. ``I think the Democrats were very successful
in raising issues like abortion, particularly out here in
coordinated campaigns, to try to make it an issue so even those who
were not extremists got tagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into the cluster of social issues, you invariably
get into intolerance,'' she added. ``That's the piece that people
don't embrace. They don't like what I call in-your-face politics or
preacher politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a group called the Republican Leadership Council
is hoping to persuade the party to move away from its far-right
fringes. Its effort is patterned after the Democratic Leadership
Council's makeover of President Clinton in new, conservative
clothing after big congressional losses to Republican rebels in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The RLC promptly issued a statement after the election
chastising the Republican Party for not heeding the results of its
national issues survey conducted in 77 swing congressional
districts last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the key to electoral victory is a strong
emphasis on fiscal issues, education and crime as opposed to
polarizing moral issues,'' said Mark Miller, executive director of
the group.``Our survey indicated, and the elections vindicated,
that Republicans can successfully compete with Democrats on
education issues and dominate on issues such as taxes, welfare and
crime. We lose when our dominating message is one of rigid
ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller added that the Bush brothers, along with New York Gov.
George Pataki, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves and Colorado Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell all won decisive victories by campaigning on
conservative, but positive, themes.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, George W. Bush's appeal extended beyond traditional
party lines to bring in a large segment of female voters, much
higher percentages of Hispanic and African-American voters, as well
as traditional Democrats, some of them liberals. It translated into
a resounding 69 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Bush referred to his own kinder,
gentler, conservative philosophy and why he thinks it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says that a leader who is compassionate and conservative
can erase the gender gap, open the doors of the Republican Party to
new faces and new voices, and win without sacrificing our
principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also provided long coattails that carried along Republican
candidates for statewide races whose own campaigns steered clear of
abortion, gay rights and school prayer. The White House scandal
remained conspicuously absent from high-dollar media campaigns of
the GOP's top candidates until a final advertising blitz led by the
national party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won every statewide race, which I think was a big
surprise,'' Bush said. ``I think it's important for people to
understand why the conservative philosophy and its policies are
compassionate. I unite people as opposed to divide people. More
importantly I talked about issues that are going to make Texas
better in the future. I laid out a specific plan for improving
schools and making the welfare system work and making the criminal
justice system work. And, I proposed a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, I think, appreciated my style of leadership,'' he
added. ``They appreciate the fact that I can lead but more
importantly they saw where I wanted to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's style remains untested in a national campaign, where his
brand of personal affability with his home state's electorate could
undergo the inevitable strains of microscopic scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a very, very strong candidate who had a couple of
attributes that were very well-received by the voters. One, he
wasn't partisan. Two, he avoided conflict. He liked comedy. He
liked civility,'' said Bob Stein, political scientist at Rice
University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is vulnerable precisely because he is touted as a
front-runner so early, Holsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who has the opportunity is sort of George Bush
right now,'' he said. ``He has the advantage of being the
presumptive front-runner and also the dilemma of being touted
extraordinarily high. If people are simply attaching to you all
their hopes and aspirations, you often disappoint them when you
become a living, breathing, human being with certain positions and
flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bushes are on the record as opposing abortion, although a
leading anti-abortion activist in Texas said George W. Bush has
couched his opposition in policy terms that are more widely
palatable. At the state Republican Convention last summer, Bush
promised to move to the top of his agenda a bill to require
abortion providers to notify the parents of a minor seeking an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, he was savvy about it,'' said Bill Price, president
of Texans United for Life. ``He chose some pro-life issues that are
fairly well accepted by the general public. That's just smart
politics. I don't criticize him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Democratic perspective, Bush's style looks similarly
conciliatory. Just as the Democrats had to pull away from the
liberal left in presidential and gubernatorial politics, the
Republicans will do the same if they are smart, said Chuck
McDonald, press secretary to Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he did was designed to be inclusive, not exclusive,
which was the problem the national Republicans got into with all
their mean-spirited issues and language, frankly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to Gov. Bush because he clearly identified
himself as a person of strong values but at no time did he say
anything about anyone else's values. He resisted that as did Jeb
Bush, and it paid off for them in phenomenal ways.'' &QL;

   The New York Times asked authors what book _ besides their own,
of course _ they would most like to have written. Mary B.W. Tabor
compiled their answers.
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM STYRON wrote ``Darkness Visible: A Memoir of Madness,''
``Sophie's Choice'' and other books.
</P>
<P>
   One that stands out at the moment for me is the great historian
C. Vann Woodward's ``The Burden of Southern History'' because I'm a
frustrated historian myself. ``The Burden of History'' is so
magisterial in its understanding of the spirit and the traditions
of the South and the way they evolved that it's really kind of a
work of almost perfect authority.

   E.L. DOCTOROW is the author of ``Ragtime,'' ``Billy Bathgate''

</P>
<P>
   I can think of at least 50 books I would have loved to have
written without even trying. I haven't usually thought this way as
a writer, because I am always so receptive as a reader. But if you
pressed me, if there was just one book I could choose, it would be
``Don Quixote.'' I think the whole world is in that book.

   JANE SMILEY is the author of ``A Thousand Acres,'' ``Moo'' and
other novels.
</P>
<P>
   I'm ambivalent here because to wish I'd written another book is
to wish that you were another person and in some cases to wish you
were dead. I wish neither of those. But I guess the other person
that I wish I could be for a while just to experience that
consciousness would be Charles Dickens. And the book that I wish to
be writing when I was that person would be ``Our Mutual Friend,''
his last completed novel. He has a very broad canvas in that book,
and here he very consciously was trying to depict all of London
life and all of the social classes' interaction. But the most
wonderful thing about it for me is that he perfected his writing
style so that every word is right in half a dozen or more ways so
that the book becomes, as you are reading, a huge network of
meanings that the more you read the more meanings you apprehend,
and it just builds and builds and builds. It's just perfect from
beginning to end.
</P>
<P>
   KINKY FRIEDMAN is the author of many books, including ``Road
Kill'' and ``Blast From the Past.''
</P>
<P>
   I wish I'd written ``The Great Gatsby,'' I suppose. It's a great
tragic American love story, and to write a book like that requires
a great deal of heartbreak. You would have to be flying on a lot of
alcohol and a lot of different kinds of herbs and spices. You'd
have to be a pretty unhappy American to write something like that.
The (other) book I would have preferred to have written is ``A
Fan's Notes,'' in which Frederick Exley very presciently saw the
demise of Frank Gifford as an American hero. I like books by dead
writers, particularly writers who died broke or disassociated from
their times and society or died in the gutter. I like to think I
died in the gutter and lived to tell about it. People outside the
toxic mainstream of Middle America.
</P>
<P>
   WENDY WASSERSTEIN wrote the play ``An American Daughter'' and
the screenplay for ``The Object of My Affection.''
</P>
<P>
   I was thinking about Chekhov's ``The Cherry Orchard.'' What
appeals to me is the perfection of the play. He calls it a comedy
and yet it captures the tones of melancholy. Maybe I also think
it's the ultimate turn-of-the-century piece. It deals with the
passing of time and sadness. And I like his ability to capture a
moment, not realizing it until after its over. The other book I
would like to have written would be ``J.K. Lasser's Your Income
Tax'' or any of the ``For Dummies'' books. If you wrote any of
those ``For Dummies'' books, you'd know a lot of things.
</P>
<P>
   ANDREW WEIL wrote ``Eight Weeks to Optimum Health'' and other
books.
</P>
<P>
   The book I most wish I'd written is ``The Autobiography of a
Yogi'' by Paramahansa Yogananda, because then I would have had all
of the fabulous experiences he described growing up in India in the
early part of this century. Who would not want to have known
genuine gurus and living saints?
</P>
<P>
   MARIANNE WIGGINS wrote ``Almost Heaven,'' ``John Dollar'' and
other books.
</P>
<P>
   I accompanied the writer-explorer Tim Severin to the South
Pacific this summer on his current adventure, ``In Search of Moby
Dick,'' so I took the opportunity to reread Melville's roisterous,
rollicking masterpiece after 30-some years in preparation for our
voyage. As a novel I marvel at, envy and revere, it rules the
roost. Protomodern, massive, pretentious, turkey-cocking, loony and
instructive, it is unparalleled as a handbook to what fuels the
masculine in the American novel. Oh boy, do I wish I had written it
_ wish more women would write with that prowess and stamina. Its
failings are many; its rewards are unequaled in number and meaning.
</P>
<P>
   MARK CHILDRESS is the author of ``Crazy in Alabama'' and ``Gone
for Good.''
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that more than any of them I wish I'd written ``To
Kill a Mockingbird,'' not just because it's so beautifully done and
has remained so fresh, not just because it has provided its author
with a rather nice annuity, but because I think that one novel has
done more to change opinions and feelings in the South about
questions of race than all the speeches, polemics and well-meaning
tracts put together.
</P>
<P>
   PETER STRAUB, whose latest book is ``Circulo Diabolico.''
</P>
<P>
   I first read Donald Harington's ``Some Other Place. The Right
Place'' in 1973. While following Harington's career over the
intervening 25 years, I read (the book) four times over, always, in
fact increasingly, with the knowledge of encountering a vast,
delicate, bawdy, playful, reckless masterpiece filled with wit,
overflowing invention, tremendous courage, technical wizardry,
profound feeling and mysteries opening upon further, richer, more
dazzling mysteries. Who would not wish to have written such a
marvel, to have had the experience of writing it?

REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS EYE HISPANIC VOTE IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL and MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats, cheered by the results
of their unprecedented courtship of Hispanic voters in last
Tuesday's elections, are mapping efforts to enlist the nation's
fastest growing minority in their efforts to win the White House in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters made significant contributions to the margins of
victory for prominent national politicians from both political
parties, including winners with presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Lopez, head of the Republican party's program to court
Hispanic voters, said the latest election results will shape GOP
overtures in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans are looking to see if the Hispanic vote
will be the wave of the future for the GOP,'' said Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Chairman Roy Romer says the mid-term elections
underscored that Hispanic voters will be ``increasingly important
in every election we see in the next 50 years.'' Romer insisted
that the political parties' competing policy agendas _ not
superficial courtship _ will determine who garners the lion's share
of support from a rapidly growing segment of the population that
will represent 25 percent of the nation's residents by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics are going to vote Republican or Democratic not
because candidates speak their language or attend their festivals
but because the candidates are giving their families what they
really need,'' said Romer, the governor of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics made up 5 percent of the electorate last Tuesday _ a
66 percent jump from the previous mid-term elections, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates scored the greatest gains among Hispanic
voters nationwide. According to exit polls by the Voter News
Service, 35 percent of Hispanics who voted cast their lot with
Republican candidates _ up 9 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics played key roles in states with large Hispanic
populations including Texas, California, Florida and New York.
Those four states control 144 electoral votes _ or 53 percent of
the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush emerged to lead the pack of GOP
presidential hopefuls on the strength of his 49 percent share of
the Hispanic vote in his landslide second-term victory. Bush's
showing buoys Republican hopes of reclaiming California, Arizona
and Florida _ three states with large Hispanic populations that
supported President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Voter News Service exit polls, five senators
won re-election with substantial help from the Hispanic community.
They were Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., a potential GOP White House
aspirant who carried 52 percent of the Hispanic vote in Arizona;
Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Harry Reid, D-Nev. and Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Their Hispanic support ranged from Graham's 65 percent share to
Campbell's 42 percent share, according to the exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters also helped Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., score
one of the biggest upsets of the mid-term elections, ousting
12-year veteran Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. Schumer split the
non-Hispanic white vote with D'Amato, but won 82 percent of the
Hispanic vote and 86 percent of the African American vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., defeated Republican Matt Fong with
the help of 72 percent of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters also helped deliver California's statehouse into
the hands of a Democrat for the first time in 16 years, by awarding
Democratic Gray Davis 78 percent of their support.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Hispanics accounted for 14 percent of the state's
voters, up 56 percent since the last off-year election to 14
percent last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some credit the statewide draw of Democrat Cruz Bustamante, the
former state assembly speaker who won the post of lieutenant
governor to become the first Hispanic elected to statewide office
since the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that GOP candidates, led by defeated GOP
gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren, continue to suffer from
voters' backlash against the anti-immigrant initiatives of retiring
GOP Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilson is still poison among Hispanics'' in California, said
William Schneider, a public opinion specialist at the American
Enterprise Institute. ``I'm not sure Republicans can ever
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders are vowing to fight hard for the Hispanic vote
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson says Republicans will court Hispanics
with support for anti-crime measures, school vouchers to help pay
for parochial schools and tax breaks for children.
</P>
<P>
   Romer, the Democratic chairman, says Democrats will woo
Hispanics with support for school building modernization,
performance standards for students and teachers and improved access
to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Echaveste, the deputy White House chief of staff and the
highest ranking Hispanic at the White House, predicted that
Democrats will win the majority of Hispanic votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans continue with their anti-immigrant, anti-Hispanic
agenda,'' Echaveste contends. ``Thank God, they haven't figured it
out yet _ it makes our job of solidifying Hispanic support for
Democrats that much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results showed that Hispanic voters split their
tickets. In Florida, for example, 65 percent of Hispanic voters
backed the Democratic candidate for Senate; 61 percent supported
the Republican for governor. In Arizona, Hispanics gave 52 percent
of their votes to McCain, who won, and 56 percent of their votes to
Democrat Paul Johnson who lost his bid for governor.

</P>
<P>
   Of 19 Hispanic candidates who ran for major statewide office
across the nation, seven won, including Democrat Ken Salazar,
elected attorney general of Colorado, and Republican Tony Garza,
who won the post of railroad commissioner in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials reported that Hispanics made ``significant'' gains in
state legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics picked up five additional seats to hold 52 state
senate seats in legislatures in 15 states. Hispanics also gained
seven seats in the lower houses of state legislatures, to control
129 state assembly seats in 25 state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the size of the 18-member Congressional Hispanic
Caucus did not change as a result of the election.

<P>
   There's definitely something about Marianne.
</P>
<P>
   Perky, cute, leggy, warm and gregarious to the point of stark
gullibility, she's Miss American Pie, the girl next door every
Vietnam soldier dreams of dashing home to for a game of house. Only
in Showtime's ``A Soldier's Sweetheart,'' she goes to them to play
war.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggled into a relatively unsupervised and skirmish-free
medical compound by her medic boyfriend (Fossie, played by Skeet
Ulrich), Marianne (Georgina Cates) at first fits quite nicely into
this group of eight young medics in the heart of Viet Cong
territory.
</P>
<P>
   First unsure of this odd, dangerous setup, they slowly convince
themselves that she can sustain at least the illusion of normalcy
for them.
</P>
<P>
   She does, too, putting up curtains, making meals, playing
volleyball, dancing, prancing around in tiny, bright-colored
shorts, tops and sneakers _ a stark contrast to the darkness and
death around them.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the wounded arrive, Marianne is there. At first jolted
by the horror of war, she becomes something of a medical assistant
and emotional crutch, grasping the hands of soldiers as they scream
in pain or die silently on the operating table. But this is where
Marianne's tragic transformation, or rather, seduction, begins.
</P>
<P>
   Airing at 7 p.m. CST Sunday on the cable channel, ``A Soldier's
Sweetheart,'' adapted from Tim O'Brien's engaging short story
``Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong'' (a more intriguing title but
hardly a sellable one), provides a different side of Vietnam and
the war that engulfed it, a ``romantic'' one, if that's to be
believed.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Thomas Michael Donnelly offers such panoramic
views of mountains and deep jungle set off by bright sunlight,
moody fog and moonlit quiet that booking a ticket doesn't seem that
incredibly far-fetched. He provides a seductive majesty and beauty
amid the blood and horror.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that a naive, open-hearted Marianne, fresh out
of high school and wanting to live life, is sucked in and spit out?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here, might as well learn something,'' she tells Fossie
after another of her unsupervised strolls into the jungle, what she
refers to as ``going into town.'' Says an increasingly frustrated
Fossie: ``It's not like visiting neighbors back home.''
</P>
<P>
   She becomes fascinated by the hardened Green Berets stationed
just a few feet from their compound _ quiet, somber men seen only
at daybreak after returning from bloody ambushes. Marianne slowly
digests the compelling details of war, learning about land mines
and how to shoot M-16s with the same born-again fervor reserved for
new lovers.
</P>
<P>
   To punctuate the point that Marianne has become far too
comfortable, Fossie and Rat (Kiefer Sutherland, who narrates in
flashback) are talked into visiting a nearby village where Marianne
shakes the hands of young Vietnamese (with a wide smile, she talks
to them like they are suburban kids out playing touch football) who
could very well blow her to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that this is the place where I got off. By now
the transformation is irreversible: Fossie tries to get Marianne to
head back to her safe existence in Ohio, and she agrees, only to
take up arms and disappear with the Green Berets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm full of electricity,'' she tells Fossie after he
finds her. ``And I'm glowing in the dark. I'm on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Fossie goes insane (he's seen being put on a chopper
babbling), we're left with Rat's telling of this story to a very
interested commander while hiding in a ditch during a late-night
skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   By then ``A Soldier's Sweetheart'' has transformed from dark
love story to light war story to insanity bordering on the comical.
Still, what crazy, fascinating stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Although I haven't read it, O'Brien's short story ventures into
the same territory, offering even one of the last scenes of a
military police commander sifting through Marianne's discarded
luggage to find a high school yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Under her smiling face is ``Ambition?'' to which she replied
``to travel.'' Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK IN TV:
</P>
<P>
   ``Exiled: A Law &AMP; Order Movie'' (8 p.m. CST Sunday, NBC): Chris
Noth fanatics glued to ``Law &AMP; Order'' reruns on A&AMP;E will leap at
this chance to see Noth back in a two-hour movie, reprising the
role he left in 1995. To catch up the unfamiliar: Noth's Detective
Logan was transferred from New York to Staten Island after punching
out a corrupt politician in front of a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Exiled,'' he stumbles upon the ``L&AMP;O'' gang while trying to
make a low-priority murder case big time.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was Noth's idea, ``L&AMP;O'' creator Dick Wolf has made
clear, letting us know that it's Noth crawling back to him. Indeed,
Noth hasn't made much of a dent since leaving the drama series,
although getting paid to hang out with Sarah Jessica Parker on
HBO's ``Sex in the City'' is better than digging ditches. The
verdict here: ``L&AMP;O'' fans will be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Knight in Camelot'' (6 p.m. CST Sunday, ABC): An enjoyable
feast of entertainment is this retelling of Mark Twain's ``A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'' starring Whoopi
Goldberg as a computer whiz who travels back in time. Michael York
makes a great uptight Arthur and Simon Fenton is perfectly cast as
Goldberg's young page, who will certainly turn female heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Women of Alaska'' (8 p.m. CST Sunday, TBS): If women can
be found in Alaska, Boyd Matson can find them. Here the adventurer
seeks out some intriguing Alaskan females, from a salmon fisher to
a dog sled musher. What, no swimsuit models?

digests the compelling details of war, learning about land mines
and how to shoot M-16s with the same born-again fervor reserved for
new lovers.
</P>
<P>
   To punctuate the point that Marianne has become far too
comfortable, Fossie and Rat (Kiefer Sutherland, who narrates in
flashback) are talked into visiting a nearby village where Marianne
shakes the hands of young Vietnamese (with a wide smile, she talks
to them like they are suburban kids out playing touch football) who
could very well blow her to pieces.
</P>
<P>
   I have to admit that this is the place where I got off. By now
the transformation is irreversible: Fossie tries to get Marianne to
head back to her safe existence in Ohio, and she agrees, only to
take up arms and disappear with the Green Berets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm full of electricity,'' she tells Fossie after he
finds her. ``And I'm glowing in the dark. I'm on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Fossie goes insane (he's seen being put on a chopper
babbling), we're left with Rat's telling of this story to a very
interested commander while hiding in a ditch during a late-night
skirmish.
</P>
<P>
   By then ``A Soldier's Sweetheart'' has transformed from dark
love story to light war story to insanity bordering on the comical.
Still, what crazy, fascinating stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Although I haven't read it, O'Brien's short story ventures into
the same territory, offering even one of the last scenes of a
military police commander sifting through Marianne's discarded
luggage to find a high school yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Under her smiling face is ``Ambition?'' to which she replied
``to travel.'' Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK IN TV:
</P>
<P>
   ``Exiled: A Law &AMP; Order Movie'' (8 p.m. CST Sunday, NBC): Chris
Noth fanatics glued to ``Law &AMP; Order'' reruns on A&AMP;E will leap at
this chance to see Noth back in a two-hour movie, reprising the
role he left in 1995. To catch up the unfamiliar: Noth's Detective
Logan was transferred from New York to Staten Island after punching
out a corrupt politician in front of a TV camera.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Exiled,'' he stumbles upon the ``L&AMP;O'' gang while trying to
make a low-priority murder case big time.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was Noth's idea, ``L&AMP;O'' creator Dick Wolf has made
clear, letting us know that it's Noth crawling back to him. Indeed,
Noth hasn't made much of a dent since leaving the drama series,
although getting paid to hang out with Sarah Jessica Parker on
HBO's ``Sex in the City'' is better than digging ditches. The
verdict here: ``L&AMP;O'' fans will be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Knight in Camelot'' (6 p.m. CST Sunday, ABC): An enjoyable
feast of entertainment is this retelling of Mark Twain's ``A
Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'' starring Whoopi
Goldberg as a computer whiz who travels back in time. Michael York
makes a great uptight Arthur and Simon Fenton is perfectly cast as
Goldberg's young page, who will certainly turn female heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wild Women of Alaska'' (8 p.m. CST Sunday, TBS): If women can
be found in Alaska, Boyd Matson can find them. Here the adventurer
seeks out some intriguing Alaskan females, from a salmon fisher to
a dog sled musher. What, no swimsuit models?

<TEXT>
<P>
   For contemporary historians, Thomas Jefferson has always been an
enigma, and the new DNA evidence that he fathered at least one
child by his young slave Sally Hemings simply deepens the mystery
of the man.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Jefferson was the author of some of the most
glorious sentences in the English language, his ringing affirmation
of the equality of all men in the Declaration of Independence. On
the other, he was a slaveholder who wrote some of the vilest
sentiments of racism in his only book, ``Notes on the State of
Virginia,'' published in 1785. Blacks, Jefferson wrote, have ``a
very strong and disagreeable odor,'' they are incapable of uttering
more than ``a plain narration.'' Jefferson also said that racial
amalgamation ``produces a degradation . . . to which no one can
innocently consent.''
</P>
<P>
   Most historians now believe that his relationship with Hemings
probably endured for many years, if not from 1787, when Hemings,
then 13 or 14, arrived in Paris as a ``nurse'' to Jefferson's
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the new evidence is in, how can the inconsistencies in
Jefferson's character be explained?
</P>
<P>
   The ability to overlook the contradictions in his own behavior
was at the core of Jefferson's personality, and his relationship
with Hemings was only one of many inconsistencies in his character,
Annette Gordon-Reed, a law professor at New York Law School,
contends in her book ``Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An
American Controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was a republican, an anti-monarchist who saw himself
as a man of the people, yet he lived luxuriously, with a silver
trimmed carriage, entertaining lavishly at Monticello. He made his
slaves skilled craftsmen but said they could not be freed because
they were basically children. Jefferson's behavior, Ms. Gordon-Reed
said, was consistent with the essential rationalizations of
slavery. Black women were seen as animals, but slave owners gave
them their children to suckle and had sex with them. Black men were
seen as infantile, but they were also seen as sexual predators, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays hide-and-seek within himself,'' Joseph J. Ellis,
perhaps the best known of contemporary Jefferson scholars, said
this week when the DNA evidence was revealed. During his lifetime,
there were rumors, including a public accusation by a journalist,
James Callender, that he was having relations with a slave woman.
Jefferson denied it only once, indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``Notes on the State of Virginia,'' it was written before
his relationship with Hemings seems to have begun. After it
apparently commenced, Jefferson grew quieter on the subject of
racial mixing, though he did speak out against it toward the end of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson,'' Ellis went to some lengths to deny that Jefferson
could have had a sexual relationship with Hemings. And so have most
Jefferson scholars, including Dumas Malone, the author of a
six-volume biography of Jefferson, and Garry Wills, the author of
``Inventing America: Jefferson's Declaration of Independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson has always been a kind of American god, one of the
three figures, including Lincoln and Washington, whom Malone called
``our trinity of immortals.'' And as gods sometimes are, he has
been imagined as sexless. In ``American Sphinx,'' Ellis said that
for most of his adult life Jefferson was unable to express his
sexual energies. He cited a contemporary description of Jefferson
as somewhat effeminate. But Ellis' view of Jefferson's sexuality
overlooks the fact that Jefferson's wife, Martha, was almost
constantly pregnant during their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hemings, Wills said that many men ``use prostitutes and
use women,'' adding, ``There is no evidence he cherished her.''
</P>
<P>
   The assertion that Jefferson's relationship with Hemings was
probably one of long standing has in the past been left to two
historians who are women, the late Fawn Brodie in her book ``Thomas
Jefferson: An Intimate History'' and Ms. Gordon-Reed.
</P>
<P>
   But how could Jefferson have sustained a relationship with
Hemings that may have lasted for 38 years if he thought that black
people smelled, that they were stupid and childlike? ``In general,
in order to retain someone in slavery, you have to dehumanize
them,'' said Edmund Morgan, author of ``American Slavery, American
Freedom: the Ordeal of Colonial Virginia.'' ``It was a standard
thing that went with slavery.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson was also surrounded by examples of sexual
relationships between masters and slaves. He had witnessed the
relationships of two men he deeply admired, his father-in-law, John
Wayles, and his law professor, George Wythe, with slave women.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason Jefferson may have been able to reconcile his
relationship with Hemings with his opposition to miscegenation, Ms.
Gordon-Reed points out in her book, was that Hemings was his wife's
half sister, the daughter of John Wayles and his slave consort.
Jefferson had been devastated by his wife's death, and he had
promised her he would never remarry. Perhaps Hemings, who was known
to be beautiful, bore some of his wife's characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most important, Hemings, under Jefferson's notions
of race mixing, may have been in some way ``white'' in his eyes.
Indeed, in the 1830 census of Monticello, Hemings was listed as
white.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson also believed that blacks became ``white'' when they
had a certain amount of white blood in them, a theory he
illustrated once in a complex mathematical chart drawn up in a
letter to a friend. ``Let `h' and `e' cohabit,'' Jefferson wrote,
and ``the half of the blood of each will be q/2 plus e/2 plus a/8
plus A/8 . . .'' He concluded that the more white blood they had,
the more ``the improvement of the blacks in body and mind.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's attitude toward slaves bore some similarities to his
attitude toward women. ``He was very paternalistic; he grouped
women and slaves together as people who should be protected,'' Ms.
Gordon-Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Jefferson cared for Hemings sufficiently to have a
relationship with her that endured for decades, why did he not free
her? Indeed, as the author of the Declaration of Independence, as
one who spoke publicly about the abominations of slavery, why did
Jefferson not free all his slaves? One reason may have been the
lavish life style he led, which depended on his slaves. ``It was
more important for him to live the way he did than to deny himself
much,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Wills agrees, saying, ``He was running up his life style, so he
had to take it out on his slaves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson dwelt in a fantasy world,'' Ms. Brodie wrote. He was
willing to ignore contradictions between his own life and his idea
of a just world. To have faced the contradictions in his own
behavior would have served to destroy his confidence in his own
destiny as a moral leader of men.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that in the end, the contradictions within Jefferson
the man were paradigmatic of the contradictions within slavery
itself, contradictions that eventually broke the system apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about the symbolism of it,'' Jan Lewis, a
professor of history at Rutgers University in Newark, N.J., and the
author of ``Pursuit of Happiness: Family and Values in Jefferson's
Virginia,'' said this week, ``of the fact that blacks and whites
are the same family, and of the cost to the country of denying our
familial relationships; of not understanding, of not being able to
claim each other as kin, biologically and figuratively. Clinton
talks about the national conversation about race. My first thought
now is the conversation may begin now that we have a place to
start.''

MITTERRAND'S LAST WHIM STRUGGLES WITH REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ALAN RIDING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In late March 1995, just weeks before leaving office,
President Francois Mitterrand inaugurated the $1.5 billion complex
that would house the new National Library of France. The last of
what are known as the ``Grands Travaux,'' or great works, that
would mark Mitterrand's 14 years in power, it was also his
favorite, so much so that he picked the design and rushed its
construction in just 19 months.
</P>
<P>
   After his death in January 1996, the library was given his name
in what seemed like an appropriate tribute to a man who literally
imposed this personal whim on the nation. Now, however,
Mitterrand's strong identity with the library has turned him into
an easy target of blame for what is fast becoming a major source of
embarrassment to the government and of irritation to its users.
</P>
<P>
   From its very unveiling in late 1989, Dominique Perrault's
design was questioned. The idea of storing books in four
glass-faced towers, L-shaped to evoke open books, was ridiculed by
library experts. Many critics also said that the rectangular
complex beneath the towers was too sprawling to be practical. But
work went ahead anyway, on a site overlooking the Seine in eastern
Paris. The library's troubles, though, were not over.
</P>
<P>
   Once construction was completed, it took three years for 11
million volumes to be moved from the old National Library on the
Rue Richelieu, with the public reading area finally opened by
President Jacques Chirac in December 1996. But the entire library
went into operation only on Oct. 9 this year, 18 months behind
schedule, when the area set aside for 2,000 scholars was ready.
Then, 11 days later, the library was shut down by a strike.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, public sector strikes have become something of a habit
in France of late, but this strike went beyond customary demands
for higher wages to spotlight the deeper crisis gripping what only
three years ago was being proclaimed as ``the first library of the
third millennium.'' The 17-day strike of some 800 of the 2,800
staff members was settled Friday, although things may not return to
normal for several days. More seriously, some problems exposed by
the strike may take years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, given the design of the building, some complaints will
be impossible to satisfy, even with an annual budget of $180
million. ``Unfortunately, it is too late to change the structure of
the building,'' the library's director-general, Francois Stasse,
said in a letter to the staff last week. ``Neither can we reduce
the distance between the towers nor bring daylight into windowless
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   What in fact provoked the strike was a massive computer
breakdown on Oct. 13, which forced library workers to hand-carry
books to scholars and suggested that the rush to open the library
last month had forestalled proper testing of complex equipment.
``But the breakdown was merely the catalyst that revealed much
deeper social malaise,'' explained one senior staff member who did
not join the strike.
</P>
<P>
   For the strikers, the comfort enjoyed by public visitors and
scholars contrasts with the poor working conditions of much of the
staff, above all those involved in finding and delivering books to
scholars on the premises. The strikers also complained that a flood
of temporary workers had been hired without adequate training to
work with computers. Further, many books are too large to use an
automated delivery system, requiring staffers to carry them through
heavy doors and long corridors.
</P>
<P>
   The striking unions said that, as a first step, the scholars'
area should be closed on Mondays as well as on Sundays to allow
time for special training. The government resisted, arguing that
every major library in the world was open at least six days a week.
As part of Friday's settlement, however, the scholars' area will be
closed all day on Monday through Jan. 31 next year and on Monday
mornings through June 30. The public reading area will also close
on Mondays, but it is open on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   As the library's troubles have spilled into the public domain,
complaints about the monarchical manner in which Mitterrand _ ``the
Prince,'' as some newspapers have called him _ gave birth to the
project have escalated. ``If the library was invented to illustrate
the archaic and arbitrary nature of the Grands Travaux, it is a
success,'' Jean-Michel Helvig wrote in a signed editorial in
Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   But the library's architect also has not escaped fresh
criticism, although Perrault, 44, has been quick to point out that
his design followed the instructions given to competing architects
and that he had no responsibility for the computer failures.
``We're like children wanting everything now,'' he said. ``A period
of adjustment is indispensable.''
</P>
<P>
   With French newspapers mischievously reporting the success of
the new British Library in London as a way of dramatizing the
setbacks here, Perrault even tried to reassure the French through a
bizarre form of logic. ``What is great is that we are 15 years
ahead of the British Library, which the English took 25 years to
build,'' he said. ``That means we still have plenty of time to sort
out our problems.''

RWANDA ADMITS HELPING CONGO REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Rwanda acknowledged on Friday for
the first time that it has troops helping rebels in Congo, an
admission that could smooth the way for a cease-fire in that
troubled country.
</P>
<P>
   Since fighting broke out in Congo in July, Rwanda has repeatedly
denied any involvement. The stand has made it difficult for real
bargaining to take place and has led to heated exchanges between
Rwandan leaders and the president of Congo, Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, a mixture of opposition politicians and disgruntled
soldiers, are accusing Kabila of corruption, nepotism and inciting
ethnic hatred. When Kabila came to power 18 months ago, ousting the
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, he did so with crucial support from
Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   But those countries have now turned against him and are backing
the new rebellion. The Rwandans believe that Kabila has been arming
and training exiled Rwandans and former soldiers with the aim of
destabilizing Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The admission on Friday was made by Rwanda's vice president,
Paul Kagame, at the end of an hourlong meeting with President
Nelson Mandela in Pretoria. At a news conference, Kagame said
Rwanda became involved in the Congo rebellion in August and had
denied such actions because it did not want to be seen as fueling
the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame said it was important that people understand that the
rebellion did not spring from the Rwandan presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning there were different complications because
people were confusing the issues,'' Kagame said. ``They were
confusing any information about the presence of our troops as the
problem. They did not realize that the problem was basically an
internal one.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite dozens of meetings to promote peace negotiations, the
fighting in Congo has continued for three months, drawing in
neighboring countries on both sides and threatening to develop into
a large-scale war.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame said Friday that Rwandan forces would not withdraw until
Rwanda's security concerns were addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it is an issue of making sure that whatever solution is
found in the Congo, that it must take care of all our security
concerns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who sat next to Kagame as he spoke, said Rwanda's
admission of involvement would be crucial in advancing peace talks.
Mandela has been working on a diplomatic solution to the crisis off
and on for months, but has had little success so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the Rwandans, through the vice president, have made
this acknowledgment, I think that we have reason to believe that
there's going to be progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said a meeting of the regional Southern African Development
Community would be held to try to work out a cease-fire deal and a
framework for the withdrawal of all foreign forces in Congo. He
gave no date for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Kagame spoke a day after the Congolese rebel leader Ernest Wamba
dia Wamba said Ugandan and Rwandan troops were helping his rebels
fight Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who control large areas of eastern Congo, have
repeatedly called for direct talks with Kabila _ whose forces have
been reinforced by soldiers from Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe and
Chad. But Kabila has refused, saying that there is no substantial
rebel movement, only Rwandan and Ugandan troops.

MEXICAN CITY SEEKS HELP BECAUSE OF RISE IN VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ A wave of violence spawned by the drug
trade has prompted the mayor of this border city to seek state help
to counter attacks on the ill-equipped police force, including the
recent execution of two officers and the apparent abduction of two
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned about this lack of respect,'' Mayor Marcos
Garcia said Thursday at City Hall. ``Naturally, a border city will
have problems with drug traffickers. They aren't attacking
citizens, but we consider this the time to be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he had asked the governor of the state of Tamaulipas
to send in more police officers, and is seeking investigative
assistance from the Mexican army.
</P>
<P>
   Nuevo Laredo also needs money to arm its own officers, the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two officers were killed in late October when attackers armed
with AK-47 assault rifles shredded their patrol car with gunfire.
Two other police officers haven't been seen in almost a month and
are believed to have been kidnapped by drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest violence came Tuesday when the windows of a police
commander's car were shot out, though no one was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no arrests in connection with the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   The police vowed they would not be intimidated by what they
believe are efforts of international drug smuggling cartels to
scare them off the job and control this city of more than 200,000
people. The city has long served as a gateway for smuggling cocaine
and marijuana into neighboring Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is that someone has something against the
police,'' said Ricardo Gloria de la Garza, a spokesman for the
Nuevo Laredo police. ``We are professional officers. We will not be
intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   A heavily armed team is being created to defend officers, and
the city is exploring ways to purchase weapons for a police force
that is so poor some officers don't even have handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The violence erupted after the national police confiscated about
$1 million stashed in the ceiling of a tractor-trailer rig and, in
a separate seizure, 1,000 pounds of cocaine in early October. The
drugs and cash were taken to a federal building where they were
guarded by a ring of soldiers before being transferred to military
custody.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary information shows Nuevo Laredo is caught in a battle
between the Arrellano Felix cartel, based in Tijuana, near San
Diego; and the cartel formerly headed by Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
which is based in Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who succeed control certain parts of the river and
probably have tremendous influence over police,'' said Leonard
Lindheim, head of U.S. Customs Service investigations for South
Texas. ``The drug business is a dangerous business. The price for
crossing these people is a piece of lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Events in Nuevo Laredo still are less brutal than the carnage in
Juarez, where dozens of people have been killed in machine-gun
attacks in bars, restaurants and on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Other incidents that may be connected to the drug violence in
Nuevo Laredo are the death of an attorney whose body was found
along a highway in early October, and the shooting of a Laredo,
Texas, man in late October.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan was a member of the state National Guard and had
worked with the Customs Service during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Agustin Dovalina, chief of the Laredo police, said his officers
were on alert because of the violence across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may spill over, it may not. So far we've been lucky,'' he
said. ``It could happen at any time. I don't want to put the
community on alert. Violence can happen at any time.''

   GOMA, Congo _ The dusty stalls and roadside shops are open until
late afternoon now, and people are less afraid to wander out after
dark. But learning to live with the second rebellion here in two
years is not the same as loving it, as Gilbert Kombi, an unemployed
cabdriver, bluntly pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The troops who are soldiers in this rebellion are corrupt,''
he said the other day. ``In reality this is a foreigners'
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kombi's suspicion of foreign influence _ that the insurrection
is led by Rwanda and Uganda _ is widespread in Goma, the rebels'
home base. But it only partly explains what the leaders of the
three-month-old uprising against President Laurent Kabila
acknowledge is one of their highest hurdles: despite recent
military victories, they are not popular here.
</P>
<P>
   The mood is much different from last year, when Kabila's forces
marched from this eastern city across the country to Kinshasa, the
capital, and were greeted by crowds jubilant at ending 32 years of
dictatorship under Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
   This time people express skepticism, war-weariness and outright
hostility at another rebellion when the last one, many Congolese
say, produced so little to improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that people have received the war with
reservations,'' said Lunda Bululu, a prime minister when this
country was called Zaire and now a top rebel in the year-old state
of Congo. Other rebel leaders are equally, perhaps surprisingly,
frank, even as they say the public will soon embrace their vision
for rebuilding Congo.
</P>
<P>
   But people around Goma show few signs of appreciating their
honesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a first liberation,'' said a 21-year-old woman, a
law student at the Free University for the Great Lakes Countries,
who would not give her name for fear of reprisals from rebel
soldiers. ``Two years later there is a second liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering,'' she asked, ``they are coming to liberate who
and why?''
</P>
<P>
   The war that began in early August is only the most recent
violence in the area around Goma, a city nestled between Lake Kivu
and a rumbling volcano, which is equal parts beautiful and
tumultuous.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Mobutu's soldiers looted the city. Three years later
hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu, some leaders of the
massacres of their Tutsi countrymen, fled Rwanda and filled refugee
camps north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1996 the Tutsi-led government of Rwanda attacked the
camps, setting in motion a rebellion led by Tutsi soldiers allied
with Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   That past helps explain the present: Kabila, who purged the
Tutsi from Congo's leadership after he took power last year, has
now cast this rebellion as a Tutsi invasion from Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels accuse Kabila of stirring the ethnic hatred that many
Congolese feel for the Tutsi. At minimum, Kabila seems to have
tapped a vein of nationalism that has bolstered the public's own
tepid feelings about him.
</P>
<P>
   Kombi, the cabdriver, said he liked Kabila, not so much for what
he had accomplished, but ``because he is Congolese, like me.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been no fighting here except a brief attack in
September by Hutu militiamen allied with Kabila. But residents say
hardship shows itself everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   For the rich, it became impossible until the last few days to
make international phone calls. Commercial airline service stopped.
</P>
<P>
   For the masses in the city of 300,000 people _ perhaps 10
percent of whom are refugees from the fighting _ it has become
dangerous to travel too far out of Goma. The only way to get
messages to families in Kinshasa is through the International
Committee of the Red Cross, and every morning at 8 a.m. people line
up to write brief, censored letters across the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Life is more expensive. Gasoline went from $2.25 a gallon to
more than $3. The produce at a market in the town center is sparse
and expensive. Rotten tomatoes are sold at one table because, the
vendor said, it is too dicey to bring fresh produce from the
countryside. One 38-year-old shopper held a bag stuffed with two
cabbages that he said cost triple the usual price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like vegetables,'' the man said. ``If I had more
money, I would buy meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The man said he was afraid to give his name, as were most people
interviewed here _ many of whom said they knew of kidnappings and
cases of intimidation by the young, well-armed soldiers stationed
around the city.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leaders have acknowledged what they say are isolated
kidnappings, which they say they neither knew about nor condoned.
In an interview, the rebels' military commander, Jean-Pierre
Ondekane, made a point of saying soldiers who misbehaved would be
dealt with severely.
</P>
<P>
   ``My soldiers know if they rape or loot they will be killed,''
Ondekane said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel leaders say that for the moment the lack of public support
has not hindered their military drive. They have claimed a string
of victories in the last several weeks in the country's east and
say they have broader support outside Goma's region, Kivu, which is
particularly divided among ethnic lines. They also boast of not
having to put down any uprisings in the towns they hold.
</P>
<P>
   But they say they have much work to do to convince people. They
have held many meetings with tribal leaders, students and other
groups, and they say people will soon come around, especially if
they continue to win territory.
</P>
<P>
   Their pitch is simple: that Kabila did not deliver the democracy
he promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``After two years he has done as much bad as Mobutu,'' said
Bululu, one of the rebel leaders. ``That we must explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Motindo, 28, a student from Kinshasa, said he had
attended one of those meetings and was won over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need democracy,'' he said. ``Mobutu was a dictator. We
don't need another dictator.'' He even signed up to help spread the
word, but quit not long afterward, when he realized he could not
afford to stay in Goma these days unless he was paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry to say that,'' Motindo said. ``If you are doing
something for your country you shouldn't do it for money. But it is
very hard.''

NETANYAHU SUSPENDS ACCORD DISCUSSION AFTER CAR BOMB KILLS TWO 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A car bomb exploded in a crowded outdoor market here
Friday, killing two Palestinian suicide bombers and casting new
doubt on Israeli ratification of a new peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had been meeting
with his 17-member Cabinet to endorse the Wye agreement signed last
month with the Palestinians, suspended discussion of the accord
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The attack increased the already heavy pressure on Yasser Arafat
and the Palestinian Authority to rein in Islamic militant groups
such as Hamas who have been seeking to sabotage the accords.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and other Palestinians immediately condemned the attack
and called on Israel not to use it as a pretext for not putting the
agreement into action. Arafat even made a rare appearance on
Israeli television, terming the bombings ``criminal'' and appealing
to the Israeli people for understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli police said that Hamas had claimed responsibility for
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said a red Fiat exploded about 10 a.m. at the entrance
to the Mehane Yehuda market, a popular downtown shopping spot,
minutes after Israeli border police had tried to prevent it from
entering the market's narrow alleyways.
</P>
<P>
   One police officer ran ahead and warned shoppers that a
suspicious car had refused to stop, sending people running for
cover just as the bomb went off and possibly preventing greater
casualties, witnesses said. At least 25 people were injured. One
woman suffered a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a burst of fire,'' said Shimon Kadiro, a 41-year-old
Israeli who said he saw the explosion from his bakery about 40
yards from the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started to run. The heat from the fire came all the way
here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have been a lot more injuries if the border
policeman hadn't warned everyone,'' said Jacob Shaw, a 25-year-old
ultra-Orthodox shopper dressed in a black hat and coat, who saw the
explosion. ``But in this case, everyone ran away.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry crowds gathered afterward shouting ``death to Arafat'' and
``death to the Arabs'' as police, ambulances and politicians
descended on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody is trying to destroy the peace process between us and
the Palestinians,'' Israel's Public Security Minister Avigdor
Kahalani told Israel Radio, speaking at the market shortly after
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Cabinet, in its second day of deliberations over the
Wye agreement, said it would not meet to endorse the agreement
until the Palestinians began an ``all-out war'' against Hamas
militants, a decision likely to further complicate the ratification
of an agreement that is already a week late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israeli government will meet again to discuss the
agreement after it is satisfied that the Palestinian Authority is
taking intensive steps for an all-out war against the terrorist
groups and their infrastructure,'' said Dani Naveh, the Cabinet
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright expressed their sympathy but urged Netanyahu and
Arafat not to let it break their resolve to carry the process
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be clear that we condemn the criminal attack aimed at
destroying the peace process,'' Arafat said during his television
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis and Palestinians must fight together against such
actions which compromise the peace process. We are obliged by the
Wye Plantation agreement to hunt down the terrorists and arrest
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian leader said he had spoken to Netanyahu of the
``deep pain'' he had felt over the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that the Palestinian security services will make a
100 percent effort against terrorism and that we are hoping for 100
percent success,'' he told Israeli viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Until the bombing, the Cabinet had appeared poised to pass the
Wye accord, which will put an additional 13 percent of West Bank
territory under Palestinian control in return for specific
Palestinian security measures.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had predicted the vote would come in at nine in favor
and four opposed with four abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that majority looks less secure. ``In this situation, I
cannot vote'' for the agreement, Silvan Shalom, a Likud party
member, told Israel Radio's English program.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's postponement came after a week of setbacks that some
analysts said foretold the difficulties to come when the two sides,
ever at odds over the precise wording, try to implement the accord.
Netanyahu had already postponed the vote on two accounts prior to
Friday's delay.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said the Palestinians had not shared with him a
security blueprint for combating terrorism and, second, he said
they had not provided a timetable for arresting 30 wanted
Palestinian fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   Neither move on the Palestinian part is explicitly required by
the Wye accords.
</P>
<P>
   This latest delay may throw off a meticulously laid out
timetable during which Israel is to complete three land transfers
in three months in return for Palestinian actions such as
confiscating illegal weapons, arresting wanted men and restating
their commitment to nullify clauses of the Palestine Charter
offensive to Israel. The first land transfer was to take place on
Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, an outspoken champion of the
peace accords, said he hoped the Cabinet would not delay for long
the ratification of the Wye deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the immediate conclusion of some people is to bury (the
agreement), no, I am for the government of Israel to decide
Saturday, or Sunday, Monday or Tuesday that it is implementing what
it signed,'' he told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's bombing was the second since the Wye accords were
signed at the White House on Oct. 23rd and the third since
peacemakers convened at the Wye River conference center in Maryland
to negotiate the deal.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the second time in just over a year that the Mehane
Yehuda market was the target. In July 1997, two Palestinian suicide
bombers blew themselves up only yards away from where this latest
explosion left a mangled heap of car metal and pools of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Yeffet Mordechai, a 30-year-old spice vendor whose shop is
sandwiched between the two bombing sites, saw both explosions. His
father, Nachum, 65, said he's seen six or seven attacks in this
market since he opened his shop years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never believed in this peace,'' said the younger Mordechai,
standing over bins of saffron and cumin. ``It's not a matter of
politics. It's a matter of hatred, enmity between two peoples.'' &QL;

   NEW DELHI _ India and Pakistan, the world's two newest nuclear
powers, failed Friday to make progress toward peace in the one
place where their armies are now killing each other: a wretched,
freezing, thin-aired border spot 24,000 feet above sea level known
as the Siachen Glacier.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years, the two enemies, both claiming this 48-mile-long
ice floe, have been heaving artillery and mortar fire at each other
through the piercing winds. Military reports often tell of a
handful of soldiers dying in the crossfire, though these casualties
are said to be only half of those lost to frostbite, avalanches and
fatal slips into deep crevices.
</P>
<P>
   In a hopeful meeting in New York on Sept. 23, the prime
ministers of the two nations had laid the groundwork for sessions
to soothe bellicose tensions. But the first round of talks last
month in Islamabad produced little conciliation, and now the second
one, here in New Delhi, is proving even more discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who occupy the high ground on the glacier, hoped to
assume the same position in negotiations by offering a cease-fire.
The Pakistanis rejected this because it did not include the
withdrawal of troops from their adversary's favorable positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you get by freezing a situation in conflict?'' asked a
Pakistani diplomat who spoke to reporters on the condition of
anonymity. ``What kind of peace and tranquility will you get if all
the troops remain?''
</P>
<P>
   During a similar news conference, one of India's lead
negotiators, Lt. Gen. I.K. Verma, was unusually candid in answering
such questions. Though a written statement said a cease-fire might
be a first step toward a ``disengagement'' and ``redeployment,''
the general declared: ``This is our area. We are in control of it.
We dominate the area, and they are telling us to vacate it and
everything will be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   The very idea made him indignant. ``This is our nation's
frontiers, and to us it is sacrosanct, and if there is a threat to
it, we have to take appropriate measures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the glacier sits in a kind of icy netherworld within
the Karakoram Mountains, wedged between India, China and
Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. For a long time, the matter of who owned
it was secondary to the question of who would want it.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, Pakistan began encouraging foreign
mountaineers to go exploring there. In time, Indian troops began to
venture up the steep ridges as well. One of their discoveries were
maps of Pakistan that included territories _remote though they
might be _ that more fittingly belonged to India. This alleged
land-grabbing through map-making became known as ``cartographic
aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought three wars against each other
since they were separated at birth in 1947. Two of the wars were
over rival claims to Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   While these hostilities came and went in huge flare-ups, the
fighting in the Siachen Glacier has hung on like a low-grade fever.
Both sides are believed to have about 3,000 troops in the fray. By
some estimates, India spends anywhere between $1 million to $4
million per day to maintain its hold on the steepest perches.
</P>
<P>
   The arduousness of the Indian effort on the world's highest and
coldest battlefield is the stuff of legend here _ how temperatures
dip to 50 below zero, how the mind plays tricks on a man at such
extraordinary altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic importance of the glacier is something else again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its military value has been debated for years, but its chief
importance is symbolic,'' said Uday Bhaskar, deputy director of a
defense think tank in New Delhi. ``It radiates on a national level,
the way it would be a big deal for the United States if Mexico was
trying to cheat it of a meaningless piece of desert.''
</P>
<P>
   The dubious importance and colossal expense of the Siachen
dispute led some to speculate that the two sides might find this a
reasonable place for compromise. The issue had been the subject of
talks six times before 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to reach a Siachen agreement Friday, however,
followed a failure to settle a relatively minor disagreement about
water on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost any glow of optimism, the talks will continue for
another week, moving on to matters like maritime boundaries and
drug trafficking.

 &HT;    SKETCHES OF A CROP OF CHALLENGERS FOR GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects number of Livingston terms to 11 in penultimate
graf of his thumbnail, which is condensed from a story moved
Thursday. Corrects McCrery's status as ``potential'' challenger in
lede of his thumbnail .
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are personality sketches of Republican House
members who have declared their candidacy for, or interest in,
running for leadership positions in the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   BOB LIVINGSTON
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, few doubt that Bob Livingston is tough enough
for the job of House speaker, for which he declared his candidacy
Friday. At 6 feet, 5 inches in height, the 55-year-old conservative
is an imposing figure.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for a fast and fiery temper. Congressional
Quarterly's ``Politics in America'' describes a 1995 incident when
Livingston nearly came to blows with an aide to Rep. Pat Roberts,
R-Kan., then the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some son of a bitch on your staff has been saying bad stuff
about my staff to the press and I'm tired of it,'' Livingston
reportedly told Roberts before being physically restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is not without a sense of humor, albeit one that is
sometimes pointedly political. On his first day as chairman,
Livingston came to an Appropriations Committee meeting armed with a
machete and a alligator-skinning knife _ ready to cut the federal
budget. In 1993, he wore a clown's hat and a red plastic nose to
ridicule what he called a ``goofy'' Democratic bill to change
campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   As a three-term chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he
holds the federal purse strings and can help Republican colleagues
with funding for projects in their home districts. His position
also is a magnet for hopeful political contributors, so he channels
campaign funds to needy Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1977, Livingston has represented the First
District of Louisiana for
</P>
<P>
   11 terms. Born in Colorado, Livingston grew up in New Orleans.
His parents divorced with he was 7, and he and a younger sister
were reared by their mother. After dropping out of Tulane
University, Livingston joined the Navy. After his hitch ended, he
married in 1965 and returned to Tulane to earn a bachelor's degree
and then to graduate from law school.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to the former Bonnie Robichaux, and they have four
children.
</P>
<P>
   STEVE LARGENT
</P>
<P>
   Steve Largent is ready for the next chapter in his all-American
life.
</P>
<P>
   When he was born in Tulsa, Okla., 43 years ago, a nurse put a
toy football in his hospital crib. Sure enough, that blue-eyed baby
grew up to be a Hall of Fame wide receiver for the Seattle
Seahawks. ``People'' magazine proclaimed him one of its ``50 Most
Beautiful People in the World'' and Wheaties put his face on a
cereal box. He's been married to his high school sweetheart for 23
years and is devoted to their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an easy re-election to a third term as a Republican
congressman, Largent has decided to take on Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, in a battle over the leadership and direction of
the House.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are hardly new for Largent. After attending the
University of Tulsa on a football scholarship, he was deemed too
small and too slow for the National Football League. He signed as a
free agent with the Seahawks and retired 14 years later with the
NFL career records for receptions, receiving yards and touchdown
catches.
</P>
<P>
   After working for several years as a marketing consultant and
appearing in TV commercials, he ran for Congress in 1994 as a
Christian conservative promising ``my faith, my family and my
values will give me the strength to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he has stubbornly set his own course _ voting
against the 1997 GOP budget deal and sparking headlines by
denouncing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE RADANOVICH
</P>
<P>
   A banker by trade, George Radanovich long dreamed of setting up
a winery amid the fertile fields and rolling pastures of
California's Central Valley. So in 1983, while working days as an
assistant bank manager, he founded the first winery in his native
Mariposa County. Each year, Radanovich Winery now produces several
thousand cases of sauvignon blanc, merlot and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   The vintner, meanwhile, has turned his attention from grapes to
the GOP. First elected to Congress in 1994, Radanovich is
challenging Rep. John Boehner of Ohio to be chairman of the House
Republican Conference, the caucus of all GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Croatian immigrants, Radanovich is an avowed
conservative who believes cutting taxes and easing environmental
restrictions on farmers and ranchers are keys to economic growth.
He wants to limit the scope of both the federal government and the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Cal Tech graduate with a degree in agriculture business
management, the 43-year-old Radanovich is married to the former
Ethie Weaver, and the couple has one child.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER DUNN
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins the Republican rebellion, Jennifer Dunn of
Washington is unlikely to lose her position as the highest-ranking
woman in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   All sides know the party can't afford an all-male top team.
After her election as vice chairman of the House Republican
Conference in 1996, Dunn declared the vote ``a validation of the
fact a woman has a place not only in the Republican Party but in
the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Active in GOP politics since the 1960s, Dunn is a Stanford
graduate, a former IBM systems engineer and divorced mother of two
grown sons (one of whom is named Reagan). In 1992, she was elected
to Congress from a district made up mostly of Seattle's affluent
suburbs and has sought to put a kinder face on her party since her
arrival in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a proponent of softening our rhetoric,''
she said before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a steadfast supporter of Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., who in return has backed her rise in the Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally conservative and pro-business, she has supported free
trade policies that benefit exporters around Seattle and policies
to advance Microsoft and other high-tech industries in her
district.
</P>
<P>
   JIM McCRERY
</P>
<P>
   Grits vs. Gumbo? Not really. In the fight for the chairmanship
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, incumbent Rep.
John Linder of Georgia is no good ol' boy, and his potential
challenger, Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, is no Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   While Linder grew up in Minnesota, though, McCrery was reared
amid the piney woods and oil refineries of northern Louisiana _ a
strait-laced Protestant region more akin to Alabama than to the
free-rolling Catholic bayous of southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from Shreveport, McCrery has been both a social and
fiscal conservative since he left his job as a regional manager for
Georgia-Pacific Corp. in 1988 to win election to Congress. He is a
steadfast opponent of abortion and a supporter of gun owners'
rights and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In his votes, he has been generally loyal to the GOP leadership,
although he voted against the 1990 tax increase backed by the Bush
administration and questioned the $500-per-child tax credit in the
1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
   McCrery, 49, is a graduate of Louisiana Tech and the Louisiana
State University law school. He is married to the former Johnette
Hawkins, and the couple has two children.

`A KNIGHT IN CAMELOT': WHOOPI GOLDBERG VISITS KING ARTHUR'S COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(bl) 
 By WILLIAM McDONALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though the story has been updated repeatedly on film, the basic
plot of ``A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court'' has
remained intact: a present-day Everyman (or Everywoman) is whisked
back in time to give the Arthurians, for better or for worse, a
taste of modern life. What changes with each film is ever-advancing
modern life.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest movie based on Mark Twain's classic, Whoopi
Goldberg arrives with what appears to be an armful of merchandise
from Nobody Beats the Wiz, and soon has Camelot doing the twist.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, for one brief, silly moment on Sunday night, toward the
merciful end of ``A Knight in Camelot'' on ABC, Sir Lancelot and
the rest of the Round Table legends drop their shining-armor
routine and get down to the sound of Chubby Checker, belting out
his 1960 hit from a boom box. ``A boom box?'' says Sir Sagramour.
``Yeah, it's a musical thing,'' Ms. Goldberg replies weakly, here
playing Vivien Morgan, a Connecticut physicist who is blasted back
to A.D. 589 when an experiment misfires.
</P>
<P>
   Probably no story has had more incarnations on film and
television than Twain's comic fantasy. The count is now no fewer
than seven, including two previous Disney attempts. Why Disney
thought it was time for another go is anybody's guess. Even casting
a black female in the lead role has been done before.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the charitable explanation is that an updated
``Connecticut Yankee'' offers irresistible possibilities for
culture-clash comedy and fresh social comment. Twain knew how to
till that fertile ground. The trick for lesser hands, though, is to
avoid easy and obvious laughs on the one hand, and sentimental
moralizing on the other.
</P>
<P>
   This new Disney movie falls into both traps. Potentially rich
moments for satire are too often wasted on predictable sight gags
and tired wisecracks. And when the time comes for a heart-to-heart
with the feudalists, the sermons start. (Ms. Goldberg to King
Arthur, played sturdily by Michael York: ``We believe that if we
give people the tools, like love and honor and loyalty and
forgiveness, they can make their lives better.'')
</P>
<P>
   Even after casting Ms. Goldberg as a dreadlocked alien among
ruddy-faced Angles, Disney passes on mining that racial vein.
General comments are made about the evils of slavery, but only a
page boy seems to notice that Ms. Goldberg is of a pigment that
Camelot has never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``A Knight in Camelot'' may not be intended to bear
much scrutiny; at 7 p.m., it's for children, after all. And if, by
adult standards, the acting of Ms. Goldberg is a bit hammy or, in
the case of Amanda Donohoe as Guinevere and James Coombes as
Lancelot, a little stiff, it may be amusing enough to a young
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But with Ms. Goldberg using a laptop computer to avoid the
executioner's block, the children won't be getting a fair measure
of the Twain tale, anyway. Besides, Chubby Checker may seem as
dated to them as Sir Galahad.

   NY-DEEJAY (New York) _ Mark Ronson, of the East Hampton and
Central Park West Ronsons, is the most prominent club deejay at a
moment when deejays are the latest nightlife celebrities. Absolut,
which is one of many marketers exploiting the trend, did a survey
that found ``the cool people weren't going to see bands, they were

   TV-VIEW (Undated) _ After a slow start in its first season,
``The View's'' ratings in the past few months have jumped by 50
percent among traditional daytime viewers _ young mothers, older
people and the unemployed. But what's even more surprising is that
in New York it has gained something of a cult following, watched in
gyms and coffee shops, and taped for later viewing by many folk who
are not traditional day-time watchers. By Nancy Hass. (With a

   SMOKING-GURU (Undated) _ Call directory assistance in
Massachusetts and ask for ``the mad Russian'' and chances are
they'll know who you're trying to reach. Address an envelope with
the same name and the Boston post office knows where to deliver it:
a brownstone in Brookline, whose stoop is often crowded with
smokers furiously puffing away, before entering the offices of
Yefim Shubentsov, 58, a Soviet emigre renowned for curing nicotine
slaves of their cravings in an hour. By Dany Levy.

<P>
   ELBAZ-FASHION (Undated) _ You might call Alber Elbaz, 37, the
Woody Allen of fashion, so frequently does he indulge in
self-deprecating humor. He is one of a number of Americans _
including Tom Ford at Gucci, Michael Kors at Celine, Marc Jacobs at
Louis Vuitton and Narciso Rodriguez at Loewe _ who have assumed
titles at moribund European fashion houses, infusing them with new
life. By Elizabeth Hayt. (With a photo.)

NEW ATTACK POINTS UP PROBLEMS OF MIDEAST MILITANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ At a news conference in Gaza last month the leader
of the militant Islamic movement Hamas, Sheik Ahmad Yassin, made an
uncharacteristic admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our military wing is encountering many difficulties,'' he
said, ``mainly as a result of American-Israeli-Palestinian
cooperation hindering the activity of Hamas fighters.''
</P>
<P>
   Such difficulties, faced by Hamas and its militant twin, the
Islamic Holy War, seemed evident in the bombing in a market here on
Friday that may have been the work of either group. A relatively
small primitively rigged charge was packed in a car that apparently
caught fire before the explosion, giving the police precious
moments to remove scores of intended victims.
</P>
<P>
   The close call followed one last week in the Gaza Strip, where a
car bomber who was trying to hit an Israeli school bus detonated
the bomb prematurely near an Israeli army jeep, killing himself and
a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   The limited effects of the two bombings, in comparison with
devastating suicide attacks by Hamas and Islamic Holy War that
killed scores of Israelis in recent years, may have been simply a
matter of chance.
</P>
<P>
   The bombers did succeed in penetrating Israeli security cordons
around Jerusalem and Palestinian checkpoints in the Gaza Strip to
reach their targets.
</P>
<P>
   They also managed to rig their bombs in the teeth of a sustained
anti-terrorism effort by both the Israeli and the Palestinian
security forces, including a Palestinian crackdown after the
signing of the Wye River accord two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli public security minister, Avigdor Kahalani,
acknowledged Friday that bombers could never be entirely stopped,
no matter how tight the security net. ``This is mission
impossible,'' Kahalani said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Israeli security officials and analysts suggested that
the bungled bombings might reflect problems in recruitment and
resources faced by militant Islamic groups, which have been
battered in recent months by the Israeli and Palestinian security
forces, at times working together with the help of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   In March a top bomb maker for Hamas, Muhyi a-Din al-Sharif, was
found dead after a mysterious explosion in the Palestinian-governed
town of Ramallah. In September, Israeli soldiers shot and killed
Adel Awadallah, considered by the Israelis to have been the
commander of the Hamas military wing in the West Bank. His brother
and assistant, Imad Awadallah, was also killed.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks later two Hamas members were arrested by the
Palestinian security services in Gaza as they tried to enter
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Several bomb laboratories and weapons caches have been found in
recent months by the Palestinian police, at times acting on
information supplied by the Israelis. Both Israeli and Palestinian
security officials say they have thwarted an undisclosed number of
planned attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hamas appears to be having some sort of problem in its ability
to carry out impressive attacks,'' said Yaakov Perry, who headed
the Shin Bet security service of Israel from 1988 to 1995. ``Either
they don't have the ability to manufacture and supply explosives or
they have an internal organizational problem, which is apparently
having an effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the outcome of the bombing on Friday may have been a
stroke of bad fortune for whichever group carried out the attack,
``it indicates the poor quality of the people who carried it out,''
Perry said, ``both those who manufactured the charges and those who
took them _ a decline in operational capability.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the latest attacks teen-agers were used, indicating a lack
of older volunteers for suicide missions. Witnesses described the
bombers here as slightly built, having the appearance of boys. The
bomber in Gaza was identified as a high school student aged 19.
</P>
<P>
   But Perry acknowledged that the perception of a disabled Hamas
could change if the group managed, despite the rising obstacles
facing it, to carry out another spectacular attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be guarded in our assessment,'' he said, ``because
this could all blow up in our face.''

   MIDEAST-ISRAEL (Jerusalem) _ A red Fiat belching smoke sent
shoppers fleeing moments before it exploded outside a bustling
marketplace this morning, killing the two bombers and wounding 24
other people. The Israeli Cabinet immediately suspended
deliberations on the Wye peace memorandum, calling on Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to prove he was cracking down on
terrorism. By Deborah Sontag.

<P>
   RUSSIA-FOOD (Moscow) _ The burning question for the Kremlin
these days is not the future of capitalism, the lack of a national

fast approaching, this nation is locked in a primordial struggle to
feed its citizens and prevent them from freezing. By Michael R.
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   LA-EDWARDS-INDICT (Baton Rouge) _ After more than two years of
investigation, a federal grand jury Friday indicted former Gov.
Edwin W. Edwards of Louisiana, his son Stephen, and four associates
in a far-reaching racketeering conspiracy aimed at extorting
millions of dollars from businessmen seeking to win lucrative
riverboat casino licenses in Louisiana. By Kevin Sack.
</P>
<P>
   NY-MOYNIHAN-RETIRE _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., the
academic-turned-politician whose career spanned five decades and
included work in four presidents' administrations, surprised New
York's political establishment Friday by announcing that he would
not run for re-election when his fourth term ends in 2000. By James
Dao.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-LEADERSHIP (Washington) _ Touting himself as a pragmatist
and a manager, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana, the chairman of
one of the most powerful committees in Congress, announced Friday
that he is running for Speaker of the House, seeking to topple
Speaker Newt Gingrich, whose hard-edged oratory and confrontational
tactics propelled the Republican Party from minority status to
control of the Capitol. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   REPUBS-GINGRICH (Washington) _ Not so long ago, Newt Gingrich
was the saviour who brought the Republican party back into the
majority. Now he's being blamed for election losses that some fear
will push the party into the minority. He's had near-death
experiences before, but this time Gingrich's troubles run very
deep. By Alison Mitchell.

   BKN-LABOR-KIDSREACT (New York) _ By the calendar at least,
basketball loyalists should be tethered to their televisions,
trying to glimpse the latest moves, newest phenoms and hottest
highlights of the National Basketball Association. But this season,
a high-stakes labor battle between the NBA's more than 400 players
and 29 team owners has already canceled 194 games in November and
is threatening to call off the entire schedule. On the basketball
courts and public playgrounds of New York City, which have launched
legions of basketball dreamers _ and more than a few NBA stars _
hardcore fans of all ages are directing sharp words at both the
players and the owners. Many fans say they have heard enough to
know this much: basketball is disintegrating into a game of greed.

   ISRAEL-BOMBING _ JERUSALEM _ A suicide car bomb exploded Friday
in a Jerusalem market crowded with Israelis shopping for the
Sabbath. The blast killed two and wounded 21. It also prompted
Israel's Cabinet, which had already delayed been dragging its feet
on implementation of a new peace accord with the Palestinians, to
suspend it. The Islamic militant group Hamas, which has been trying
to sabotage the peace accord, claimed responsibility for the attack
in the Mahane Yehuda market, police said. Israel TV said the two
dead were the assailants, and not Israelis. Developing. (Kaplow,

   SHEINFELD _ As a teenager growing up in Kefar Sava, a town some
20 kilometers northwest of Tel Aviv, Israel, he heard Scud missiles
go across his house and destroy parts of nearby neighborhoods
during the Persian Gulf War. A few years later _ playing for the
18-and-under Israeli national basketball team that was touring
Europe _ he ended up at a game in Mannheim, Germany, where a mob of
skinhead thugs outside the gym jeered him and his teammates,
shouting, as he called it, ``threats and Nazi trash talk.'' And
just a couple of years ago, he found himself on nighttime patrol
along the streets of the conflict-torn Gaza Strip. Yet, for

Many also seem disposed by ibogaine to enter psychotherapy,

ibogaine also eliminates hunger for cocaine, nicotine, alcohol and
amphetamines. A University of Miami researcher foresees an
addiction ``patch'' that would use ibogaine or some active portion
of it to help people leave their cravings behind forever. But a
nasty court fight between the University of Miami and the original
discoverer of ibogaine, former Beat Generation heroin addict Howard
Lotsof, over rights to the drug has stalled FDA-sanctioned human
trials. Addicts who believe it will work for them are forced to
either of to two off-shore ibogaine ``clinics,'' one linked to the
University of Miami scientists and the other run by Lotsof.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Gingrich's fall may be as fast as his rise
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday's election did not end the culture war that has split
this nation. But it does ensure that for the time being, that war
will be contained within the confines of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the battle will swirl around the imperial figure of
House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who ascended to the speaker's
chair four years ago with astonishing speed, may fall from that
lofty post just as quickly. It was just only Monday night that he
was predicting a minimum Republican gain of 10 seats in the House,
with a maximum of 30. In the Senate, he boasted, the Republicans
would pick up between two and six seats.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify that optimism. In midterm congressional
elections, the party out of the White House had historically done
very well. Not since 1934 had a presidential party actually picked
up seats in such an election. And this year, the Republicans had
the added advantage of running against a Democratic president
seemingly crippled by a sex scandal and impeachment probe.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't turn out as Gingrich predicted. On Tuesday, the
Republicans lost five seats in the House and gained none in the
Senate. And from there, events moved quickly. By Wednesday morning
Republicans were sniping at each one another through the press, and
by Friday _ less than four days after Gingrich's prediction of
golden days ahead _ civil war had broken out. U.S. Rep. Robert
Livingston of Louisiana announced that he would challenge Gingrich
for the speaker's job, and Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma announced
he would take on Rep. Dick Armey of Texas for the job of majority
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Their alleged crime? Believe it or not, insufficient fervor in
the conservative cause.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents believe that say Republicans would have fared
better had Gingrich and Armey made the election a referendum on gay
rights, school prayer, affirmative action and other issues relating
to ``family values.'' They also argue that Gingrich should have
forced President Clinton to accept large tax cuts during last
month's budget negotiations, even if that meant risking another
government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans took a different, more sober lesson from
Tuesday's defeat. Some heard it not as a rebuke to moderation, but
as a rejection of the party's increasingly right-wing conservative
agenda. Gingrich is among that number, describing his opponents
this week as ``people who would in fact take the party to a
narrower base with fewer members.''
</P>
<P>
   To many people, the sight of Gingrich being attacked for excess
moderation comes as a shock. But he's always been a man defined by
a complex interplay of emotion and logic. Intellectually, he has
sided with the moderates because he knows that's where the votes
are and where the work gets done. But emotionally, he likes to side
with the bomb-throwers because that's where the fun is. His career
over the past few years has been a slow transition in which his
intellectual side, aided by the sobering reality of power, won out.
</P>
<P>
   It's a maturing process that many other congressional
Republicans have yet to experience.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and his fellow moderates _ what a strange phrase _ have
a powerful argument on their side. Trying gamely to find something
positive on election night, Gingrich cited the strong performance
of GOP candidates for governor in important swing states. The sons
of President Bush, Jeb and George W., easily won races for governor
in Florida and Texas. Republicans also won races in Massachusetts
and New York, states where Republican members of Congress are
having a harder and harder time holding their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Those candidates won because they rejected the hard-right
emphasis on social issues and instead stressed their ability as
good managers. They came across as moderate, competent people who
see government as a legitimate tool for improving the lives of
Americans, and as a result they got elected.
</P>
<P>
   It's also instructive to note the states where the Republicans
lost. In Congress, they lost seats in Kansas, New Mexico,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Washington, all areas well outside the
South, where family values play best. It is hard to argue that
those races could have been won with a more conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, the Republicans also lost hard-fought races for
governor in Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia, the very heart of
Dixie. Even in the South, the hard-core, right-wing message doesn't
translate well on a statewide basis.
</P>
<P>
   And that confronts the Republicans with a real dilemma. The
election of 1994 that put the GOP into the majority in Congress is
looking more and more like a blip on the political screen, a
historical accident that could be reversed as early as the 2000
elections. The Republicans can avoid that fate only if they somehow
come to agreement on a platform more compelling than hating Bill
Clinton, hating government, distrusting minorities and opposing
abortion. And wresting such a platform from a party dominated by
groups such as the Christian Coalition will require some nasty
infighting.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for speaker is only the opening skirmish in that war.
The struggle will really intensify when candidates begin to
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. In his victory
speech Tuesday night, Gov. Bush of Texas was already trying out his
theme of ``compassionate conservativism,'' while Steve Forbes and
others were renewing their allegiance to the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, moderate candidates have had little or no chance in
Republican primaries, in races for state as well as national
office. In Georgia, GOP voters this year rejected state Sen. Chuck
Clay, a moderate from Cobb County, in favor of Mitch Skandalakis, a
hard-right, race-baiting conservative, as their party's candidate
for lieutenant governor. That choice proved to be a disaster. Two
years ago they rejected another Cobb moderate, Johnny Isakson, in
favor of the more conservative Guy Millner in the race for the U.S.
Senate. In the general election, Millner lost.
</P>
<P>
   In George Bush and Bob Dole, Republicans were blessed with
politicians whose many years of loyal service made them almost
inevitable picks for the nomination. Their presence saved the party
a fight for its identity. That generation of politicians has
retired, however, and the selection of the GOP candidate for 2000
will in many ways define the party for the next decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   The smart choice _ the electable choice _ would be someone like
George W. Bush. But the Republican Party as it currently exists may
not be not capable of making such a choice.

DEAR GOV. CELLUCCI ...

 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The auto columnist has been mulling a letter to the governor of
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Now that we know who the
governor will be come the new year, it's time to take pen in hand,
as they say, and let fly. Just so everybody knows, you can all look
over my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL; 
The Hon. Paul Cellucci &QL; 
Governor of Massachusetts &QL; 
State House &QL; 
 &QL; 
Dear Gov. Cellucci, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations on winning a close one and finally shedding that
``acting'' label. And my sympathy on being virtually the only
Republican up there in a sea of Democrats _ especially in view of
the way you folks have been mouthing off about one another. But
I've got something better than sympathy to offer, Guv; I've got the
issue to glue you people together in a common cause: saving
children's lives. Interested?
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to agree that saving young lives is certainly
nonpartisan _ it's a no-brainer. And my request for a course of
bipartisan action speaks to another of your pet issues, education,
particularly teacher qualification.
</P>
<P>
   While you guys have been fussing and fuming over SATs, reading
scores, and growing illiteracy (all vital issues), you have been
ignoring the most woefully underqualified class of teachers tending
to the most disgracefully inadequate curriculum that purports to
prepare young people for life-and-death decisions daily. I refer,
of course, to that most bitter of oxymorons, Driver Education.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, young people die needlessly on our highways, not
because no one cares, not because no one is doing anything, but
simply because no one is dealing with the real cause. Our children
are being issued license to drive without fundamental preparation,
without the knowledge to inform decisions, with no real
understanding of the machines with which they are to be entrusted.
</P>
<P>
   You've read the stories; you've seen the photos; you've
witnessed grieving parents.
</P>
<P>
   Guv, six hours in a car and 30 hours watching TV presentations
do not translate into driving preparedness. Where is the training
in proper braking technique, steering control? Where is the
discussion of physics of driving, the nature of skids? Where is the
practice in accident avoidance? Our kids are taught to parallel
park _ not exactly a life-and-death matter, even in Boston where
people occasionally still practice parallel parking, usually
parallel double parking.
</P>
<P>
   How come when the Commonwealth tests teachers, there are no
driver ed teachers being examined? But then who would test them?
And on what, where?
</P>
<P>
   So, Guv, what I'm proposing is a blue ribbon commission to find
the professionals (they're out there) to map a strategy, prepare a
curriculum, the men and women who can be the cadre to train the
trainers of our children. We desperately need to turn to driving
professionals to set the standards.
</P>
<P>
   The training facilities, by the way, are largely in place
already _ all those unused or under-used airports around the region
offer safe localesfor advanced training.
</P>
<P>
   This piece of the education pie can be bought on the cheap,
relatively speaking _ don't start whining about the cost of it
anyway lest I ask that embarrassing question: What's a
16-year-old's life worth in Massachusetts?
</P>
<P>
   And let's quit the bushwa about advanced training ``teaching
them how to misbehave on the highway.'' That's what I call the
``sex education'' argument. Knowledge does not incur risky
behavior, Guv. Ignorance does.
</P>
<P>
   Let's give them the tools to survive out there and cut down on
the number of grieving parents whose children never learned to cope
with hydroplaning or just steered ``in the direction of the skid''
as an incompetent driver ed teacher told them to do (you've got to
do more than that, Guv). There's a dividend, too. Well-trained
teens grow into well-trained adults.
</P>
<P>
   I know you care; I know the other pols up there care, too. So
let's do something that will really make a difference. Before some
more children ride ignorance to oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to discuss the matter, Guv, I'll buy lunch.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Sincerely, &QL; 
John R. White &QL;

THE BUSH BROTHERS REPRESENT NEW, IMPROVED REPUBLICAN PARTY: MORAL,
INCLUSIVE, COMPASSIONATE 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
 
By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ It's the new, improved Republican. Conservative but
compassionate, moral but not mean, inclusive not divisive. A
winner.
</P>
<P>
   On Election Day 1998, that optimistic package sold big for Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, an early front-runner for a GOP presidential
bid, and brother Jeb, governor-elect of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brothers focused on issues that appeal to
middle-of-the-road voters _ lower taxes, economic opportunity,
better schools for kids and personal responsibility. Both
successfully attracted greater numbers of minorities to their
moderate vision of conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're beginning to see here is the emergence of the new
Republican,`` said Robert Holsworth, director of the center for
public policy at Virginia Commonwealth University. ``Are you going
to fight a cultural civil war or are you going to include everybody
under one umbrella?''
</P>
<P>
   Republican politicians embraced by the social conservative wing
of the party, meanwhile, too often dwelled in the past to their
peril, analysts say. The White House sex-and-lies scandal might
have provided an entertaining diversion on television talk
circuits, but it turned voters off at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Weary from harsh rhetoric and the sting of fire-and-brimstone
politics, voters turned their backs on numerous favorites of social
conservatives Tuesday in upsets almost unimagined just weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, staunch Southern Republicans such as North Carolina
Sen. Launch Faircloth, Alabama Gov. Fob James and South Carolina
Gov. David Beasley were sent packing. In California, Democrats
successfully painted GOP candidates as out of touch to take back
the governor's mansion after 16 years and to return Barbara Boxer
to the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where Republicans swept the statewide slate in the
first such victory since Reconstruction, social conservatives in
the party failed to take over the State Board of Education, an
ideological battleground for curriculum standards, mandatory
testing and textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the (Republican) party has to move to the mainstream
if they're going to be successful, and the party has to show the
kind of compassion and tolerance that was demonstrated in the
campaigns of Governor Bush and Governor Bush,'' said Marlin
Fitzwater, White House press secretary in the Reagan and George
Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were able to reach out to Hispanics and other minorities.
They used plain language to explain their policies and programs in
terms people could understand how they would benefit from them.
They made it clear that they wanted government to be a source of
strength and support for the people of their states. I think those
are approaches Republicans need to emulate.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, Democrats found voters were turned off by social
conservatives' hot-button issues, particularly abortion, said
Leslie Goodman, a Sacramento-based political consultant with ties
to the George Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly say that there's a trend against
stridency,'' she said. ``I think the Democrats were very successful
in raising issues like abortion, particularly out here in
coordinated campaigns, to try to make it an issue so even those who
were not extremists got tagged.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into the cluster of social issues, you invariably
get into intolerance,'' she added. ``That's the piece that people
don't embrace. They don't like what I call in-your-face politics or
preacher politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a group called the Republican Leadership Council
is hoping to persuade the party to move away from its far-right
fringes. Its effort is patterned after the Democratic Leadership
Council's makeover of President Clinton in new, conservative
clothing after big congressional losses to Republican rebels in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   The RLC promptly issued a statement after the election
chastising the Republican Party for not heeding the results of its
national issues survey conducted in 77 swing congressional
districts last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the key to electoral victory is a strong
emphasis on fiscal issues, education and crime as opposed to
polarizing moral issues,'' said Mark Miller, executive director of
the group.``Our survey indicated, and the elections vindicated,
that Republicans can successfully compete with Democrats on
education issues and dominate on issues such as taxes, welfare and
crime. We lose when our dominating message is one of rigid
ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller added that the Bush brothers, along with New York Gov.
George Pataki, Kansas Gov. Bill Graves and Colorado Sen. Ben
Nighthorse Campbell all won decisive victories by campaigning on
conservative, but positive, themes.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, George W. Bush's appeal extended beyond traditional
party lines to bring in a large segment of female voters, much
higher percentages of Hispanic and African-American voters, as well
as traditional Democrats, some of them liberals. It translated into
a resounding 69 percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   In his acceptance speech, Bush referred to his own kinder,
gentler, conservative philosophy and why he thinks it works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says that a leader who is compassionate and conservative
can erase the gender gap, open the doors of the Republican Party to
new faces and new voices, and win without sacrificing our
principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It also provided long coattails that carried along Republican
candidates for statewide races whose own campaigns steered clear of
abortion, gay rights and school prayer. The White House scandal
remained conspicuously absent from high-dollar media campaigns of
the GOP's top candidates until a final advertising blitz led by the
national party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won every statewide race, which I think was a big
surprise,'' Bush said. ``I think it's important for people to
understand why the conservative philosophy and its policies are
compassionate. I unite people as opposed to divide people. More
importantly I talked about issues that are going to make Texas
better in the future. I laid out a specific plan for improving
schools and making the welfare system work and making the criminal
justice system work. And, I proposed a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``People, I think, appreciated my style of leadership,'' he
added. ``They appreciate the fact that I can lead but more
importantly they saw where I wanted to lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's style remains untested in a national campaign, where his
brand of personal affability with his home state's electorate could
undergo the inevitable strains of microscopic scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a very, very strong candidate who had a couple of
attributes that were very well-received by the voters. One, he
wasn't partisan. Two, he avoided conflict. He liked comity. He
liked civility,'' said Bob Stein, political scientist at Rice
University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is vulnerable precisely because he is touted as a
front-runner so early, Holsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who has the opportunity is sort of George Bush
right now,'' he said. ``He has the advantage of being the
presumptive front-runner and also the dilemma of being touted
extraordinarily high. If people are simply attaching to you all
their hopes and aspirations, you often disappoint them when you
become a living, breathing, human being with certain positions and
flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Bushes are on the record as opposing abortion, although a
leading anti-abortion activist in Texas said George W. Bush has
couched his opposition in policy terms that are more widely
palatable. At the state Republican Convention last summer, Bush
promised to move to the top of his agenda a bill to require
abortion providers to notify the parents of a minor seeking an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, he was savvy about it,'' said Bill Price, president
of Texans United for Life. ``He chose some pro-life issues that are
fairly well accepted by the general public. That's just smart
politics. I don't criticize him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Democratic perspective, Bush's style looks similarly
conciliatory. Just as the Democrats had to pull away from the
liberal left in presidential and gubernatorial politics, the
Republicans will pull away from the right wing if they are smart,
said Chuck McDonald, press secretary to Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he did was designed to be inclusive, not exclusive,
which was the problem the national Republicans got into with all
their mean-spirited issues and language, frankly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat's off to Gov. Bush because he clearly identified
himself as a person of strong values but at no time did he say
anything about anyone else's values. He resisted that as did Jeb
Bush, and it paid off for them in phenomenal ways.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats, cheered by the results
of their unprecedented courtship of Hispanic voters in last
Tuesday's elections, are mapping efforts to enlist the nation's
fastest growing minority in their efforts to win the White House in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters made significant contributions to the margins of
victory for prominent national politicians from both political
parties, including winners with presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Lopez, head of the Republican party's program to court
Hispanic voters, said the latest election results will shape GOP
overtures in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Republicans are looking to see if the Hispanic vote
will be the wave of the future for the GOP,'' said Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Chairman Roy Romer says the mid-term elections
underscored that Hispanic voters will be ``increasingly important
in every election we see in the next 50 years.'' Romer insisted
that the political parties' competing policy agendas _ not
superficial courtship _ will determine who garners the lion's share
of support from a rapidly growing segment of the population that
will represent 25 percent of the nation's residents by 2050.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hispanics are going to vote Republican or Democratic not
because candidates speak their language or attend their festivals
but because the candidates are giving their families what they
really need,'' said Romer, the governor of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics made up 5 percent of the electorate last Tuesday _ a
66 percent jump from the previous mid-term elections, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidates scored the greatest gains among Hispanic
voters nationwide. According to exit polls by the Voter News
Service, 35 percent of Hispanics who voted cast their lot with
Republican candidates _ up 9 percent from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics played key roles in states with large Hispanic
populations including Texas, California, Florida and New York.
Those four states control 144 electoral votes _ or 53 percent of
the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush emerged to lead the pack of GOP
presidential hopefuls on the strength of his 49 percent share of
the Hispanic vote in his landslide second-term victory. Bush's
showing buoys Republican hopes of reclaiming California, Arizona
and Florida _ three states with large Hispanic populations that
supported President Clinton in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Voter News Service exit polls, five senators
won re-election with substantial help from the Hispanic community.
They were Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., a potential GOP White House
aspirant who carried 52 percent of the Hispanic vote in Arizona;
Bob Graham, D-Fla.; Harry Reid, D-Nev. and Ben Nighthorse Campbell,
R-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Their Hispanic support ranged from Graham's 65 percent share to
Campbell's 42 percent share, according to the exit polls.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters also helped Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., score
one of the biggest upsets of the mid-term elections, ousting
12-year veteran Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. Schumer split the
non-Hispanic white vote with D'Amato, but won 82 percent of the
Hispanic vote and 86 percent of the African American vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., defeated Republican Matt Fong with
the help of 72 percent of the Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters also helped deliver California's statehouse into
the hands of a Democrat for the first time in 16 years, by awarding
Democratic Gray Davis 78 percent of their support.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Hispanics accounted for 14 percent of the state's
voters, up 56 percent since the last off-year election to 14
percent last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some credit the statewide draw of Democrat Cruz Bustamante, the
former state assembly speaker who won the post of lieutenant
governor to become the first Hispanic elected to statewide office
since the 1870s.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that GOP candidates, led by defeated GOP
gubernatorial candidate Dan Lungren, continue to suffer from
voters' backlash against the anti-immigrant initiatives of retiring
GOP Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilson is still poison among Hispanics'' in California, said
William Schneider, a public opinion specialist at the American
Enterprise Institute. ``I'm not sure Republicans can ever
recover.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders are vowing to fight hard for the Hispanic vote
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson says Republicans will court Hispanics
with support for anti-crime measures, school vouchers to help pay
for parochial schools and tax breaks for children.
</P>
<P>
   Romer, the Democratic chairman, says Democrats will woo
Hispanics with support for school building modernization,
performance standards for students and teachers and improved access
to health care.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Echaveste, the deputy White House chief of staff and the
highest ranking Hispanic at the White House, predicted that
Democrats will win the majority of Hispanic votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans continue with their anti-immigrant, anti-Hispanic
agenda,'' Echaveste contends. ``Thank God, they haven't figured it
out yet _ it makes our job of solidifying Hispanic support for
Democrats that much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's results showed that Hispanic voters split their
tickets. In Florida, for example, 65 percent of Hispanic voters
backed the Democratic candidate for Senate; 61 percent supported
the Republican for governor. In Arizona, Hispanics gave 52 percent
of their votes to McCain, who won, and 56 percent of their votes to
Democrat Paul Johnson who lost his bid for governor.

<P>
   Of 19 Hispanic candidates who ran for major statewide office
across the nation, seven won, including Democrat Ken Salazar,
elected attorney general of Colorado, and Republican Tony Garza,
who won the post of railroad commissioner in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed
Officials reported that Hispanics made ``significant'' gains in
state legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics picked up five additional seats to hold 52 state
senate seats in legislatures in 15 states. Hispanics also gained
seven seats in the lower houses of state legislatures, to control
129 state assembly seats in 25 state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the size of the 18-member Congressional Hispanic
Caucus did not change as a result of the election.

DAY, BAILEY A STUDY IN CONTRAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ They are arguably the two best jockeys in the
country and they have contrasting styles. One, Pat Day, is a
patient rider, while the other, Jerry Bailey, is aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   Both have mounts in all seven of Saturday's Breeders' Cup events
at Churchill Downs, which carry a total purse of $13.22 million.
Whether you like a rider who sits chilly or one who pushes hard,
you can bet that Day and Bailey, who have combined for 15 winners
in the 14 years of the Breeders' Cup (Day has nine, the most of any
jockey), will be at the top of their game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good about my mounts in the Breeders' Cup,'' said
Day, who, at the age of 45, still rules Kentucky racing.
``Churchill Downs is a great host. The whole community gets up for
it. But the only advantage I'll have is that I'll be able to sleep
in my own bed. Riding in the Breeders' Cup is an awesome feeling. I
have to keep pinching myself to make sure I'm not dreaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``First post is 11:30 a.m., just like Derby Day, but there's
45-50 minutes between races at the Derby. I get up to ride the
first race, then I have to wait. No matter what you do, it's hard
not to let down between races. It's an emotional roller coaster,
and I'm really worn out when the day is over. But the Breeders' Cup
card is run very fast. There's not much time to savor the sweet
taste of victory or dwell on the bitter taste of defeat. I just get
in a groove and go. I like it and I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Day may rule Kentucky, but Bailey, 41, is the king of New York,
and he has no problems being the visiting team with so much on the
line. ``For me, the Breeders' Cup is easier, in a sense, than a
normal day,'' said Bailey. ``There are a lot of things to keep your
mind occupied. After every race, you turn the page and keep going.
You can't get too emotional one way or the other. Every race is
signficant, but every day, every race is important because it's
very dangerous out there and you have to take it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the differing styles of the two top guns, Day said, ``You
have to do what works for you. I've tried to incorporate Jerry's
aggressive style at times, but it hasn't worked for me. I get along
best with a horse if I let him put himself in the race rather than
make him get into it. My style works with most of the horses I
ride, and Jerry's style works with most of the horses he rides.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a look at the Breeders' Cup races, with an extra peek at
the mounts ridden by Day and Bailey:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Juvenile  &LR; _ Day rides the 3-1 morning line favorite, Cat Thief,
who heads a three-horse entry trained by D. Wayne Lukas. A
beautifully bred son of Storm Cat, out of Train Robbery, a good
race mare by Alydar, Cat Thief stamped himself as the one to beat
with a nifty tally in the Breeders' Futurity at Keeneland Oct. 18.
Bailey's mount, Answer Lively, is a key contender at 4-1. Answer
Lively showed the way in the Breeders' Futurity and was caught by
Cat Thief right on the wire. Two big threats are The Groom Is Red,
owned by Rick Pitino's Celtic Pride Stable, and Lemon Drop Kid. The
Groom Is Red comes from the clouds and won the Champgane at Belmont
over a sloppy track Oct. 10 for his third stright tally. Lemon Drop
Kid, who has never been out of the money (5-2-2-1), had the lead in
the Champagne when The Groom Is Red stormed past.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Juvenile Fillies  &LR; _ Bailey rides Confessional, a daughter of
Holy Bull, who took the Frizette at Belmont Oct. 10 and has a good
shot at 6-1. Day rides Bag Lady Jane, a daughter of Devil's Bag who
has won both of her starts but is at 15-1 because of inexperience.
She has an upset chance. ``Bag Lady Jane has lots of talent,'' said
Day. ``She's lightly raced, but I look for a big effort out of
her.'' The logical choice, at 8-5, is Silverbulletday, trained by
Bob Baffert and owned by Mike Pegram, who owns Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner Real Quiet. Silverbulletday has won four of five
starts, most recently the Alcibiades at Keeneland Oct. 11. Astute
trainer Shug McGaughey will saddle Emanating, a rapidly improving
daughter of Cox's Ridge, and she should be watched.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sprint  &LR; _ Day has 3-1 second choice Wild Rush, who dead-heated
Silver Charm in the Kentucky Cup Classic at Turfway Sept. 26, and
he has a big chance. Bailey seems up against it on 30-1 shot Rare
Rock. ``Wild Rush has shown that he's a horse with a great deal of
talent,'' said Day. ``Six furlongs is not his best distance, but
we've been trying to get speed into him. He's drawn the rail but he
likes the fence, and I don't see that as a distraction. He's
training terrifically.'' The program pick, at 2-1, is Affirmed
Success, winner of three in a row, including the Vosburgh at
Belmont Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mile  &LR; _ Day will handle 1997 Horse of the Year Favorite Trick,
who has found a new home on the turf and may go right to the lead.
Bailey rides a European, Cape Cross, who seems a cut below the best
from overseas and is held at 10-1. Favorite Trick won the only
grass race of his career, the Keeneland Mile Oct. 17, going wire to
wire in very impressive fashion. ``The Churchill course is very
much like the Keeneland course _ they're both sand-based,'' said
Day. ``The grass is quite long right now, but it is in good
condition. My only concern with Favorite Trick would be a deep,
boggy course, and with the forecast for clear weather, I think
he'll handle this course fine.'' The lukewarm favorite, listed at
4-1, is Labeeb. Strictly a closer, Labeeb is 3 for 3 this year, but
he will have to overcome a very difficult No. 13 post. Desert
Prince is the real deal from Europe. A noted stalker, he is a neck
short of having won four straight Group I races and is a major
threat at 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Distaff  &LR; _ Bailey has the strong 6-5 choice, Banshee Breeze,
while Day rides Tap to Music, undefeated in four starts. Again,
because of lack of seasoning, Tap to Music is 8-1. Banshee Breeze
has won three straight Grade I races and dominated the Spinster at
Keeneland Oct. 17, winning by 12 lengths. ``Banshee Breeze is on
the improve, and her last few races have been very good,'' said
Bailey. ``I'm not overconfident but I'm certain she'll run well.
She likes this track.'' Escena, at 2-1, is the lone speed in the
race, and Keeper Hill, a 7-2 chance, beat Banshee Breeze in the
Kentucky Oaks in May.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Turf  &LR; _ Bailey will be aboard Leggera, a filly who finished
second in the Prix de L'arc de Triomphe. Only in the Breeders' Cup
could a horse who lost Europe's greatest race by a neck be 12-1.
Day has River Bay, a Californian who seems just a notch below the
best and is 12-1. Royal Anthem, a top European who prepped with an
easy score in the Canadian International at Woodbine Oct. 18, is
favored at 3-1. And you can expect a big late run out of defending
champion Chief Bearheart at 6-1. The Chief hasn't been quite as
sharp as he was last year, but he's still double tough.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Classic  &LR; _ Bailey is the regular rider of leading Horse of the
Year candidate Skip Away, winner of seven straight this season
before losing the Jockey Club Gold Cup in the slop Oct. 10. Skip
Away is 9-5 in the line. Day has the assignment on Awesome Again,
who has won all five of his 1998 starts. Awesome Again heads a
powerful three-horse entry that includes Touch Gold and Coronado's
Quest. ``Awesome Again has tactical speed; he's been on or close to
the lead in all his recent races,'' said Day. ``I anticipate
getting away cleanly and being well positioned going under the wire
the first time. I'll take it from there. He's on the top of his
game and he's ultraconfident right now.'' Said Bailey, ``If Skip
Away runs the way he has been all year, with the exception of the
Jockey Club, he'll be tought to beat. He's certainly worked well
several times since his loss, and I'm optimistic about him.''
Silver Charm, who captured the Kentucky Derby and Preakness last
year and the $4 million Dubai World Cup this year, is favored at
8-5. One to watch is Swain, the best handicap horse in Europe, who
lost the Dubai Cup by a nose to Silver Charm, at 10-1.

DAVIS CAN TAKE VENTURA IN GUBERNATORIAL GRUDGE MATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For release on Sunday, Nov. 8) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JANE ROBISON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- He's lean, he's mean, he's a Democratic fighting
machine, that pugnacious pulverizer of puny, wedge-head Republicans
and their big-tent bag of peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   Ladies and gentlemen of the Golden State, entering the ring as
the first Democratic governor in 16 years and only the fourth
Democrat to hold the high office this century, give it up for
California's middle-of-the-road masher -- ``Gorgeous'' Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Forget state mottos. Minnesota changed all that when it tossed
two veterans out of the ring and handed the brass knuckles and
championship gubernatorial belt to former pro wrestler Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura in Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesotans decided that if you've got two great sports --
wrestling and politics -- why not combine them into one great
super-event?
</P>
<P>
   It's not as crazy as it sounds. It just means that instead of
primaries, now we can have celebrity death matches on MTV. Which is
perfect for Davis, who during the primary said, ``In California
politics, if you're not on TV, you don't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray, baby, get out of the box. This is bigger than TV. This is
Wrestlemania. Grappling governors go (ITAL)mano a mano(END ITAL) in
gargantuan grudge match.
</P>
<P>
   Our governor can beat your governor. Name the place. Name the
time. Bring the kids. We're going to rock your world.
</P>
<P>
   Forget those phony, uptight gubernatorial debates that nobody
watches. Grappling governors coupled with monster truck pulls will
fill every fairgrounds in the country to overflowing.
</P>
<P>
   And just to get the crowd wild and hyped up for the main event,
the League of Women Voters can stage undercard bouts with Focus on
the Family.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Super Tuesday, championship wrestling can take on the
presidential primary. Fifty governors in leather and lace square
off to pick the next candidate for president in an incredible,
unbelievable showdown that will pit pointy-headed policy wonks
against burly back-room brawlers.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Pete ``The Wedge-inator'' Wilson has politics gotten
this down and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of down and dirty, I've been asked to handicap the
matchup between the California Cheese State and the Land O' Lakes
Butter State.
</P>
<P>
   And just how does our boy ``Gorgeous'' Gray stack up to Jesse
``The Mind, The Body, The Governor'' Ventura?
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. ``Gorgeous'' Gray is match-tested and ready to
rumble. It took him ``23 years to walk 15 feet'' to the Governor's
Office, and he knocked down many a challenger to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say knocked?
</P>
<P>
   He galvanized ``Chucky the Cheesehead'' Al Checchi in the
primary. He laced ``Plain'' Jane Harman's shoes together till she
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   And Dan ``Not the Man This Time'' Lungren? Body-slammed to the
mat.
</P>
<P>
   In a no-holds-barred grudge match, I'm betting our guv can whip
the Minnesota wuss who used to strut his stuff in pink feather boas
and glittering tights.
</P>
<P>
   Our former U.S. Army captain can pile-drive their former Navy
SEAL.
</P>
<P>
   Our professional politico can choke-hold their populist
pugilist.
</P>
<P>
   This is a sure-fire fandango of finesse over fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been getting in shape to serve as chief executive of
the state for 18 years. His early tryout bouts included serving as
lieutenant governor, acting governor, state controller, assemblyman
and chief of staff to former Gov. Jerry ``The Moonbeam'' Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Davis' opponent rocked the political world by landing
a tremendous knockout punch on two seasoned veterans -- Democrat
Hubert Humphrey III, the state attorney general and son of the
former vice president, and Republican Norm Coleman, the mayor of
St. Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's only elective office before Tuesday's big score was
serving as mayor of Brooklyn Park, Minn., from 1991-95.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party candidate boasted that his success means people
with ``regular jobs'' can still perform public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it says in the rule book is, be over 25 and live in the
state for one year,'' he told NBC's ``Today'' show. ``I'm
qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Ventura's real name is James George Janos. He
latched on to Ventura after our own neighboring city in 1975 as his
wrestling nom de plume when he was honing his bleached-blond,
surfer-dude image.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, maybe ``Gorgeous'' isn't the hottest
nickname for our fighter.
</P>
<P>
   I'm thinking Gray ``The Val'' Davis conjures up that moderate,
middle-America suburban mystique he's going for.

BLEDSOE LACKING IN THE USUAL TARGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Injuries have stripped him of most of his
familiar weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Bledsoe might as well be throwing to Bill The Barber and
Paul the Plumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more comfortable with these guys than I deserve to
be, based on their experience and my experience with them,'' the
Patriots quarterback said of his current receiving corps. ``These
guys have come in and done their jobs well enough. They are
allowing me to have a great degree of comfort and confidence in
them even with a lack of experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The new starters, of necessity, are 22-year-old Tony Simmons and
37-year-old Henry Ellard. Simmons is just a few months removed from
the track at the University of Wisconsin. Ellard is just days
removed from semiretirement in southern California. They have
become the targets Bledsoe must deliver the ball to.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, he has.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry comes in and he's been in this offense before and he
knows how to run the specific routes,'' said Bledsoe. ``He is so
exact about what he does. That makes it very easy to make that
transition in a short period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   For a spell, Bledsoe had a familiar arsenal. Simmons wasn't even
active for the first five games, usually spending his time on the
sideline in street clothes. Ellard wasn't on the roster. Terry
Glenn was healthy. Troy Brown was healthy, and better than ever.
Vincent Brisby was rejuvenated. Shawn Jefferson was an
enthusiastic, speedy fixture.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, there was Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is one. Coates is the only healthy incumbent,
Bledsoe's fail-safe weapon. But after connecting with Simmons for
bombs in each of the last two games, the quarterback is beginning
to think he might have something special with the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``In training camp, I got on him for not running hard because he
seemed to run so effortlessly,'' said Bledsoe. ``Then I'd
underthrow him by 5 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe thought Simmons would play only sparingly this season
while learning the system. That has changed dramatically. Now the
Chicago native is beginning to make many wonder whether he could be
just as good as Glenn, if not better, because he's faster. He can
certainly break a game open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows great strength with his hands,'' said coach Pete
Carroll. ``He has exceptional hands. He has great confidence in his
hands. He can get jostled and still hold the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Many times, Bledsoe has just heaved the ball and let Simmons get
it. At 6 feet 2 inches, 206 pounds, Simmons has the size and
strength to outduel many cornerbacks one-on-one. That's what he did
against Terrell Buckley two weeks ago in Miami for a 47-yard gain.
This week he'll likely draw Atlanta's Ray Buchanan, a veteran he
should be able to outrace and outmuscle for the ball. If tomorrow's
weather isn't overly windy, that should happen a time or two.
</P>
<P>
   If Bledsoe has the time to get him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defensive line does a great job of getting upfield, and
that allows them to play a more conservative style of defense,''
said Bledsoe. ``They can rely on their line pressuring the passer.
It's a good veteran secondary, and Eugene Robinson is one of the
best safeties to ever play the game. They don't make many mistakes
because of their defense and because of their scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the Falcons will mix up their coverages, using a
zone some of the time, bump-and-run other times, and virtually
throw the kitchen sink at the Patriots' offense. Bledsoe will need
good protection from a line that has allowed 17 sacks this season.
Atlanta's defense has 20 sacks and 13 forced fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   This is where Coates comes in. If Bledsoe doesn't have the time,
he'll go to his tight end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still as effective as he's always been,'' said Bledsoe of
Coates, with whom he's connected on 40 touchdown passes in six
years. ``His production is down some because now we have some other
guys and I don't throw to him every time.''
</P>
<P>
   He almost threw to him every time last week when Coates caught
10 passes for 109 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years back, when we didn't have the weapons, he was our
guy,'' said Bledsoe. ``Now we have a few guys hurting, so we
brought him back into a prominent role in the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The past few games have shown that the deep connection is
paramount to the Patriots' success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've been able to get good protection up front, and
when that happens and when I have time to throw, it makes it a lot
easier,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll believes the Patriots will have great depth if Simmons
continues to derliver while the Big Three are recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll make it more competitive for guys coming back,'' said
Carroll. ``How do you take a Tony Simmons out of the lineup after
he looks like he can contribute? It makes us better. It's the
competition through the ranks that will force our ability to move
upwards toward the end of the season. That part of it is
encouraging. It will only be discouraging if we can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe, who threw only six interceptions in his first eight
games, seems to be on the beam entering the second half of the
season. He's completed five passes over 50 yards this season. In
1997, he completed seven such passes.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is a sign that Bill The Barber and Paul The Plumber
are doing all right.

   REMODEL-REALESTATE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ When Randall and Pamela

 &HT;    Lure of living in city's core impels owners, buyers to remodel
 &HT;    By R. Michelle Breyer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When Randall and Pamela Kopfer bought their
house 16 years ago for $60,000, it was a modest 1,500-square-foot,
three-bedroom, one-bathroom house.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of renovations, the house in the Highland
Village area of Central Austin has grown by one bedroom and one
bathroom. The Kopfers are in the midst of a $90,000 renovation that
will add 700 square feet to their home.
</P>
<P>
   For the Kopfers, it made economic sense to remodel their house
rather than buy a new one, especially if they want to stay in
Central Austin, where housing prices have increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could get the square footage we wanted and stay right where
we were,'' Randall Kopfer said.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is in the midst of a remodeling boom. Homeowners are
investing millions of dollars in their homes, updating kitchens,
restoring wood floors, building additional rooms and, in some
cases, adding an entire story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like where they're at, but the house doesn't fit their
needs,'' said Austin builder Steve Gillen.
</P>
<P>
   The renovation activity is concentrated in Central Austin _ from
Travis Heights to Crestview _ where homeowners are buying older
homes and customizing them, said Ryan Robinson, chief demographer
for the City of Austin. A similar phenomenon has transformed urban
neighborhoods in cities such as Dallas, Houston and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a renewed emphasis on living in town,'' Robinson
said. ``Not only are people willing to pay a premium to live in the
urban core, but they'll buy that two-bedroom bungalow in Hyde Park
and double its square footage.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the first nine months of the year, there were 4,508
permits filed for residential additions and repairs, totaling
$469.3 million, according to the City of Austin Development, Review
and Inspection Department. That's up 38 percent from 1994 and up
145 percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Austin isn't alone in its penchant for remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   Americans spent $88 billion on remodeling during the past 12
months ending in September, according to a new economic indicator
devised by Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.
Remodeling spending has grown 15 percent during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, like the rest of the nation, this boom has been
fueled partly by a combination of factors, including low interest
rates, the bull stock market and housing appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on remodeling took a big jump in mid-1997, just as
interest rates began a steady fall. That triggered increased
activity in refinancing, which homeowners often use to improve
their current houses.
</P>
<P>
   The remodeling activity has kept local contractors busy.
</P>
<P>
   Don Boozer of Don Boozer Construction has remodeled houses from
Northwest Hills to Tarrytown. Boozer said he has experienced sales
increases of as much as 20 percent each year since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Builder Jerry Donahoo has been inundated with calls since he put
his sign in front of a remodeling job at 45th and Red River streets
last month. More than a dozen people have inquired about remodeling
projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most activity I've gotten on any sign,'' Donahoo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, business is expected to flourish as baby boomers'
families grow and older residents prepare their homes for aging,
said Mike Turner of TLC Builders and past national chairman of the
National Association of Home Builders' remodelers council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done a few projects for people who have parents moving in
with them,'' Gillen said.

KILLER EXPLAINS WHY HE CONFESSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY RIZZO and RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLATHE, Kan. _ Daniel Crocker lived with being a murderer for 19
years. But he couldn't live any longer with being a hypocrite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behind the veneer of his Christian life lurked a terrible sin.
He decided that he couldn't pursue his future until he had
exorcised his past. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So in September he left his wife and children, traveled halfway
across the country and confessed to a murder for which he had never
been a suspect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Crocker pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and
attempted rape in the death of Tracy Fresquez, who was 19 when she
was killed in Shawnee in 1979. Later in the day, in an exclusive
interview with The Kansas City Star, he spoke publicly for the
first time about the case and his decision to come forward. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His attorneys, Tom Bath and Robb Edmonds, agreed with District
Attorney Paul Morrison to recommend a sentence of 20 to 60 years.
Under the law in place in 1979, Crocker would be eligible for
parole in 10 years. He is to be sentenced Jan. 14. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said he thought the plea agreement was fair to both
sides. Crocker received some consideration for coming forward, but
will still spend many years in jail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real important we don't forget what he did 19 years
ago,'' Morrison said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fresquez's relatives were mostly satisfied with the pleas. They
acknowledged that Crocker probably would have stayed free if he
hadn't stepped forward, but they wanted to see him punished even
though his confession made new victims of his own family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel horrible for them, but that doesn't change the crime he
did 19 years ago,'' said Jay Fresquez, who was 16 when his sister
was killed. ``Their family got hit with the same lightning bolt we
did. He might be a great person now. Twenty years ago, he was a
raping killer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victim's father, Louis Fresquez, said Crocker's turnaround
shouldn't absolve him: ``There's more involved than just finding
God; you just can't say you've found God. And for him to go through
with his wife knowing about it for 11 years _ he had no right to
start a family. He had no right to start a family at all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by one of his attorneys, Crocker spoke to a reporter
Thursday afternoon inside a small conference room on the third
floor of the Johnson County Jail in Olathe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old resident of Chantilly, Va., talked of his
religious faith and his need to set a good example for his children
and other Christians. He also said that he hoped the Fresquez
family could forgive him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The decision to come forward was a difficult one, Crocker said,
but ultimately he felt there was nothing else to do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to,'' he said. ``As I pursued my walk with the Lord,
this wall had come up... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't live as a hypocrite any longer. How could I take my
son and speak to him about what is right?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, he said, he wanted to emphasize the need for
people who consider themselves Christians to publicly admit
whatever ``hidden sins'' they have in their lives _ and to accept
the consequences. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They want forgiveness, but they don't want the punishment,''
he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker didn't know what kind of punishment awaited him when he
decided to confess. He didn't know whether he faced a death
sentence or life in prison. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the Lord had brought me to this point,'' he said. ``My
children were at a good age to tell that daddy had done something
wrong.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being away from his 9-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter is
tough for Crocker. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I love them dearly, but I know that's part of my penalty,''
Crocker said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker, who grew up in the Kansas City area, was the youngest
of five children who were raised in a devout Christian family. As a
teen he rebeled, experimenting with drugs such as marijuana and
LSD, and moving away from his parents' faith. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In early October 1979, he was living in a Lenexa apartment
complex and nursing a recently broken heart. Crocker said he was
distraught, suffering an emotional letdown after a girlfriend
``betrayed me with someone else.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He sought solace in drugs. Crocker said he took an ``extreme''
dose of LSD that kept him high, without food or water, for three
days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was already numb because I didn't want to face those
emotions in my heart,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One night during the binge he was smoking pot with a neighbor.
He went to a nearby convenience store, and as he walked out, he met
a young woman. He cannot remember her face. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can remember there was a smile,'' he said. ``I asked her
to go to a party.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back at his neighbor's apartment, Crocker said, he and the woman
injected some kind of drug into their veins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it was,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker didn't want to talk about what happened next. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He told police that they ended up at her apartment. He left
after she spurned his sexual advances, but sneaked back in, crawled
into bed with her and attempted to have sex. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She awoke screaming, and he smothered her with a pillow. &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   with a pillow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drug-induced fog, Crocker said, he knew what he had
done. He said he cried and asked God for mercy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe I was capable of doing such a thing,''
Crocker said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then he did his best to forget it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like if you've been in an accident,'' he said. ``You
wake up and you don't want to deal with that terrible thought.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker turned again to his Christian faith. He got married and
raised a family. Went to work every day and never committed another
crime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not until he began ministering to the nephew of a family friend,
incarcerated in a Virginia prison, did memories of his crime come
back to the surface. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time for me to clear my conscience,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But his memories were dimmed by time and his efforts to repress
them. He could remember few details. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, Crocker said, he prayed to God to help him remember, and his
prayers were answered. During his statement to Shawnee police,
Crocker said, he felt the need to confess every detail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said he owed the Fresquez family the comfort of knowing what
had happened. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not my intention to bring them any more grief or hurt
or sorrow,'' he said. ``I ask that they find a place in their
hearts for peace and to forgive me.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker told his wife about the crime long ago, but other
relatives didn't know about his guilt until he called them days
before he flew to Kansas City and surrendered to Shawnee police. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I just want to make plain to the Fresquez family is
we feel their hurt and we love them,'' Thomas Crocker said outside
court after his son's plea. ``We just don't know how to express our
sorrow to them for what happened.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crocker and his four siblings were raised Baptist. When he was
five, he gave his life to Jesus and told his family that God told
him to preach, his father said. Crocker's parents tried to shelter
their children from the world, but Crocker rebelled when he was 17,
Thomas Crocker said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to see how the world was,'' he said of his
son. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two years later _ after Crocker killed Fresquez, his family
would later learn _ he cut his hair, stopped smoking and began
living a clean life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He got married and eventually moved to Virginia, where his wife,
Nicolette Crocker, and their two children are now living with help
from their church and relatives. Nicolette Crocker home-schools the
children near Washington, D.C., and doesn't work outside the home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since Crocker came forward, news organizations from across the
country have covered the case. Columnists have used Crocker as a
positive example because of his contrition. The media response to
Crocker's case is something he didn't want or ask for. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come here to be a hero,'' Crocker said in the
interview. ``Doing what's right is why I'm here.'' &QL;

CARTER BACK, INJURED SAMSONOV A QUESTION MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You gain some. You may lose some. And some keep holding
out.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the state of the Bruins roster Friday. Just as the team
finally got free agent holdout Anson Carter back in the lineup
Thursday night for a solid 4-1 win over Toronto, Sergei Samsonov
took a spill late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Samsonov was tripped up in the third period and hit his elbow
when he went to the ice. He missed Friday morning's practice at the
FleetCenter to have his bursa sac drained. While coach Pat Burns
said his status for games Saturday at Pittsburgh and Sunday in
Carolina was uncertain, Samsonov made the trip to Pittsburgh in the
afternoon and assistant general manager Mike O'Connell later said
he was likely to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very painful,'' O'Connell said. ``But once it's drained,
it heals pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   So Carter is back. Samsonov is tender. P.J. Axelsson is out
suffering the effects of his second concussion in a week. Tim
Taylor (ankle) is skating, but his return is still a ways off,
Burns said. And defenseman Kyle McLaren remains a holdout. On the
plus side, Rob DiMaio may return Saturday after missing Thursday's
game with a bad ankle.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he left a message on McLaren's machine Thursday
night but had no news on his status.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not returned my calls,'' O'Connell said. ``I just
wanted to see what he's thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said before Thursday's game that more than once, the
team thought it had a deal with McLaren and his agent, Doug
Messier, only to have it fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   There is a time when it becomes too late to reach agreement,
O'Connell said, but he's not sure when that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to decide,'' O'Connell said. ``We're playing. I don't
know. That's all there is to report.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins headed to Pittsburgh looking for back-to-back wins
for only the second time all season, the first since consecutive
3-0 shutouts of the Islanders and Avalanche Oct. 12 and 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins and Hurricanes are both coming off big comeback
wins Thursday night. Pittsburgh trailed Ottawa, 2-0, and won, 4-2.
Carolina trailed the Islanders, 3-0, and won, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   How does Burns feel about taking on Jaromir Jagr and Pittsburgh
without his DiMaio-Taylor-Axelsson checking line?
</P>
<P>
   ``Scared,'' the coach said.
</P>
<P>
   He played his No. 1 line of Jason Allison, Samsonov, and Dmitri
Khristich against Toronto's best Thursday, and they not only held
their own, they scored a couple of goals. Depending on how his
lineup shapes up, Burns may try some of that again Saturday, he
said. Overall, he wants his team to keep things simple and treat
every game, every period, like it's 0-0 and see how well it can
shut opponents down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to just settle down and wait until
everyone gets back and try to hang on for our dear lives for the
next couple of weeks,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   Having Carter's size and speed in the lineup won't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said Thursday there will be no hard feelings on the
Bruins' part.
</P>
<P>
   Carter agreed, though he said he will remember what he went
through on the way to a two-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once your deal is done and out of the way, it's all
business,'' Carter said. ``You've got to be professional. You
signed a contract and you've got to be geared for playing for that
team. There are always teams looking and watching, and you don't
want to put yourself in a situation where you're going to sulk and
you're going to pout. That's all behind me right now, and I'm here
to play hockey and help this team win hockey games.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's not forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep it in the back of your head; you never forget,''
Carter said. ``You can forgive, but my parents taught me never to
forget. I won't forget what happened. It's been a learning
experience for myself and the team and maybe the guys in the
dressing room as well. I'm mature enough and old enough to realize
you just turn the page. You can't have any lingering doubts in your
mind because it will affcet how you play.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio said he will be in the lineup if he has anything to say
about it. ``But it's not really up to me right now,'' he said.
``But if they take my input, I want to play.'' DiMaio hurt his left
ankle in the morning skate before Tuesday's game in Buffalo when a
teammate coming to join the group in a huddle took him out. ``It
was one of those fluke things,'' DiMaio said. ``I was in the group
already, and the train barreled into me and forgot to stop.'' ...
Thursday night was only the second time all season the Bruins have
scored more than three goals. The other was in the 9-2 romp in
Montreal Oct. 28. That was also the team's only win in its last
five road games. The Bruins have scored a total of four goals in
those last four road losses.

HOG FARM OPPONENTS SEEK _ AND FIND _ RELIEF IN LOCAL COURTS, LOCAL
GOVERNMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Environment Writer &QL; 
 &LR; tx:It's hard to imagine the horrible stench that can come from a
large hog farm, says Mary Miller, a rural Pettis County, Mo.,
retiree who in 1995 had one such operation open just 2,000 feet
from her home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened in January and by April it was stinking,'' Miller
said. ``It was stinkier and stinkier.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The stench woke her up at night and kept her from her garden and
even such normally mundane pleasures as sitting outside in the
breeze. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So Miller sued _ and won. Last week, a state circuit court judge
shut down the offending hog farm, finding it to be a nuisance, and
awarded the Millers and their neighbors, the Blackburns, $117,500
in damages. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling _ along with another recent state court
judgment that upheld Linn County's right to regulate the farms as
threats to public health _ have cheered opponents of large hog
factories in Missouri. Impatient with what they see as weak and
slow efforts by state officials to control stench and pollution
from hog operations, they have turned to courts and county
governments for relief. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These rulings are potentially huge,'' said Scott Dye of the
Missouri Sierra Club. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen other outstate counties in Missouri now are
looking at adopting health regulations similar to those upheld in
Linn County, Dye said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pettis County case, Dye added, is significant because it
split the responsibility for damages between the farm's owners,
Edward and Bonnie Byler, and Cargill Inc., the company that owned
the farm's 2,800 hogs. That means large hog companies will have to
pay attention to the ruling, Dye said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on now on the judicial front is going to have
more impact on people's lives than anything legislative,'' he
added. ``If we sit and wait for the Missouri legislature to do
something, we're going to be paved over with pig farms.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys and others involved in the Pettis County case say they
don't know of another farm being shut down by a judge for being a
nuisance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bylers and Cargill are contemplating an appeal, saying the
judge went too far. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very drastic,'' said Steven Fritz, the attorney for
the Bylers. ``There's an investment there in the farm of well over
$400,000, just in structures and land.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Cargill said the company is considering an
appeal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The judge in the Pettis County case, George Thompson, explained
that closing the Bylers' farm does seem drastic, but it was
appropriate and the only practical way to abate the nuisance.
What's more, according to Thompson's ruling, the Bylers had been
warned before opening a hog operation that neighbors opposed a hog
farm and would bring legal action. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bylers built their facility only 700 feet from the
Blackburns. Cargill representatives had advised against the site
because it was so close to neighbors, the court ruling stated. The
facility was built before new setback rules were adopted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the General Assembly did enact new restrictions for
such facilities, including the required setbacks. But Dye and other
opponents of the large hog farms believe those rules are too weak
to bring relief to rural residents like the Millers and
Blackburns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the Pettis County lawsuit didn't deal with those state rules
or the state's enforcement of them. The plaintiffs sought relief by
having the farm's owners and Cargill declared negligent and
nuisances. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Taylor, the attorney for the Millers and Blackburns, says
it is difficult to say how significant the Pettis County ruling
will become. The case must be appealed before it has much legal
standing. And the facts of this case were a bit unusual because the
farm was so close to a neighbor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to have a lot of farms put 700 or 800 feet
from a neighbor,'' Taylor said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet Taylor believes the case illustrates that smaller operations
can be as offensive as the largest operations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's also my personal opinion that the odors can be
controlled,'' Taylor said. ``It's a matter of money.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hog facilities should be required to use the best available
technology to control odors, just as most other industries are
required to do, Taylor said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In northern Missouri, reacting to residents' complaints of
odors, waste spills and stream pollution from a nearby hog farm,
the Linn County Commission adopted new health regulations for such
operations in August 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As elected officials, we have an obligation to protect our
residents' health, safety, welfare and quality of life from these
types of operations,'' said Buck Farrenkopf, the county's presiding
commissioner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Counties and cities must meet strict waste-management rules,
added Linn County Commissioner Becky Thudium, but the large hog
operations can spread and store the wastes untreated, and must
comply with only minimal safeguards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Pork Producers, which joined a Linn County farmer
in the lawsuit seeking to overturn the county health regulations,
said the rules were unnecessary and too costly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an onerous rule,'' said Don Nikodim, executive director
of the Pork Producers, ``and it's cost-prohibitive.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It won't be fair for farmers to comply with a variety of local
rules, each set different in each county, Nikodim said. ``And
there's no real scientific reason to do it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the prices that farmers receive today,'' he added.
``It's just devastating. And now you have local government wanting
to impose a whole new level of bureaucracy and costs on the
farmer.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's rules regarding large hog farms are more restrictive
than those of the states that surround it, he added. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pork Producers plan to appeal the ruling soon. &QL;

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City's HOK Sports Facilities Group is
merging with a similar firm based in London and Brisbane,
Australia, creating what is thought to be the first international
sports architecture practice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOK is merging with LOBB Sports Architects. The new practice
will be called HOK (plus sign) LOBB Sport, and it will retain
headquarters in all three cities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports architecture is a big industry in Kansas City,'' said
Robert White, a vice president at HOK, referring to the fact that
there are two other sports architecture firms in the city. ``Now
it's truly becoming a global industry.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOK _ celebrating its 15th anniversary Friday _ has been
successful in designing football and baseball stadiums in the
United States but has struggled overseas in designing stadiums for
cricket, rugby and other non-American sports, said Ron Labinski,
HOK's senior vice president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that you have to be on the ground,'' Labinski
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, HOK needed local help from LOBB in designing Croke
Park in Dublin, Ireland. Croke Park is for Gaelic football, which
is kind of like rugby, and for hurling, which is a rougher version
of field hockey. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two found they needed each other's help to pull off a
complete reconstruction that is to begin at the first of the year
at Wembley Stadium in London, which is a soccer and concert venue. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, LOBB helped out with a soon-to-begin $150 million
renovation of a horse track in Mexico City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never done a horse track before,'' Labinski said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the two companies worked together and executives talked, they
decided to merge, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While other sports architecture firms carry out some projects
overseas, White said they thought the new HOK+LOBB would be the
first with permanent offices in multiple countries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And HOK figures it can help LOBB, which has never designed an
arena, for example. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We can lend them a hand there,'' Labinski said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The number of employees should not change, Labinski said. HOK
has about 275 employees, all of whom are in Kansas City except one
in London. LOBB has 50 in London and about 25 in Brisbane and
Sydney, Australia. (LOBB is the lead designer for much of the 2000
Summer Olympics in Sydney.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOK+LOBB will be an operating unit of Hellmuth, Obata and
Kassabaum Inc. of St. Louis, a large architectural firm. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOK Sports, the largest sports design firm, began in Kansas City
15 years ago. Among the stadiums, arenas and ballparks it has
designed are Alltel Stadium for the Jacksonville (Fla.) Jaguars,
Pro Player Stadium for the Miami Dolphins and Florida Marlins,
Jacobs Field for the Cleveland Indians, and Camden Yards for the
Baltimore Orioles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LOBB began in 1935 and has been involved in sports and
entertainment architecture. In 1993, it began focusing exclusively
on sports. &QL;

 CHIEFS FANS: REMEMBER THE 1980s?  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although it's difficult for average fans to perceive their
beloved Kansas City Chiefs as a business entity, that is precisely
what they are. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team is unlike most businesses in that it's capable of
generating enduring emotional loyalty. On the other hand, what it
does have in common with traditional businesses is its
vulnerability to the cyclical ups and downs experienced by other
economic enterprises. The Chiefs, unfortunately for their fans,
this year entered a down phase of the cycle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How far down this slide will carry the franchise remains to be
seen, but the fans already are getting restless. The disagreement
over who should be the No. 1 quarterback intensifies with each
loss, and the first signs of a head coach controversy are emerging.
Like shareholders in a troubled traditional business, Chiefs fans
increasingly wonder whether it's time for a change at the top. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who find this possibility attractive either have short
memories or weren't in Kansas City during the worst of the last
Chiefs downturn. It was, in its own way, as horrific as the 1973-74
bear market and recession. Not as hard on the pocketbook, but
psychologically devastating, nevertheless. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're one of those getting on the sack-the-coach bandwagon,
repeat after me: Frank Gansz. John Mackovic. Marv Levy. Tom Bettis.
Paul Wiggin. These were the coaches between the Hank Stram and
Marty Schottenheimer eras. Schottenheimer won as many games in his
first eight seasons as those predecessors did in 14. Schottenheimer
has been a winner every year since his arrival. His predecessors
managed a grand total of two winning seasons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Changing field generals is something pro football franchises
should do only with considerable care. An experience recounted
recently by a local business executive put the risk factor into
telling perspective. He recalled when the Chiefs were at the nadir
of their down cycle in the '80s and some bit of business required
him to get together with a Chiefs employee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most convenient time for both was a Sunday afternoon when
the Chiefs were playing at home. He went to the sports complex,
which wasn't nearly the traffic zoo it's become on game day since
the Chiefs became a hot ticket. He got a security pass, went down
to the field, met his contact and did whatever it was he was there
to do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to leave, the Chiefs guy asked if he'd like to
stick around for the game, which had just begun. He demurred,
saying he had some personal errands to run that afternoon, and he
went his merry way. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To this day, he said, it's hard for him to believe how easy it
was to blow off the opportunity to watch a Chiefs game from the
sidelines. But that's how unappealing the Chiefs were during their
last bad patch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs' last down cycle wasn't entirely the fault of the
coaches, although some of them were pretty bad. The front office
was nothing to write home about, either. This is good to keep in
mind when cries for Carl Peterson's scalp begin to be heard, which
they will if the down cycle steepens at Arrowhead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it hasn't been a banner year for the Chiefs. But
before the stakeholders start demanding a housecleaning of
Arrowhead's executive suite, they'd best be careful what they pray
for. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Think Frank Gansz. Think 8-22-1. &QL;

BC HOPES HOME FINALE AGAINST IRISH WILL END ON PLEASANT NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ For the last five weeks, Boston College's football team
has been like a discordant chorale struggling to find the right
pitch, the right harmony. Each time the Eagles have set out to
clear their voices and raise them in mellifluous unison, it has
only resulted in a grating cacophony.
</P>
<P>
   Something more akin to Metallica than Mozart.
</P>
<P>
   So in what will be the home swan song for 15 BC seniors, the
Eagles (3-5) will attempt to avoid hitting another flat note when
they host No. 13 Notre Dame (6-1) today in their 1998 Alumni
Stadium finale.
</P>
<P>
   After going 0-4 in October for the second year in a row, capped
by last week's hideous 35-17 loss at Miami, the Eagles need to win
their final three games in November to salvage a winning record. To
do that, they must avoid the first-quarter blahs that have plagued
them in their losses.
</P>
<P>
   Last week several BC players were puzzled that the team could
come out flat for the second game in a row. Although coach Tom
O'Brien bristled at the suggestion, the scoreboard at the Orange
Bowl certainly reflected as much as the Hurricanes rolled to a 21-0
lead in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come out flat. That's bogus. I've been hearing that
for two years,'' said O'Brien. ``I haven't seen anything that
indicated to me the team was (flat). The only thing that was flat
was us; we got run over. We were flattened.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been a disturbing trend of late. In the five losses,
the Eagles have been outscored, 52-7. In the last four, the Eagles
were shut out in the first quarter, 45-0. For the season, BC has
been outscored in the first period, 66-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team has come out and they've played,'' O'Brien said. ``We
haven't got off to a good start, but that has nothing to do with
they way we've played and that has more to do with the opponent
we're playing. That's what I've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But against Notre Dame's senior- and junior-laden team, O'Brien
could see more of the same if BC's injury-riddled defense is forced
to go without two of its top three players again. Junior free
safety Pedro Cirino is set to return from the left shoulder burner
that sidelined him for the last four games. Sixth-year linebacker
Brian Maye (pulled right groin) remains questionable pending a
final evaluation in pregame warmups.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish, conversely, are on a five-game winning streak after
suffering a 45-23 embarrassment at Michigan State Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a team that takes anyone or anything for granted,''
said second-year Notre Dame coach Bob Davie, whose team was 3-5
before it pinned BC with its worst loss last year, a 52-20 rout at
South Bend, Ind. ``When you look at those tapes, I mean in all
sincerity, when you watch those tapes (of BC), you see what a good
football team they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been really very few people, if anyone, that has
slowed that offense down.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami accomplished what no other defense had this season against
BC by holding senior running back Mike Cloud below 100 yards.
Cloud, who entered the game needing 92 yards to surpass Big East
all-time rushing leader Terrell Willis (3,114 yards), was held to a
season low of 75 yards on 20 carries. Cloud, who has 215 carries
for 1,227 yards and 11 touchdowns this season, dropped from the
nation's No. 2 to No. 4 rusher (153.4 yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every week when we leave that stadium, we
realize that there's a lot of things that we could've done
better,'' Davie said. ``Because of being that type of team, we're
not going to overlook anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, meanwhile, will counter with an offense led by
senior quarterback Jarious Jackson and senior running back Autry
Denson, who is 160 yards from supplanting Allen Pinkett (4,131
yards, 1982-85) as the Irish's all-time leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at them and they have experience on the offensive
line, they have a senior quarterback, and they have all this
experience playing on defense,'' said O'Brien, sitting at his desk
as he flipped through Notre Dame's two-deep roster. ``They ought to
be a good football team. That's the thing they have going for them
right now. That's a senior-junior football team. They're very
experienced, they're very talented, and they're (6-1), and that's
how you get that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they will lead a young and inexperienced team onto the
field at Alumni Stadium one last time, BC's seniors, especially
cocaptains Doug Brzezinski and Maye, will try to strike one last
harmonious chord at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for a lot kids,'' said O'Brien. ``It's
their last chance to play football here in front of a home crowd at
BC. What better game to do it than to play Notre Dame?''

LIVINGSTON'S CHALLENGE TO GINGRICH IS A BATTLE BETWEEN FRIENDS
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND and ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Robert L. Livingston's announcement Friday
that he will seek to take the House speakership away from Newt
Gingrich pits him against a longtime friend and political patron.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who Gingrich promoted over three more senior
Republicans in the 104th Congress to lead the powerful
Appropriations Committee, said the Republicans' disastrous loss of
five House seats Tuesday was a signal from the voters that the
House needs better management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running against a friend and I don't like that,''
Livingston told reporters. ``It would be different if I couldn't
stand the guy... I just think that my talents as a manager are more
in demand than his are.''
</P>
<P>
   He referred to Gingrich as ``my dear friend'' of 20 years who
came to Congress at the same time. Running for speaker ``has been
the most difficult decision I have ever made,'' Livingston said.
``In the last four years, no one has been a stronger supporter of
him and no one has been more loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who has often styled himself a ``Newt loyalist,''
said Gingrich was ``fantastic'' at going around the country to
raise money but that money failed to boost the GOP majority in the
House. Before the Tuesday election, the Republicans had a 228-207
margin. When the new Congress convenes in January, it will still be
in the majority but by a smaller 223-212 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll travel from time to time but I will be more of a
stay-at-home speaker who wants to get the job of the House of
Representatives done,'' he said. ``Making sure the trains run on
time is part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulane University political science professor David Clinton, who
has followed Livingston's career, said Livingston's announcement
``has an almost Shakespearian quality to it. He was elevated by
Gingrich out of turn because he was expected to be a loyalist. He
was the protege of someone else who could be viewed as turning on
his patron.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Appropriations Committee that is responsible
for designing government spending programs, Livingston was
reportedly irate with Gingrich last month for excluding him from
last-minute budget negotiations that the speaker and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott conducted with White House officials.
During those talks, the congressional Republicans agreed to make
major concessions to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a wealthy New Orleans lawyer, former assistant U.S.
attorney and veteran party worker who was elected to Congress in
1977, told reporters last March that he was ``aggressively
pursuing'' the speakership by lobbying House colleagues because he
expected Gingrich to quit as speaker in 1999 to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   However, Livingston also said he would continue to support
Gingrich as long as he chose to remain speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 55, who won his 12th term Tuesday, is considered a
strong committee chairman with a hot temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does have a temper _ he has displayed that more than
once,'' said Clinton. ``He cools off quickly though. It's like one
of the summer torrential rains we have in New Orleans: it's violent
at the time but doesn't last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Livingston has a conservative voting record (the
American Conservative Union gave him a 95 percent approval rating
in 1996 and the Chamber of Commerce gives him an 88 percent rating
the same year), he has had some well-publicized clashes with the
ideologically charged segment of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Traditional Values Coalition, an evangelical
church group that claims 36,000 members, blasted Livingston for
refusing to support measures banning adoptions by unmarried couples
and banning publicly financed intravenous needle exchanges in the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Christian group called him a ``fraud'' who was
``more concerned with currying political favors with the left than
he is about doing what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston responded by telling off the organization's executive
director, Andrea Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's announcement that he will seek the speakership
followed another by Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., a telegenic former
wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks who is challenging House
Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said, ``It's always
difficult to take out the speaker'' but he noted that many members
are angry with Gingrich because he led them to believe that
Republicans ``were going to pick up seats, right up to the last
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel either they were lied to or they feel that the
speaker's office didn't know what was going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, unlike Largent, is not part of the revolutionary
class of 1994 that tried to overthrow Gingrich in a coup attempt
last year ago. ``He's been one of the powerbrokers,'' Rothenberg
said..
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is a graduate of Tulane, where Gingrich got his PhD
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston can't get enough of ``rock 'em, sock 'em action
movies,'' he said in an interview last year. One of his favorite
movies is ``The Rock,'' a pyrotechnic extravaganza about a
terrorist who threatens to blow up San Francisco. In the flick,
there's lots of blood and bomb blasts. And the good guys triumph
over huge odds.

moments before it exploded outside a bustling marketplace on Friday
morning, killing the two bombers, injuring 24 other people and
disabling the U.S.-brokered peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Cabinet immediately suspended deliberations on the
peace accord that was signed in Wye, Md., last month and called on
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to prove he was cracking
down on terrorism. Reverberating through the heart of downtown, the
blast Friday morning was the second since the Israelis and the
Palestinians signed a new land-for-security agreement at the White
House two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis believe that Islamic Holy War, a militant
fundamentalist organization, bears responsibility for the attack at
the heavily guarded Mahane Yehuda market, where terrorists have
staged several deadly bombings before.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred during the typical Friday shopping rush
before the Sabbath. At 9:40 a.m., the Fiat, chugging along like a
car about to quit, began emitting smoke. The smoke served as the
first alarm, followed by a series of small explosions, that sounded
like firecrackers. In the minutes before the final boom, as the car
aimed to climb the sidewalk, the police moved quickly to clear the
busy area, in an effort to minimize the final toll. The bombers
died, their car blown to bits of twisted metal. But once the flames
ebbed and the thick black smoke cleared, only one victim proved to
be badly injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started running like a crazy person,'' said Sigal Yitzer,
who was recovering from minor injuries in a Jerusalem hospital. ``I
thought only of my two 18-month-old twins at home, and if I should
die, who would be their mother?''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat condemned the bombing, spending the day in meetings in
Ramallah with his top security advisers and Cabinet. But his aides
expressed concern that the attack had provided Benjamin Netanyahu,
the Israeli prime minister, with an excuse for reneging on his
commitment to the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the result of this terrorist action will be to give
a gift, an umbrella, to Netanyahu,'' said Freich Abu Madein, the
Palestinian minister of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of the accord was supposed to have begun last
Monday, but the Israelis delayed it, with Netanyahu insisting he
needed the approval of his Cabinet and Parliament first. Then, he
postponed convening his Cabinet, demanding written guarantees that
the Palestinians would arrest 30 fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   When the Israeli ministers finally met, in a rambunctious
all-day session on Thursday, they indicated that they might give
the peace accord only conditional approval, if any. They had just
reconvened on Friday morning when they received news of the
explosion. They immediately moved to suspend their vote on the
accord _ and thus, its implementation _ until Arafat declared
``all-out war'' on terrorism, according to Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Arafat to do what is being demanded of him,'' said
Silvan Shalom, the Israeli minister of science. ``He needs to
combat the terror infrastructure. He has done that in the past and
he needs to do so now.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu issued no public statements. He did not visit the
scene, and he did not visit the injured at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On her way to work on Friday morning, Yehudit Levy, a bank
clerk, had stopped at the Haba bakery on Jaffa Street to buy a
chocolate croissant for breakfast when she noticed the smoking
Fiat, which she later called ``a real jalopy.'' Concerned for the
driver, she ran to rap on his window, motioning toward the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the face of the terrorist,'' she said. ``It was dark,
thin and kind of pinched. He gripped the steering wheel hard and
stared straight in front of him. He looked scared. I couldn't
understand why he wasn't getting out of this dangerous car. I
wanted to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two border police officers came running toward her, shouting for
her to move away from the car. People were pushing each other out
of the way, whimpering and screaming. Smoke was pouring from the
exhaust pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smoke saved us,'' Levy said. ``We ran away from the smoke.
If it wasn't for the smoke, there would have been a terrible
massacre because it was very crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Mizrachi, a fruit vendor, said he saw sparks and heard a
put-put sound, followed by an explosion that knocked him and dozens
of others off their feet. The flaming car shot into the air,
splintering into shards of metal and glass that littered the
marketplace and the charred street. Many people crawled into
alleyways and shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was hysteria,'' said Eliad Duan, an Israeli border
policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Levy, who had run to shelter, emerged to see a border
policeman lying on his back in the street, and two mangled corpses,
one of whom was the driver, his face sheared away.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the operation as amateurish, Israeli police later
said that it was unclear whether the bombers intended to commit
suicide or to plant the bomb and flee. Israeli television reported
on Friday night that two suitcases filled with explosives may have
been detonated in desperation because the Fiat was breaking down. A
Palestinian official said the bombers carried Israeli
identification cards and lived in East Jerusalem. He identified one
as Yousef Izghaiar, 22, who was released four months ago from an
Israeli jail where he spent two years for taking part in Islamic
Holy War operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that there are certain types of attacks where our
deployment, no matter how tight and reinforced, is not hermetic,''
Police Chief Yehuda Wilk said. `But this is the type of incident
which could have ended much, much worse, especially if the
explosion had happened inside the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a half hour after the bombing, shoppers had resumed their
errands in the market, and some even begged the police to allow
them to cross the barricades so they could visit their favorite
spice or dried-fruit stalls. ``Unfortunately, we've gotten used to
this,'' said Ariel Twito, 36, as he ate a banana across the street
from where the bombers' corpses lay under tarps.
</P>
<P>
   But Chada Weinberg, an elderly woman, was distraught. Her
husband had gone to the market to buy chicken while she stayed home
cleaning for the Sabbath dinner. When she heard of the bombing on
the radio, she rushed over. Her husband always waited for the bus
in the crosswalk where the explosion had taken place, she said, and
he was very late in returning.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Mrs. Weinberg said, after another terrorist
attack, she had accompanied her sister to the Mahane Yehuda market
to search for her brother-in-law. He had ended up a casualty, and
her sister a widow with seven children.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking and crying, Mrs. Weinberg collapsed at an olive stand as
yeshiva students with cell phones called hospitals for her. They
finally located her husband _ home with a chicken waiting to be
broiled. Mrs. Weinberg wiped her eyes and hugged the vendors, the
yeshiva students and the journalist by her side. ``Thanks be to
God,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish settlers in the West Bank, who vehemently oppose the
land-for-security deal as a betrayal, called on Netanyahu to
respond to the terrorist attack by abandoning the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more he continues these terrible peace agreements, the
more terrorist attacks we will have,'' said Aharon Domb, the
settlers' leader.
</P>
<P>
   But several Israelis criticized Netanyahu's government for
responding to the terrorists' provocation by backing away from the
peace accord, which has a tight, 12-week implementation schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a grave thing that in the wake of such an act, the
government stops its talks,'' said Yossi Beilin, a Labor Party
member of Parliament and an architect of the Oslo interim peace
agreement. ``After all, this is exactly what the terrorists want.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first act of terrorism that followed the signing of the
accord, a suicide bomber attempting to blow up a schoolbus of
children near a Jewish settlement in Gaza was foiled by a jeep of
soldiers, one of whom was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians responded to that incident with an instant
crackdown on Hamas, arresting more than a hundred members and
placing its spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza on Friday, several thousand militant Palestinians
rallied to protest Yassin's arrest, the peace accord, and the
detention of Palestinians in Palestinian jails. They chanted
anti-Israeli, anti-American and anti-Arafat slogans. No Hamas
leaders attended, surprising the organizers.
</P>
<P>
   `` Netanyahu, if he stays with his stubbornness, there will be
many arrows directed at his head,'' said one speaker, Imad Falouji,
the communications minister for the Palestinian Authority.

 &HT;    Ex-U.S. secretaries: Problems will remain with Saddam in power
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something needs to be done about troublesome Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein, seven former U.S. secretaries of state
agreed Friday. Exactly what is another story.
</P>
<P>
   This much the secretaries could agree on: Problems will persist
as long as Saddam remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability, but we don't seem to have the will to
do it,'' said Caspar Weinberger, who served under President Ronald
Reagan from 1981 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that Saddam , who again this week refused to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, is trying to build weapons
of mass destruction, Weinberger said.
</P>
<P>
   But William Perry, who served from 1994 to 1997 under President
Clinton, asked his colleagues what could be done realistically. Did
they think, he asked, that cruise missile attacks or bombings would
change anything?
</P>
<P>
   Answered Richard Cheney, defense secretary from 1989 to 1993 for
President George Bush, ``Part of the difficulty is that we keep
looking for the silver bullet in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   James Schlesinger, who served Presidents Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford from 1973 to 1975, urged everyone to stop the
``hand-wringing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you can take out Saddam Hussein,'' Schlesinger said,
``then you are going to have to live with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Cabinet members made their observations at the 12th
Annual Report of the Secretaries of Defense, a two-hour conference
sponsored by the Southern Center for International Studies and held
at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came as the Clinton administration debates what
to do with $100 million that Congress allocated last month for
military assistance to Iraqi opposition groups trying to topple
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the former secretaries urged the Clinton
administration to send a clear, consistent message. Arab allies in
the Persian Gulf are hesitant to support the United States because
Clinton has not followed through on threats to attack Saddam, three
of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Saddam Hussein,'' said Donald Rumsfeld,
President Ford's defense minister from 1975 to 1977. ``His
neighbors believe that no matter what we do, he's still going to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our credibility is eroding,'' said Frank Carlucci, Reagan's
defense chief from 1987 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A seeming lack of consistency in foreign policy was one of the
major complaints the former officials voiced as they addressed a
wide array of topics, including the Balkans, Russia, Africa, Korea
and terrorism in general. Several of the secretaries, six of whom
served under Republican presidents, criticized what they see as an
absence of leadership under Democrat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to act decisively and firmly and you should never
make a threat you're not willing to carry out the next day,''
Weinberger said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States must pick its spots, said Melvin Laird,
Nixon's defense chief from 1968 to 1973: ``We're trying to do too
many things in too many places with too few resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were videotaped and are scheduled to be be shown
on GPTV on Tuesday, Dec. 15, at 11:30 p.m. and Sunday, Dec. 20, at
11:30 a.m.

 &HT;    Couple who got game tickets from slaying suspect horrified
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The man and woman who went to a Falcons football game
with Timothy Carl Dawson were horrified when they discovered their
tickets were taken from the victims of the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers
killings, police said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were afraid to go out after dark,'' said Maj. Mickey
Lloyd of the Atlanta Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The couple came forward after learning that Dawson was accused
of killing Phillip Dover, 31, of Gainesville, and his guests,
Gerrold Shropshire, 50, of Altamonte Springs, Fla., and Ron
Gutkowski, 51, of Leesburg, Fla. While the couple watched the
Falcons' game with the New Orleans Saints on Oct. 18, Atlanta
police were still combing the victims' bloody hotel room and trying
to identify the three bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The couple contacted Fulton County Police Chief Lewis Graham and
brought the ticket stubs to him, Lloyd said. The couple gave a
statement at Atlanta police headquarters Thursday night, and the
stubs were placed with other evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   He described the couple as ``not friends of Dawson, more like
acquaintances,'' and would not identify them. Graham deferred all
queries to Lloyd.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police spokesman John Quigley said detectives were
examining videotapes made by Georgia Dome security cameras to try
to cement that part of the case by spotting Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard issued a brief statement Friday
saying that indictments against Dawson, 37, are expected ``within
two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working round the clock on this case,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to facing three murder counts from the hotel
killings, Dawson is charged with a similar hotel robbery-murder in
College Park and with the killing of DeKalb County real estate
agent Raycell Mason, 44, in a home invasion Oct. 5. Detectives have
not ruled out the possibility of linking him to more cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dawson was arrested for speeding last weekend in Memphis, and
deputies discovered driver's licenses and credit cards belonging to
several of the victims in his car.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Tommy Hilfiger gave a birthday party for his
brother and business associate, Andy, he filled a rented penthouse
studio overlooking the Hudson River with a well-buffed,
ultrastylish crowd that seemed to have stepped from a Hilfiger bus
advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   There were Mary J. Blige and Aaliyah, the rhythm-and-blues
singers; Kidada Jones, the daughter of Quincy Jones and Peggy
Lipton, and a team of multi-ethnic adolescent models, grooving
dutifully on a stage in the latest Tommy parkas and cuffed jeans.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Mark Ronson, spinning records behind a pair
of turntables _ a flawlessly cute sometime model for the Hilfiger
company who also has the title of official company deejay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the quintessential Tommy boy,'' Tommy Hilfiger said,
beaming, from across the room. ``He's young, hip, educated,
good-looking and confident.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in faded Levi's and a Lacoste polo shirt, Ronson kept
nervously eyeing his Rolex. It was past midnight and he was late
for Super Kool, a weekly hip-hop party where he is the deejay at
Vanity, a club on East 23rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to be at Vanity a half-hour ago!'' he said in
an accent that is part private school, part ghetto rapper. He
embraced the Hilfiger brothers in parting, dragged his records to
the elevator and speed-dialed a car service on his Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually have a car waiting,'' he said, panting. ``But I have
so many gigs these days, I keep losing track of my schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Disk jockeys _ the people who work the turntables in dance clubs
and lounges, and sometimes in recording studios _ have emerged from
anonymity in the past decade, winning recognition as full-fledged
musicians, first as the rhythm section behind rappers, and later as
remixers of hit records for stars like Janet Jackson and Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are gaining status as night-life personalities,
becoming as important for drawing a crowd as the party's host or
the club itself. The latest and most visible celebrity deejay is
Ronson, 23, who is a son of Ann Jones, the socialite given to
flamboyant fashions, and the stepson of Mick Jones, the guitarist
for the '70s rock band Foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to doing things for the Hilfigers like flying to
Beverly Hills to open a new store, Ronson has toured on a private
jet with Wesley Snipes and Stephen Dorff to be the deejay at
opening-night parties for the movie ``Blade'' and has worked the
turntables at countless fashion-industry parties, whose invitations
prominently include his name. Last week he spun records at Sean
(Puffy) Combs' 29th birthday party, the overcrowded Titanic of
Fashion Week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity deejays didn't exist in the same way back in the
'80s,'' said Anita Sarko, a deejay who worked at Danceteria and
Area at the time. ``Promoters didn't automatically go, `What font
should I use when I put your name down?'''
</P>
<P>
   The status of deejays has soared thanks to a combination of
self-promotion, faddishness and the evolution of musical genres
like hip-hop and electronica that reconstruct fragments of other
songs. Jason Bentley, a deejay who has two radio shows in Los
Angeles and is a musical scout for Madonna's Maverick Records,
said: ``Deejay culture is alternative culture because it's the
mentality for our times: understanding the world as samples, sound
bites and information overload, and how we make sense of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when the CMJ Music Marathon brought some 1,000
alternative music acts to Manhattan clubs, performances by deejays
were prominent on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   No better evidence exists for the emergence of the deejay as a
cult figure than the way the deejay has been embraced by marketers
seeking street credibility to reach the wallets of young consumers.
Tommy Hilfiger, a pioneer in using the endorsements of hip-hop
musicians to make jeans and rugby shirts appear cool to both black
and white youths, is hardly alone in reaching out to deejays.
</P>
<P>
   Emporio Armani held a series of weekly deejay parties in October
at its minimalist Fifth Avenue boutique. And Diesel, the trendy
clothing company, has a deejay spinning records at its Lexington
Avenue store, which can resemble a rave with clothing racks. ``I
try to play music that will motivate the shoppers to buy,'' said
Graham Connelly, the staff deejay. ``Like when the men's outerwear
coats came in, I started playing more trip-hop, spacey-sounding
stuff, because they looked very futuristic to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And Absolut vodka, well known for advertisements using artists
famous to a select few, recently made over its Web site to focus on
what it calls ``the history of the DJ movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out and got the pulse on what people in their 20s were
doing today,'' said Pete Callero, an account director at
TBWA/Chiat/Day who helped conceive the new Absolut deejay online
site. ``We found out that the cool people weren't going to see
bands; they were going to see deejays. It was perfect for us,
because it hadn't yet hit a mainstream platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Goias, 21, a deejay, and Jauretsi Saizarbitoria, 26,
special events manager for Details magazine, recently started Tough
Guy, which they describe as a ``full service'' deejay company, to
profit from corporate interest in deejay culture. They have 40
deejays available for promotional events.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't invent the wheel on urban hip-hop marketing,'' Ms.
Saizarbitoria said. ``Hilfiger hit it first, and now other
companies want to do it, and they have no idea how. If you get the
deejay, then it's like infiltrating the whole club. Those are the
kids with the most disposable income. That's who you want buying
your jeans and your shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   When Quiksilver, the surf-wear maker that plans to expand its
business beyond surf shops, opened a store in SoHo in September, it
called on Tough Guy to help broaden its image. ``There weren't any
blond, blue-eyed surfers in NYC,'' Ms. Saizarbitoria said. ``So we
hooked them up with some deejays _ the urban equivalent of cool.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This pouncing upon a subculture for marketing purposes inspires
the usual mix of desire and revulsion by those who helped to build
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Simmons, a founder of Def Jam Records, recalls that New
York deejays like Grandmaster Flash and Love Bug Starsky were once
stars only to those who were true fans of hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have guys like Funk Master Flex deejaying at celebrity
events like Ted Fields' party in the Hamptons in front of Penny
Marshall and Ron Perelman,'' Simmons said. ``All of a sudden
companies like Bulgari are getting in on something four years too
late. They're just followers trying to cash in on something that is
widely accepted as cool. It's a trickle-up phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   Party and club deejays have become so high-profile that many
recording stars from rock and hip-hop have been recruited for guest
appearances behind the turntables. They include Boy George, Q-Tip
from a Tribe Called Quest, and Prince Paul from De La Soul. At the
opening recently of a Madison Avenue boutique for Bottega Veneta, a
luxury Italian leather-goods maker that seeks a more youthful
image, Perry Farrell, formerly of Jane's Addiction fame, was hired
to be the deejay, even though he had never worked in public behind
a pair of turntables before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came downstairs to the deejay booth and Perry was standing
there wondering why there was no sound coming out,'' said Ronson,
who was also spinning at the party. ``He had forgot to lower the
arm onto the record.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronson was not perturbed _ Farrell was one of his idols. Ronson
is a child of the Hamptons and Central Park West who grew up in the
orbit of family friends like Mick Jagger and Jann Wenner and
attended slumber parties with Sean Lennon in the Dakota. By the
time he was 16, he and the Whole Earth Mamas had a record contract
with Polygram. He landed his first deejay job, at Club USA, as a
senior at the Collegiate School because he was a friend of the
daughter of Peter Gatien, the club's owner.
</P>
<P>
   Today, among the deejays who are most consistently booked for
the plum movie and store parties and for club VIP rooms _ including
Jackie Christie, Victor Calderon, Max Glazer, Kaori and Jules _ no
one is as much in demand as Ronson. But he seems cheerfully
unimpressed with his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how I got so popular,'' he said with a
shrug one day at Bar Pitti in Greenwich Village as he wiped the
sleep from his eyes and ate an afternoon breakfast of carpaccio. He
was to meet a promoter later in the day to talk about a party for
Durex condoms with Antonio Sabato Jr. ``The fashion industry is
like that,'' he said. ``If they get one name in their head, then
suddenly everyone has to have that person at their parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less mystified by Ronson's rise. Some night-life
insiders say it has everything to do with his family connections.
``It's a lot like Hollywood,'' said Ms. Christie, who has worked as
a deejay at New York clubs for eight years. ``The kids of the
Barrymores, Coppolas and Fondas have a better chance of becoming a
movie star than some kid from Nebraska. It's the same with being a
deejay.''
</P>
<P>
   At least two other children of celebrities in New York _ Drena
De Niro, a daughter of Robert De Niro, and Ethan Browne, a son of
Jackson Browne _ are also deejays.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 21, don't have a job and you're invited to every
trendy party in town because of your parents, that is a way to make
some money if you're out till 4 in the morning anyway,'' said Peter
Davis, a night-life columnist for Paper magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones-Ronson family has such strong name recognition that
Mark's younger sister Sammantha, 21, was hired to spin records on
Tuesdays and Thursdays (the hottest nights) at Veruka (one of the
hottest clubs), even though she was an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hired because they wanted my brother and he was too
busy,'' Ms. Ronson, a tomboyish New York University student, said
the other day while she was working as a deejay at a premiere party
at Veruka for John Waters' film ``Pecker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even know how to turn on a turntable,'' she said with
a giggle. ``But deejaying is fun. Plus, if I'm going to go out all
the time, I might as well get paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The money is not that great. Ronson, the top of the heap for
so-called lounge deejays, who play more intimate places than big
clubs like Tunnel, said he earns $500 to $750 to work Friday nights
in the VIP room at Life and $1,500 to $2,000 for a high-profile
fashion event. Average party deejays make around $250 a night; a
rock star like Boy George making a guest appearance can earn
$20,000 for a store event.
</P>
<P>
   Ronson maintains that at most clubs where he works, few people
have a clue who his mother is, or remember Foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then, there might be the odd person who cares
more that my mom's this famous socialite, or that my dad was a rock
star,'' he said. ``But if one of the Rockefeller kids tried to get
up and deejay, I don't think people would hire them because they
were from a good family. If the music was bad, people wouldn't
dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronson was defended by Funk Master Flex, a deejay who has a show
on WQHT (Hot 97) radio, appears on MTV and runs his own record
label.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who his family is,'' he said. ``He knows how
to balance the room and rock a party with just the right amount of
reggae, hip-hop and soul. That's why he's in demand. Anyone who
criticizes him for being cute and from a famous family is just a
player-hater.''
</P>
<P>
   Three nights after Andy Hilfiger's birthday party, Ronson was
the deejay in the VIP room at Life's red-hot Friday night party.
</P>
<P>
   Mariah Carey grooved her shoulders back and forth at a banquette
with the rappers Jay-Z and John Forte and a trio of bodyguards. At
the next table, Oliver Stone was surrounded by a group of giggly
young Asian women. A small-time promoter named Jesus, dressed in a
white robe and blond dreadlocks, danced toward a model in a leather
hooded dress and discreetly handed her a flier for a party where he
is the host.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is your party like this?'' the model asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My party is a little bit more mellow,'' he admitted
sheepishly. ``We don't have a Mark Ronson.''

A MEDIA FLING FOR A MEDIA DOYEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 08, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You knew it had been a good week for Democrats when
Teddy Kennedy got up to sing.
</P>
<P>
   To the tune of ``May-ree, May-ree,'' he kicked off the salutes
to Mary McGrory, the Boston-bred columnist who keeps everybody
honest in Washington, pontificating pressperson as well as
persiflaging politician. The SRO National Press club dinner crowd
then heard Russell Baker, Timesman-turned-PBS cultcha-vultcha,
skewer the singing senator as ``the Irish Pavarotti.''
</P>
<P>
   The speeches just got better. Roger Mudd unrolled a droll
description of life at the loudly mourned and, alas, defunct
Washington Star, where McGrory rose from the lowly rank of book
reviewer to become the furnisher of color, mood, texture, and tone
to the Army-McCarthy hearings of the late '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the black-and-white oversimplifications of newspaper
accounts of the era, McGrory was a pioneer in the
not-yet-art-but-definitely-different style of adding the pastels,
the nuances, the revealing aside, the devastating characterization.
Having learned her poetry at home from her revered postman father,
and her Latin grammar at Girl's Latin, McGrory had her tools early.
</P>
<P>
   But it took editor Newbold ``Newby'' Noyes of the Star, a master
at matching talent to opportunity, to yank McGrory from underneath
the Book-of-the-Month Club backlist and set her tracing the spoor
of Joe McCarthy. No problem. Having come from the brawny, braying
Boston wards, McGrory explained in a pithy aside, where politics
was discussed at every family dinner, she recognized ``just another
Irish bully'' when she saw one.
</P>
<P>
   The Star was that rarest of newspaper properties, a writers'
paper, where insufficient coin was being minted to have serious
bean counters at the throttle. As a result, the inmates ran the
asylum, and if you lived in Washington in those days, the Star was
a must-read, even as it dwindled into the dust of economic
insufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Post matriarch Katharine Graham alluded wistfully to
the Star's grip on the heartstrings of journalism's savvier
practicioners when she sighed that Mary didn't love the Post in
quite the same way she'd loved the Star. It's true. If you grew up
in Roslindale, you never forget where you first found your life's
work. Noyes, Mary said simply, ``gave me a break.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Timeswoman Maureen Dowd, the reigning Mistress of
Archness on the Self-Obsessed Capital of the World, lobbed some
genteel barbs, which McGrory returned with the same blend of
sweetness and sarcasm. This pair is well-matched, separated by
decades but twinned in acerbity. With Dowd as with McGrory, All
Gall is Divided into Three Parts: columns about yesterday, today,
and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, delivering some sort of lifetime achievenment award
from her fellow scriveners, was broadcast by C-SPAN, and attracted
half pantheon of print, as well as luminaries like Walter Cronkite.
But at heart it was just another chinwag, reporters dishing the
dirt and chewing the fat.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory had requested an opening hymn by a longtime friend who
is a Salvation Army colonel. Colonel ``Ernie'' confided before
leveling his baritone at the crowd that ``Mary used to write about
us'' whenever the Sally Army needed something extra-bad.
</P>
<P>
   With so many power brokers in the hall, if everyone went home
and next day did something for the downtrodden, there'd be little
left for McGrory and her scathing conscience-kicking columns to
right. Alas, the world has too many downtrodden, and not enough
McGrorys.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``the small victories'' she'd help bring to pass, the
honoree admitted toward evening's end. If an antiwar demonstrator
got trashed in the back of a cop wagon, or a prisoner of conscience
was being rudely treated in a federal lockup, a whispered word to
McGrory could unleash an unabashed retreat by the forces of
inertia, bureaucracy, or studied governmental indifference.
</P>
<P>
   William James used to brag that at Harvard, ``our
undisciplinables'' were the university's proudest product. At
Emmanuel College, they may feel the same after adding up the good
works of McGrory's brave-hearted liberalism. She can be as tough on
friend as on foe, which may be why Clinton &AMP; Clinton sent their
encomium via mail.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unexpected triumphs of election night, Bill &AMP; Hill
are still off the social circuit, especially wherever the Fourth
Estate is arrayed in full formal regalia. They're not quite ready
to call him Franklin Delano Clinton, after the Democrats pulled off
a stunt not seen here since 1934. Not for two-thirds of a century
had the party holding the White House actually gained House seats
in an off-year election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pachyderms rampant!'' was former governor Bill Weld's playful
proclamation four years ago when he won his second,
not-to-be-completed term. ``Donkeys delirious'' was the rejoinder
Tuesday night in a number of races, if not the Bay State
governor's. Parties come and go, politicians ditto, but the press
is as perennial as seasonal change.
</P>
<P>
   Mary McGrory just clocked 80 on life's speedometer, but she made
plain to Kay Graham and all the other newspaper people in the hall
she wants to keep on keeping on, piling up those ``small
victories'' that can make so much difference in the lives of people
with no juice, clout, money, connections.
</P>
<P>
   There is a century-old axiom, first voiced in New York by
then-governor David Bennett Hill, when the gold vs. silver fight
fractured the Democratic party. Determined to sit out the William
Jennings Bryan tornado on behalf of free silver: ``I am a Democrat
still ... very still,'' quoth Hill. There are still lots of
Democrats like that back in her native Boston, but my pal Mary made
this plain Thursday night: She is a newspaperwoman still, and so
she will remain, and there is nothing ``still'' about her.

UNIVERSITY COMPLIES WITH ANTI-AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION INITIATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., Calif., La., Texas, Miss.)  (mk) 
 By ETHAN BRONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first concrete result of Tuesday's passage of an
anti-affirmative action referendum in Washington state, the
University of Washington says it is regretfully suspending its
30-year practice of race-conscious admissions.
</P>
<P>
   University officials say they are also reviewing a set of
programs that may be affected by the initiative, which bars
``preferential treatment'' to any group based on race or gender in
the public sector. Those other programs include ones that encourage
women to enter the field of engineering and African-Americans to go
into mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   While the university, whose main campus is in Seattle, does not
have a large minority enrollment, officials there say they have
relied on race-conscious admissions policies to increase those
numbers over the years.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 members of the current freshman class, representing
some 24 percent of its minority students, would not have been
admitted without race-conscious policies, according to Ernest
Morris, vice president for student affairs. The university
calculates that over the past three decades, it has admitted and
graduated more than 5,000 minority students through their
preferential admissions plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken steps to suspend the use of race and gender in
admissions,'' Morris said. ``But we are determined to do everything
we can within the law to maintain the diversity of the student
body. The numbers are relatively small as is, so we're just going
to have to look very carefully at ways to get those students to
enroll here.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the undergraduate population at the University of Washington
_ the state's only public university that says it has used
affirmative action in its admissions _ some 2.8 percent are black,
3.8 percent are Hispanic American and 1.5 percent American Indian.
Asian-Americans, who make up 19 percent of the student body, are
not considered ``underrepresented minorities'' by the university
and their admissions would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   System-wide, there are 37,500 students, both undergraduate and
graduate, at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is the second state, after California, to pass a
voter initiative banning preferential treatment, and the language
of the resolution in Washington, called I-200, mirrors that of the
1996 California initiative known as Proposition 209.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi have also been barred from
considering race and gender in university admissions by a federal
court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington initiative, which passed with 58 percent of the
vote, says: ``The state shall not discriminate against, or grant
preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of
race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of
public employment, public education or public contracting.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state attorney general's office in Seattle says there is
an important difference between its new law and the one in
California. In California, the resolution amended the state
constitution and so overrode any conflicting statutes. The
Washington initiative is simply a statute like any other and must
be interpreted in light of competing statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Since there are other state laws calling for ``affirmative
action'' or enhanced opportunities for women and minority-group
members in state employment and contracting, the meaning of barring
``preferential treatment'' is unclear, the office said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Hughes, a senior assistant attorney general
representing the university, said there were no conflicting
statutes regarding university admissions, so affirmative action in
admissions could be suspended without confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Other university programs that may be affected will continue
while the meaning of the law is worked out. Such programs include
ones that encourage women and minority members already at the
university to go into engineering and math, areas heavily dominated
by white men.
</P>
<P>
   It is also unclear how much recruiting and outreach to
minorities and women would be permissible under the new statute,
she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The university's law school is the defendant in a reverse
discrimination class-action lawsuit over the practice of admitting
minority students with lower grades and test scores than whites.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, similar to one against the University of Michigan,
was filed in 1997 by the Center for Individual Rights, which is
based in Washington D.C., as part of its campaign to end
race-conscious admissions policies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hughes, the university lawyer, said that since the main
goal of the lawsuit is to end race-conscious admissions practices,
and that has now occurred through I-200, there seemed little reason
for the suit to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Terence Pell, senior counsel at the center, said that if I-200
really ends such admissions practices, ``that is a tremendous
victory.'' But, he added, his group is waiting to see how the
university changes its admissions policies in practice before
taking its next step.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Schnapper, a law professor at the University of Washington,
said another complication of I-200 is how it affects American
Indian tribes, of which there are many in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said laws giving American Indians special privileges are a
vital part of state policy and that federal policies toward Indians
are based not on race or efforts at diversity but on political
arrangements resulting from numerous conflicts and treaties over
the years.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)  
 (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deals, deals and more deals. Despite the summer riot in
financial markets, 1998 may be remembered as the Year of the Deal.
</P>
<P>
   New mergers _ and worries about some older ones _ have been on
the market's mind. Since the middle of October, when the Federal
Reserve cut short-term interest rates for the second time in less
than three weeks, a half-dozen combinations worth $1 billion or
more have been announced.
</P>
<P>
   But the departures of James Dimon, president of Citigroup, and
David Coulter, president of BankAmerica, cast doubt on whether
their respective, newly merged organizations would prove to be
harmonious, profitable marriages.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent conversation, Tom Burnett, director of Merger
Insight, an institutional research service that publishes daily
reports for clients who own takeover stocks, shared some of his
thoughts on the combination game, and how to play it. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you see trouble brewing at either Citigroup or
the combined BankAmerica and Nationsbank?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. There was a lot of euphoria after the Citicorp-Travelers deal
was announced, and we thought a lot of that was misplaced, even
though we did not expect the Russian turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   It will take some time to generate the synergies and
cross-selling opportunities John Reed and Sandy Weill were talking
about when they announced the deal. In a highly regulated industry
like banking, you can't expect a bonanza overnight. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Did James Dimon's dismissal surprise you?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I was surprised the stock didn't fall more than it did after
that happened, because I saw it as a sign of overall management
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   But when all is said and done, this is Sandy Weill's deal.
Having a strong personality on the buyer's side is very important,
because you need strong-willed senior management to make sure the
merger happens. A far greater risk to the deal, in my view, is what
happens in Washington. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How so?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. With the defeat of Sen. Al D'Amato, who was chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee and was in favor of bank legislation
reform, no one knows what sort of legislative thrust we will get
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, who is next in line to be chairman, has put out
an olive branch, saying he is not adamantly against reform. But he
has been a big opponent in the past.
</P>
<P>
   That could put a bit of a cloud over Citigroup, because it is
hard to plan budgeting and capital spending for insurance, which is
one-third of their major operations, that they may not own in three
years. I think Citigroup would be very unhappy if they had to give
that part of their business up. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is the situation at Nationsbank different?(end
italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Very much so. Hugh McColl had a vision to build a
coast-to-coast banking operation, but unlike Sandy Weill he already
has a formal approval, from the Federal Reserve O.K.'ing the
merger. Those things are hard to get.
</P>
<P>
   Going forward, all McColl has to do is grow the business.
</P>
<P>
   People are talking about David Coulter's forced resignation
right now, but in five years I don't think people will remember his
name. But they will remember McColl's, because he built the first
coast-to-coast banking empire. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You have said that the characteristics of a
successful merger tend to vary from one industry to the next.
Still, there must be some generic guidelines to help investors
determine if they should hold, sell or buy.(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be careful of mergers of equals that end up with
co-managers, like the HFS-CUC deal. That usually leads to
management succession and accountability problems. In the period
between when a deal is announced and consummated, it is very
important to read senior management well, to make sure they are
committed, because there is a certain amount of pressure that
bubbles up.
</P>
<P>
   Always invest in a company with a clear leader and clear
reporting relationships. DaimlerChrysler has a clear organization
chart. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has a clear delineation of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   British Petroleum and Amoco is another good example. They have
clearly labeled what the company in Illinois is going to do and
what the company in the United Kingdom will be doing. It should be
a big success. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is the pace of activity likely to slow next
year?(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have had a slowdown from the first half of the year, and I
think it will remain slow until we see if we are going into a
recession. If companies sense that, they will pare activity. In the
greater scheme of things, recessions are near-term events and a
merger is a long-term decision. But the near-term impact can be
painful if you pay for an earnings stream that dries up if a
recession hits.

   Back in 1993, Colgate-Palmolive chief executive Reuben Mark
received 2 million stock options in addition to his salary and
bonus. Colgate's board explained that the huge grant was the only
one Mark would receive until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996, Colgate hired two consulting firms, Towers Perrin
and Hewitt Associates, to review the company's
executive-compensation plans. The consultants found that Mark's
long-term incentive package had fallen ``significantly below the
median'' of companies they used for comparison. So in 1997, a year
early, the board granted him 2.6 million more options _ a package
it promised would have to last Mark through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In the grand scheme of things, giving Colgate's chief a new
grant of stock options a year early is not such a big deal. Sure,
his total compensation went up 83.5 percent annually over the last
four years, while Colgate's total returns rose an average of 25.9
percent. But the company has outperformed the market, and the stock
must keep rising for Mark to exercise his options at a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this and hundreds of other examples, each with their own
twists, help illustrate how hard Corporate America works to make
sure that few chief executives feel underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Through an elaborate process fraught with conflicts of interest
and marred by questionable assumptions, executive pay is often set
with methods imported from Lake Wobegon, Garrison Keillor's
imaginary place where ``all the children are above average.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is not just the hundred-million-dollar payouts that a
few chief executives collect by reaping the rewards of huge
stock-option grants. Nor is it simply that some executives whose
companies do poorly are nonetheless richly rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, an examination of the interplay among chief executives,
corporate directors and the consultants who help set pay levels
calls into question whether ``pay for performance'' _ the mantra of
executive compensation for the last two decades _ has been
distorted almost beyond recognition by the maneuvering that goes on
behind closed boardroom doors.
</P>
<P>
   Performance certainly plays a role in executive compensation.
But other forces conspire to escalate pay beyond anything
performance strictly justifies:
</P>
<P>
   _ By setting their chief executives' pay above the median of
whatever peer group of companies they choose for comparison, boards
constantly ratchet up the compensation base line. If all companies
in the peer group aim to pay in the top quarter of the group, for
example, that level will just keep rising. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Top executives, rather than the board of directors, typically
control the hiring and firing of consultants who are brought in to
design pay packages.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many directors who sit on their board's compensation
committees have ties to management that raise doubts about their
independence and objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   _ Boards justify raises by saying they have to pay their chief
executives ``competitively'' in order to retain them, even if those
executives are underperforming. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such mechanisms work against anyone trying to set compensation
at appropriate levels, said Robin Ferracone, president of SCA
Consulting, a compensation and management consulting firm based in
Los Angeles. ``Those forces tend to loom large and lead to
abuses,'' she said. ``And when you have a whole string of them,
shareholders haven't gained a thing. Instead, they've paid out a
ton of money to keep people around who are underperforming.''
</P>
<P>
   A result of all these forces is reflected in a study conducted
for The New York Times by Graef Crystal, who edits a San
Diego-based newsletter on executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal looked at the performance of 383 large companies where
the same chief executive was in office from 1993 to 1997. An
investor who put $100 in those companies at the end of 1993 would
have had $202.10 four years later, for an annual return of 19.2
percent. So if the pay of the companies' chiefs tracked that
performance, their average compensation would roughly have doubled,
from $2.78 million in 1993 to about $6 million four years later.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, according to Crystal's analysis, the executives' pay
climbed 38.1 percent a year, to an average of $10.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to blame for this gap between pay and performance?
Experts in both pay and corporate governance say that there is no
single culprit _ except, perhaps, unchecked human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not evil of management to seek the highest possible pay
package they can, because we all try to maximize our value,'' said
Charles Elson, a professor at the Stetson University College of Law
in St. Petersburg, Fla., and a director of three public companies.
``And it's not evil for a compensation consultant to have an
affinity for management. Nor is it evil for a director to feel an
affinity for the CEO who appointed them. But it's a process that
creates a one-sided result.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, pay consultants say many directors have become more
vigilant in recent years, in part because rich compensation
packages have often come under sharp attack by large shareholders,
including pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of backbone and independence has increased by
several orders of magnitude,'' said Ira Kay, global practice
director for compensation consulting in the New York office of
Watson Wyatt Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the average chief executive's pay rising twice as
fast as performance over the last four years, such vigilance has
not forged a very strong link between pay and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Running a large corporation requires a rare set of skills. So it
is perhaps understandable that directors would consider their chief
executive an above-average boss worthy of above-average
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   But many companies set their executives' pay by looking at what
similar companies pay their executives. And if they all are trying
to make their chiefs feel special _ say, by paying them above their
peer group's scale _ that can create powerful updrafts for
executive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge problem with those surveys,'' said Jay Lorsch,
a Harvard Business School professor who specializes in corporate
board issues. ``They are self-fulfilling prophecies. There is a
ratcheting effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies in the Dow Jones industrial average, for
instance, pledge to keep their executives' pay well above the
median of their respective peer groups.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris' goal is to compensate its executives in the
``upper quadrant'' of its peer group. The same goes for Coca-Cola,
while IBM shoots for the 75th percentile. American Express uses the
third quartile as its reference point.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Dow industrial companies that aim to compensate
their executives at levels comparable to that of their peers. GTE's
proxy states that the company's philosophy is to be 10 percent to
15 percent above ``a median grant posture'' of its comparison group
of companies for long-term incentive pay. From 1993 to 1997, the
company's stock rose at an average rate of 17.8 percent a year; the
pay of GTE chief executive Charles Lee rose an average of 75.8
percent a year, to $13.35 million from $2.15 million. Lee received
a new grant of stock options every year from 1993 to 1997, for a
total of more than one million options.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bulk of the chairman's compensation is in long-term
incentives that are directly tied to shareholder value,'' a GTE
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Options sometimes are used to motivate underperforming
executives, and at other times to reward good past performance. But
options issued simply to keep an executive apace with his peer
group may have nothing to do with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies first settle on an executive's compensation and
then determine what performance will be expected of him, said Jean
Head Sisco, a member of the compensation committees of Textron,
Nieman Marcus, and Chiquita Brands International.
</P>
<P>
   ``The status quo should not allow a person to reach the upper
percentiles,'' said Ms. Sisco, who is also a partner in Sisco
Associates, a management consulting firm based in Washington. ``But
it is obvious that at certain companies, that is allowed to happen.
Just studying the proxies tells you that.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company's directors want independent expertise as they
design their executives' pay packages, they rely on the advice of a
small coterie of compensation consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the selection and hiring of the consultants
is typically controlled by management itself. If the executives do
not like the opinions offered by their consultants, they can easily
replace them with others more willing to act as their advocates
before the board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with 10 consultants, estimates of the number of
their prospective clients who have shopped this way for more
accommodating advice ranged from 5 percent to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A more pliant consultant can, for example, select a more
favorable group of peer companies on which to base a chief
executive's recommended pay. Or the consultant can make adjustments
that benefit the executive in the various parts of a pay package,
including salary, bonus, restricted stock and many forms of
long-term incentive compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, anything can be justified in executive
compensation, because there are so many rules to the game,'' said
Judith Fischer, publisher of Executive Compensation Reports, a
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in the field of corporate governance generally agree
that it is a mistake to leave management in charge of hiring
compensation consultants. Instead, they say, it should be the
responsibility of the board's compensation committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the relationship that counts,'' said Ira Millstein, a
partner at the New York law firm of Weil, Gotshal &AMP; Manges who
advises many boards on governance principles. ``Who do you report
to? Who hires you? Who fires you? My answer to all three is that it
should be the compensation committee.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be unusual, of course, for a company to report in its
annual proxy statement that it had left the selection of its
compensation consultant to top management. But many compensation
consultants say boards often defer to management's advice on which
firm to hire. And some large companies acknowledge that their
compensation committees follow the lead of management.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 proxy for Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber, for example, the
compensation committee said it ``met with the chief executive
officer to receive his recommendations regarding 1997 adjustments''
of top executives. It added that it relied principally on surveys
to set pay levels, but also considered the chief executive's
recommendations ``on certain subjective factors, including his
evaluation of the performance of each executive officer, the
performance of the company and general economic and competitive
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   A Goodyear spokesman said that the chief executive did not make
recommendations regarding his own compensation, and that his
guidance on his aides' compensation did not influence board
decisions on his pay.
</P>
<P>
   At other companies, like Cummins Engine, the process is more
clearly driven by directors on the compensation committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thought of compensation consultants rather like
auditors,'' said Hanna Holborn Gray, the retired president of the
University of Chicago who has been the chairwoman of Cummins'
compensation committee for six years. ``We need an independent
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Who serves on the compensation committee is as important as
where the committee gets its advice.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 report, the National Association of Corporate
Directors wrote that compensation committees ``should be made up
exclusively of independent outside directors selected by the
outside directors and approved by the whole board.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's rationale? ``Achieving both the appearance and
the reality of independence demands no less,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this unequivocal recommendation, however, many
compensation committees have members who at least have the
potential to engage in mutual back-scratching with the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Directorship, a consulting firm in Greenwich, Conn., said 67 of
the 839 large public companies in its data base have current or
former executives of the company on the compensation committee. And
at 12 of those 67, the committee's chairman is a current or former
executive. Among them is Occidental Petroleum, which has been
criticized by institutional investors over the $95 million paid
last year to its chief executive, Ray Irani, to replace his old
contract with a new one.
</P>
<P>
   A separate study of 1,197 companies by Investor Responsibility
Research Center, based in Washington, found that 522 directors on
compensation committees had affiliations _ as suppliers or former
employees _ that called into question their independence.
</P>
<P>
   One example is MBNA Corp. of Wilmington, Del., one of the
nation's leading issuers of credit cards. The chairman of its
compensation committee is James Berick, whose law firm provides
services to MBNA. Also on the committee is Benjamin Civiletti, the
U.S. attorney general from 1979 to 1981, who is now chairman of
another law firm that counts MBNA among its clients.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What will slow the rise in executive pay?
</P>
<P>
   A bear market would help, many experts say, because shareholders
would start voting down management plans for issuing shares to
reward top executives and other employees. Even now, votes against
such proposals are rising.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, experts say, the key is for directors to act more
like shareholders. Charles Elson, a Stetson College law professor
who serves on three corporate boards, argued that director nominees
should be required to buy a considerable amount of company stock _
say, $100,000 worth _ before joining a board and then be
compensated with stock for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Elson said, directors will consider the company's money
their own and be more likely to resist a chief executive who wants
an unreasonably large share of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, any penny that is overpaid comes out of the
director's pocket as opposed to some vague force known as the
company,'' he said. The amounts involved, he acknowledged, may
amount to no more than pennies a share, but people nevertheless
have a keen sense of what is rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Elson has seen the process work first-hand. When he was
appointed a director of Sunbeam Corp. in 1996, he was required to
invest $100,000 of his own money to buy 5,000 shares in the
company. Indeed, Elson had advised Albert Dunlap, then Sunbeam's
chief executive, to impose the requirement on all his directors.
</P>
<P>
   With the additional compensation he received in Sunbeam stock in
subsequent years, the total value of Elson's holdings rose to
$250,000. But after the company foundered earlier this year under
Dunlap's leadership, the value of Elson's holdings fell steeply, to
less than $50,000 at one point.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Elson who, in June, made the motion to the Sunbeam
board to remove Dunlap. The Sunbeam board has been widely reported
to be fighting with Dunlap over his severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a large equity stake in a company,'' Elson said,
``really wakes you up.''

INVESTING WITH: WILLIAM H. GROSS OF PIMCO TOTAL RETURN FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)

346-9867.) 
 (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   William H. Gross may never be popularly seen as challenging
Peter Lynch's or Warren Buffett's status as America's pre-eminent
market sages. After all, what are the chances of hitting investing
grand slams _ with their attendant publicity _ in boring old bonds?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're quite good. So Gross is gathering as much
acclaim as a bond investor can hope for. Pimco Advisors Holdings,
his employer in Newport Beach, Calif., expects that by the end of
the month it will complete its own TV studio so Gross can better
accommodate the growing requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, 54, is portfolio manager of Pimco's Total Return fund,
which has ranked in the top percentile of its peers in virtually
all the standard return periods of the last decade, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. This year, it
gained 8.7 percent through Oct. 31, compared with 6.3 percent for
its peer funds and 7.7 percent for its benchmark, the Lehman
Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. In the last decade, Total Return has
returned 10.26 percent, versus 7.5 percent for its peers and 9
percent for the index.
</P>
<P>
   Widely available to individuals only since last spring _ the
minimum investment, previously $1 million, is now $250 _ the fund
has ballooned to $22.69 billion, twice as large as its nearest
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, convinced that financial and economic
contagion from Asia was proving more acute than widely recognized,
Gross swung from what he called a milquetoast bullish stance to
what became by summer a bold bet on lower rates. That was just in
time, as a safety-obsessed market drove down the yield on Treasury
securities, which moves in the opposite direction from prices. The
benchmark 30-year bond briefly touched 4.75 percent, the lowest
yield in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about a month ago, Gross retreated a bit, cutting the
duration of his portfolio to a somewhat less aggressive 4.6 years,
from 5. (Duration refers to the average weighted life of all
payments related to a bond, interest as well as the return of
principal when it comes due. Maturity, which is usually longer than
duration, refers simply to the time before a bond is due.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a bit off the table,'' he said, adding that Total
Return was still primed for slight declines in rates over the next
six months _ perhaps to 5 percent, from the current 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of general bond portfolios usually adopt the
``top-down'' approach to investing, which gives the most weight to
economic trends. That is because bonds _ at least until recently _
have tended to move in tandem with economic forces.
</P>
<P>
   But to Gross, who contends that the timing of the next recession
is unknowable, there is more involved than just trying to plumb the
business cycle or the impact of distress in Asia. In what Gross
calls Pimco's ``super tops-down'' approach, he steps back to assess
longer-term fundamentals like the graying of the populations of
industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things, like demographics, are known with almost complete
certainty,'' he said. The same, he added, goes for the trend toward
globalization and the worldwide buildup of corporate and government
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Besides deciding on a portfolio's proper duration, bond managers
must also fathom the yield curve _ the array of fixed-income rates
ranging from a matter of days to 30 years or more _ to determine
the best mix for producing that duration.
</P>
<P>
   One common approach, called the ``barbell,'' involves big
commitments to the short and long ends of the curve. That method is
attractive when the long-term sector is expected to do well
relative to intermediate-maturity bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the ``bullet'' _ a heavy concentration in
intermediates due, say, between 2 and 10 years _ a strategy toward
which Gross aggressively shifted the Total Return portfolio in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main statements that the portfolio is making is
that it's fairly concentrated in intermediate maturities,'' Gross
said. ``The bullet strategy,'' he added, ``does well when the
Federal Reserve is in the market, so to speak, and is actively
lowering interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Before July, his portfolio had been in a half-barbell,
half-bullet position. That was before he perceived the Federal
Reserve as being seriously concerned about the possibility of a
global meltdown and likely to lower short-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   Total Return, which Gross calls a plain-vanilla bond fund, uses
no leverage, though some 20 percent of its Treasury portfolio is in
higher-returning futures. Because of quarterly expirations, they
tend to magnify the portfolio's turnover rate, which is 173
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Total Return could invest as much as 20 percent of its
portfolio overseas _ and half of this in emerging markets _ Gross
keeps foreign exposure to a minimum and says such holdings should
be confined to the highest possible quality. ``I've not had a
Russian bond and never will,'' said Gross, who is no stranger to
risk-taking: He played blackjack professionally in Las Vegas for
five months after college.
</P>
<P>
   He also doesn't much favor corporate issues these days, even
though this sector has improved lately after its problems helped
prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates again last month, outside a
scheduled policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would continue to be leery about corporates,'' Gross said,
citing what he considers significant risk that they might go into
default in a recession. ``We're hunkering down and climbing into
the bomb shelter,'' he said, keeping to shorter maturities and
stressing high quality.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he added, corporate spreads and yields will become
more attractive, and that ``will be a better time to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is Gross' impact and reputation, however, that he must
shroud such decisions in CIA-like secrecy, using as many as 10
dealers, few if any of them privy to more than minimal information.
</P>
<P>
   He checks Bloomberg and Telerate monitors in his basement at
home before heading for work but doesn't take action before
reaching the office, usually by 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Duke University, Gross honed his
mathematical and analytical skills at the blackjack tables, where
he turned $200 into $10,000 by playing every day for 16 hours,
earning what today would be minimum wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the best,'' said Gross, a card counter who said
he has been thrown out of more than one casino. ``I proved a point,
that I could beat the system.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Navy, he intended to find a stock-market
job, but wound up as a credit analyst in the bond department of
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance, from which Pimco evolved. Now he's
the biggest owner of Pimco and the closest thing in the bond
business to a cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   Gross has relatively little involvement in Pimco's management, ,
though he was a co-founder. ``It's very difficult to manage a
business and run a portfolio at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This results in a relatively modest salary of $200,000, but he
makes many times that much in performance pay tied to Pimco's
bottom line. Because he isn't an executive, the amount is not found
in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As for investing his personal fortune, which runs into nine
figures, Gross said the portion not in Pimco Advisors is mostly
invested in the Total Return fund and in municipal bonds that he
selects himself.
</P>
<P>
   Something else he has been doing is buying more stock, actually
partnership interests, in his own company, Pimco Advisors Holdings,
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Pimco, growing at 15 percent a year, has a bond-like yield,
largely because it pays no corporate-level income tax, which is
levied against investors. But it provides a way for anybody to bet
on Gross' continued success with bonds, about half Pimco's total
business, while being well paid in the interim.

 &HT;    THE REAL ISSUES IN THE MICROSOFT CASE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Nov. 8.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Imagine if you owned a telephone that you could use
only to make and receive calls to and from your boss, your doctor
and the members of your immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   Such a phone might be of some value to you. But the real value
of telephones is that they can reach billions of people throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, in the realm of personal computers, an operating
system gains immeasurable value to users if it's able to handle all
manner of useful applications _ ones that help us write letters,
balance our checkbooks or surf the Internet _ and have them all
work in harmony with each other.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the core realities behind the landmark antitrust case
against Microsoft Corp., due to enter its fourth week on Monday in
Courtroom Two of the federal courthouse here before U.S. District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that courtroom, most economists who have studied the case
concur that Microsoft is a monopolist. In fact, recent industry
studies show that of every 100 personal computers being shipped
today, 97 will contain one flavor or another of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson must wrestle with the issue of whether Microsoft has
illegally leveraged that monopoly to fence off for itself still
other software markets, such as access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the small courtroom, Microsoft's lawyers dispute the monopoly
tag, citing fringe operating systems such as Linux or Apple
Computer Inc.'s Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   In mounting a second line of defense, they argue that in the
rough-and-tumble high-tech world, even today's monopoly power may
wind up as tomorrow's has-been firm.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of this, they cite IBM Corp., which fought the
Justice Department to a draw more than a decade after being accused
of monopolizing mainframe computers. By the time the government
finally dropped the case, the mainframe business had become static
as sales of personal computers took off.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has also raised an ``everybody-does-it'' line of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, from Microsoft's perspective, Netscape
Communications Corp. basked in a monopoly on Internet browsers
until Microsoft began giving its Internet Explorer away.
</P>
<P>
   In a like vein, the software giant from Redmond, Wash., argues
that Apple would control the software market for video and sound
content through its QuickTime technology had it not been challenged
by Microsoft's media player and by RealNetworks(cq) Inc., in which
Microsoft has purchased a stake.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Microsoft contends it has fused Internet Explorer
directly into Windows 98 because that's what its customers wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The company contends in court that it should be free to blend
any and all applications directly into Windows. That position
appears to trouble the judge.
</P>
<P>
   But, in practice, there is little that Jackson _ or, for that
matter, even the U.S. Supreme Court _ can do about it, since the
code has been so tightly woven into the latest versions of Windows
that the product would stop working properly if it were to be
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not at all clear what remedies the government would
seek, and the courts would agree to impose, if Microsoft is found
guilty as charged of having broken the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Department of Justice nor the 20 states that have
joined in bringing the case have sought financial reparations from
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint does seek to recover ``costs'' from Microsoft _
such as the sums spent to prepare dozens of videotaped depositions.
Likewise, the state attorneys general, according to their
complaint, have asked Jackson to award them ``their costs of suit,
including reasonable attorneys' fees.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to Microsoft, such costs and fees are pocket change
compared to what is at stake should it lose the case. Presumably,
Microsoft would be vulnerable to civil suits filed by injured
rivals who could use a guilty verdict to pursue damage awards
potentially worth billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Monday's witness in the slow-moving trial _ original estimates
of a six- to eight-week trial now range up to Valentine's Day _
will again be Apple Senior Vice President Avadis Tevanian Jr. After
that, prosecutors may show more videotaped testimony from Microsoft
chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's strategists believe their fortunes in Courtroom Two
will improve when its expert witnesses take the witness stand and,
in a reversal of roles, face a grilling from the federal and
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among these witnesses is Richard Schmalensee, acting dean
of the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   William Neukom, Microsoft's senior vice president for law, who
has sat at the head of the defense table for the entire course of
the trial, says Schmalensee ``will refute the government's case and
prove that our inclusion of Internet technologies in Windows was
designed to provide new tools and innovations for consumers and
software developers.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the trustbusters intend to double-dip into
expert pool before resting their case by calling economists
Franklin Fisher and Frederick Warren-Boulton.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who is also now at MIT, played a key role in the
drawn-out IBM litigation. Warren-Boulton, a former chief economist
for the Justice Department, now heads a Washington consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a 13-page court filing submitted to Jackson in May, Fisher
held that Windows produces ``network effects,'' just like the phone
system or the public airwaves. Under this theory, the more people
decide to use a system, the more imperative it for other people to
use it too.
</P>
<P>
   If such ``network effects'' are found to really work, the courts
might decide that Windows is a public utility and that Microsoft
should be guaranteed a regulated fair rate of return to maintain
and improve the system. Conversely, the courts could decide that
Microsoft is an aggressive competitor who should be left free to
compete.
</P>
<P>
   All that is sure at this early point in the historic trial is
that the issue remains in doubt.

 &HT;    GINGRICH IS A BATTLE BETWEEN FRIENDS 
 (EDS: NEW TOP FIVE GRAFS TO UPDATE WITH GINGRICH ANNOUNCEMENT) 
</HEADLINE>
 LIVINGSTON'S CHALLENGE (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND and ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich's announcement Friday
night that he will give up the speakership places his old friend,
and recent challenger, Rep. Robert L. Livingston in line to succeed
to the job
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's announcement came just hours after Livingston said he
would seek to take the job away from Gingrich as the result of
Republican losses of House seats in Tuesday's mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who Gingrich promoted over three more senior
Republicans in the 104th Congress to lead the powerful
Appropriations Committee, said the Republicans' disastrous loss of
five House seats was a signal from the voters that the House needs
better management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running against a friend and I don't like that,''
Livingston, R-La., told reporters. ``It would be different if I
couldn't stand the guy... I just think that my talents as a manager
are more in demand than his are.''
</P>
<P>
   House later, Gingrich announced that he would not seek a third
term as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston e referred to Gingrich as ``my dear friend'' of 20
years who came to Congress at the same time. Running for speaker
``has been the most difficult decision I have ever made,''
Livingston said. ``In the last four years, no one has been a
stronger supporter of him and no one has been more loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who has often styled himself a ``Newt loyalist,''
said Gingrich was ``fantastic'' at going around the country to
raise money but that money failed to boost the GOP majority in the
House. Before the Tuesday election, the Republicans had a 228-207
margin. When the new Congress convenes in January, it will still be
in the majority but by a smaller 223-212 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll travel from time to time but I will be more of a
stay-at-home speaker who wants to get the job of the House of
Representatives done,'' he said. ``Making sure the trains run on
time is part of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulane University political science professor David Clinton, who
has followed Livingston's career, said Livingston's announcement
had ``an almost Shakespearian quality to it. He was elevated by
Gingrich out of turn because he was expected to be a loyalist. He
was the protege of someone else who could be viewed as turning on
his patron.''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Appropriations Committee that is responsible
for designing government spending programs, Livingston was
reportedly irate with Gingrich last month for excluding him from
last-minute budget negotiations that the speaker and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott conducted with White House officials.
During those talks, the congressional Republicans agreed to make
major concessions to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a wealthy New Orleans lawyer, former assistant U.S.
attorney and veteran party worker who was elected to Congress in
1977, told reporters last March that he was ``aggressively
pursuing'' the speakership by lobbying House colleagues because he
expected Gingrich to quit as speaker in 1999 to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   However, Livingston then said he would continue to support
Gingrich as long as he chose to remain speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 55, who won his 12th term Tuesday, is considered a
strong committee chairman with a hot temper.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does have a temper _ he has displayed that more than
once,'' said Clinton. ``He cools off quickly though. It's like one
of the summer torrential rains we have in New Orleans: it's violent
at the time but doesn't last very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Livingston has a conservative voting record (the
American Conservative Union gave him a 95 percent approval rating
in 1996 and the Chamber of Commerce gives him an 88 percent rating
the same year), he has had some well-publicized clashes with the
ideologically charged segment of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the Traditional Values Coalition, an evangelical
church group that claims 36,000 members, blasted Livingston for
refusing to support measures banning adoptions by unmarried couples
and banning publicly financed intravenous needle exchanges in the
District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative Christian group called him a ``fraud'' who was
``more concerned with currying political favors with the left than
he is about doing what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston responded by telling off the organization's executive
director, Andrea Sheldon.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's announcement that he will seek the speakership
followed another by Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., a telegenic former
wide receiver for the Seattle Seahawks who is challenging House
Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said, ``It's always
difficult to take out the speaker'' but he noted that many members
are angry with Gingrich because he led them to believe that
Republicans ``were going to pick up seats, right up to the last
minute.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel either they were lied to or they feel that the
speaker's office didn't know what was going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, unlike Largent, is not part of the revolutionary
class of 1994 that tried to overthrow Gingrich in a coup attempt
last year ago. ``He's been one of the powerbrokers,'' Rothenberg
said..
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is a graduate of Tulane, where Gingrich got his PhD
in history.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston can't get enough of ``rock 'em, sock 'em action
movies,'' he said in an interview last year. One of his favorite
movies is ``The Rock,'' a pyrotechnic extravaganza about a
terrorist who threatens to blow up San Francisco. In the flick,
there's lots of blood and bomb blasts. And the good guys triumph
over huge odds.

AN ISSUE THAT REMAINS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, November 08, 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Rosemary Bray. She possesses the key, I think, to
understanding the one really puzzling result in last week's
election. The news otherwise was so generally reassuring _
America's commitment to fair play and sound economic housekeeping
reaffirmed _ that a development in Washington State stood out.
</P>
<P>
   A ballot initiative was adopted there that will have the effect
of short-circuiting affirmative action programs in state
undertakings, including universities.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to have an effect like that of a similar
California referendum two years ago, where Afro-American
enrollments in the state's leading law school at Berkeley dropped
from 20 &UR;  &LR; to one after a similar measure was adopted, before
bouncing back to nine this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It is not clear what Washington's citizens intended, whether
they aimed to conduct an experiment or simply fell for the
sentiment expressed by the initiative's wording _ cleverly phrased
to affirm the value of equal treatment under the law, deliberately
avoiding the phrase ``affirmative action.'' This question of how to
reach out to those previously excluded is one part of the debate on
which we have not yet reached closure.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Rosemary Bray comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Bray, 43, is a successful editor and writer, among the first
woman graduates of Yale, the mother of two. Not incidentally, she
was also the beneficiary throughout her childhood of welfare (the
now-discontinued Aid to Families with Dependent Children) in Cook
County, Ill., of parochial schools, and the Roman Catholic Church,
and of determined affirmative action aimed at ``mainstreaming'' her
at many steps along the way. It worked.
</P>
<P>
   Her autobiography, ``Unafraid of the Dark,'' appeared last
spring. It is so consistently interesting and persuasive that it
cannot be read without the ends of affirmative action being
instantly understood and its efficacy _ at least part of the time _
demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Bray's book is especially valuable since it stands in contrast
to Tamar Jacoby's ``Someone Else's House,'' the latest in a line of
criticism that has been bankrolled by the neo-conservatives who
operate the Manhattan Institute, a New York think tank. I have
nothing against Jacoby's book, except that its 614 pages would
never have seen the light of day in its present form if the
one-time Newsweek correspondent had not been heavily subsidized.
</P>
<P>
   But then neither is ``Someone Else's House'' very good. It is a
long history of how some whites have seen blacks _ case histories
of New York, Atlanta, Detroit _ as all ``militant tail wagging
moderate dog.'' There is not much conversation in this book.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the book begins with an incident in which Jacoby reads
the e-mail messages that an Afro-American colleague has
inadvertantly left on her computer screen. Every one emphasizes
irritation with the pervasive whiteness of the place. Why, Jacoby
wonders, must so many blacks view their lives through a racial
prism? Whatever happened to integration?
</P>
<P>
   The answers, almost all of them, can be found in Bray.
</P>
<P>
   Bray's mother, Mary Love, came from Mississippi to Chicago in
1947, uprooted from the rural South by the invention of the
mechanical cotton picker. She had finished fourth grade. Bray's
father, Nehemiah, came from Arkansas; he had finished sixth grade.
They settled in the Kenwood neighborhood on Chicago's South Side.
Both worked hard, married, and seven years later Rosemary arrived,
the first of four children. (For the record, Hiawatha Bray, my
colleague at The Boston Globe, is the author's younger brother.)
</P>
<P>
   Nehemiah Bray insisted that Mary Love stay home to care for the
children; fair enough, it was the 1950s. But the father was an
inveterate gambler, and the possessor of a vicious rage, to boot.
Soon there was no money.
</P>
<P>
   So Mary Bray turned to the welfare department. Her lessened
dependence on him enraged her husband, who nevertheless refused to
desert his children. Instead he hid from the welfare case worker,
read to them from five newspapers every day _ and beat them, and
their mother, in his rage.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago was just beginning to dismantle its nearly universal
segregation as Rosemary hit her teens. A friendly teacher at St.
Ambrose School sent her on to the fancy private Francis Parker
School for junior high; an alumni recruiter found her there and
urged her on to Yale.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, the sort of experiment chronicled and
assessed _ &UR;  &LR; through the other end of the telescope _ by Derek Bok
and William Bowen in their book, ``The Shape of the River:
Long-Term Consequences of Considering Race in College and
University Admissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Bok and Bowen, as presidents, respectively, of Harvard and
Princeton universities, were leaders in implementing affirmative
action programs in the 1970s. Their careful assessment of the
results of such programs recorded in a database of 28 selective
colleges and universities over 40 years adds a great deal to the
debate. It demonstrates the same kind of multi-dimensional success
in the aggregate to which Bray's first-person story adds flesh and
bone.
</P>
<P>
   And tears. ``Unafraid of the Dark'' is exquisitely clear and
honest on the difficulties of moving out of city poverty into the
world that privileged whites take for granted. On entering Parker,
she becomes a locker-room thief _ until the school catches her and
gives her the $5 weekly allowance her parent cannot afford. At
Yale, she nearly flunks out, seduced by the freedom and her
membership in the new-found black community _ ``a group of really
smart, really raucus cousins I had never met.''
</P>
<P>
   She develops a bit of what the rest of us would call
``attitude'' _ breezing past the long line of freshmen awaiting
lunch at the Commons to the name-checker at the front. ``It was
something nearly all the black freshmen did, unless we were in
conversation with a white fellow student and chose to wait in line
with her or him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall a white student once asking me why so many black
students refused to stand in line. I told him I didn't refuse; I
just didn't need to identify myself to the woman on duty. Miss
Betty knew my name, and knew most of the other black students. `If
you ever spoke to her she might know your name, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   She also describes the tricks of the integration game. ``Part of
being black and successful _ whatever your profession _ involved
learning how to make white people comfortable. And we all knew that
white people were most comfortable when they could forget we were
black. What we feared most was the possibility that we would
forget, too.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; After graduation, Rosemary Bray holds a series of media jobs
in New York City, none long enough to develop a passionate
commitment to anything more than her polished writing style. She
marries her college sweetheart. They try homesteading in Harlem, a
few years before it would have worked. In due course she becomes an
editor at The New York Times Book Review, and finally tops out when
she bids on a daily book critic's job _ one of the most demanding
on the paper _ and doesn't get it. Affirmative action has its
limits, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bray lives in Montclair, N.J., a thoroughly
racially &UR;  &LR; mixed upper-middle-class suburb of New York City. She
writes children's books (about Martin Luther King, Nelson Mandela)
and raises her children. As if to affirm their shared commitment to
racial equality, Tamar Jacoby of ``Someone Else's House'' &UR;  &LR; lives in
Montclair, too. &UR;  &LR; I wouldn't be surprised if they do not talk.
</P>
<P>
   But I know their children will be a different story. I know,
too, that neither of them would be living in that leafy bastion of
the middle- and upper-middle class without affirmative action _
race-based in Bray's case, gender-based in Jacoby's. (Women waged
an intense struggle for preferential treatment at Newsweek, just
before Jacoby arrived.)
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action _ systematic efforts at developing leaders
for future generations through diversity _ is not enough. It is not
easy. But it is far from being the ``poison'' or the ``band-aid on
the cancer of underdevelopment'' that Jacoby says it is. An
overwhelming majority of Americans probably support affirmative
action _ all but a determined little band of resisters. &UR;  &LR; And
corporations such as Boeing, Microsoft, and Starbucks &UR;  &LR; vigorously
opposed the initiative in Washington State. It was into this
portion of the consensus, among many others, that Bill Clinton
tapped so decisively last week. Further political success awaits
those who know it.

   &QL;  HUD, DELEGATION FEUD OVER ICE STORM MONEY
</P>
<P>
   $2.18 million ``totally unacceptable''
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 -- In a move that left even Democrats in the
state stunned, Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo issued $2.18 million
for Maine Friday to defray costs of the January ice storms, setting
off a war of words.
</P>
<P>
   The $2.18 million is nowhere near what Maine was expecting,
since original estimates of damages to just the state's private
utilities topped $80 million. ``It's just a drop in the bucket,''
said Eric Samp, spokesman for Bangor Hydro Electric Co., which
sustained $4.5 million in damages itself.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing $49 million Friday to 11 states, out of the $130
million Congress approved for disaster relief in a bill last
spring, Cuomo also said that Maine would not receive any of the
remaining relief money. ``I would not envision any additional
funding for Maine,'' he said in a conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine Public Utility Commission has been reluctant to
approve any rate increases until it is clear how much federal money
is given to the private power companies. But Friday's announcement
makes it more likely that a rate hike will be passed on to
consumers so the companies can recoup the costs of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have to think about what the next step will be,''
said Mark Ishkanian, spokesman for Central Maine Power, adding,
``If this is what the federal government thinks is support ... that
speaks volumes about how much we can count on the federal
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo's decision prompted the state's congressional delegation,
two Democrats and two Republicans, to issue a strongly worded
statement calling the funding ``totally unacceptable'' and accusing
Cuomo of ``an outrageous betrayal'' of the intent of the disaster
relief bill.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the wording of the law. In the wake of the
devastating ice storms, which wiped out power lines across the
region, Maine's delegation led a coalition with other New England
lawmakers to get federal funding to recoup some of the costs to
rebuild the electric grid.
</P>
<P>
   Under strict guidelines, the Federal Emergency Management Agency
cannot pay out any disaster relief to private utilites such as
Bangor Hydro and Central Maine Power. So the New England group
arranged for $130 million in disaster money to be steered through
the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
</P>
<P>
   And, most importantly, the bulk of the $130 million was to go
toward Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and New York -- the northern
states hardest hit by the ice storms. An unspecified amount of
money was expected to go to states that had suffered presidentially
declared disasters up to the point that the law was signed, May 1,
such as the mudslides in southern California last January.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's how lawmakers from those states saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo clearly read the law differently. In a broadside directed
at the Maine delegation, Cuomo said there was nothing in the law
that directed him to give any special consideration to Maine or New
England. So he is distributing the $130 million among 63 disasters
in fiscal year 1998, with more than 60 percent of the money going
to disasters after June 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says all disasters during the year,'' Cuomo said. If Maine
wanted special consideration, he said, ``They should have written
the law to say, `Maine will get ...' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``HUD doesn't write the laws, HUD administers the laws,'' Cuomo
continued. ``I defy anyone to find the word Maine, with an `e' at
the end, in the law.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, Maine and New Hampshire got $3.7 million from Cuomo,
less than 3 percent of the total relief package. New York and
Vermont didn't receive a single penny.
</P>
<P>
   ``HUD's action represents a violation of the specific
authorization of this funding by Congress,'' said Sens. Olympia
Snowe and Susan Collins, and Reps. John Baldacci and Tom Allen in
their statement.
</P>
<P>
   They said the intent of the law was very clear, and their aides
said Friday that HUD had been told that the region was supposed to
get a ``fair share'' of the disaster relief pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice start, but it's a far cry from a fair share,'' said
John Ripley, Baldacci's spokesman. ``It's simply not adequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what we had in mind,'' said Dave Lackey, Snowe's
spokesman. ``(Cuomo) is sort of disingenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation has vowed to continue fighting for more funding
for the utilities, but there is no money left in the disaster
relief bill. Any additional funds would have to come sometime next
year from $250 million in extra money given to HUD in the 1999
budget.
</P>
<P>
   And the utilities say they need the money now, or else a rate
hike will be unavoidable. ``We feel a little bit caught in the
middle,'' said Samp, of Bangor Hydro. ``All these costs are sitting
out there.''

RECORD COMPANIES DREAD PROSPECTS OF FREE DOWNLOADED MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's the biggest jukebox in the universe, with
every kind of music you could ever want sitting there, free for the
taking. And it's driving the record industry crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Do you like Pearl Jam, or Madonna, or Alanis Morissette? Most of
their latest music hit the Internet months before the albums were
officially released.
</P>
<P>
   The tunes are out there, often converted to a compact,
good-quality computer audio format called MP-3, and tucked away on
some college mainframe system, or someone's fan site, available
with just a few minutes of downloading.
</P>
<P>
   Staring at the proliferation of thousands of free copies of
music they've labored long and hard to produce, record companies
worry that the Internet will kill their business.
</P>
<P>
   Not only won't the record labels see a dime for all those
pirated copies, neither will artists who sang and played on them,
nor will the people who wrote the songs. Neither will the companies
that normally would distribute those records, nor the retailers
that would sell them.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the entire, enormous food chain that is the nation's
music business fears starvation by Internet. With nothing more than
a basic computer, an Internet connection and some freely available
software, virtually anyone can make endless digital copies of any
CD or other sound source, then ship them all over the planet.
</P>
<P>
   STOP THE MUSIC?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you need record labels? Do you need record stores?'' asked
Bruce Weber, a Grammy-winning producer and co-owner of Weberworks,
a small record label. That's what record companies are wondering,
even as their representatives scour the Internet, trying to scrub
it clean of illegally copied music.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   On college campuses, where high-speed Internet connections are
common, a student such as Northwestern University junior Chris Ward
from Valencia can quickly find and download a pirated version of a
song, then have his computer play it whenever he'd like.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said his computer has about 50 MP-3 song files, none of
them legally obtained. Some of his MP-3s, from up-and-coming band
Guster for instance, have led him to pay for the group's music.
</P>
<P>
   But most are by bands whose music he otherwise doesn't much
like, such as Queensryche and the Scorpions, and whose records he
wouldn't otherwise buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This music is something I enjoy, but I wouldn't want to spend
money on it,'' said Ward. ``It's just a great bonus for music you
can listen to for relatively little hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   When it's time for an all-nighter, Ward said, he turns on his
computer, tells it to start playing his personal jukebox of songs,
and starts writing.
</P>
<P>
   People like Ward are part of an Internet revolution in music
that has riled the record business and threatens to change its
structure radically over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   That's because once a piece of music is turned into an MP-3 or
some other digital format, it can be easily copied and moved around
the Internet at virtually no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three-fourths of Pearl Jam's last album was on the Internet in
December, and it wasn't supposed to hit stores until when, March?''
says Brandy Thomas, CEO of Cyveillance, which works for the
Recording Industry Association of America, ASCAP and other
organizations to track down illegal digital music, movies and other
intellectual property on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ALL YOU NEED IS SOFTWARE
</P>
<P>
   The ease of copying and distributing illegal music is radically
different from the old days of vinyl, where pirates need access to
expensive record-pressing machinery.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a pretty big barrier to entry there,'' said Todd
Steinman, Warner Bros. Records vice president for new media.
``There were very few pirates that would want to spend $50,000 or
whatever it was to build a pressing plant. Now all you need is
Soundforge software and an Internet connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward and many other MP-3 fans go to Scour.net, the
Westwood-based Web site that makes it easy to search for audio
files, even just for MP-3 files, as well as still pictures and
video files on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Using Scour to look for songs by Grammy-winning singer Beck, for
instance, a quick search turns up links to 100 MP-3s, including
live recordings he's never officially released. The year-old Scour
has quickly become a darling of MP-3 fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   And as far as Scour president Dan Rodrigues is concerned, ``MP-3
is the best downloadable music format out there in terms of
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigues and others said they believe MP-3 will win out over
more secure alternative formats, such as Liquid Audio and a2b,
because it's not owned by any private company. And they say the
record industry's ire is misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't the technology that should be questioned,'' said
Brian Litman, president and CEO of PlayMedia Systems, which owns
the technology behind the widely downloaded Amp series of MP-3
player software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger issue is why people would use the technology in
ways that could be construed as illicit,'' Litman said. ``Our
position is the growth of the MP-3 phenomenon is symptomatic of
bigger problems faced by the major (record labels). In a world
where distributing digital content can be as easy as sending
e-mail, you have to rethink what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   MP-3 BOOSTERS
</P>
<P>
   A group of technology and small music companies recently banded
together to form the MP-3 Association to further the use of the
format.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge opportunity in online music,'' said Steve Grady
of online record label GoodNoise, an association member. ``We feel
like the format is already out there, and consumers are using it.''
</P>
<P>
   GoodNoise sells MP-3 songs from artists such as Frank Black for
99 cents each, reasoning that it's better to join 'em if you can't
stop 'em. It recently acquired other online companies with rights
to music from artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Patsy Cline, Ray
Charles and Billie Holliday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans don't have access to legitimate content on MP-3,'' said
Gene Hoffman, GoodNoise's president and chief executive officer.
``MP-3 is never going to go away _ the technology is there and
available, and you might as well make it easier to buy it than to
steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Platinum Records announced this week that it will give away
MP-3s by prominent artists, but only one song each from four
artists at a time _ and for only two weeks per song. Company
officials said the marketing and promotional value of such releases
outweighs any concerns about their proliferation on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at the piracy of this,'' said singer Taylor
Dayne, one of Platinum's first four artists to give away a
downloadable song. ``I look at this as a giant radio station. It's
a promotional tool for me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing but good news to MP-3 boosters like Michael
Robertson, president of MP3.com, an all-in-one Web site with links
and reviews to MP-3 software, hardware, recordings and much more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see is fear,'' said Robertson of the industry's
concerns. ``If you do it right, you'll sell more music than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But bigger record labels, with more to lose, are struggling to
figure out how to use the Net to sell records without losing
control over their products.
</P>
<P>
   DIGITAL ALTERNATIVES
</P>
<P>
   The companies that provide more secure alternatives to MP-3,
such as Liquid Audio and a2b, believe that their products will make
it possible to widely expand digital distribution of music without
killing the record companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe downloadable music is a viable, large channel for
distributing music,'' said Howie Singer, a2b's chief technical
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you're a record company, I'm not sure you're all that
anxious to use MP-3s,'' Singer said. ``The reason is not because
MP-3 is not good. The technology is innocent. But many of the major
record labels are reluctant to release more music in MP-3 because
they don't want to encourage more illegal releases of their
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Amplified.com is one of several companies using the more secure
alternatives to sell songs. It has cut deals with smaller labels
such as Beggars Banquet, Del-Fi, Alligator and 4AD to sell 99-cent
Liquid Audio versions of individual tracks from artists such as
Dead Can Dance, John Cale, Dick Dale and the Cult.
</P>
<P>
   One of Amplified.com's investors is Dutch electronics giant
Philips, which is giving away certificates to 30 free songs with
the purchase of its CD-recordable drives, said Amplified.com's
Frazier Hollis. The drives, which cost around $300, can be used to
make playable copies of music downloads.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger record labels have been more cautious, announcing
deals that allow you to listen to music but not get digital copies
of it on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, for instance, announced this week that it will offer a
``jukebox'' service that allows you to pay $2.50 to listen to 10
songs as much as you want over a 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Records also announced it will make three or four songs
available for listening from each of its new releases in coming
months, said Mark Cuban, president of Broadcast.com, which will
carry the music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can listen to it, but you can't download it,'' Cuban said.
``That'll lead to lots more sales. It's all about selling CDs.''
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. Records makes a single song at a time available for
listening, but not downloading, on its artists' Web sites. It has
no plans to sell online copies of its music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of taking a wait-and-see approach,'' said Warner's
Steinman. ``We want to have our artists and copyrights protected.
We want to use the Web to its fullest market potential but don't
want to destroy the commerce that surrounds the music business
now.''

LARGENT: EX-FOOTBALL PLAYER BECOMES POLITICAL STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, the
former pro football player who is running for House majority
leader, has been trying from the day he arrived in Congress to
prove he is not just a celebrity jock.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief four years in the House, Largent's devotion to his
Tulsa district and his Christian conservatism have served him well
in Oklahoma, and his telegenic presence has helped him become a
star on the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with his brash effort to replace Representative Richard
Armey as the number two GOP leader, Largent faces a far more
serious challenge. To win the job, he must convince his fellow
Republicans, many of whom outrank him in seniority, that he has the
intelligence and political skills to help rebuild the battered
party.
</P>
<P>
   Largent faces an uphill battle in part because he is running on
his own, and is not teamed with Representative Robert Livingston of
Louisiana, who announced Friday he is running for speaker. Largent,
asked about his discussions with Livingston, said, ``There is no
slate'' and he was running without ``coattails.''
</P>
<P>
   But Largent is used to being underestimated. Although he is just
5 feet 11 and 190 pounds, quite small by National Football League
standards, Largent became a legend for his success as a wide
receiver for the Seattle Seahawks for 14 years before retiring in
1989, earning him election to the NFL Hall of Fame his first year
of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was a small person in terms of height and weight in the
NFL, and I asked him how challenging that was,'' said
Representative John Baldacci, a Maine Democrat who shares a Capitol
Hill townhouse with Largent. ``He said, `John, I just told those
naysayers to look at the scoreboard.'''
</P>
<P>
   Baldacci said Largent is far more than a jock, recalling how he
is just as likely to spend an evening reading books as he is to
watch Monday Night Football. ``He is somebody I found I can talk
with who didn't have his mind already made up, which is different
from some of the members in that class,'' Baldacci said, referring
to Republicans elected in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Largent arrived in Washington as one of 52 new House Republicans
swept into office in the year of Speaker Newt Gingrich's Contract
with America. But Largent has often battled with Gingrich and other
Republican leaders. Although Largent sometimes is to the right of
Gingrich, he portrays himself as a better messenger for the party.
</P>
<P>
   While not explicitly criticizing Gingrich or Armey, Largent made
his disagreements clear Friday. He said the party ``desperately
needs ... to heal the alienation that currently exists among
members of our current leadership'' and that ``the last two years
are nothing to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent, who has said he saw his father only twice as a child,
has focused much of his attention on what he calls pro-family
issues. He has also angered the gay community by attacking same-sex
marriages, saying once that he isn't intolerant of gays, but he is
``intolerant of the gay agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is
openly gay, has battled Largent on the House floor over the issue.
But Frank, who has had even harsher battles with Armey, said
Friday, ``It's hard to speak ill of anyone who opposes Dick
Armey.'' Frank said he can't recall working with Largent on any
issue, but ``he is amiable and that's helpful. Largent has got that
sort of pleasant personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent, 44, who has said he will serve no more than 12 years in
the House, is married to his high school sweetheart, Terry, and has
four children. In Tuesday's election, Largent easily defeated
Democrat Howard Plowman, a retired minister.

MOYNIHAN TO STEP DOWN AT TERM'S END IN 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Daniel Patrick Moynihan, long-respected as the most
intellectual member of the US Senate, will not run for re-election
when his term expires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A former Harvard professor, Cabinet officer, and US ambassador,
who has ruffled feathers throughout his several careers, Moynihan
was elected to the Senate in 1976 and handily won all three races
since.
</P>
<P>
   It has been rumored for a few years that Moynihan, now 71 and
visibly more tired than he used to be, might retire rather than
tread through a fourth campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan made the decision official Friday three days after
Democrat Charles Schumer defeated three-term Republican incumbent
Alfonse D'Amato for the state's other Senate seat, thus ensuring
that, even without him, his party will still have at least one New
Yorker in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surely will miss it,'' Moynihan told the Associated Press,
``but there are other things to do in life and there comes a
time.'' He said he might go back to teaching, if some college would
have him.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of another long-held Senate seat, so soon after one
changed hands, unleashed a flurry of speculation about who might
succeed Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely Democrat to run is state comptroller Carl
McCall, New York's highest-ranking black official, who won
Tuesday's reelection with 63 percent of the vote _ the widest
margin in any statewide contest. McCall said on Thursday he would
consider a Senate run if Moynihan retired.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prospect on everybody's mind is New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Political consultants on both sides,
including Republican Joseph Mercurio and Democrat Henry Sheinkopf,
agreed Giuliani would be hard for any Democrat to beat. The mayor's
press secretary, Cristyne Lategano, said, ``The phone has been
ringing non-stop here,'' with friends and supporters urging him to
go for it. Some of Giuliani's allies, however, think his
personality is better-suited to executive jobs, such as governor or
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible candidates for Moynihan's seat include U.S.
Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo, ex-Gov. Mario Cuomo's son; Mark
Green, the city's Consumer Advocate, who made two unsuccessful runs
for D'Amato's seat; Peter Vallone, the city council chairman who
was defeated in Tuesday's gubernatorial election; U.S. Rep. Carolyn
Maloney, from Manhattan's Upper East Side; and environmental
activist Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., though he has discouraged such
thinking in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Some mused that D'Amato might run for the seat again, but most
observers figured the Republican ex-Senator will take one of
several lucrative offers to become a lawyer or lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's three terms and four years in the Senate have not
been marked by much legislation or devotion to constituent services
_ though he did save New York billions of dollars by protecting the
deductibility of state taxes and by passing a bill that allowed
states to use federal transportation funds for highways or mass
transit.
</P>
<P>
   He has made his mark more for lofty books and speeches on such
issues as welfare reform, the solvency of the Social Security fund,
foreign policy, and the government's excessive passion for secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the Clinton administration, when he was chairman
of the Senate Banking Committee, Moynihan urged the president to
focus on welfare reform before health-care reform _ advice that
many analysts believe would have altered the course of the
administration, and possibly saved the Democrats' majority in
Congress, had Clinton followed it.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, who grew up in the impoverished Manhattan neighborhood
of Hell's Kitchen, staked out many of his positions on social
policy long before they became conventional wisdom. His 1963 book
with Harvard sociologist Nathan Glazer, ``Beyond the Melting Pot,''
was one of the first to focus on the role of ethnicity in U.S.
society and politics. A 1965 article on the alarming rise of
fatherless black families set off a storm of controversy _ many
called him a racist _ but is now widely seen as remarkably
prescient.
</P>
<P>
   He has been, wrote political commentator Michael Barone, ``the
nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best
politician among thinkers since Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew famous in the mid-1970s as President Ford's U.N.
ambassador, where he inveighed against the third world's
anti-American and anti-Zionist rhetoric, often employing fairly
heated rhetoric himself.
</P>
<P>
   His U.N. performance elevated his stature among many New
Yorkers, who in 1976 voted him U.S. senator, after choosing him
over Rep. Bella Abzug in the Democratic primary. His shock of white
hair, colored bow ties, and Brahmin lisp soon became familiar
emblems of New York politics. His reelections became so
predictable, he might as well have been granted Senatorial tenure.

 &HT;    Clinton's visit to his home state marked with mixed feelings
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHFILL, Ark. _ Well-wishers and gawkers braved a chilly day in
northwest Arkansas to see President Clinton, who hasn't visited his
home state since his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky
became public.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was here to dedicate the new Northwest Arkansas Regional
Airport, a much-anticipated, sometimes criticized project he helped
see to completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had bi-partisan support for this airport, and bi-partisan
opposition to it,'' Clinton said. ``The truth is, it's a good thing
and it needed to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks in this hilly, rural area about 30 miles northwest of
Fayetteville say they are pleased to have the airport, but their
opinions on the president are mixed. When Air Force One landed
right in front of everyone, thousands cheered and yelped ``Sooey!''
_the battle cry for the Arkansas Razorbacks, who are playing Ole
Miss today at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Shollmier drove from Little Rock to see Clinton, whom she
says she spilled blueberry cobbler on when he was governor and she
was a waitress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see the president and see Air Force One,'' she
said. ``I'm disappointed in him, maybe, but I still support him.''
</P>
<P>
   But many local residents stayed home or gathered in their usual
spots to grumble about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go, I've got a Mary Kay party to host,'' said Dorothy
Miller, who lives just a few miles from the airport. ``Besides, I
moved out of Arkansas because of him being governor, and then they
elected him president.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Arkansas is the fastest growing part of the state;
Wal-Mart, Tyson Foods, and J.B. Hunt Trucking are based here, and
were responsible for pushing the airport project. It is also the
most Republican part of the state, so Clinton's native appeal wears
thin here.
</P>
<P>
   At the Cave Springs General Store, a group of retired men who
gather daily and call themselves the L&AMP;L Club, or Loafers and
Liars, was smoking and drinking coffee and having a lively
discussion about Clinton as they watched the line of cars crawl
toward the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had three steak dinners bet on him getting impeached,'' said
Eugene Cole. ``I guess I lost those.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't call him Slick Willy for nothing,'' said Brent
Holland, shaking his head. None of the men planned to attend the
dedication, which was open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the airport dedication, there were some spectators who
just like the idea of seeing any president, even if it is one they
don't like.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't vote for him, but he is our president, so I respect
him,'' said Wilma Hubbard, who teaches elementary school in nearby
Decatur. ``I just wanted to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has been criticized for approving an airport
that some said was only being built because Big Money wanted it,
the airport was not his idea, but rather that of his first
political opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say I started it,'' said former Republican
U.S. Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, who defeated Clinton for a
Congressional seat in 1974. It was Clinton's first foray into
politics, attempted when he was a law professor at the University
of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sam Walton called me and said 'John Paul' what do you think
about the needs for a regional airport?'' Hammerschmidt said. ``I
decided we should have a hearing, so I had 14 members of the House
of Representatives come here. The first three witnesses were Sam
Walton, J.B. Hunt and Don Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammerschmidt only grudgingly gives credit to Clinton for the
airport's completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received approval from the Federal Aviation Administration
during the Clinton Administration so I guess you'd have to say the
president would be involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is ``disappointed by Clinton, but, he added,
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody here pretty well knows Bill. We're honoring the
presidency by inviting him to the dedication. Whoever was the
president, we'd invite them.''
</P>
<P>
   The $109 million facility is only the third airport built from
scratch and not from an existing site in the United State in 25
years. It was more than $30 million under budget, and so far has
two carriers_ American Eagle and Trans World Express_signed on to
offer daily flights.

 &HT;    Report: Reinvent U.S. security to confront terrorism, threats
 &HT;    By Jeff Nesmith
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bureaucracy created 50 years ago to guide
America's Cold War confrontation with communism is too cumbersome
and fragmented to deal with the rapidly changing threats of the
21st century, warns a report issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Problems such as terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction and the spread of international criminal organizations
are among the new security threats replacing the relentless and
determined hostility of the Soviet Union, noted Stephen A. Cambone,
a researcher at the National Defense University.
</P>
<P>
   Future presidents will need more flexible and quicker ways to
respond to these threats, Cambone said in a report published by the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   But the planning, policies and government structures to allow
that kind of response don't exist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``handshake'' agreements between such organizations
as the CIA and the FBI underlie most of the planning for responding
to an event such as a terrorist attack, he said in a discussion of
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Those sort of preparations fail to provide sufficient planning
and leave unsolved a myriad of previously unseen legal problems, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the (military commander in chief) down at Norfolk going
to do about sending troops to San Francisco when the Trans-America
building comes down?'' Cambone asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event a bio-terrorist bomb is released somewhere, who's
going to decide who can go into an area and who can come out?'' he
asked. ``Who will decide who receives medical treatment and who
does not?''
</P>
<P>
   Cambone's report, titled ``A New Structure for National Security
Planning,'' appears at a time when university and policy institute
analysts and some members of Congress are beginning to talk about
the need to replace the 1947 National Security Act, which guided
the development of the current defense and foreign affairs
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1947 law, from which came the Department of Defense, the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Council and the CIA,
was designed to marshal the country's ability to confront the
``single overarching threat'' represented by the Soviet Union,
Cambone said.
</P>
<P>
   Cambone does not recommend a wholesale dismantling of the
national security structure _ replacing the Defense Department, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   He does recommend abolishing the White House National Security
Council and replacing it with a new structure, designed to guide
the development of policies under which the country could act
quickly and decisively in case of a terrorist attack or other
assault.
</P>
<P>
   The ``National Security Directorate'' would be headed by the
president with a deputy director, who could be the vice president
or someone who is appointed by the president and confirmed by the
Senate. Other members would be given responsibility for specific
security areas, such as crisis management, finance and trade,
science and technology and ``home defense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization of the Cold War security apparatus might have
suited the unique situation of the Cold War, but its virtues then
might now be impediments to the president's flexibility of
developing security policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A set of threats has emerged that is not of the traditional
variety and whose origin may be abroad but whose impact can be felt
in the United States and by U.S. citizens,'' he said. ``These
threats include terrorism, the use of weapons of mass destruction,
organized crime (including drugs) and illegal immigration ... ``

 &HT;    Internet's got jokes for Glenn: `Everybody put on ape masks!'
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was the joke that circled the globe almost as many
times as John Glenn himself. The following e-mail message has been
sent and received over the Internet thousands if not millions of
times in the last few days:
</P>
<P>
   ``We need your help... Please distribute this to everyone (on
earth, that is) you know: When John Glenn returns from space,
everybody dress in ape suits. We have 8 days in which to bury the
Statue of Liberty up to her neck.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, where everyone thinks he's a comedian, this
particular joke seems to have worldwide appeal. The reference to
the '70s cult classic ``Planet of the Apes'' film series has seems
to have hit just the right chord with the pop culture sensibility
of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually Net jokes are pretty lame, but this one is actually
quite good,'' read one e-mail introduction to the joke.'' Another
e-mail version was prefaced with this: ``I want to see those guys
at Mission Control all sitting in ape suits when they land. That
would be a lot funnier than any of those songs they play to wake
them up every morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Internet jokes take months or even years to circle
the e-mail universe. Some jokes, such as the Nieman Marcus cookie
scam or the ever popular ``Things someone from (fill in name of
your favorite state here) would never say.'' However this little
bit of intergalactic humor has a short life span (the space shuttle
is scheduled to land today). Perhaps the sense of urgency was what
sent the joke zipping in and out of e-mail boxes everywhere. If you
don't have e-mail or didn't get a copy, not to worry. It's too late
to bury the Statue of Liberty anyway.

EX-LOUISIANA GOVERNOR INDICTED IN GAMBLING LICENSE SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Edwin W. Edwards, a four-term Louisiana governor
who twice escaped conviction in federal racketeering trials, was
indicted Friday on charges of running a ``corrupt enterprise''
involving riverboat gambling licenses in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's son, Baton Rouge attorney Stephen Edwards, and four
other associates of the flamboyant political leader were also named
in a 34-count indictment handed up in US District Court in Baton
Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   With characteristic bravado, Edwards appeared at the courthouse
and declared, ``It's less than I expected. I'm not charged at all
with the Oklahoma City bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a sentence of up to 350 years if convicted, the
71-year-old Edwards added, ``I can truthfully say if my sentence is
350 years, I don't intend to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The move against Edwards had been expected for more than a year,
but the case intensified a month ago when Edward DeBartolo Jr.,
owner of the San Francisco 49ers, appeared in court to implicate
Edwards in a scheme to shake down DeBartolo for hundreds of
thousands of dollars in exchange for the award of a state franchise
for a riverboat casino. Edwards immediately dismissed DeBartolo as
``the new Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was accused of using his influence with the state Gaming
Control Board after he left office to win the 15th and final
riverboat license for a corporation headed by DeBartolo. For his
help, according to evidence introduced in court last month,
DeBartolo paid Edwards $400,000 in bundles of $100 bills.
</P>
<P>
   When federal agents raided Edwards's home and office in April
1997, DeBartolo's money accounted for most of the $470,000 in cash
that was seized from Edwards and his son.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo was sentenced to two years' probation and subjected to
fines and forfeitures that amounted to about $1 million. He had
temporarily given up control of the 49ers after being drawn into
the investigation, and his future involvement with the team is
still not clear.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of DeBartolo's dramatic admission, US Attorney Eddie
Jordan warned of a ``train of justice... leaving the station'' in
an open appeal for others to cooperate with the government.
According to sources familiar with the case, the formal indictment
of Edwards was delayed until Friday to accommodate three more
business associates of the former governor who came forward to
plead guilty while linking him to a multimillion-dollar extortion
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling was legalized in Louisiana in 1991 under former
Governor Buddy Roemer. But when Edwards regained the governor's
office the following year, his administration authorized most of
the licenses for the 15 riverboat casinos permitted by state law,
and Harrah's, a huge gambling emporium in downtown New Orleans that
went bankrupt months after it opened.
</P>
<P>
   A popular Democrat with a well-publicized penchant for gambling
and a self-promoted reputation as a roue, Edwards is a product of
Louisiana's Cajun country. He speaks Cajun French and specializes
in sarcastic humor. His following is so great that he was elected
governor at intervals over the past quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutors Friday described Edwards as ``the leader of
a corrupt enterprise whose objectives included illegal and corrupt
manipulation of the riverboat gaming licensing process during and
after his last two years as governor.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has taken on bizarre twists since it became public
after the raids. Edwards complained that he had been targeted by a
pervasive system of wiretaps and secret videotapes. In one
instance, after he was piloted by undercover investigators during a
sting operation, Edwards wisecracked that the agents seemed
uncommonly bright for FBI men because they were able to land the
plane on the first pass.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Dempsey White, a former state transporation
department official, pleaded guilty to participating in a
counter-plot with Edwards to wiretap the FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Others who turned against Edwards in the last four weeks were
former Treasure Chest casino owner Robert Guidry, who testified
that he paid $1.4 million in bribes to seal a riverboat license
while Edwards was still in office in 1994, and Ricky Shetler, a
friend of Stephen Edwards who said he channeled $550,000 in payoffs
from Players Casino in Lake Charles to both Edwin and Stephen
Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the latest upheaval in a state long tarnished by
public corruption. While he was governor during his third term in
the mid-1980s, Edwards was the defendant in two trials in federal
court in New Orleans, confronted with racketeering charges
involving hospital and nursing home ventures. His first trial ended
in a hung jury; the second in acquittal. During breaks in the
trials, Edwards led choruses ridiculing the prosecutor at a
fashionable French Quarter bar.
</P>
<P>
   He has vowed that he will be acquitted again.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Edwards' son, state Sen. Greg Tarver of Shreveport,
one of the most prominent legislators in the Louisiana, was also
indicted Friday, along with Andrew Martin, a former aide to the
governor, and two of Edwards' friends, Bobby Johnson, a Baton Rouge
contractor, and Cecil Brown, an auctioneer from Eunice.

LIVINGSTON: PRACTICAL, MODERATE, MAINSTREAM

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana, who
joined Newt Gingrich's insurgency four years ago and now hopes to
succeed him as leader of slim Republican majority in the House, is
known in his home district as a pragmatic conservative with an
ability to get along with competing forces in his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very practical person,'' said former New Orleans
councilwoman Peggy Wilson, who served for years as the only
Republican voice in city government. During battles within the
state party between regulars and the religious right, Livingston
has been allied with the moderate faction without alienating the
Christian conservatives, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a mainstream type of person, a strong family man. He's
against abortion. He's not out of synch with the religious right,
he just takes a different approach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 55, was a Republican when the party was negligible
here. After years of partisan toil, he has become a prominent
figure as the GOP captured the governor's office and five of the
seven House seats in a state where Democrats still outnumber
Republicans 3-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Although he comes from a family with an aristocratic background
_ one ancestor administered the oath of office to George Washington
and others ruled as Louisiana plantation grandees _ Livingston's
personal background is more humble. After his father abandoned his
mother when Livingston was a child, the future congressman labored
at the Avondale shipyards to pay his way through Tulane University.
He received a law degree in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of years of private practice, he worked as a
prosecutor in the Orleans Parish district attorney's office until
he won a House seat in a special election in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a Catholic, represents a predominantly white
district that has been redrawn several times, forcing him to move
from New Orleans to suburban Metairie. He represents two slivers of
white neighborhoods in the city, but the bulk of his constituency
lies in relatively affluent suburbs surrounding New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   He has represented their interests as a strong fiscal and social
conservative in Washington, but he has thrown his weight behind
efforts back home to deny David Duke, an erstwhile Ku Klux Klan
leader and inveterate politician, a role in the Louisiana
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livingston has button-downed passion. Sometimes he'll get
worked up as a true believer, and you'll see his arms flailing in a
debate, but he's not mean-spirited,'' says John Maginnis, the
publisher a Louisiana political newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Republicans won control of Congress in the 1994
elections, Livingston was best known here for his work in
delivering federal contracts and public works projects to his
district as a member of the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing four other Republican members with more seniority,
Gingrich tapped Livingston to lead the committee. In the spirit of
Gingrich's revolution, Livingston showed up at his first committee
meeting as chairman carrying an alligator skinning knife he called
a ``Cajun scalpel.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston announced his plan to challenge the House speaker
only hours before the news broke that Gingrich would step down. He
was said to have been angered earlier this fall when the House
leadership pushed him aside during budget negotiations with the
White House. Livingston was critical of the deal eventually reached
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Following Tuesday's debacle at the polls, when the Republican
advantage in the House was shaved to six seats, Livingston advised
Gingrich to step aside and he let it be known that he was available
to lead a counterrevolution.
</P>
<P>
   If Livingston becomes speaker, Representative Barney Frank, a
liberal Massachusetts Democrat, said the Louisianan ``would clearly
be able to work well with Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank praised Livingston for fighting off attempts to load
appropriations bills with extraneous antigay and anti-environmental
measures. ``The right wing keeps insisting on adding these
things,'' Frank said. ``Since 1995, Livingston has been telling
them they can't use the appropriations process for all their
issues.''

MOYNIHAN DELAYED RETIREMENT IN DEFERENCE TO PARTY, EX-AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former aides to Daniel Patrick Moynihan said Friday
the senior senator from New York had considered retiring years ago
but waited until he believed the Democrats in the state were in a
strong position.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence O'Donnell, who worked on Moynihan's staff for eight
years, said the senator had talked before this week's election
about retiring but that he was concerned that his departure would
leave New York without a Democratic senator.
</P>
<P>
   But with Rep. Charles E. Schumer's defeat Tuesday of Republican
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, O'Donnell said Moynihan saw an opportunity to
leave without hurting his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Schumer victory absolutely solidified a decision that he
was pretty close to making anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Maffei, a former press secretary to Moynihan, agreed. ``The
exact timing of the announcement surprised me, but ... Schumer's
victory an was important factor.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said Moynihan began considering retirement a decade
ago. ``In 1988, when he was running for re-election, he did say he
thought that would be last term,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei said Moynihan, 71, did not want to leave the Democratic
Party in a vulnerable position, with the possibility of a
Republican winning Moynihan's vacated seat and leaving New York
with two GOP senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moynihan is not leaving the party in a bad position at all by
retiring,'' he said. ``I think that was important factor.''
</P>
<P>
   With his stark white hair and academic demeanor, Moynihan is
towering figure in the Senate. Although often waxing eloquently on
the history of programs before the Senate, Moynihan was a practical
deal-maker, working on both side of isle to get legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   He is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which
oversees taxes, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and welfare _
all of which are at the heart of the Congress' annual political
fights.
</P>
<P>
   He was the panel's chairman when Democrats held the Senate
majority in 1993 and 1994. During those years and afterwards, he
has been a maverick who at times has clashed with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the decision early in the Clinton administration
to focus on revamping the nation's health care system rather than
overhauling welfare, and in 1996 he criticized the president for
signing the Republican-written welfare overhaul bill.
</P>
<P>
   Before winning a Senate seat in 1976, Moynihan served in the
Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford administrations. Nixon named
Moynihan ambassador to India in 1973. Ford made him United Nations
ambassador in 1975. Known for bluntly asserting U.S. positions,
Moynihan stayed at the United Nations only eight months before
returning to Harvard University to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from Moynihan's Senate colleagues was one of praise for
the senator's achievements and sadness at his departure.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who was elected to the Senate in 1980, called Moynihan
a great senator for New York and the nation. ``It has been my
privilege to call him my friend and to serve with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert J. Kerrey, D-Neb., who also serves on the Senate
Finance Committee, said Moynihan was an ``innovative thinker and
leader,'' and that he was ``heartened by the fact that Senator
Moynihan will be with us in the Senate for these next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scholars said Moynihan would be remembered for his
work in a host of areas, including restructuring the Social
Security system and helping to pass deficit-reduction legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely unique,'' said Stephen Hess, a political
expert at the Brooking Institution, an independent Washington-based
think tank. ``There has never been anyone else in the history of
the United States like him in that he is an intellectual in the
Senate who remained an intellectual.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan grew up the rough lower Manhattan neighborhood known as
Hell's Kitchen. His father was an alcoholic who left the family
when Moynihan was 6. His mother operated a saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tulsa, Okla., Moynihan became an academic who taught at
Harvard before going into public service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first times he captured public attention was in 1965,
when his report, ``The Negro Family,'' warned that the growth of
single-parent families was only worsening inner cities. He wrote
that ``benign neglect'' would be better than continuing failed
welfare programs _ an argument that led to criticism by some that
he was racist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he won a contentious four-way Democratic Senate primary
that included feminist Bella Abzug. He went on to defeat the
conservative Republican incumbent, James Buckley. Moynihan was
re-elected easily three times after that.

CAR BOMB INJURES 21, HALTS ISRAELI PEACE PACT TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A car bomb tore through a crowded open market here
Friday injuring 21 people and halting Israeli cabinet talks on
ratification of a new interim peace deal struck with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion, which killed the two suicide bombers, raised a
plume of acrid, black smoke and cast a pall over a peace process on
the verge of breaking a 20-month deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton urged Israelis and Palestinians to
persevere with the search for peace despite efforts by extremists
intent on destroying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the best way to safety for the Israelis and the best way
to acheive the aspirations of the Palestinians, and in the end the
only answer to today's act of criminal terror,'' said Clinton,
whose dogged diplomacy brought the two sides together to hammer out
an agreement at the Wye River Plantation last month in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an annonymous phone call to the Israeli government
claiming responsibility from the military wing of the Islamic
organization, Hamas, senior Israeli officials said they had
information that the attack was carried out by another Palestinian
militant group called Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   The crudely constructed bomb exploded at the entrance of the
packed Mahane Yehuda market hours before the start of the Jewish
Sabbath. Experts believe it was the work of an Islamic militant
opposition that has grown desperate.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a race between these extremists to kill the peace
process and Yassir Arafat's Palestinian Authority to destroy these
organizations before they can accomplish their goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military wing of Hamas and Islamic Jihad is greatly
weakened,'' said Ronni Shaked, a reporter and terrorism expert for
the Israeli newspaper Yediot Aharanot. ``The skilled engineers have
been killed and their materials have been taken in raids of bomb
factories.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Israeli police, two bombers whom they identified as
``terrorists'' blew themselves up in a car that rammed a stall at
9:45 Friday morning at an entrance to the Mahane Yehuda market,
which just 16 months earlier had been the target of a suicide
bombing that killed 15 people and wounded more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21 people wounded in Friday's attack, hospital officials
said, one was listed in serious condition. Huge casualties were
avoided because the car carrying the bomb erupted in several small
explosions and then belched smoke for over one minute before
detonating, according to witnesses. Several people, fearing that it
was a bomb, yelled for people to take cover before the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on Israeli television Friday night, Arafat condemned
the bombing and reconfirmed his commitment to dismantle the
infrastructure of terrorism that Israelis claim has been allowed to
operate in the Palestinian controlled areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We condemn this criminal act, whose aim is to derail the peace
process... We condemn them and at the same time we are comitted to
implement the requirements of the agreements in pursuing, fighting
and arresting these people,'' Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the bomb tore through the produce stalls, delis and
bakeries of the market, Netanyahu's right wing cabinet was meeting
in the Prime Minister's office to discuss the ratification vote of
the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Before the bombing, Netanyahu was believed to have secured
enough votes in his fractious coalition to approve the deal and
narrowly avoid an attempt to bring down his government by
hardliners who oppose a peace process begun by their more liberal
predecessors in the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts Friday said it was unclear if the attack could unravel
Netanyahu's carefully crafted support for the plan, which followed
a Hamas suicide bombing mission on October 29 that almost decimated
a bus full of Israeli school children in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said Friday that the 17-member
body would meet again to discuss the agreement only ``after it is
satisfied that the Palestinian Authority is taking intensive steps
for an all-out war against the terrorist groups and their
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River Memorandum calls for the Palestinian Authority to
make a concerted effort to combat terrorism and arrest known
terrorists in return for the phased withdrawal by Israeli troops of
13 percent more West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
   Terrorism expert Shaked said that the Wye agreement was a
``declaration of war'' on Hamas and Islamic Jihad by Arafat's
Palestinian Authority which, under the agreement, will work in
cooperation with the the US Central Intelligence Agency and Israeli
security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian authorites moved swiftly to make arrests after the
incident in Gaza. They rounded up several of Hamas' leading
militants and top officials and placed its founder, Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad) know they have
little time left to destroy the peace process. They are on the run
and they are desperate to say they are still alive right now,''
Shaked added.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the bombing, the twisted frame and engine
block of the red Fiat that carried the bomb lay in a heap before
several blown out stores. Rescue workers tended to the wounded and
rushed men and women with blood-streaked faces to ambulances.
Almost immediatley, shop owners began sweeping up the shattered
glass in their stores and were going about picking up produce
stalls that had been turned over by the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and store owners appeared equally divided over the
significance of the event. Half saw the bombing as a grim reminder
that peace will never work, while the other half believed it to be
a sign that the government must try harder than ever to create a
lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   Yehudit Levi, 43, a bank teller, was standing on line at a
bakery just moments before the bomb exploded. She saw the car
smoking for roughly two minutes, and then just moments after
Israeli police began yelling for shoppers to take cover, it
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   She hid behind the entryway wall of the bakery and, through
thick black smoke, saw shoppers all around her lying on the ground.
She saw the bodies of the two suspected suicide bombers torn apart
and tossed just a few feet away from her. One of them lay face up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at his face, I don't know why. And I felt pity. I
don't know why,'' she said. This is life in Jerusalem. But the
peace process has to continue. It is the only way we will ever stop
the bombings.''
</P>
<P>
   Shimshon Shaumi, a vegetable stand owner, said his brother-
in-law was killed in the first Mahane Yehuda bombing 16 months ago
and his brother was severely wounded. When the explosion shook the
market again Friday, the memories and the fear from the last
bombing came flooding back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are blowing us up, how can we believe the Arabs want
peace?'' he asked. ``They should stop this peace process. It won't
work. How many bombs have to happen to tell us that?''
</P>
<P>
   Nader Qawasmi, a Palestinian laborer who works for Shaumi, has
also suffered losses from terrorism. A Palestinian friend was
killed in the previous bombing as well. And his own brother was
killed in a Jerusalem bus bombing four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all suffer from these attacks,'' Qawasmi said. ``And we all
want peace. You just have to hope that these people who want to
destroy it will not win.''

INSURANCE CHIEF REFUSES TO WITHDRAW FROM AUTO RATE DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Defying Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, Insurance
Commissioner Linda Ruthardt refused Friday to withdraw from
proceedings to set next year's auto insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger said in an Oct. 27 letter to Ruthardt that she
should step down as judge in the rate-setting process because she
had compromised her objectivity by meeting privately last March
with a top industry official.
</P>
<P>
   After wavering for a week, Ruthardt responded late Friday with a
7-page letter to the attorney general's office acknowledging she
met with the official but denying any improper discussions that
would require her to recuse herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not engage in any improper communication,'' she wrote.
``Nor did I acquire any disqualifying bias or prejudge the merits
of the now-pending proceeding, nor is my impartiality reasonably
subject to question.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute, which Celluci adminstration officials have
dismissed as politically motivated, centered around a meeting in
March between Ruthardt and Daniel Johnson, president of the
Automobile Insurers Bureau of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston has said the meeting was merely an attempt to simplify
the rate-setting process. Critics, however, have said Johnston was
trying to tip the process in the favor of insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's letter, Ruthardt said she ``listened'' to Johnston's
proposal to streamline the profits portion of the hearings but
``merely agreed in principle to the pursuit of simplification.''
</P>
<P>
   She denied Harshbarger's charge that Johnston persuaded Ruthardt
to ``settle'' the profits portion of the rate-setting case and said
that meeting with Johnston was proper.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt also cited previous cases to support her position that
``considerable lattitude is allowed in the exercise of the
commissioner's legislatively conferred discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger aides have said the attorney general could challenge
Ruthardt in court immediately or wait until the 1999 rates have
been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost to Celluci in the race for governor, Harshbarger
will leave the attorney general's office in January. A spokeswoman
didn't return phone calls requesting a response to Ruthardt's
letter late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt said in her letter to the office, ``I hope that in the
course of this representation you can agree with me that based on
the foregoing it is not in the best interests of consumers that I
recuse myself.''

EXTRAORDINARY TALES OF LIFE AMONG THE TURMOIL OF MITCH

<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Beyond the horrendous death toll of
Hurricane Mitch, there are extraordinary tales of the living and
what they went through just to stay alive.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed from hospital beds and refugee centers across
Honduras and Nicaragua, the survivors provide countless profiles in
courage.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a week after the storm pounded Central America with its
debilitating rains, rescuers are beginning to reach thousands of
stranded people across Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Many have lost their whole families. Most have lost their homes
and all of their worldly possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Some have lost a leg, an arm or both. Some are so weak or
injured they can barely talk.
</P>
<P>
   But almost none of them cry.
</P>
<P>
   Isabella Arriola Batiz climbed up on her roof to escape the
flooding in the Honduran town of Santa Rosa de Aguan. She was found
90 miles out in the Caribbean sea four days later, still clinging
to a fragment of the roof.
</P>
<P>
   One man clung to a treetop in Nicaragua for three days. He was
rescued and taken to a hospital where both his gangrened legs were
amputated.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Martinez, 19, was in his home in the northeastern
Nicaraguan village known as El Porvenir last week when he heard a
strange noise.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped outside and saw a wall of black water descending from
the side of the Casitas volcano and just started running.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father, mother, grandmother and brother were all left in
the house,'' he said. ``Supposedly, they all died.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez spoke a few days ago from a hospital bed, with blood on
the floor and a stifling stench of rotting flesh in the air.
</P>
<P>
   With relief supplies still mostly unavailable, many survivors
have been forced to renew their severely taxed reserves of
endurance and courage.
</P>
<P>
   Liseth Selaya, a 25-year-old single mother of two, watched a
landslide sweep away her brother and her home in a Tegucigalpa
neighborhood known as Nueva Esperanza, or New Hope, last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Selaya now lives with her two young daughters in a nearby
school, where the three of them try to get by in a small classroom
now populated by 55 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mattresses are so scarce that 10 or more people share each bed
in shifts.
</P>
<P>
   The government has given the people in the school enough rice
and beans for about one meal a day.
</P>
<P>
   With no kerosene, the families cook their beans and rice with
diesel fuel. Smoke fills the room each time they light their
makeshift stoves.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the people got a special treat: chicken feet, which
they boiled to make a soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I can think about now is surviving, just
getting through the day,'' said Selaya. ``I don't know where we
will go, but I can't think about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we eat once,'' she said, ``there isn't anything left for
the other two meals that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Gomez was once Selaya's neighbor in their hillside
community. Now he sleeps in another room in the same school.
</P>
<P>
   He has lost a home, a sister, two cousins and a few more distant
relatives. His job at a construction site is gone. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Red Cross volunteers came to Nueva Esperanza a week ago Friday
to warn the residents closest to the river that they might need to
be evacuated because of the flooding.
</P>
<P>
   But the volunteers didn't know that the entire hillside was
going to crumble into the river, so they told Gomez and others near
the top of the hill that it was all right to stay in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rains just kept falling,'' Gomez said. ``At about 1 in the
morning Saturday, there was this wind, and things got cold. We
realized that the cold was from the rising of the river below. Then
there was this rumbling, and everything just fell.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez was in a house with 10 people. Five people survived,
including his wife. Even many of those who managed to escape with
their lives and their homes have problems.
</P>
<P>
   In downtown Tegucigalpa, Casto Eguigure spent Friday trying to
clean up the remains of the automobile repair shop the he has owned
for the last 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The floodwaters of the Choluteca River reached the roof of the
repair shop, sweeping away some cars parked there and overturning
others.
</P>
<P>
   Eguigure and his eight employees went to work Friday, digging
through up to 9 feet of river sand to see what tools and parts they
can salvage.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the cars owned by clients or the building, which is
owned by a landlord, Eguigure estimates that his business suffered
more than $70,000 damage. He has no insurance, but he is already
looking for a new location to reopen his shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can do is fight on,'' he said. ``I've got to pick myself
up and get back to work.''

LINE PLAY CONCERNS GAILEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Though he's confident in the substitutes'
abilities, Cowboys coach Chan Gailey acknowledged yesterday that
the inexperience on the right side of the offensive line worries
him going into tomorrow's game against the New York Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Second-year backup Tony Hutson will move into the starting
lineup at right tackle in place of Erik Williams, who is doubtful
with a sprained left foot. Hutson will play alongside rookie guard
Flozell Adams, who will start for the fourth consecutive game in
place of Everett McIver (sprained right knee). Gailey said he is
worried about the execution from his young linemen against the
Giants' standout defensive line, which has accounted for 24 sacks,
including eight by left end Michael Strahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have not played together before,'' Gailey said. ``The key
will be communication.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutson, who started one game last season and has only been on
the active roster for two games this season, said he is ready for
the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident in myself,'' Hutson said. ``Strahan is one of
the top players in the league. I'm going to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Hutson had a good week of practice, and it's just a
matter of him making the most of his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said he is close to ruling Williams completely out for
the game but said he expects Williams to be ready for next week's
matchup with the Cardinals.
Business as usual
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said helping running back Emmitt Smith break Tony
Dorsett's team rushing record is not part of the Cowboys' game plan
for the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who has rushed for 11,942 yards in his career, is 94
yards behind Dorsett's mark of 12,036.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not something we are thinking about going into the
game,'' Gailey said. ``We just want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said the record will only become an issue if Smith's
close to it late in the game and the Cowboys have a big lead.
</P>
<P>
   Smith doesn't plan to leave anything to chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning comes first,'' Smith said. ``But it's a big deal to me
and especially to be able to do it at home. That's a special
record.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Giants have made a habit of picking on Cowboys
cornerback Kevin Smith more than any other team the past two
seasons, Gailey said he will not change the defense and is
confident that Smith will be up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Center Clay Shiver and deep snapper Dale Hellestrae, who have
been hobbled this week with sprained right knees, both practiced
yesterday and will play against the Giants.

MOYNIHAN DELAYED RETIREMENT IN DEFERENCE TO PARTY, EX-AIDES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Adds background on retirement decision.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM and DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former aides to Daniel Patrick Moynihan said Friday
the senior senator from New York had considered retiring years ago
but waited until he believed the Democrats in the state were in a
strong position.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence O'Donnell, who worked on Moynihan's staff for eight
years, said the senator had talked before this week's election
about retiring but that he was concerned that his departure would
leave New York without a Democratic senator.
</P>
<P>
   But with Rep. Charles E. Schumer's defeat Tuesday of Republican
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, O'Donnell said Moynihan saw an opportunity to
leave without hurting his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Schumer victory absolutely solidified a decision that he
was pretty close to making anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan, 71, announced Friday he would retire at the end of his
current term, which expires in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Maffei, a former press secretary to Moynihan, agreed with
O'Donnell. ``The exact timing of the announcement surprised me, but
... Schumer's victory an was important factor.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell said Moynihan began considering retirement a decade
ago. ``In 1988, when he was running for re-election, he did say he
thought that would be last term,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei said Moynihan did not want to leave the Democratic Party
in a vulnerable position, with the possibility of a Republican
winning Moynihan's vacated seat and leaving New York with two GOP
senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moynihan is not leaving the party in a bad position at all by
retiring,'' he said. ``I think that was important factor.''
</P>
<P>
   With his stark white hair and academic demeanor, Moynihan is
towering figure in the Senate. Although often waxing eloquently on
the history of programs before the Senate, Moynihan was a practical
deal-maker, working on both side of isle to get legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   He is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which
oversees taxes, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and welfare _
all of which are at the heart of the Congress' annual political
fights.
</P>
<P>
   He was the panel's chairman when Democrats held the Senate
majority in 1993 and 1994. During those years and afterwards, he
has been a maverick who at times has clashed with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the decision early in the Clinton administration
to focus on revamping the nation's health care system rather than
overhauling welfare, and in 1996 he criticized the president for
signing the Republican-written welfare overhaul bill.
</P>
<P>
   Before winning a Senate seat in 1976, Moynihan served in the
Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford administrations. Nixon named
Moynihan ambassador to India in 1973. Ford made him United Nations
ambassador in 1975. Known for bluntly asserting U.S. positions,
Moynihan stayed at the United Nations only eight months before
returning to Harvard University to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction from Moynihan's Senate colleagues was one of praise for
the senator's achievements and sadness at his departure.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who was elected to the Senate in 1980, called Moynihan
a great senator for New York and the nation. ``It has been my
privilege to call him my friend and to serve with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert J. Kerrey, D-Neb., who also serves on the Senate
Finance Committee, said Moynihan was an ``innovative thinker and
leader,'' and that he was ``heartened by the fact that Senator
Moynihan will be with us in the Senate for these next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Political scholars said Moynihan would be remembered for his
work in a host of areas, including restructuring the Social
Security system and helping to pass deficit-reduction legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely unique,'' said Stephen Hess, a political
expert at the Brooking Institution, an independent Washington-based
think tank. ``There has never been anyone else in the history of
the United States like him in that he is an intellectual in the
Senate who remained an intellectual.''

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan grew up the rough lower Manhattan neighborhood known as
Hell's Kitchen. His father was an alcoholic who left the family
when Moynihan was 6. His mother operated a saloon.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tulsa, Okla., Moynihan became an academic who taught at
Harvard before going into public service.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first times he captured public attention was in 1965,
when his report, ``The Negro Family,'' warned that the growth of
single-parent families was only worsening inner cities. He wrote
that ``benign neglect'' would be better than continuing failed
welfare programs _ an argument that led to criticism by some that
he was racist.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he won a contentious four-way Democratic Senate primary
that included feminist Bella Abzug. He went on to defeat the
conservative Republican incumbent, James Buckley. Moynihan was
re-elected easily three times after that.

LOTUS NOTES LEADS MICROSOFT EXCHANGE, NEWSLETTER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: cc:Mail. is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lotus Development Corp. has regained bragging rights over
Microsoft Corp. in their struggle over the market for business
communications software. Numbers released Friday show that Lotus'
flagship Notes software outsold Microsoft's rival product, Exchange
for the first time in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic Mail &AMP; Messaging Systems (EMMS), an industry
newsletter published in Washington, found that Lotus sold 3.4
million units of Notes in the third quarter of 1998, while
Microsoft sold 3.2 million units of Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Though glad of the good news, Lotus executive vice president
Mike Zisman ridiculed the idea that the competition between
Microsoft and Lotus could be measured by reading the latest
quarterly sales figures. ``We still think these numbers are pretty
silly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What matters, Zisman said, is that Notes continues to hold a
substantial lead over Exchange in total users worldwide. The EMMS
report found that as of Sept. 30, there were 28.5 million Notes
users compared to 19.8 million Exchange users. ``We entered the
year with a 10 million lead on them,'' said Zisman. ``We'll exit
the year with a 10 million lead on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Comiskey, an analyst with International Data Corp. in
Framingham, confirmed that Lotus is still well ahead of Microsoft,
but warned that Lotus had better keep glancing over its shoulder.
``Microsoft has definitely shown a lot of momentum in the last two
years or so,'' Comiskey said. Still, he noted that Lotus is set to
ship a new version of Notes by year's end, which should result in a
substantial boost in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus, based in Cambridge, Mass. but now a division of IBM Corp.
invented the concept of groupware -- sophisticated software that
lets groups of workers coordinate their activities using electronic
mail and shared databases. Microsoft responded in 1996 with
Exchange, and though the Lotus product is still generally
considered more sophisticated, Exchange sales have grown rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   But Zisman claimed that much of the growth in Exchange users is
due to Microsoft's decision to stop producing upgraded versions of
an earlier electronic mail product, Microsoft Mail. This led many
customers to upgrade to Exchange, said Zisman. Meanwhile, Lotus
continues to produce new versions of its older e-mail product,
cc:Mail.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Exchange product manager Doug Stumberger shrugged off
Lotus' third-quarter victory. ``We consider this a two-horse
race,'' Stumberger said, ``and we do expect the lead to change from
quarter to quarter.'' He also noted that for the year to date, the
total Exchange sales level of 9.8 million units is still well ahead
of Notes' 9.2 million.

 &HT;    EDs: Corrects secretary of defense title
 &HT;    Ex-U.S. secretaries: Problems will remain with Saddam in power
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something needs to be done about troublesome Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein, seven former U.S. secretaries of defense
agreed Friday. Exactly what is another story.
</P>
<P>
   This much the secretaries could agree on: Problems will persist
as long as Saddam remains in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the capability, but we don't seem to have the will to
do it,'' said Caspar Weinberger, who served under President Ronald
Reagan from 1981 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that Saddam , who again this week refused to
cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors, is trying to build weapons
of mass destruction, Weinberger said.
</P>
<P>
   But William Perry, who served from 1994 to 1997 under President
Clinton, asked his colleagues what could be done realistically. Did
they think, he asked, that cruise missile attacks or bombings would
change anything?
</P>
<P>
   Answered Richard Cheney, defense secretary from 1989 to 1993 for
President George Bush, ``Part of the difficulty is that we keep
looking for the silver bullet in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   James Schlesinger, who served Presidents Richard Nixon and
Gerald Ford from 1973 to 1975, urged everyone to stop the
``hand-wringing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you can take out Saddam Hussein,'' Schlesinger said,
``then you are going to have to live with Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Cabinet members made their observations at the 12th
Annual Report of the Secretaries of Defense, a two-hour conference
sponsored by the Southern Center for International Studies and held
at Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Their comments came as the Clinton administration debates what
to do with $100 million that Congress allocated last month for
military assistance to Iraqi opposition groups trying to topple
Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the former secretaries urged the Clinton
administration to send a clear, consistent message. Arab allies in
the Persian Gulf are hesitant to support the United States because
Clinton has not followed through on threats to attack Saddam, three
of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Saddam Hussein,'' said Donald Rumsfeld,
President Ford's defense minister from 1975 to 1977. ``His
neighbors believe that no matter what we do, he's still going to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our credibility is eroding,'' said Frank Carlucci, Reagan's
defense chief from 1987 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A seeming lack of consistency in foreign policy was one of the
major complaints the former officials voiced as they addressed a
wide array of topics, including the Balkans, Russia, Africa, Korea
and terrorism in general. Several of the secretaries, six of whom
served under Republican presidents, criticized what they see as an
absence of leadership under Democrat Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to act decisively and firmly and you should never
make a threat you're not willing to carry out the next day,''
Weinberger said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States must pick its spots, said Melvin Laird,
Nixon's defense chief from 1968 to 1973: ``We're trying to do too
many things in too many places with too few resources.''
</P>
<P>
   The proceedings were videotaped and are scheduled to be be shown
on GPTV on Tuesday, Dec. 15, at 11:30 p.m. and Sunday, Dec. 20, at
11:30 a.m.

FREE AGENCY `SILLY SEASON,' HARRINGTON SAYS

   John Harrington calls it the ``silly season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens every year at this time,'' said the Red Sox CEO.
``You get to free agency and the agents start putting out these
stories about their players that simply are not true and the media
starts to run with the stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``All week long, I kept hearing about our team and the deadline
on Mo Vaughn. What deadline? There's no deadline. And they keeping
saying that I'm waiting to find out what the market for Mo Vaughn
is. That's not true. What we're waiting for is Mo's people to find
out what the market is. And then when they find out what it is,
then we will sit down and give them our offer. We didn't want to be
the first ones to make an offer because then they could take our
offer and use it to negotiate with other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Mo. We're going to give it our best shot. We think
that time will come somewhere in the middle of next week. I'll say
it again. Either it's going to get done in a hurry or it's not
going to get done. We've got agents for some of the biggest-name
free agents banging on our door looking for a deal, so we are going
to move fast.''

   Former coach Tom Coughlin recalls one of the greatest victories
in Boston College football history, when the Eagles beat Notre Dame
for the first time ever, winning, 41-39, five years ago in South
Bend, Ind., in exciting fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tough deal for our team at the time,'' said
Coughlin, now the highly successful coach of the Jacksonville
Jaguars. ``We had to play them back-to-back years on the road when
they had great ball clubs. When we went out there to play them in
'92, they were loaded. Our kids were awestruck and a little bit
intimidated by the surroundings and everything that goes with
playing a football game at Notre Dame as the visiting team. They
spanked us pretty good (54-7) that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to play them back there the next year, and we studied
them for a full year. All season long, we talked to our players
about the opportunity we thought we were going to have to beat
them. Things broke right for us. We started playing real well in
the middle of the season. Then the week before, they beat Florida
State to become No. 1. That gave us a perfect situation. Our kids
went out there to win, not just to play Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got off to a good start. We could move the ball all day on
them and score points. But near the end, they rallied and got ahead
of us with a couple of minutes to play (39-38). We didn't panic. We
had spent more time on the two-minute drill that year than any team
in the country. Our kids knew what to do. We moved the ball and got
into position for the winning field goal with one play left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with David Gordon, our kicker, on the sideline and
told him, `Don't do anything fancy. Just strike the ball solidly
and get it into the air.' He did. The ball started out right and
then went right back inside the goalposts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great feeling. It stays with you the rest of your
life. We beat a great team that day. Later that night, I remmember
riding the buses, getting close to the campus, and seeing the
lights on in the stadium. We didn't know what was going on. It was
crazy. They said there were 10,000 fans waiting for us. I remember
Father (J. Donald) (then the school president) wanting to make a
speech but he couldn't because it was so noisy. The students were
jumping up and down on the cars in the parking lot to get a better
look at what was going on. That was the bad part. Those were our
guys. They ruined some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   One high-ranking Notre Dame official said recently in a private
conversation that the defeat was the toughest to accept in his
tenure at the school. It cost Notre Dame the national championship
and millions of dollars.

   Ralph Wilson, owner of the Buffalo Bills, on his new starting
quarterback, Doug Flutie: ``No one mentions what a great
ballhandler this guy is. He's the best in the league. He's the best
I've seen in a long time. There were three or four times in our
Miami game last week that I thought they sacked him. I thought he
still had the ball but he didn't.'' Flutie was asked why he
continued to carry out his play fakes even when it was obvious the
Miami defenders were using them to take a few extra hard hits. ``I
like when they hit me thinking I got the ball,'' said Flutie.
``When they do that, they can't be tackling the guy that does have
the ball.'' ... Rick Pitino's long-shot special for Breeders' Cup
day: ``I like a horse named Arch (15-1) in the Classic. He is bred
by Seth Hancock, one of the great people in racing, and he told me
the horse is going to win.'' Pitino reportedly developed his
interest in racing as a result of a friendship with Hancock when
Pitino was coaching at Kentucky.

   Things are not going well for Tim ``Rambo'' Johnson, the Blue
Jays manager who got the job with a large boost from his good buddy
Roger Clemens. Johnson was the bench coach for the Red Sox under
Kevin Kennedy and used to enthrall players and management alike
with tales of his adventures in Vietnam with the US Marines.
Johnson even kept a ``Rambo''-type knife in his locker, which he
took out from time to time to demonstrate how he engaged in
hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Now it has been revealed that
Johnson was never in Vietnam. His explanation is that he was in the
Marine Reserves and trained young soldiers to fight in Vietnam. But
that's not the way he was telling it around the Red Sox clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of this past season, Johnson fired first base coach
Jack Hubbard, who claimed it was because he was too close to
pitching coach Mel Queen, whom Johnson did not like. Hubbard said
Johnson told him not to sit beside Queen on the Toronto bench but
Hubbard refused to obey because Queen was his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnam thing wasn't between him and Mel,'' Hubbard said
in the Toronto Sun, ``but more a case of the players losing respect
for him. He was always trying to draw a parallel between what they
were going through and his own problems in the rice paddies or
whatever. He was always trying to revert to something he never
experienced. I should feel sorry for him. If you have to lie to
make someone believe in you, you are not cut out for the job.''

 &HT;    Energy agent sheds customers for Shell
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Grass Roots Energy, a suburban Atlanta-based ``buyers'
agent'' for natural gas customers, will turn over its list of
35,000 Georgia subscribers to Shell Oil Co.'s gas marketing
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   The consumers are under no obligation to purchase gas from Shell
Energy Services and have been released from agreements designating
Grass Roots as their bargaining agent for one year, Grass Roots
Energy President David Rich said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Energy Services will now contact ``each and every one'' of
the Grass Roots subscribers to make sales offers for natural gas,
said Shaun P. Kingsbury, national marketing manager for the
Houston-based Shell subsidiary. The consumers will be contacted
through a joint Shell/Grass Roots mailing or by telephone from
Shells call center in Syracuse, N.Y. and will be able to start
buying gas from Shell as early as Dec. 1, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Grass Roots consumers will be offered no special deals,
Kingsbury said. They will get the same terms Shell is offering all
of Atlanta Gas Lignt Co.'s 1.4 million customers who can now choose
alternative suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of Friday's deal were not disclosed, but Rich
said Shell will pay Grass Roots a commission for every customer
Shell signs up. Kingsbury said he anticipates a ``large
percentage'' of Grass Roots subscribers will do so.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement offers Shell the prospect of moving to the
forefront of Georgias new gas market. As of Friday, a total of
20,648 homes and businesses had switched from Atlanta Gas Light to
new rival marketers.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Natural Gas Services, the new marketing affiliate of
Atlanta Gas Light, and South Carolina-based SCANA Energy have until
now been the market leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Shell is offering two pricing plans: a guaranteed rate for one
year to be negotiated with each consumer and 10 percent savings
from Atlanta Gas Lights rates for gas that account for about 60
percent of an average bill.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, a former utility executive, founded Grass Roots last year
with the goal of signing up thousands of consumers, then
negotiating on their behalf for the lowest possible rates with
marketing companies. Grass Roots uses a network of about 3,000
partime marketing representatives that are compensated under a
multilevel marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   Rich said he spent about $500,000 on commissions paid out to the
sales reps and plans to pay out more commissions as customers begin
receiving gas from Shell.
</P>
<P>
   Rich at at first sought to sign over his subscribers to SCANA
Energy, which is offering new customers $50 worth of free gas. But
the South Carolina-based company declined to negotiate an agreement
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Rich said that Shell offers his subscribers the best deal
availale and that those who select the Texas company ``are going to
start saving right away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasnt the most lucrative deal for us, but its best deal
for the consumer,'' Rich said.
</P>
<P>
   Shells agreement with Rich is limited to those customers he had
signed up as of Friday. But Rich said he will continue his efforts
and plans to negotiate more deals with marketing companies. ``Were
going to continue on,'' he said.

 &HT;    AGL reports profits
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AGL Resources Inc. reported Friday a profit for the
fourth quarter, compared with a year-ago loss, and it credited
capital and operating cost controls and a deregulation-related rate
restructuring affecting its Atlanta Gas Light Co. subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first look at how deregulation will affect the
company's financials, as Atlanta Gas Light, AGL's largest
subsidiary, becomes a gas delivery service and the sale of gas is
left to another AGL unit.
</P>
<P>
   AGL reported net income of $11 million, or 19 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $3.4 million, or 6 cents a share a year
ago. Revenue totaled $205.4 million, up from $194.6 million a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The per-share earnings beat analysts' expectations of 3 cents,
according to a survey by First Call. The earnings were reported
after the markets closed Friday. AGL's stock closed at $21.25, up
12 1/2 cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the state's deregulation law, which went into effect
Nov. 1, Atlanta Gas Light's rate structure was changed effective
July 1 so that revenue collected by the utility for delivering gas
is averaged out over the year instead of being recorded month to
month, which would vary based on usage. The change had the most
pronounced impact for the July-September quarter, because gas
consumption, and hence revenues, are generally at a low point.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the new rate schedule, the company expects second-quarter
1999 revenues collected during the winter months to decrease from
the second quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Walter M. Higgins, president and chief executive officer, said
now that deregulation is in place, ``were ready for competition,
and were positioning our organization to achieve our financial
objective of a compound annual earnings growth rate of 6 percent to
7 percent over the next five years.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to continued revenue for delivering gas through
Atlanta Gas Light Co., AGL has established a new subsidiary to
market gas, Georgia Natural Gas Services, at deregulated prices.

 &HT;    Grocery warehouse walkout ends
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Union employees at two Atlanta warehouses that serve
96 metro area Kroger grocery stores went back to work early Friday
morning after reaching a settlement with two companies that took
over their operations.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 workers, who were employees of Cincinnati-based Kroger
until midnight Thursday, went on strike Tuesday and picketed the
warehouses, located on International Park Drive in south Atlanta
and Oakleigh Drive in East Point. Employees were concerned they
would lose their pensions and other benefits under their new
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Kroger sold the warehouses to CS Integrated, a Secaucus (cq),
N.J.-based subsidiary of ProLogis(cq). The trucking operations are
being outsourced to Ruan Transportation Management Systems of Des
Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   After a sharp drop in shipments to all Kroger stores in Georgia
and a few outside the state, Kroger, CSI and Ruan moved quickly to
end the strike. As part of the agreement, CSI took over the
warehouses Thursday, earlier than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended much sooner than we thought it would,'' said Kenneth
Hilbish, president of Teamsters Local 528. Hilbish said the union's
new agreement with CSI allowed the workers to essentially keep
their benefits and wages.
</P>
<P>
   All of the warehouse workers and drivers were guaranteed
employment with the new company, Hilbish said. None of the
companies would comment on specifics of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-area Kroger stores were able to keep their shelves
adequately stocked during the strike. The union said store managers
drove and unloaded trucks. Kroger wouldn't comment on how stores
received deliveries during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Like other large supermarket chains, Kroger has been selling
warehouse operations to cut costs and focus on the retail end of
the business. With rampant consolidation in the industry and
increased competition, efficiency has become increasingly
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supermarkets are not generally good at running their own
warehouses,'' said James Singer, a principal with consulting firm
A.T. Kearney. ``The trend in the last 15 to 20 years was to take as
much of the distribution operations in-house as possible, but that
has changed recently.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, many grocers have changed their
conventional strategy to let logistics specialists take over those
operations, Singer said. Also, selling distribution operations
presents an opportunity for supermarket chains to get out of union
labor situations, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, in Kroger's case, the recent $11.8 billion purchase of the
Fred Meyer chain has tightened the purse strings. ``Fred Meyer has
got a lot of debt, and Kroger is looking to conserve cash flow,''
said Mark Husson, a Merrill Lynch analyst. ``Getting rid of bricks
and mortar and trucks is one way to do that.''

BRITAIN DEALS WITH LATEST SURGE OF HOMPHOBIA

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Tony Blair seldom misses a chance to plug Cool
Britannia, his vision of a tolerant, pluralistic Britain.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it is not surprising that Blair and many other
Britons have been left speechless by a week in which one of his
Cabinet ministers resigned after being robbed at a gay cruising
spot and another was outed. The resulting controversy triggered an
unsettling burst of homophobia across England.
</P>
<P>
   The squall began last week when Ron Davies, the Welsh Secretary
and odds-on favorite to become the first Welsh prime minister when
its local parliament convenes next year, resigned after he told
police he was robbed by strangers he met at Clapham Common in
London. Davies, who is married and has a child, was economical with
the truth, citing privacy concerns. But even his friends
acknowledge he was robbed by several men after picking up a
stranger at a place known as a spot where gay men meet to arrange
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the investigation say Davies went to the police
after one of his assailants tried to blackmail him by threatening
to go to the tabloid press and expose him as a closeted homosexual
unless Davies paid him. So far, six men have been arrested in
connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
   Just days later, Peter Mandelson, Minister for Trade and
Industry, who is widely seen as Blair's most talented, if
Machiavellian, adviser, was outed on Newsnight, the ``Nightline''
of the usually staid BBC. Mandelson has made no comment on the
claims that he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy grew after the BBC host who initiated the
outing, Jeremy Paxman, apologized to Mandelson, and BBC superiors
issued a memorandum ordering its journalists not to make references
to Mandelson's sexuality on future programs. This led to charges of
censorship, especially from Conservative Party members who,
trailing Blair's Labor Party badly in the polls, will seize upon
anything to attack an extremely popular government.
</P>
<P>
   But most troubling to many Britons was the homophobic invective
unleashed by the events. Norman Tebbit, a former Cabinet minister
and Conservative member of the House of Lords, responded to the
news by saying homosexuals should be barred from holding important
Cabinet positions because they could engage in a gay conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world where Freemasons are being asked to identify
themselves as such in order that the public may judge if they are
improperly doing one another favors, surely it is important that
homosexuals should not be in a position to do each other favors,''
Tebbit said in a letter to The Daily Telegraph, the most
conservative of Britain's national dailies.
</P>
<P>
   Tebbit's comments led the Conservative Party to distance itself
from him. A spokesman said the party leader, William Hague, has
gone out of his way to recruit homosexuals as party members. Hague,
his aides point out, supports the reduction of the homosexual age
of consent to 16, matching that for heterosexuals, and sent a
letter in support of the annual Gay Pride parade.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of being seen as bigoted, some conservatives point out that
Tebbit, ornery to begin with, has become increasingly bitter since
1984, when he was badly hurt and his wife left an invalid by an
Irish Republican Army bomb that killed five people but missed its
prime target, Margaret Thatcher, then prime minister and Tebbit's
good friend.
</P>
<P>
   But others say Tebbit was expressing publicly opinions that many
people here hold privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an important lesson to learn from the events of the
past week,'' concluded The Independent, the most liberal of
Britain's national broadsheets. ``Namely, that homophobia is still
endemic to Britain.''
</P>
<P>
   A story this week that received considerably less attention than
the Davies scandal underscored the real-life consequences of
homophobia. An inquest found that a 15-year-old choirboy in
Burton-on-Trent hanged himself after being tormented by bullies who
mocked him as gay because he preferred cooking and drama to sports.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the public airing of homophobia came just weeks
after British newspapers had held up the gay-bashing murder of
Wyoming college student Matthew Shephard as evidence that
homophobia was a major problem in the United States. And
conservative newspapers here, which routinely dismiss the United
States as a crime-ridden haven for gun-nuts and lunatics, cited the
Shephard murder as further evidence, as if any were needed, that
one is better off living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't simply the conservative pundits who engaged in
verbal gay bashing. The public weighed in as well. Sir Walter
Walker of Sherborne in Dorset was typical of letter writers to the
Telegraph when he observed, ``Is not the nauseating lifestyle so
prevalent today, even in the highest places, little better than
that portrayed in the recent BBC program Wildlife On One, showing
the activities of the pygmy chimps?''
</P>
<P>
   Nansi Cree, from rural Liphook, said she agreed with Tebbit's
call to bar homosexuals from important Cabinet posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuals do not usually procreate children or live in a
family environment,'' she said. ``They do not have the basic
instinct of a stake in the future that heterosexuals have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay rights activists here were not surprised by the open
bigotry. David Alison, spokesman for the gay rights group OutRage,
dismissed Tebbit's comments as ``typical Tebbitry.'' Stephen Twigg,
one of only four openly gay members of Britain's 659-member
Parliament, said, ``Thank goodness we are no longer in the days
when Lord Tebbit's views counted for anything in government.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of progress amused gay rights activists. Rupert
Murdoch's traditionally homophobic tabloid, The Sun, confirmed that
Mandelson is gay and bleated in a headline, ``Sleaze is
Baaa-a-a-ck.'' But The Sun confounded its critics by acknowledging
that Mandelson is ``a talented politician,'' and urged him to tell
the truth. ``You will win respect for your honesty,'' it opined.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Smith, the Culture Secretary, is the first and only openly
gay British Cabinet minister. But he insists that he is a Cabinet
minister who happens to be gay, not a gay Cabinet member. He
declined to be interviewed for this article.
</P>
<P>
   As the controversy continues, one of the most popular music
videos in Britain now is by George Michael, the British pop singer
who last year was humiliated when he was charged with lewd behavior
in a Los Angeles public bathroom. The incident forced Michael
publically to admit his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   While Michael endured a litany of abuse from the tabloids and
others here who dismiss gay men as ``poofters,'' his popularity
with fans has not suffered. His new video satirizes his arrest and
ends with a pair of Los Angeles policemen kissing.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Davies nor Mandelson, though, have been as forthcoming
as Michael. Nor do they yet have the luxury of looking back with
humor. Mandelson has laughed off Tebbit and ignored claims that he
is gay. But he privately criticized the BBC for naming him in its
memo because it gave Conservatives something with which to flog
Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, meanwhile, made an emotional appeal in the House of
Commons Monday, saying he had been abused as child by his father.
``We are what we are,'' he told a hushed chamber. ``We are all
different, the products of our genes and our experiences.''

BOSS WHO TRADED PLACES WITH HOSTAGE EMPLOYEE STILL A CAPTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In an extraordinary act of compassion and executive
responsibility, the owner of a Canadian mine drilling company has
traded himself to a band of communist guerrillas in Colombia to win
the freedom of an employee, taken hostage by the rebels in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your shift is over; it's time to go home,'' Norbert Reinhart,
49, &UR;  &LR; owner of Ontario-based Terramundo Drilling Inc., told Edward
Leonard _ drill foreman at the company's exploratory site in the
rebel-infested mountains of Colombia _ as the two men switched
places on Oct 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm taking your place,'' recounted Leonard, also a
Canadian and now safely back at his home in British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic human swap in a remote pass near the Venezuela
border marked the first time Leonard, 60, had met his employer, who
remains a captive of ransom-seeking rebels of the left-wing
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an extraordinary thing when somebody puts their
life on the line to save your life,'' said Leonard. ``I wanted to
be out, but I didn't want anyone to take my place. This is one hell
of a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the hostage switch were confirmed Friday by Canada's
Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Reinhart's wife after Canadian news
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels a tremendous loyalty toward his employees and was in
real anguish when (Leonard) was taken captive,'' said Casey
Reinhart, describing the call she received from her husband shortly
after he arrived in South America last month to negotiate Leonard's
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if push came to shove, he would try to exchange
himself,'' said Casey Reinhart. ``I said, `No way!' But he was
determined to do what he felt was the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple has two little daughters, and Casey Reinhart said the
toughest part of the situation is trying to explain to Robin, 6,
and Molly, 2, why their daddy is away and can't call to tell them
good night, as he usually does when away on business.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian government officials said Friday that they had warned
Reinhart not to make the swap. They made no secret of their
displeasure with the mining executive's act, implying it might
encourage more kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had frankly recommended that this particular deal not be
done,'' Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy told reporters in Ottawa.
``These kind of private deals should not be struck.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Canada is doing what it can to win Reinhart's release,
Axworthy stressed that ultimate responsibility rests with the
Colombian government. Last year the violence-torn country saw 1,800
kidnappings, with 58 foreigners among those abducted.
</P>
<P>
   Many kidnappings in Colombia are undertaken by rebels seeking
ransom to finance their guerrilla war against Bogota.
</P>
<P>
   According to Canadian press reports, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces are seeking $2 million for the release of Reinhart, but
communications with the group have been sporadic because of
fighting in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was kidnapped on June 24, a week after being hired by
Reinhart after a telephone interview and reporting to Terramundo's
exploratory drilling site near Bucaramanga. The company was
subcontracting for a Vancouver-based mining firm, Grey Star
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said he was not mistreated during his 106-day ordeal,
during which he shed 25 pounds. ``I was overweight anyway,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime veteran of mining exploration in South America, with
a fair knowledge of Spanish, Leonard said he did not consider the
job for Terramundo to be risky. Guerrillas occasionally stopped by
the remote drilling site, but made no threats or demands.
</P>
<P>
   That changed on the day he was seized at gunpoint and marched
deep into the mountains with two other hostages seized from a
German relief project. They slept on the forest floor, bathed in
frigid streams and were marched from place to place by their
captors.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas traded the drilling employee for his boss after
weeks of secret negotiations, apparently carried out by
intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
   The switch was made on a dusty mountain pass where Reinhart
arrived accompanied by a bodyguard to ensure that the rebels kept
their end of the bargain by releasing Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He traded places with me on that mountain,'' said Leonard. ``I
am very grateful.''

VICTORY MARGINS MATTER IN TITLE HUNT

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram

<P>
   Like failed network shows, brisker weather and falling leaves,
it happens every fall. College football is conducting its annual
debate. ``Running Up The Score: A Necessary Evil?''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA struggled to beat a one-win Stanford team, 28-24, and fell
in the polls. The Bruins had been No. 1 in the Bowl Championship
Series ratings going into the game; they came out with their
seventh victory and the No. 3 spot on the BCS list. If you're not
No. 1 or No. 2 with the BCS, you're tied with 110 other Division
I-A teams for third.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're telling us is that it doesn't matter if you just
win. You have to win big,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said this week.
``What it tells us is we have to run up the score. I'm not going to
run up the score. If it means we have to run up scores to win the
national championship, then we're doing the wrong thing.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt UCLA ``tried'' to run up the score against Stanford.
Top-ranked teams are expected to record blowouts against teams with
1-6 records. But margin of victory still remains a huge factor in
the national championship race.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Penn State fell to No. 2 when it beat Indiana, 35-29.
The Hoosiers scored two late touchdowns against the Nittany Lions'
second-team defense. Last year, Penn State fell from No. 1 after a
16-15 victory against Minnesota and Nebraska dropped from the top
after a 45-38 overtime victory at Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfortunate if teams have to run up the score to
prove how good they are to the voters,'' Ohio State quarterback Joe
Germaine said.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State, No. 1 in the BCS, beat Indiana, 38-7. With a 31-7
lead, Germaine threw six consecutive passes to first-team receivers
as the Buckeyes drove for a final score. Ohio State coach John
Cooper explained that he wanted to enhance Germaine's Heisman
Trophy chances by allowing him to reach 300 yards passing for the
fourth consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be penalizing our football team,'' said Cooper,
pointing out that Ohio State ended the game on Indiana's 1-yard
line and declined to try for another touchdown. ``I never have
attempted to run the score up on anybody. I hope we don't have to
have lopsided games to impress people around the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State's closest margin of victory has been 19 points over
Penn State, and the Buckeyes are averaging 29-point margins in
their eight victories.
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory counts with the media and coaches. And
with two of the computer polls in the BCS. Computer rankings
compiled by Jeff Sagarin and ``The New York Times'' each factor in
margins of victory.
Cool Brees
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Purdue was 9-3 as senior quarterback Billy Dicken
adapted quickly to coach Joe Tiller's wide-open passing attack. In
Tiller's second season, the biggest question facing the
Boilermakers was how would sophomore Drew Brees fare as Dicken's
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Brees, from Austin Westlake High School, has answered the
questions with his statistics. He has thrown for 24 touchdowns,
breaking the single-season school record that had been shared by
Mike Phipps, Mark Herrmann and Jim Everett. The Big Ten Conference
record of 29 by Ohio State's Bobby Hoying is within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just something that comes with the offense,'' Brees said.
``When you throw 50 times a game and you complete 50 percent of
them, you are going to rack up a lot of yardage.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Brees set the NCAA record for attempts (83)
and tied the record for completions (55) in a 31-24 loss to
Wisconsin. In a 56-21 victory over Minnesota, Brees set a school
record with 522 yards passing and six touchdowns.

   Rutgers is 4-4, the first time the Scarlet Knights have been at
.500 this late in the season since 1994. And this week, coach Terry
Shea had his contract extended.
</P>
<P>
   So when Shea was reminded that ``Sports Illustrated'' had picked
Rutgers as the nation's 112th team _ out of 112 _ he took the
opportunity to fire a shot at the sports weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If ``Sports Illustrated'' is so sharp, why can't they pick the
No. 1 team every year, and they consistently don't,'' Shea said.
``So, what makes them think they can pick the last team?''
</P>
<P>
   FYI, ``SI'''s preseason No. 1 was Ohio State.
Miami on the run
</P>
<P>
   Miami (Fla.) is 5-2, equaling last season's win total. Much of
the reason for the Hurricanes' improvement can be traced on their
ability to stop the run defensively and to move it on the ground
offensively.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Miami was 100th out of 112 schools in rush defense,
allowing 219 yards per game. This season, Miami is 26th against the
run, allowing 117 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes are 29th nationally in rushing offense, averaging
191 yards per game. Junior tailback Edgerrin James, who gained
1,098 yards last season, is 18th nationally in rushing, averaging
108 yards per game.
Stat corner
</P>
<P>
   There were 19 new coaches going into the 1990 season. Four are
still on the job: Wisconsin's Barry Alvarez, Florida's Steve
Spurrier, Utah's Ron McBride and Miami of Ohio's Randy Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (Ohio) running back Travis Prentice is averaging 160.5
yards per game rushing, which is second to Texas' Ricky Williams.
But Prentice's most impressive statistic is that he has 601
consecutive carries without a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson's 46-39 loss Saturday to North Carolina State was the
first time in school history the Tigers scored that many points and
lost. Clemson had been 154-0 when scoring 33 or more points.
</P>
<P>
   With Nebraska's 47-game winning streak over, Florida State takes
the lead in the home-field superiority department. The Seminoles
have a 26-game winning streak, longest in Division I-A. Florida
State has not lost in 38 games in Doak Campbell Stadium (it tied
Florida, 31-all, in 1994).
</P>
<P>
   California is a shaky 5-3. All five of its victories have been
by 10 points or fewer. The Bears have won three games by one point,
another by four and their fifth by 10. And they had a three-point
lead in that game before scoring on an interception return in the
final seconds.
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   The Cotton Bowl will have representatives at these games today:
Oklahoma at Texas A&AMP;M, Oklahoma State at Texas and Mississippi at
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Mississippi-Arkansas game in Fayetteville, Ark., has an
interesting subplot. The Rebels are coached by Tommy Tuberville,
who was a finalist for the job that went to Razorbacks coach
Houston Nutt. Tuberville did not have unanimous support on the
search committee and when he pulled out, Nutt got the job.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado coach Rick Neuheisel was surprised when the Buffaloes
fell out of The Associated Press Top 25 without playing a game.
``We got beat by bye,'' he said. ``If nothing else shows the
subjectivity of it all, I don't know what does. How do you fall 42
points without even playing? I don't understand it. It's all
barbershop talk.'' Colorado was ranked No. 24, but fell to the
``also receiving votes'' category.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl projections
</P>
<P>
   Here are the likely matchups for the Bowl Championship Series
and the Cotton Bowl. The top two teams in the BCS rankings will
play in the national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl. The
other BCS bowls will be the Rose, Sugar and Orange. Champions of
the Big 12, Big Ten, Big East, Atlantic Coast, Southeastern and
Pacific-10 conferences are assured berths in BCS bowls. Two other
at-large teams will be selected: Fiesta, Jan. 4 Ohio State vs.
Kansas State Sugar, Jan. 1 Tennessee vs. Notre Dame Rose, Jan. 1
UCLA vs. Wisconsin Orange, Jan. 1 Florida State vs. Syracuse
Cotton, Jan. 1) Nebraska vs. Arkansas

STOCK MARKET ENJOYS THE `JOHN GLENN RALLY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market has spoken. Its tidings: Happy days
are here again.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday's close, most broad market measures were either
close to their summer highs or at them. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed the week at 8,975.46, up 59.99 points for the day
and 4.46 percent for the week. That places the Dow only 3.8 percent
below its July 17 peak and up 19 percent from its Aug. 31 low. For
the year, the Dow is up a respectable 13.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Big-capitalization stocks that make up the Dow average are not
the only ones moving up. The Wilshire 5000 index, the best
approximation for the entire U.S. stock market, has shown an even
better performance. It has jumped 21 percent from its Oct. 8 low,
and is up 12.4 percent for the year. Friday, the Wilshire had a
value of $11.5 trillion. In about one month, the value of the index
has risen more than $2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the market has gone eight sessions without a down
day, its second example of such durability in less than one month.
But extended moves like these are unusual: to find a third example
of such staying power requires a trip back to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What's fueling this move? Traders and strategists point to
several disparate factors.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, perhaps, is a sea change in monetary policy
not just domestically but around the world. Central banks,
beginning with the Federal Reserve back in September and extending
to Britain, Latin America and parts of Asia, have been reducing
interest rates fairly aggressively. According to Jeffrey Applegate,
chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, since the September
rate cut by the Fed, 27 central banks have done the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last month and a half, the global policy outlook has
improved,'' Applegate said. ``Then this week we had a slew of data
that was stock-market friendly. I think the fear trade is out of
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates are almost always a tonic for stocks
largely because they mean reduced borrowing costs _ and the
potential for higher profit margins _ for corporations. So it is
not surprising that historically, a cut in the discount rate _ the
Fed's borrowing rate for banks _ is followed by an average 12-month
increase in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been getting an additional lift from a giant
increase in the money supply. According to Ian Shepherdson, chief
U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., the
broadest measure of money supply, known as M-2, which includes
currency in circulation, savings accounts and money market mutual
funds, has grown by 2.5 percent in the last two months. The
annualized rate for the last three months is 9.3 percent, the
fastest annual expansion since 1987. ``This tells me that there
isn't a credit crunch,'' Shepherdson said. ``And all this liquidity
sloshing around has got to go somewhere.'' That somewhere appears
to be the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the money supply comes basically from the Fed
providing reserves to the banking system, which banks use to lend.
``New lending and investing power is created as money turnover
speeds,'' said Robert Parks, an economist and consultant to
institutional investors in Scarborough, N.Y. ``It brings increased
spending power that can go into stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Another supply of money coming into stocks is from investors
selling Treasury holdings in recent days. When Russia effectively
defaulted on its debt in August, Treasuries became the darling of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The price of the 30-year bond has tumbled this week.
Its yield, which rises when the price falls, ended at 5.38 percent,
up from 5.15 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting, if somewhat obscure, reason for the advance in
equities may be the decline in stock volatility recently.
Volatility _ basically the range from high to low in stocks during
the trading day _ peaked on Oct. 15. Applegate notes that since
1948, the S&AMP;P 500 has risen an average 12 percent in the
twelve-month period after a peak in volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the policy outlook continues to look good, then
risk aversion should come down, volatility should come down and
returns should come up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stock market is clearly enjoying the recent spate
of good news, it is choosing to shrug off some troubling
indicators. Corporate earnings, for example. While all the earnings
announcements are not quite in for the third quarter, the period
was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many analysts have focused on the positive
announcements, those were a distinct minority. According to John
Manley Jr., equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, of the 428
companies that have reported third-quarter results, fewer than 36
percent recorded a positive surprise. Manley defines a positive
surprise as a company that reports a result greater than the
consensus estimate on Wall Street one month before the quarter
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do stocks seem to care that it is becoming increasingly
likely that the Fed's policy-making committee will not cut rates at
its Nov. 17 meeting. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, said on
Thursday that investors and lenders appear less fearful than they
had been. If the deep freeze in the credit markets is indeed
beginning to thaw, as Greenspan seems to believe, another quick
rate cut is less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are calling the recent moves in stocks the John
Glenn rally. After all, since Glenn blasted off from Cape
Canaveral, the market has rallied nearly 10 percent. As long as he
has been in orbit, so has the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn returns to earth Saturday. Investors clearly hope the
stock market does not follow suit.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a nippy November afternoon, when he would
ordinarily be leaping toward the net of a basketball rim trying to
imitate the aerodynamic glide of his hero, Michael Jordan,
11-year-old Jonathan Figueroa grimaced at the mention of
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the once aspiring point guard was transforming the Goat
Courts at 99th Street and Amsterdam Avenue _ one of New York City's
most hallowed hoops grounds _ into an asphalt baseball field. And
with repeated swings of his wooden bat, he tried to forget ever
having loved Jordan or professional basketball, which he says is so
``messed up''in a labor dispute that fans like him have been pushed
to the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is dead,'' Jonathan declared, continuing to swipe
the air with his bat. ``The players only really care about getting
a lot of money. I don't care if it ever comes back. It's all about
baseball now.''
</P>
<P>
   By the calendar at least, basketball loyalists like Jonathan
should be tethered to their televisions, trying to glimpse the
latest moves, newest phenoms and hottest highlights of the National
Basketball Association. But this season, a high-stakes labor battle
between the NBA's more than 400 players and 29 team owners has
already canceled 194 games in November and is threatening to call
off the entire schedule. The two sides are at odds over how best to
split up basketball's billion-dollar revenue base. The players want
60 percent; the owners are offering 50.
</P>
<P>
   On the basketball courts and public playgrounds of New York
City, which have launched legions of basketball dreamers _ and more
than a few NBA stars _ hard-core fans of all ages are directing
sharp words at both the players and the owners. While almost no one
is well-versed or even particularly interested in the details of
the day-to-day negotiations, many fans say they have heard enough
to know this much: Basketball is disintegrating into a game of
greed.
</P>
<P>
   As in many urban areas across the country, basketball has long
been more than just a sport in New York. It has also been a way for
young people in poor, isolated neighborhoods to grasp at America's
modern pastime: success, and the wealth that comes along with it.
But as with other such pursuits, it has a heartbreaking trail of
disappointments _ none better known in New York than that of Earl
(the Goat) Manigault, for whom the Amsterdam court is named.
Manigault became a local legend for his ability to defy gravity on
the court, but a heroin addiction spoiled his chances of pursuing a
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the NBA impasse has a particularly sharp resonance on
the city's concrete playgrounds, where those who sweat and dream of
an NBA career and its comforts feel betrayed by the few who have
made it.
</P>
<P>
   Players at the famed West Fourth Street Courts in Manhattan
recently joked about the predicament of Kenny Anderson, a former
point guard for the New Jersey Nets. Anderson said recently that he
may have to sell one of his eight luxury cars now that he is unable
to collect his $5.8 million salary from his new team, the Boston
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who also has homes in New York and Los Angeles and a
fledgling entertainment company, told The New York Times that he
spends $75,000 a year on the upkeep of his cars and is currently
losing $76,000 for every game that he does not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its insulting,'' said Stephen Breslin, 15, a West Fourth
Street regular. ``They can go out and buy a whole bunch of cars and
apartments and we're supposed to feel bad. Get real. Even the ones
who make only a couple hundred thousand still have it better than
most people out here. I don't have no sympathy for either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Some basketball devotees have so distanced themselves from the
NBA's troubles that they had to be reminded that the official start
of the season came and went this week.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Eddo Smalls, 16, spent his time and money collecting
memorabilia related to his role models, Penny Hardaway of the
Orlando Magic and Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers. But
the two have now been dethroned by the likes of ``Big Sexy Kevin
Nash'' and ``Stone Cold Steve Austin,'' starts from the world of
professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrestling is the last pure sport,'' Eddo said. They don't have
big NBA egos, everything they do is for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the NBA say they are painfully aware of the damage
the lockout is doing to the public perception of the game. ``We
know the lockout is not doing anything to endear us to fans,'' said
Brian McIntyre, a spokesman for the league. ``But we have an
economic system that is not working and if left unaddressed would
only get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   McIntrye said some teams lost so much money during last year's
regular season because of player salaries and benefits that this
year's lockout is actually saving money. Officials for the National
Basketball Players Association union did not return telephone calls
to their office.
</P>
<P>
   But like the baseball strike of 1994-95 _ when fans vowed to
turn their back on the game but returned en masse by this year _
the grousing over the basketball impasse is most likely to be
fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Rose, a 27-year-old NBA fan and amateur player, said he
is mourning the loss of basketball. ``I'm hurting,'' he said.
``Right now, I'm supposed to be in front of my TV rooting for the
Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   And others like Derek Pilgrim, 31, a friend of Rose's, said the
team owners were at fault. ``Blaming the players is crazy.
Basketball is a business now. Players know their careers probably
won't last 10, 20 years like they used to, so they have to look out
for themselves just like the owners are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Brownsville Recreation Center in Brooklyn, all the talk
about salaries and sticking points was lost on the nearly three
dozen children who gather each season in front of a 52''colored
television to watch NBA games. So far this year, the children have
had to settle for sitting in the gym and watching amateurs mimic
the moves of their favorite NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair,'' 12-year-old Rykeem Robinson said as
he lay sprawled out over the gym's bleachers, only half watching a
loud, sweaty game between six men. ``On TV its better than this. If
the players weren't selfish, we could be watching a real game.''

REBUILDING OF HURRICANE-DEVASTATED AREAS WILL BE MASSIVE
UNDERTAKING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said Friday that
rebuilding the four Central American nations devastated by
Hurricane Mitch would cost hundreds of millions, if not billions,
of dollars and last for several years.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already committed $70 million to the
relief effort. But administration officials acknowledged that the
four nations _ El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua _
will require many times that amount of aid, and that Honduras and
Nicaragua in particular have been so devastated that they will be
almost entirely dependent on the outside world for food and shelter
for the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two nations have been wiped out,'' said J. Brian Atwood,
head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which is
overseeing the administration's disaster relief effort in Central
America. In Honduras, he said, ``basically the crops of that
country have been destroyed in their entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department, which has dispatched 25 helicopters and
four cargo planes to assist in the rescue effort, said that several
more U.S. military aircraft would arrive in Central America this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The government of Nicaragua has said it needed at least 20 U.S.
helicopters to transport food and supplies to isolated regions, and
that only eight helicopters had been dispatched so far.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Nicaraguan ambassador to the United States, Francisco
Aguirre-Sacasa, offered no criticism of the United States and other
donor nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happened was that this hurricane threw a sucker
punch at everybody and no one really understood at first how bad
this was,'' he said in an interview. ``It took a little while for
this to fully sink in in the U.S. Now it has, and I want to
emphasize that I feel very gratified by the announcement of $70
million in emergency relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lucas, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command, the
unit of the Defense Department that is responsible for Central
American affairs, said that the United States ``is throwing
everything we can at this.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: `` Could we be doing more? Should we be doing
more? The answer to that is probably yes. But an undertaking of
this size is not easily organized.''
</P>
<P>
   American charity organizations involved in the relief effort
strained for words to describe the scale of the disaster, which is
estimated to have killed more than 10,000 people and left vast
stretches of Central American underwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is even worse than all the damage done in Central America
during the decades of war there,'' said Michael Delaney, regional
director for Latin America and the Caribbean for Oxfam America, a
Boston-based charity. ``After their wars, Nicaragua and El Salvador
had a period of peace to develop their local economies, and now all
of that progress is destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent aid organizations said they welcomed President
Clinton's announcement earlier this week that the United States
would organize an initial emergency aid package of $70 million.
</P>
<P>
   Delaney said that the relief effort mounted by the United States
may have been slow to start in the hours after the hurricane passed
through the region. ``But I think that's normal,'' he said. ``I
don't have any criticism. The $70 million will be important in the
short term. What we need to watch is the middle to long-term in
regards to the American response.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Atwood, the head of AID, said in an interview that the United
States and other donor nations would have to help Honduras and
Nicaragua _ and El Salvador and Guatemala, to a lesser extent _
rebuild their most basic infrastructure, including road networks
and telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $70 million is simply the first major tranche of aid,'' he
said. ``We really are going to have to be engaged in the
reconstruction of these countries.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the destruction of so much farmland had left much of
Central America without any source of income. ``The whole
agricultural sector has just been wiped out,'' he said. ``And so in
what are basically rural agricultural communities in these
countries, their one and key source of income is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Charity groups said that the disaster had produced an outpouring
of offers of money and other assistance from the American public, a
response in large part to the dramatic television images of the
aftermath of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing _ we're seeking a response here that we haven't
seen in quite some time,'' said Cynthia Glocker, a spokeswoman for
Care, the Atlanta-based relief organization. ``From the minute this
happened, we've been getting calls offering help. Our phones are
ringing off the hook. We get 800 calls a day about this.''

COMENTARY: DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich isn't a total fool.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to blame his party's disastrous election results
on the media _ specifically the scandal-fixated TV media _ he was
betting on the fact that if there's anyone more despised by the
public than he is, it's the press. And while the speaker's
ridiculous spin self-destructed within the news cycle _ it would
take a Goebbels to make the case that All Monica benefits Democrats
_ his underlying strategy was sound. In this election, the American
people once again thumbed their noses at the talking heads who have
pontificated incorrectly all year about ``the American people.''
Americans expressed their revulsion at the press perhaps more
loudly than they did their loathing of Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have predicted that . . . Democrats would have
gained seats?'' asked Tim Russert on the ``Today'' show Wednesday.
Certainly no journalists in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the election, The Washington Post surveyed a
bipartisan spectrum of 13 media and political heavies for their
predictions; every one of them, regardless of party or ideology,
estimated GOP gains that differed only in whether they were one or
two country miles off from the actual results 48 hours later. And
who could be surprised about their whopping misreading of the
country _ except them? These experts were, after all, drawn from
the same pack that all year has been breathlessly and erroneously
predicting imminent impeachment, resignation or plummeting poll
numbers for President Clinton each time he was hit with a salacious
leak, cigar or video inquisition by Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, The Post followed up its cracked-crystal-ball
prognostications with a lengthy piece by Sally Quinn meant to
explain just why Washington's Establishment is so outraged by Bill
Clinton and by the public's refusal to dump him. The piece is such
a vivid illustration of the Beltway/American people disconnect that
it has become an object of ferocious ridicule on C-Span and an
instant camp classic on the Internet; it surely will join the Starr
report as an essential document when future generations of history
students look back on this whole giddy year.
</P>
<P>
   Writing like Tom Wolfe minus the irony, Ms. Quinn begins with a
vignette telling us what good folk Washington insiders are: they
``gather to support their own'' by showing up at a charity benefit
that raised money to fight a disease that struck the family of one
celebrity power couple. (Heaven help those who expect a handout for
an illness yet to hit the Gridiron Club.) Once these unimpeachable
humanitarian credentials are laid out, Ms. Quinn lets ``Beltway
Insiders,'' among them journalists, vent their moral outrage about
the president even as they celebrate their own righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a community of good people involved in a worthwhile
pursuit'' is how Cokie Roberts describes her crowd. ``We have a
sense of community, there's a small-town quality here,'' says David
Gergen. By contrast, Clinton ``came in here and he trashed the
place,'' observes David Broder, who is so ritualistically called
the fair-minded ``Dean'' of Washington journalists that you might
say he is the Henry Hyde of punditry. Only last Sunday the Dean
went on ``Meet the Press'' and declared that Al D'Amato would win
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Quinn's piece also pays Starr the highest accolade _ ``Starr
is a Washington insider, too. . . . He has many friends in both
parties'' _ before concluding that ``Bill Clinton has essentially
lost the Washington Establishment for good.'' The day after her
piece ran, the rest of the country went to the polls and once again
indicated that the Washington Establishment has lost it _ if not
for good, then at least until the next generational turnover. (The
median age of Ms. Quinn's insiders is somewhere between Robert
Novak and Alice Roosevelt Longworth.)
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Washington media keep missing the story is that
they are part of the story. This is the most church-going country
in the world, but its citizens instinctively recoil at being
lectured to like recalcitrant Sunday-school children by
hypocritical secular sermonizers _ whether they be the many
preacher politicians defeated this week or Kenneth Starr or
moralistic Washington insiders bloviating about our trashy
president in print and on MSNBC. Tuesday's vote was a mandate for
all of them to shut up.

FLORIDA ACCUSES SWEEPSTAKES FIRM OF PREYING ON ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ American Family Publishers, one of the nation's
two biggest sweepstakes companies, was accused by the Florida
attorney general Friday of preying on the elderly through deceptive
magazine solicitations and by selling names of senior citizens and
retired people who enter sweepstakes to operators of other
contests.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the elderly have long contended that magazine
sweepstakes and similar contests take advantage of senior citizens
with deceptive and confusing language. But a civil suit filed by
the office of Attorney General Robert Butterworth on Friday was the
first formal accusation of such conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claimed that the sweepstakes company designs its
mailings to appear to be official documents and uses two
celebrities, Ed McMahon and Dick Clark, as spokesmen specifically
to take advantage of the elderly and other vulnerable people. The
company was also accused of double-billing customers and using
collection agencies to try to collect unenforceable debts.
</P>
<P>
   The suit disclosed for the first time that American Family
Publishers is able to identify the age range of sweepstakes
entrants and sells the names of senior citizens and retirees to
other contest operators. Often fraudulent telemarketers bilk older
consumers out of substantial sums after buying their names from
mailing-list providers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit did not link American Family Publishers lists to any
fraudulent operations. But it said that last year the company
advertised for sale or rent the names and addresses of 349,542
people age 55 or over who had entered sweepstakes and the names and
addresses of 118,081 retirees who had entered.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preying upon the elderly, the solicitations are
designed to prevent average consumers from making reasonable
purchasing decisions, and the average consumer has been and
continues to be deceived by the deceptive solicitations and
fraudulent billing practices, said the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations were contained in an amended complaint filed in
state court in Tampa. The complaint expanded charges of deceptive
practices brought against the company last year. American Family
Publishers settled similar suits brought by other states, but has
been unable to negotiate an agreement with Florida.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to American Family Publishers, the complaint added
new defendants, including Time-Warner, the world's largest
entertainment company and part-owner of the sweepstakes company,
and Time Inc. Susan Caughman, chairman of American Family
Publishers' parent company, and Timothy Adams, president of Time
Customer Services, which handles billing, were also named as
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for American Family Publisher's,
said the suit was unfounded and that the company never targets
elderly consumers. ``AFP is a mass marketer and the charges
regarding the elderly are not true,'' Ms. Meyer said. ``The
attorney general has spent months trying to prove something that is
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that the company does not sell lists of people who
enter contests, selling only the names of people who do not order
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Costiglio, spokesman for Time-Warner and its subsidiaries,
said the suit was unreasonable and unwarranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be an action to intimidate and harm
reputations,'' Costiglio said. ``It is pure and simple an
unreasonable exercise of the attorney general's power.''
</P>
<P>
   About one third of all new magazine subscriptions are generated
through sweepstakes, which offer multimillion dollar prizes to lure
people into buying magazines.

RUSSIA'S NEWEST CRISIS: HUNGER AND COLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The burning question for the Kremlin these days is not
the future of capitalism, the lack of a national idea or NATO's
creep to the East.
</P>
<P>
   It is about food.
</P>
<P>
   With winter fast approaching, this nation is locked in a
primordial struggle to feed its citizens and prevent them from
freezing.
</P>
<P>
   It is a race against time. Food reserves are dwindling. Remote
cities have been left without heat. And the massive logistical task
of moving grain, meat and fuel is well behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mark of Russia's anxiety that Prime Minister Yevgeni
Primakov's aides put aside their pride on Friday and concluded an
agreement to buy $625 million worth of grain, meat, milk, soybeans
and other food assistance.
</P>
<P>
   According to Christopher Goldthwait, the senior U.S. Agriculture
Department official who helped negotiate the new food accord,
without assistance, the Russians would run out of wheat before
their next harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We project they will run short some time in the month of
July,'' Goldthwait said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Even now Russia is plagued by regional shortages. Russia's
agriculture ministry has reported shortfalls in 22 of the nation's
89 regions.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's disastrous harvest _ the worst in 45 years _ is just
part of the reason. The tendency of the nation's regions to go
their own way, lax government management and Russia's financial
crisis have turned a difficult situation into an increasingly
desperate one.
</P>
<P>
   Many grain producing regions have been hoarding their supply.
The collapse of the banking system and fuel shortages have also
delayed the sale and distribution of what food is available to
regions that do not produce their own grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Distribution is a big problem,'' said Victor Lishchenko, a
leading agricultural specialist. ``The nation is vast and many
local governors practically do not let the grain out of their
borders.''
</P>
<P>
   Quantity is not the only problem. The quality of Russia's store
of grain is uneven, diminishing its value for making bread or
raising livestock.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in domestic food production has been aggravated by a
sharp decline in imports, another consequence of the nation's
plummeting currency.
</P>
<P>
   Before its financial crisis, Russia used to import more than 40
percent of its food. But imports have fallen to a fraction of that,
and the foreign food that is being shipped is being sold at
skyrocketing prices.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's needy have been hit hard. Relief groups are besieged
with reports of orphanages that have five rubles a day (about 30
cents) per child to buy food and prisons that spend even less on
their inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the situation is critical,'' said Margarita
Plonikova, Moscow representative of the International Federation of
the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
</P>
<P>
   Even ordinary Russians have felt the pinch. Even before the
financial crisis, the annual consumption of meat had declined to
about 95 pounds a person, less than half of American levels. And
since the crisis, Russia's pasta factories have been working
overtime, a sign that Russians are changing their diet.
</P>
<P>
   Vasily Shishkaryov, a worker at Moscow's Zil truck factory, said
that many of his fellow workers had all but given up eating meat,
turning to potatoes and vegetables from garden plots.
</P>
<P>
   Food is not the only problem. The Russian government is also
struggling to keep its citizens supplied with heat and power.
Russia's Fuel and Energy ministry said this week that it had only
received 3 percent of the money it was due to buy fuel for the
nation's northern territories.
</P>
<P>
   As the food crisis has grown, the Kremlin has begrudgingly
recognized the seriousness of the situation. At first, it continued
to allow farmers in the south of the country to export their grain.
(Russian grain exports are to be limited under the new
American-Russian food accord.)
</P>
<P>
   Then Primakov aides said that the nation did not need food aid,
suggesting that talk about food assistance was simply a Western
plot to dump an agricultural surplus on Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Russians re-examined their stocks and confronted the
difficulty of distributing food supplies, they began to document
their shortfalls for their U.S. counterparts. The Russians even
urged that the first of the U.S. shipments arrive before the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord reached Friday, the United States will supply
3.1 million metric tons of food, including 1.5 million tons of
wheat, which is being provided for free.
</P>
<P>
   Another 1.5 million tons of feed grain, meat, dry milk,
soybeans. rice, corn and other goods is being purchased by the
Russians with the help of a 20-year loan at a nominal interest
rate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is also providing 100,000 tons of food to
private relief groups for distribution to Russia's needy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Russians intend to sell much of the food at home at market
rates. With corruption rampant in Russia, the United States wants
to prevent Russian businessmen from skimming off the profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans rejected the Russians' insistence that the revenue
be used to support their agricultural sectors. Instead, the
Russians are obliged to use the proceeds to pay pensions and fund
other social programs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is footing the $260 million bill for sending
the different shipments for Russia. Relief organizations,
meanwhile, are mounting their own campaigns to buy and distribute
food.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. officials said that the food aid may not be
sufficient and may need to be increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question that we have left open,'' Goldthwait said.
``We will continue to assess whether or not there is a need for
additional commodities.''

HYDE'S LETTER: BAD TIMING OR GAMBLE? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What is Rep. Henry Hyde up to?
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the Illinois Republican who heads the House
Judiciary Committee moved Thursday to wrap up the impeachment
inquiry quickly by naming only one witness, Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hyde fired off a pointed letter asking
President Clinton to say flatly whether he lied under oath,
tampered with witnesses or obstructed justice. If Clinton objects
to any of the 81 findings drawn from Starr's 445-page report, as
surely he will, the investigation could drag into next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's letter was clearly a maneuver to shift the onus to the
president and set him up as uncooperative, said a Republican aide.
``It was for political gain,'' the aide said. ``It's a gamble, a
calculated risk. It makes it look like the White House is
obstructing.''
</P>
<P>
   The combative missive might have made political sense for Hyde
before the midterm elections, when House Republicans expected to
pad their majority in the next Congress by at least 10 to 15 seats.
But after Tuesday's stunning gains for Democrats, and the prospect
of a slimmer Republican majority voting on impeachment next year,
the tactic seemed confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   The disjointed approach stemmed in part from bad timing. Hyde
had intended for weeks to seek confirmation from Clinton of
selected facts in the Starr report to spare the committee the
time-consuming process of deposing witnesses and holding hearings.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the White House is content to watch the apparent
confusion at the committee quietly from the sidelines. Gregory
Craig, the White House's coordinator of impeachment strategy, said
the president's lawyers would respond quickly to the committee's
requests for information.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig and other top White House officials had little else to
say about the matter this week. They have settled on a strategy of
portraying the president as hard at work on substantive issues like
Social Security and health care while professing equanimity about
the impeachment process on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say about it,'' Clinton said Thursday. ``I
want these hearings to be constitutionally fair and expeditious.
And at the appropriate time , we will say whatever we intend to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, some White House officials are now
expressing confidence that the president will emerge from the
impeachment proceedings with a largely symbolic vote of censure _
at the most.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Hyde's inquiry, led by former Chicago
prosecutor David Schippers, has tried to make the best legal case
it can against Clinton. Investigators have insulated themselves
from the political maelstrom swirling around them.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment is not playing in a courtroom. It is playing in
Congress, where the lawmakers who will ultimately decide Clinton's
fate are sensitive to the shifting political ground in a way that
Hyde's prosecutors are not.
</P>
<P>
   And the conventional wisdom among Democrats and a growing number
of Republicans, who now believe the polls they dismissed before the
elections, is that impeachment is a political loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome is all but certain: this thing ain't going
anywhere,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford, a conservative Republican from
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   So Hyde is in a box. He wants to end the inquiry as soon as
possible. ``If it goes down, it goes down; Henry has no vested
interest in any particular outcome,'' said one of Hyde's closest
aides.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde feels deeply bound to follow the constitutional process
to its end, to insure the proceedings have some shred of public
credibility and to satisfy the Republican Party's conservative
base.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has also dismissed the idea of short-circuiting the process
and censuring Clinton. But a group of 10 moderate Democrats and
Republicans on the committee will meet as early as Sunday to
discuss alternative punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Starr to testify Nov. 19 is a gamble for both parties. A
Republican aide familiar with the proceedings said the reason for
summoning Starr as a witness, despite the Republican's reluctance
two weeks ago, was twofold. Some members believe that Starr will
help their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyde feels Starr is a very credible person and much
maligned,'' said another Republican aide. ``He thinks when the
American people see he doesn't have horns and a tail, he'll be
credible. But it's no slam dunk for either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's popularity rating is so low it can only go up, and that
should take some of the heat off Republicans on the committee.
Besides, many Republicans thought there was no way around calling
Starr since he was the one person many Democrats seemed intent on
calling.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are torn over whether to call for additional
witnesses. Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts said it would be
unthinkable to make a judgment without calling major witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats, who believe impeachment is dead, are
advising against it. Why aggravate the process? they ask. ``If this
is what gets us to closure, then why intrude?'' a Democratic aide
familiar with the proceedings said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California said she sees business as usual.
She is one Democrat who believed that calling Starr was a waste of
time since he has not been a witness to anything. And if
Republicans wind up dragging the whole thing into next year,
arguing that the president was not cooperative, they will be
shooting themselves in the foot again, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elections have not changed the majority's approach at
all,'' Ms. Lofgren said. ``The president said it should be fair,
constitutional and expeditious. Well, all I see is expeditious. I
don't see fair and constitutional. There are a lot of things that
are quick. A lynching is quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are convinced impeachment is dead _ definitely in the
House and maybe even in the Judiciary Committee _ and that Hyde is
trying to find a graceful exit. ``They are trying to figure out how
to fold their tent as quickly as they can without looking like they
are folding tent,'' a Democratic official said.

U.S. PLANS NEW RULE TO INSTALL CHILD SAFETY SEATS IN NEW CARS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Transportation plans to publish a
rule next month that would establish, for the first time, a uniform
system for installing child safety seats in cars without using seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, under negotiation for years with manufacturers of cars
and of child seats, will affect new cars and safety seats. Cars
would need two attachment points where the seat back cushion and
the seat bottom cushion meet, and one attachment point at the top
of the seat. Safety seats would have devices that clamp to the
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Every year more than 1,000 children under the age of 5 die in
car accidents, although no one is sure how many would be saved by
better seats; a substantial fraction of the children killed were
not buckled into the seat or had no seat at all.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Weber, director of the Child Passenger Protection
Research program at the University of Michigan Medical School, said
earlier studies showed that use of a properly installed seat cut
the risk of serious injury or death by 70 percent, and that seats
installed improperly but still attached to the car cut the risk by
44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Century Products Co., a leading manufacturer of infant and
child seats, Greg Pinto, a product manager, said, ``There are a
certain percentage of crashes out there that are plain-old not
survivable because they're so horrendous, but a universal child
restraint anchorage will make installation easier, and hopefully
more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Society of Automotive Engineers sets a voluntary standard
for seat belts and safety seats in an effort to make the two
compatible, but not all seats on the market follow that standard.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Transportation Safety Administration
standard would take years to take full effect because the car
hardware would be required only on new models, and even that would
not cover all new models for several years. Child seats would be
sold with two different attachment systems, so that they could be
used in new cars or old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Spot checks by the police show that baby seats now in use,
nearly all of which attach to the seat belts meant to restrain
adults, are often installed improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ricardo Martinez, administrator of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration, said most were too loose or were
hooked up without a locking clip, so that the lap belt could play
out in an accident. ``You're not getting the full protection of the
system, and that's our concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers have argued against the new requirement.
Cosco Inc., a manufacturer of low-cost baby products, predicted
that the higher cost would reduce the sales of car seats, and thus
their use. But safety experts said that improperly installed seats
were common and were only about half as effective in reducing death
or serious injury as properly installed seats.

   BKN-LABOR-KIDSREACT (New York) _ By the calendar at least,
basketball loyalists should be tethered to their televisions,
trying to glimpse the latest moves, newest phenoms and hottest
highlights of the National Basketball Association. But this season,
a high-stakes labor battle between the NBA's more than 400 players
and 29 team owners has already canceled 194 games in November and
is threatening to call off the entire schedule. On the basketball
courts and public playgrounds of New York City, which have launched
legions of basketball dreamers _ and more than a few NBA stars _
hardcore fans of all ages are directing sharp words at both the
players and the owners. Many fans say they have heard enough to
know this much: basketball is disintegrating into a game of greed.

GETTING GLOBALLY REAL  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Later this week, President Clinton heads for the annual
meeting of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which this
year, by quirky fate, is being held in Malaysia, a country that has
denounced the West, rejected the International Monetary Fund's
approach to the Asian crisis and tried to stop all trading in its
currency. While in Kuala Lumpur, Clinton will also be seeing the
president of China and the new prime minister of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Clinton might say if he were not restricted to
polite diplo-speak.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TO MAHATHIR MOHAMAD (italics)Prime Minister of Malaysia:(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   Quite a city you've carved out of the jungles here. Hey, are
those twin towers down the street really the tallest in the world?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, all this in an economy the size of Kentucky's. But
then, you've always tried to one-up the rest of the world _ which
brings me to my point.
</P>
<P>
   I know you can't stand preaching from the decadent West any more
than you can stand George Soros. So I won't preach. If you want to
seal your borders and detach your currency from the global economy,
that's your business. Heck, I've felt your pain _ in 1993 I was the
one cursing the bond traders.
</P>
<P>
   But then this fellow named Rubin (you've met Rubin, right?)
clued me in: Even though I'd just been elected president of the
most powerful nation on earth, I had no choice but to learn to live
with the global markets. I had to throw out all my grand social
plans to get the deficit down, and they were a lot more expensive
than your towers.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. The economy boomed, the whole world wanted to invest
in my country _ and it saved my skin. If the economy had been in
the tank when I ran into this Monica thing (you've heard of Monica,
right?), you'd be staring at Al Gore right now.
</P>
<P>
   You are doing fine for now, but soon you'll need big-time
investment. If I've learned anything about markets, it's this: They
hate unpredictability. And you, Mohamad, are behaving like a loose
cannon.
</P>
<P>
   If you can jail your finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on
trumped-up charges for opposing your economic policies, then no one
else is safe here. Before long the companies that turned this place
from a rubber plantation into a maker of cell phones and memory
chips and air conditioners, the Intels and Motorolas and
Matsushitas, are going to look elsewhere. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TO YEVGENY PRIMAKOV (italics)Prime Minister of Russia:(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   How's Boris feeling? What do you mean you haven't spoken to him
in a month?
</P>
<P>
   I know you want to find a distinctively Russian way to the
future, and that's your right. But there is no special Russian
method of mathematics. International investors are pretty good at
reading budgets, and yours doesn't make any sense.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't figure out a way to collect taxes or run an economy
that doesn't bleed to death with corruption, all that's left is
printing rubles. Hyperinflation is just around the corner, and that
will only make an impossible situation intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   I've got every incentive to help you. The last thing I need at
the end of my presidency is a breakup of Russia, with crazies
grabbing your nukes. But the key to arms control today is fiscal
control. You need a realistic budget. Right now, that bear don't
hunt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TO JIANG ZEMIN (italics)President of China:(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   Loved my trip to China; a great start to a rotten summer. But
those empty office towers in Shanghai worry me. So does the
collapse of that big investment house in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   You guys have been heroicly keeping your currency stable. But my
friends Bob Rubin and Larry Summers, the ones who keep sending all
those e-mails to your Finance Ministry, are quietly petrified.
</P>
<P>
   You've got a banking system loaded with bad debts. You've got
tens of millions unemployed. No one believes your economy is really
growing 8 percent a year, and it doesn't help that you announced
your fantastic third-quarter growth just hours after the quarter
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Every Chinese bank and brokerage house is trying the Japanese
trick: Hide the depth of the problems. If you let them get away
with it _ well, you don't want to go there.
</P>
<P>
   Now, about getting you into the World Trade Organization. My
national security adviser, Sandy Berger, argues inside the White
House that we should bend the rules and let you in soon, as a good
geopolitical gesture. After all, this is a matter of geopolitics,
not just trade. But my trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky,
says she'd rather swim the Yangtze than let you in without making
you open your markets.
</P>
<P>
   If you're quick, you'll exploit the difference and cut a deal to
open up over the next 20 years. I'll have to approve it, to show
we're making progress on free trade in Asia even in the middle of a
huge financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   To sweeten the pot, I'll even send you a bunch of American legal
experts to live in the Chinese countryside and help build a modern,
rule-of-law society. Ever heard of Ken Starr?

MISSED THE BOAT? CLIMB ONTO JUNK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Impressive indeed, this John Glenn rally in the stock
market. In the seven trading days since Glenn was lifted into
space, the Dow Jones industrial average has rocketed 7.2 percent.
Even more remarkable, the Dow has rallied 19 percent from its Aug.
31 low.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, anytime a market moves up this far this fast, it
leaves plenty of investors behind. Those who sold stocks during the
late summer or early fall are kicking themselves for their caution.
</P>
<P>
   But chasing stocks after a nearly 20 percent spurt doesn't feel
right, either. What should investors do?
</P>
<P>
   Buy junk bonds. Because of their outsized risk, these securities
are regarded more like stocks than bonds. But unlike equities, junk
bonds have not yet rallied from depressed levels. That is because
there's still less liquidity in the junk market; trading isn't near
the usual volume for this arena.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a credit pullback and another travesty like the one
that befell the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund have kept
the market frozen for high-yield bonds. Although the first signs of
a thaw are emerging, these bonds still trade at exceptionally high
yields relative to Treasury bonds with comparable maturities.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the yield on Merrill Lynch's High Yield Master
index now stands at 5.76 percentage points above 10-year
Treasuries. That is down from the peak spread of 6.44 percentage
points on Oct. 16, but still well above the historical average
spread of around 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Junk bonds look especially compelling if you believe the bulls'
case for stocks. This view says that there is no recession on the
horizon, that further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve
Board will make sure none appears, that worries of a credit
contraction are overblown and that corporate earnings will not be
as weak as previously thought.
</P>
<P>
   If the bulls are right, junk bonds will be big money makers for
investors. But an appealing aspect to buying junk bonds at current
levels is that the reward potential is great and that the chance of
disaster is far less than it is in the stocks that are back to
their all-time highs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the nation slips into a recession and default rates rise
on junk debt, prices of these already depressed bonds are not
likely to crater. If prices do fall a bit, investors collect a
considerable yield for their trouble.
</P>
<P>
   That high-yield bonds have not yet responded to the Fed's recent
rate cuts at least partly reflects investor unease about rising
defaults among issuers of risky debt. Defaults have averaged 3.3
percent of all issues annually since 1971, but hit a low of 1.4
percent in the spring of 1997. Recently, the rate has crept up to
2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill
Lynch, says the market in junk bonds is so beaten down right now
that even a 5.5 percent default rate wouldn't trash it. Indeed,
according to Fridson's calculations, junk's current premiums to
Treasury yields are roughly the same as what they would be if
default rates were 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody believes that defaults are going to rise to double
digits. The reason that the spreads grew as wide as they did was
that liquidity evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In effect, you're already at a spread consistent with a
default rate three or four times where you actually are,'' Fridson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high costs associated with buying individual junk
issues, high-yield mutual funds are the way to go for most
investors in this market. Funds rated highly by Morningstar, and
with relatively high yields and low expenses, include Fidelity High
Income, Legg Mason High Yield Primary and Vanguard High-Yield
Corporate. &QL;

   Last year, after airplane production at Boeing Co. became so
fouled up that the aerospace giant was forced to halt assembly of
its 747 and 737 jets for several weeks, the company's top
executives began holding monthly teleconferences for reporters and
Wall Street analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Month after month, as Boeing chairman Philip Condit, president
Harry Stonecipher and commercial airplane chief Ronald Woodard were
peppered with questions, Alan Mulally, the head of the new space
and defense businesses that generate 40 percent of the company's
annual revenue, sat by in silence. No one ever asked him a
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like, doesn't anybody care?'' Mulally recalled
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after stepping into the shoes of Woodard, who was ousted
Sept. 1, Mulally is no longer feeling neglected. He is the point
man for Boeing's turnaround, the star of what is probably the
greatest high-wire act in Corporate America today.
</P>
<P>
   If he succeeds as president of the commercial airplane division,
he will very likely be the top candidate to follow Condit as
chairman and chief executive. If he fails, he will just as likely
join Woodard in early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing's fortunes have improved lately, its flagship
passenger-airplane division is still a mess. Boeing must meet its
commitment to churn out a record 180 jets this quarter, even as
many customers are having trouble paying for them. The company is
one of only two suppliers of large commercial airplanes left in the
world, but its profit margins on its jets are lower than the
margins at most personal computer makers. Worst of all, its
customers are angry.
</P>
<P>
   During meetings with Boeing executives in October, both the
United Parcel Service and United Airlines complained about Boeing's
poor service. One United executive called the company a
``dysfunctional organization.''
</P>
<P>
   And around the same time, in an unusual public outburst, Gordon
Bethune, the chief executive of Continental Airlines and a former
Boeing executive who is close to Woodard, said the wrong man had
been forced out.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally has moved quickly, reshuffling the executive ranks and
introducing a new organization that divides the commercial-airplane
division into three separate groups: one for narrow-body planes,
one for wide-body planes and one for customer service. Each is now
responsible for its own profits and losses, a revolutionary concept
at Boeing, where even top executives do not know exactly how much
it costs to make their planes.
</P>
<P>
   Mulally said his first priority was to deliver all the planes
Boeing has promised by the end of the year, and to then focus on
raising profit margins. Unlike the patrician Woodard, 55, who
exuded confidence even as Boeing's troubles grew and its stock
price declined, Mulally, 53, comes across as an eager-to-please Boy
Scout.
</P>
<P>
   After laying out his turnaround strategy to a reporter in a
long, breathless speech, he stopped suddenly to ask: ``What do you
think?'' And when questioned about the pressures he faces, he
responded: ``I'm pleased to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   But those who know him say that his earnest exterior hides a
steely resolve. He is known as a man who can cut through Boeing's
notorious bureaucracy and fix a problem for a customer or a
supplier with a few phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation among the financial analysts is probably as
more of a cheerleader,'' said Byron Callan, an analyst at Merrill
Lynch. ``But when you talk to people who deal with him on a
business basis, he is really pretty hard-headed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulally joined Boeing in 1969, a 24-year-old with a new master's
degree in engineering who packed his belongings into his Volkswagen
Beetle and drove to Seattle from his home in Kansas. He cemented
his reputation in the early 1990s working for Condit as the chief
engineer of the 777, Boeing's newest and most sophisticated
wide-body jet. It is still his defining moment at Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   At a black-tie airline-industry dinner in New York in October,
Mulally displayed the full range of his social skills. Early on, he
was spotted chatting amiably with Bethune, who told him that his
public criticisms had been aimed at Boeing, not at Mulally.
</P>
<P>
   Later, sitting a table between Trans World Airlines chairman
Gerald Gitner, and Continental president Gregory Brenneman, Mulally
hooted and cheered like a rowdy football fan for Lord King, the
81-year-old retired chairman of British Airways, who was on the
dais.
</P>
<P>
   It was Lord King who chose the 777 for British Airways, forever
earning Mulally's gratitude. ``Lord King!'' he repeatedly shouted
in a hoarse voice over the low din of banquet conversation. ``Lord
King! Lord King!'' As the verbal tribute continued on and off for
several minutes, Lord King, who is hard of hearing, showed no
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the episode, Mulally said, ``He makes my eyes water
just to think about him.''
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, after Boeing acquired the space division of
Rockwell International and McDonnell Douglas Corp., Condit put
Mulally in charge of consolidating Boeing's much enlarged space and
defense portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts give Mulally mixed reviews for his brief performance
running those businesses. But that did not prevent Mulally from
becoming a sought-after executive. Earlier this year, he turned
down an offer to become heir apparent to the chief executive at the
Raytheon Company, choosing to keep his wife and five children in
Seattle and to bet his future on Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great opportunity and I was glad to be asked,'' he
said. ``I just think this is a fabulous franchise.''

INDONESIAN AUTOMAKER OFFERS TOUGH CHOICE TO CREDITORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON TEDJASUKMANA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ PT Astra International, Indonesia's largest
automaker, offered its creditors two choices Friday: cash out and
take a sizable loss or join its debt-revamping plan and hope for an
improvement in the languishing Indonesian economy.
</P>
<P>
   `What Astra would like to request is time,'' Astra International
president Rini Soewandi said in an interview after a seven-hour
closed meeting with creditors from Japan, Europe and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was a follow-up to one in October, when the company
announced it was halting payment on $1.4 billion in loans.
</P>
<P>
   Astra said it would offer creditors who wanted to get out a
chance to do so through a ``Dutch auction'' in which the company
would set aside $70 million to buy back debt ``at a significant
discount.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has the same right and can put in a bid and whoever
puts in the lowest bid will be able to get out,'' Ms. Soewandi
said, ``but the amount we buy back will not be more than $70
million.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenders to Astra International not interested in taking the
loss, or failing to qualify, will be repaid in three installments
at later, still to be determined dates, presumably, when the
economy has improved.
</P>
<P>
   Immediate reactions to the revamping plan, which has been in the
planning stage since August, were impossible to gauge, with
creditors leaving the meeting saying they had signed
confidentiality agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Astra has been praised by analysts as one of the only Indonesian
companies to address its portion of the country's staggering
private-sector foreign debt problem, estimated at more than $67
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Its main sources of revenue have dried up since August 1997,
when the Indonesian currency was trading around 2,400 to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   With the devaluation of the rupiah, which closed the week at
8,300 to the dollar, the car sales of Astra have been only 30,489
this year, off sharply from the 173,457 total of 1997. Astra _ the
local assembler of Toyota, Daihatsu and Isuzu _ predicts just
25,000 sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Operating losses are projected to rise from 316 billion rupiah
in 1998 to 894 billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cash balance has been depleted because our operational
cash is not sufficient,'' said Dorys Herlambang, the company's
finance director. ``We have been using our cash reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Herlambang said the company's cash reserves had dwindled to 300
billion rupiah and it was now in discussions to sell holdings in
Honda, Isuzu and Daihatsu as well as stakes in PT Berau Coal and PT
Pama Persada, a mining contractor.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the decline in car sales, motorcycle sales at PT
Federal Motors, the company's main motorcycle production unit, have
fallen 75 percent and sales of heavy machinery at PT United Tractor
have plunged 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of Astra's debt is owed to Japanese banks,
including the Long-Term Credit Bank, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking,
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Sanwa Bank, Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji
Bank, Sumitomo, Sakura Bank and Marubeni.
</P>
<P>
   The company's next meeting with creditors _ which also include
Paribas and Societe Generale of France, Chase Manhattan,
Commerzbank of Germany and ABN-Amro Bank of the Netherlands _ is
scheduled for two weeks from now in Singapore.

 &HT;    Discovery crew packs up for landing in Florida or California
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas _ Discovery's seven astronauts
packed up their experiments and readied the orbiter for their
return to Earth today, but it wasn't clear whether they will land
in Florida or California.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle landing strip at Kennedy Space Center is the
preferred site, but NASA activated its backup site at Edwards Air
Force Base on the Mojave Desert in case the weather in Florida is
too cloudy or windy.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is being considered mainly because weather is expected
to be worse at both sites on Sunday and Monday, and the orbiter
would run short on supplies after that, mission controllers here
said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA was forecasting scattered clouds at 4,000 feet at Kennedy,
which would be acceptable, but there was a chance the clouds would
close in and prevent a landing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be watching the weather very closely,'' flight
director Linda Ham said.
</P>
<P>
   Mission commander Curtis Brown and pilot Steven Lindsey have two
re-entry chances today for landings at Kennedy at 12:04 p.m. and
12:45 p.m., and two for landings at Edwards at 12:35 p.m. and 2:17
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Brown shut down a cluster of three maneuvering jets Friday
morning after one began leaking oxidizer, but Ham said the orbiter
has other engines that can compensate for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   She said engineers think Discovery's drag parachute is still
packed safely away though the door of the compartment in its tail
fell off at launch last week. The pilots will land without
deploying the chute, but they will be ready to jettison it if the
chute comes out by itself, Ham said.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts at Kennedy and Edwards, flying Gulfstream jets to
check weather conditions prior to the landing, will use binoculars
to check Discovery's drag chute door area as it passes below 30,000
feet at either site. If they see anything hanging out, they will
ask the pilots to jettison the chute.
</P>
<P>
   An accidental deployment is unlikely, Ham said, and at high
speeds, the chute would either burn or tear away before it could
cause a problem. But if it pops out when the orbiter is less than
150 feet above ground level and the crew doesn't immediately get
rid of it, ``we would land hard enough probably to break the
orbiter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ham said the most likely damage would be a blown tire or a
broken landing gear strut, but she said it would be unlikely to
cause injuries.

THE WOODY ALLEN OF FASHION JOINS SAINT LAURENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)  
(lb) 
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, on the night before his first day as the new designer
for Yves Saint Laurent's ready-to-wear collection, Alber Elbaz laid
out his clothes on a chair like a nervous schoolboy. The gesture
was purely ceremonial. Elbaz usually wears an all-black ensemble so
rumpled that it might as well have been slept in. But the glamour
and prestige of his job was unnerving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them at Saint Laurent, `Are you sure it's not a
mistake? You can still change your mind,''' the designer said, with
characteristic self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   You might call Elbaz, 37, the Woody Allen of fashion, so
self-deprecating is his humor. ``If someone says, `I don't like
that dress,' I think she doesn't like me,'' he admitted. ``And if
she says, `I love that dress,' I think she has no taste. So you
see, you can't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he is of the Groucho Marx school of not wanting to
belong to any club that would have him as a member.
</P>
<P>
   But Elbaz is definitely a member of the club these days. Along
with an elite of American designers _ including Tom Ford at Gucci,
Michael Kors at Celine, Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton and Narciso
Rodriguez at Loewe _ he has taken over at a grand, but moribund
European fashion house, and has been charged with bringing it new
life.
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz is the only one among this group to be named by the very
designer he is succeeding, Saint Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   He won the post after successfully modernizing the house of Guy
Laroche, a venerable French company that had been flailing since
the early 1990s. ``Guy Laroche was all about pink boucle with gold
buttons,'' said Elbaz, who took over in 1996. ``I couldn't go to
black leather overnight. So I started with the gold buttons and
changed the pink to gray and eventually got to black leather.''
</P>
<P>
   At Saint Laurent, his preference for evolution over revolution
is likely to be just as apparent. His personal aesthetic _
beautiful, womanly clothes that are above all else, wearable _ is
in keeping with his legendary predecessor's.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a good dinner, you have to have a good wine and fresh
tomatoes, a past and a present, which will take you into the
future,'' said Elbaz, whose imagination often runs to poetic
metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   Many fashion insiders had complained that since Saint Laurent's
heyday in the '70s, there had been little innovation in the
ready-to-wear line, with the same safari styles repeated each
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood that we needed to change because the fashion
business has changed,'' said Pierre Berge, Saint Laurent's business
partner and president of Yves Saint Laurent couture. ``Alber is
American. It's not a question of nationality but of training.
American training is very good. The French are totally haute
couture and chichi. Old couturiers pretend to be artists. I don't
need an artist. I need someone who respects women, craftsmanship
and thinks about marketing, strategy and communication. That is
Alber.''
</P>
<P>
   With Saint Laurent now freed to concentrate on couture, it is
Elbaz's responsibility to turn the house into a global enterprise,
a skill he developed at Guy Laroche. ``You need colors for South
America, New York needs black, California pastels only,'' he said.
``The South needs short, the North long. Within Europe, the German
market is looking for one thing, the French another. You make a
dress with a coat for the society look or a jacket with pants for
the career look.
</P>
<P>
   ``The collection has to be versatile but mixed like a cake, not
a salad, which is blended in the wrong way,'' he said. ``A cake is
blended into one taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Morocco, Elbaz grew up in Israel, studying fashion
design in Tel Aviv before moving to New York in 1986 at age 25.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he was hired as an assistant designer for
Geoffrey Beene, a position he held for eight years. It was Dawn
Mello, formerly the executive vice president of Gucci and now the
president of Bergdorf Goodman, who helped him land the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a designer for Gucci, and Alber was
recommended to me,'' she recalled. ``He wouldn't have been right
for Gucci, which was on the sporty track. He did dressy evening
clothes. He has a great sense of fantasy and sophistication, and
that's why his evening clothes are so good. So I called Geoffrey
Beene. Alber learned a lot from Geoffrey. His work became very
refined, but he always had his own style.''
</P>
<P>
   That style is deceptively simple. Without elaborate
embellishments or silhouettes, Elbaz relies on classic shapes, a
few feminine flourishes like beading and ribbons, and flattering
colors to achieve a look that he describes as ``very French _
coquette and chic.''
</P>
<P>
   From his mentor, Beene, Elbaz learned how to update styles
through daring, complicated construction, placing sharp darts and
seams in unconventional places _ across the chest and lower back,
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The client whom I have in mind wants something beautiful and
comfortable,'' Elbaz said. ``For evening, the clothes are glamorous
but never extravagant. When a woman walks into a room, no one will
faint, but she will be noticed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Jurnjack, a hairdresser who has worked with Elbaz on his
last three shows at Guy Laroche, said the designer was never
directly influenced by past styles or what is trendy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never talks about the '60s, the '20s, or makes reference to
a magazine,'' Jurnjack said. ``Alber is the first designer I've met
who never asks me what was in the shows in London or Milan, which
come before Paris. If I make a comparison to someone else, it's
already too close, and he throws it out. His references come from
the street, and they're always very social.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing apart from other designers, Elbaz displays little
interest in fame or stardom. ``It's so '80s,'' he said
dismissively. He lives in the Bastille, an unpretentious section of
Paris, where he rents a sparsely furnished apartment. He takes a
subway, bus or cab to get around. ``I never walk, I don't like to
walk, I'm Jewish,'' he said, with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alber is an example of someone getting ahead on the basis of
his portfolio and talent,'' said Amy Fine Collins, a special
correspondent at Vanity Fair, who frequently writes about fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no PR blitz. From the beginning, he was fascinated
with a new way to cut cloth and stitch a seam. Those things obsess
him. These are things in the bright flash of a camera or splashy
video you can't see. Today, what matters in fashion is what looks
splashy. It's about superficial effects and not anatomy. Alber gets
anatomy. Let's just say, he's the real thing. He's not interested
in being a celebrity or walker for socialites.''
</P>
<P>
   When not working, Elbaz loves to eat, food being a passion and
frequent topic of conversation, his weight a preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I eat a lot when I'm tense or relaxed,'' he said. ``I am
always tense or relaxed, so there you go. I say I'm allergic to
sand because I won't wear a bathing suit. But it's because I'm
fat.''
</P>
<P>
   As a people person with a gentle, upbeat personality, it is not
surprising that Elbaz was an official social planner for the troops
while serving in the Israeli army. For three years, he planned
parties, organized visits to a local nursing home and taught
soldiers about culture, geography and music.
</P>
<P>
   It was also in the army that Elbaz came to appreciate loyalty.
``In the army, you know someone is behind you,'' he said. ``You
depend on him. Fashion is a business, but not a Swiss watch
business. It's very personal. As a designer, sometimes they like
you, and other times they throw you to the dogs. Loyalty impresses
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Elbaz's Israeli background also helps to explain his
down-to-earth attitude toward fashion and his sense of priorities.
``There's so much going on there, so much beyond fashion,'' he
said, referring to the daily political crises in Israel. ``You take
everything in proportion. You see different perspectives. Let's say
you get a midnight-blue fabric when really what you wanted was
navy. You make it work. You do the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   A frequently recounted example of Elbaz's ability to turn an
accident into an advantage occurred during his first show at Guy
Laroche. As the models strutted down the runway in
rhinestone-studded sandals, the jewels started popping off,
scattering across the floor. Once the straps had broken, the models
kicked off their shoes, continuing the show barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the show, there was dead silence,'' Ms. Mello
remembered. ``Then, out of the back, burst this little man with
hair that looked like he stuck his finger in an electric socket. He
danced and jumped down the runway. No one had ever seen anything
like that. People started to laugh and they stood up and started
applauding, and he got the best reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the mishap, which to another designer might have
signaled disaster, Elbaz responded lightheartedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought we planned it,'' he said. ``It was so good. I
laughed about it. This is part of life. It gave a human touch to
that first show. The whole thing was like a big happening.''

 &HT;    Durable Corolla still on a roll
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Toyota Corolla is far from being the flagship of
Toyota's fleet, but it continues to sail along with some features
not always found on top-of-the-line models and a remarkable record
of longevity.
</P>
<P>
   Durability, in fact, is a major reason why Consumer Guide and
other value-conscious raters consistently give the compact
front-driver ``best buy'' ratings. If that isn't convincing,
consider this: The Corolla, now available in three trim levels with
a base price range of $12,218 to $14,868, has been on the American
market for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Look at all the models that have come and gone since the first
Corolla arrived from Japan, including Toyota's recently axed Supra
sports car, and it's obvious there's something right about the
little sedan.
</P>
<P>
   The list has to include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Optional side air bags ($250). OK, the 2,400-pound Corolla's
174-inch length means it's only a blip on the windscreens of
trucks, sport-utility vehicles and many cars, but it's got these
and other safety features aplenty. Anti-lock brakes, too, are
optional ($550), but at least they're offered, and Toyota's system
is one of the smoothest and most effective around.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cheerful little engine _ 1.8 liters and four cylinders _
that gets good mileage even when driven vigorously or when heavily
loaded. Like any four-cylinder, it can be noisy when it's time to
hustle and merge, but it manages to make 122 pounds-feet of torque
at a rapidly reached 4,400 rpm and pulls willingly up to the
6,000-rpm range with maximum muscle of 120 horsepower coming at
5,600 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Both three- and four-speed automatic transmission are offered,
and they're smooth enough to be a boon in creep-and-crawl
situations, and the overdrive lockout improves driveability up and
down hills. But Toyota's manual transmissions are well-developed
ones, and while the five-speed noticeably improves fuel mileage by
2-3 mpg, the real advantage is that manual shifting makes the most
of the engine's perkiness.
</P>
<P>
   _ An interior with trim and conveniences that won't leave owners
feeling their car was yanked off the assembly line before getting
its fair share of features and attention. The plastic, to be sure,
is apparent, but cloth door inserts give a touch of class, and the
fit and finish don't suggest that the Corolla doesn't get the same
workmanship as Toyota's higher-priced vehicles. Seams are
close-fitting, and the controls are more than basic without being
complex or redundant.
</P>
<P>
   The test Corolla CE _ more equipment than the VE, but not as
much as the LE _ went from a base price of $12,908 to a bottom line
of $16,403 after adding options and destination charges. Included
were the four-speed automatic, air bags, anti-lock brakes and a
$1,670 package of features both expected (AC, power locks and
windows) and questionable (heavy-duty defogger with timer). The
add-on pricing is a major reason most reviewers note the Corolla is
not the cheapest little sedan on the market.
</P>
<P>
   But the Corolla is a car that goes willingly, has the interior
space to take a family of four and some cabin cargo and won't
create discomfort because it's a rough or noisy ride. It's got the
inherent small-car weaknesses of a tight back seat, barely adequate
headroom and less-than-great visibility but, in the long run, the
Corolla's got a record that says it will go the distance
efficiently and reasonably comfortably.

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Call directory assistance in Massachusetts
and ask for ``the mad Russian,'' and chances are they'll know who
you're trying to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Address an envelope with the same name and the Boston post
office knows where to deliver it: a brownstone house in Brookline,
whose porch is often crowded with smokers furiously puffing away
before entering the offices of Yefim Shubentsov, a Soviet emigre
renowned for curing nicotine slaves of their cravings in an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are recognizable faces amid the clouds of smoke:
Billy Joel, Jann Wenner and Amy Tan all quit smoking after visits
to Shubentsov.
</P>
<P>
   An eccentric with an often incomprehensible Russian accent,
Shubentsov, 58, uses methods that seem to owe more to Rasputin than
to modern science. His technique resists explanation. What looks
like hand-waving and suggestive mumbo jumbo Shubentsov calls
marshaling clients' ``bioenergy'' to rid them of the desire to
smoke. ``Physically, I transform energy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who have been cured by Shubentsov have a hard time
explaining how he did it. ``It was so weird,'' the novelist Alice
Hoffman said. ``I was one of those really bad smokers. I was like
the sort who sneaked cigarettes during labor. I left there and I
had no desire for the thing I'd had before. For a long time I
couldn't even talk about it, like if you talked about it, you'd
break the spell.''
</P>
<P>
   Shubentsov even cured Jim Fitzgerald, a former editor at St.
Martin's Press, and the author of ``The Joy of Smoking
Cigarettes,'' who kicked his habit recently after attending one of
Shubentsov's group sessions, which are held four times a day, three
days a week.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, an eclectic mix of 15 patients came to
see Shubentsov, including a middle-aged man who had come from North
Carolina, a woman suffering from emphysema, and a Lebanese-born
woman with a cell phone. Each had paid $65.
</P>
<P>
   The wood-paneled waiting room had the charm of an eccentric
college professor's office. On the walls hung sunny landscapes
painted by Shubentsov, who was a commercial artist in Moscow before
he emigrated with his wife and son in 1979, setting up his
quit-smoking practice the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Shubentsov appeared: a small, compact man in a plaid jacket and
olive pants. He invited the group to a stark room adorned with
chairs in a U shape and a desk empty except for a clock and a glass
of water. ``Relax, relax,'' Shubentsov said, in an accent as heavy
as a pirogi.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxation is a key to his treatment, and since he thinks no one
who is in pain can relax, he begins sessions by asking people for
the location of any pains they have. Then he dispenses a dose of
``bioenergy'' by making a few movements with his hands near the
trouble spot. Insisting he is not a faith healer, he explained,
``It's no magic.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked his way around the chairs, waving his hands over an
injured ankle, flicking his fingers above a sore neck, encouraging
people to ask questions. ``Be brave, I don't bite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few dared. ``How does this work?'' one asked.
Shubentsov's answer, something about his superior biological
fields, elicited confused looks. ``Can you cure depression?''
someone asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's situational,'' Shubentsov said.
</P>
<P>
   In a book he helped to write this summer, ``Cure Your Cravings''
(Penguin Putnam, $21.95), Shubentsov says that he has treated
nearly 96,000 people since 1979 for smoking, as well as overeating,
phobias, depression, even broken hearts. His co-author is Barbara
Gordon, who wrote the drug-addiction memoir ``I'm Dancing as Fast
as I Can.'' He cured her of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching the last person in the group, Shubentsov stood
before his desk and said, ``Now we begin.'' A rapid-fire lecture
ensued. He flitted from subject to subject, gesturing wildly, a tic
that has prompted some to speculate that he is performing some sort
of group hypnosis. But Shubentsov later denied it. ``I never
hypnotize people my entire life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are born without the desire to smoke,'' he told the group.
``In our original condition that desire does not exist. I put back
in place what was supposed to be.'' He offered a hodgepodge of
obvious advice (don't eat between meals; get more physical
exercise) and hard-to-follow digressions. Instructing the group to
avoid substitutes for smoking, he barked, ```Don't even put your
finger in your mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are born without the desire to smoke,'' he repeated in
conclusion. ``Smoking for you does not exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he saw each client individually for one minute.
Shubentsov told them, with eyes closed, to imagine themselves not
smoking. Then he waved a hand and made a breathy sound. ``He kind
of sneezes on you,'' Patty Ryan, a graphic artist who had come from
Los Angeles, said.
</P>
<P>
   Does it work? Though he is hard to pin down, Shubentsov suggests
that his success rate is more than 90 percent, an astonishing
figure and one that seems like an exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   It is not overly difficult to find failed clients. Joel Eichel,
an owner of Bigelow Pharmacy in New York, took his three-pack-a-day
habit to Shubentsov, but was not cured. ``You can tell me a lot of
things, but just because this guy says he's gonna give me
bioenergy,'' Eichel said, trailing off in a skeptical tone, ``I
don't give it a whole lot of credence. To me, it's a lot of bull.''
</P>
<P>
   Other hard cases include Fran Lebowitz, the author, who failed
to shrug off her smoking habit after a visit to Shubentsov. She
declined to comment further.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Shubentsov said that he discovered his way with bioenergy some
30 years ago in Moscow. One day while delivering artworks, a
stranger asked him to be in a laboratory test. He was told that he
had a ``better biological field than average,'' he said. ``I didn't
understand what the hell is it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Shubentsov's method was observed by two
psychotherapists from Harvard University Health Services, Dr.
Douglas Powell and Dr. Henry Babcock. They sent him 20 patients,
who complained of phobias, pain and a desire to stop smoking and
lose weight. All had been previously treated by Powell and Babcock,
with little success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some pretty good work; it was pretty impressive,'' said
Powell, director of research and behavioral science at Harvard
University Health Services. ``These were pretty difficult patients,
and he had about 50 percent success.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared Shubentsov's technique to quigong, an ancient form
of Chinese medicine that combines movement, meditation and
visualization to enhance the mind-body connection and assist
healing. ``Some people are born to be healers, and he may have that
in him,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald, the formerly joyful smoker, cannot explain
Shubentsov's method, but he is impressed. ``There's something he
does,'' he said. ``It was all so convoluted. I keep hearing the
words `common sense.' And somehow that gets me to not smoke.''

GINGRICH: A REBEL CONSUMED BY REBELLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thus ends one of the most flamboyant Washington
runs ever.
</P>
<P>
   He gained power as an insurgent and lost it in an insurrection.
His career flourished in an oppressed congressional minority and
was extinguished in an equally oppressive congressional majority.
He saw a route to power when none of his allies believed that power
was achievable _ but never acknowledged the threats to his own
power that everyone within his caucus saw.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich _ a rebel consumed by a rebellion within his own
forces, a strategist with an instinct for gaining power but none
for retaining it, a visionary with a blind spot _ was a historian
who found a place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is the speaker who won power for the Republicans after 40
years in the wilderness and then was thrust into exile after only
four years in power.
</P>
<P>
   For four decades the Republicans labored in the minority, their
views never sought, their interests never considered, their rights
in the Congress never acknowledged. Gingrich, elected in 1978,
chafed under the Democrats' rule. He saw things that never were, at
least in the legislative lifetimes of nearly every one of his
colleagues _ a Republican majority _ and asked why not.
</P>
<P>
   By force of will, by countless acts of persuasion, with a canny
and sometimes cruel guile, Gingrich won that majority four
Novembers ago. But the man who dared to ask why the Republicans
could not hold the majority never dared to answer what the
Republicans would do with that majority once they won it.
</P>
<P>
   That, more than his personal eccentricities, more than his
ethical lapses, more than his sense of vengeance, more than his
disastrous decision to transform this week's midterm congressional
elections into a referendum on a tainted president, accounted for
his downfall. His majority was elected on the strength of a radical
document, his famous Contract with America, but beyond the promises
in that tract he was able to win no concensus for a GOP agenda for
the century's end. Moreover, he offered no legislative roadmap
himself.
</P>
<P>
   So when the bottom fell out this week _ once Republicans
realized that a leader who boasted of his sense of history had made
an historic miscalculation _ Gingrich had nothing to fall back on:
no record of achievement, no compelling agenda for the 106th
Congress, no sense that the man who had found the route to the
Speaker's Rooms had any rationale for remaining there.
</P>
<P>
   In ten terms in the House, Gingrich moved across the political
landscape of Washington like a white tornado, flinging assumptions
into the air, turning convention on its head, sending debris
everywhere, creating upheaval in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   He changed everything _ the names of committees, the way the
House works, the relationship between the two chambers. No
tradition was safe, no custom was secure, no unspoken bargain
respected. At a time when the nation became markedly less partisan,
he grew ever more partisan.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessors, especially House Minority Leader Robert Michel
of Illinois, accommodated the Democratic leadership. He fought it;
there was no scotch-and-soda with the Democrats after hours, no
golf games with liberals at Burning Tree Country Club. His GOP
predecessors became spokesmen for big business. He fought the
nation's industrialists and manufacturers; rather than invite the
CEOs of General Motors and AT&AMP;T into the office for lunch on linen
tablecloths, Gingrich had take-out club sandwiches with local Pizza
Hut franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   He toppled a speaker (James C. Wright Jr., of Texas), took on a
president of his own party (George Bush), created a kitchen cabinet
of conservative intellectuals (boasting that both he and the
majority leader, Richard K. Armey, of Texas, both possessed Ph.Ds)
and spawned scores of acolytes. He spoke of a ``conservative
opportunity society'' and then set out to make the terms seem not
incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   The result was four years of dizzying tumult: deals made and
broken with President Clinton; a government shutdown in 1995; a
tantrum aboard Air Force I; an abortive coup; a cascade of
criticism for Gingrich's weak negotiating position on budget issues
with the president; constantly changing tactics on the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, with Gingrich first vowing to mention the episode
in every speech, then urging Republicans to focus elsewhere and
finally mounting ad advertising offensive against Clinton in the
waning days of this month's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich lived a life of contradictions, and even in his moments
of triumph they thrust themselves to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   He trained his eye on the future _ but was obsessed with the
past. He spoke of openness in the Congress _ but squelched the
Democrats with as little mercy as a parade of Democratic Speakers
had shown to the Republicans. He courted religious conservatives _
but thwarted many of their efforts to bring many of their
priorities, including abortion, to the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Gingrich had no allies _ not the Democrats he
taunted, to be sure, but also not conservatives, not the moderates,
not anyone.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of his triumph, and at the heart of his downfall,
was his failure to win security _ from his colleagues, from his
movement, from his constituents. In 1990, only four years before he
would assume what is arguably the second most powerful job in
Washington, he spent an astonishing $1.5 million and won by only
974 votes. Two years later his margin in the GOP primary was only
six votes bigger _ a victory margin of only 980 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Like President Clinton, Gingrich was the son of a broken home, a
striving youth more awkward than his athletic friends, more
intelligent than the young people who surrounded him, but also more
ambitious, more driven, more singleminded, more determined to make
a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Their very similarity brought them to power in the same era, and
brought them to blows repeatedly. Each stood as the other's symbol.
Each fought off ethical battles. Each battled rebellions within
their own party. Each waltzed with catastrophe, but to his own
melody, his own tempo, his own rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Gingrich's waltz ended. He surveyed the hall, realized
that he was leading but had no partner. He went home, but the floor
he left behind has been changed forever.

FRENCH LEADERS CLASH ON STATUS OF WORLD WAR I MUTINEERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A day after France's Socialist prime minister called for
the rehabilitation of French soldiers executed for refusing to
fight in a World War I battle that cost 300,000 French lives, the
country's Gaullist conservative president, Jacques Chirac, on
Friday called the prime minister's remarks ``inopportune.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1917 battle, along a ridge road called the Chemin des Dames,
remains a sensitive subject in France as it prepares to celebrate
the 80th anniversary of the Nov. 11 armistice that ended the war.
</P>
<P>
   An aide said Chirac's office had received outraged complaints
from families of soldiers killed in the war and from some of the
few hundred surviving veterans after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
made his remarks Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the battle of the Chemin des Dames at a ceremony for
the dead in the village of Craonne, Jospin said: ``Some of these
soldiers, exhausted by attacks that were doomed in advance,
slipping in mud stained with blood, plunged into bottomless
despair, refused to be sacrificed. Let these soldiers, `shot as
examples' in the name of discipline whose rigor was equaled only by
the hardships of battle, be re-integrated today, fully, in our
national collective memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, who has been forced to live with Jospin's leftist
coalition government since elections called by the president last
year failed to produce the expected Gaullist victory, on Friday let
the prime minister know he had gone too far, softening the blow by
issuing the statement from his office in the Elysee Palace rather
than in his own name.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment when the nation is commemorating the sacrifice
of more than a million French soldiers who gave their lives between
1914 and 1918 to defend their invaded homeland, the Elysee finds
any public statement that could be interpreted as rehabilitation of
the mutineers inopportune,'' Chirac's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The power of the past remains strong in Europe. In Britain
families of soldiers executed during the war for desertion and
cowardice won permission this year for the first time to hold a
ceremony in their memory. It will take place Saturday at the
Cenotaph, the monument to the war dead in Whitehall, London.
</P>
<P>
   The French started their offensive on the Chemin des Dames in
the spring of 1917. The offensive, ordered by Gen. Robert Nivelle,
failed to drive the Germans from the road. The setback frightened
French politicians who had come 70 miles from Paris thinking they
would see a great French victory. Instead, it sent them scurrying
back to the capital with fears that the war might soon be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks of slaughter demoralized tens of thousands of French
soldiers who had held the lines through three years. At the end of
May 1917, as many as 30,000 soldiers abandoned the trenches for the
rear and refused orders to return to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Angry commanders arrested their leaders and condemned 412 of
them to death, though only a few, between 27 and 49 by various
estimates, were actually executed.
</P>
<P>
   French troops later regained the initiative and finally pushed
the Germans off the Chemin des Dames in October. But from that day
on, the mutineers were treated as disgraced and the subject as
taboo. Stanley Kubrick's ``Paths of Glory,'' a 1957 movie about the
mutinies, was banned in France when it was made and remained banned
until 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin, 61, who served as a lieutenant in the French army in the
early 1960s, decided that the moment had come, 80 years after the
end of the First World War, to put an end to an old quarrel, his
aides said. Chirac's office disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moment just wasn't right,'' an aide to Chirac said Friday.
``To put those who refused to fight and those who fought and died
on the same level _ it just wasn't the right time to do that, and
we have had an enormous negative reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac decided this year to award all 1,500 surviving Allied
veterans, including about 200 Americans, a high military
distinction created by Napoleon: the Chevalier Cross of the Legion
of Honor.

RELIEF EFFORTS ENTER RURAL AREAS IN NICARAGUA 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua _ With the flood waters generated by a huge
hurricane finally receding, now that nearly two weeks of torrential
rains appear to have ended, relief workers and international aid
groups on Friday stepped up their efforts to reach survivors in
isolated rural areas across Central America and to rush food,
medicine and other vital supplies to them.
</P>
<P>
   The combined death toll from the storm, Mitch, which officials
describe as the worst natural disaster to strike the subcontinent
in this century, is estimated at more than 11,000, mostly in
Honduras and Nicaragua.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of the difficulties that lie ahead, several
thousand others are still listed as missing, and more than 1
million have been left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to improving weather, however, airlifts of basic supplies
to the main disaster zones in both countries are finally in full
swing. Through midweek, helicopters leaving from the Nicaraguan
capital for hard-hit areas like Esteli and Matagalpa with rice,
beans, sugar and other basic foods were repeatedly unable to land
and were turned back by bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   In one indication of how international cooperation is beginning
to take effect, a small Mexican air force plane landed at
midmorning Friday at the airstrip in Chinandega, the northwestern
town closest to the most damaged area. The plane was met by a
photographer and about 12 local volunteers, who began loading large
sacks of rice donated by the United States onto trucks.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later another aircraft landed, and a group of French and
Scandinavian doctors immediately headed for the hospital, where
survivors of the mudslides that entombed six villages around
Posoltega, killing more than 1,500, are being treated.
</P>
<P>
   Reversing the lowered profile that it had cultivated since civil
wars in the region ended early in the decade, the United States has
approved $70 million in emergency aid to Central America and has
sent helicopters and food. Both Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tipper
Gore are scheduled to visit Central America in the next two weeks
as an additional expression of U.S. concern.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon former President Jimmy Carter, who helped
broker the elections in 1990 that led to the end of the Sandinista
revolution, arrived here to assess storm damage.
</P>
<P>
   President Carlos Flores of Honduras announced that former
President George Bush is to visit that country over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   New problems were emerging, however, particularly the threat of
epidemics. Nicaraguan officials acknowledged Friday that there have
been limited outbreaks of cholera in a few areas. International
relief groups warned that the huge new bodies of stagnant water
that have been created are likely to lead to the appearance of
malaria, dengue fever and other mosquito-borne diseases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With many bridges and roads still out of service, and farms and
fields throughout the region destroyed just as an especially rich
harvest was about to begin, some shortages of basic crops like
beans and rice were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers here and in other cities complained that some prices
had doubled, leading local offices of the national emergency
committee to plead with store owners not to withhold supplies or
manipulate prices.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest challenge to President Arnoldo Aleman, however, is
the popular discontent with his government's delays in sending
assistance to the areas where it is most needed. In a typical
expression of anger a survivor of the Posoltega mudslide, Francisco
Sandoval, complained on Thursday, ``The government has done nothing
to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Enrique Bolanos, who was put in charge of the
National Emergency Committee that is overseeing relief efforts, has
pleaded for patience, pointing to the bad weather and widespread
damage to communications and roads that initially slowed
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But leaders of the Sandinista Front have been critical of the
conservative government's decision to suspend the powers of mayors,
one-third Sandinistas, and to concentrate power in its hands.

US AGREES TO DECLARE BAY STATE MAN FIRST VIET WAR CASUALTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Massachusetts man, whose son would later follow his mortal
march into Southeast Asia, was formally recognized as the nation's
first Vietnam War casualty Friday when the Pentagon said it would
chisel his name into black granite _ and history.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two years after the Department of Defense's telegram
arrived at the home of Technical Sergeant Richard B. Fitzgibbon
Jr., his family celebrated the distinction it contended doggedly
for years belonged to him.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next spring, with the roar of a sandblasting tool
slicing into Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, Fitzgibbon
will become the first officially recognized US fallen serviceman of
the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In joining a son who shared his father's name, his wartime fate,
and ultimately his gravesite in Braintree, Mass., the Fitzgibbons
become the only father-son honorees on the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgibbons ``is smiling down at us and he's saying, `You did
it, kid.''' said his sister Alice DelRossi, 71, of Stoneham, Mass.,
who led the fight for the honor. ``God bless him. Now, they both
can rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Fitzgibbon, the son of a mailman and the oldest of nine
children, was two weeks shy of his 35th birthday when he was shot
to death by a fellow crew member in Saigon in June 1956.
</P>
<P>
   His family's efforts to formally enshrine his name on one of the
nation's most hallowed monuments to wartime heroism, lasted more
than a decade and led to Capitol Hill and the Pentagon. It
culminated with Washington's official agreement to change the
acknowledged date on which US entanglement in Vietnam began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fitzgibbon family sacrificed more than any other family
and they are finally receiving the recognition which they deserve
for this enormous contribution to our country,'' said US
Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Bernard Fitzgibbon Jr. enlisted in the Navy shortly
after his graduation in 1939 from Stoneham High School. He saw
combat in World War II from seaplane tenders in the South Pacific,
and after the war returned to Squantum Naval Air Station in Quincy,
Mass. He and his wife, Eunice, settled into a home in Weymouth,
Mass.,before he was transferred to the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   DelRossi said she wrote ``to every single person we knew in
Washington'' for 15 years, receiving a bundle of form letters that
deemed her brother ineligible for inclusion on the wall because he
died before 1961.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until she asked Markey for help a year ago, during a
meeting in Stoneham, that officials began to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgibbon left for Vietnam in the first week of 1956 for his
new posting as a crew chief, serving on the Douglas C-47s that flew
between Saigon and the Philippines. &UR;  &LR; Fitzgibbon's unit was in
Vietnam to train the national military to fight the Communist
insurgency, Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   DelRossi recalls letters from her brother in which he expressed
concern about Sgt. Edward C. Clarke, the radio man on his crew,
whom Fitzgibbon said vomited and fell apart when the plane came
under fire. He wrote to his family that he was worried that Clarke
was endangering the entire crew.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1956, after an especially turbulent flight over
Vietnam, relatives said Clarke and Fitzgibbon traded angry words.
Moments later, they said, Clarke shot Fitzgibbon to death and
wounded another soldier before falling from a balcony to his death.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of Fitzgibbon's death didn't bar him from the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial; officials said veterans who died at the
hands of comrades qualify. But with only a handful of exceptions,
the Pentagon's official casualty list began with deaths after Jan.
1, 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Markey successfully argued to Pentagon officials that, once the
French pulled troops out of Vietnam in April 1956, ``the US was
completely financing and controlling the military effort in Vietnam
and that anyone who was in Vietnam after that point was fully
engaged in what has come to be known as the Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   After what the Pentagon called a high-level review, the earliest
qualifying date for addition to the memorial was pushed back to
Nov. 1, 1955.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lt. Col. Tom Begines, a Pentagon spokesman, said Friday that
Fitzgibbon's death is the earliest in the Defense Department's
database.
</P>
<P>
   Markey and Pentagon officials will join Fitzgibbon's family on
Monday morning at Stoneham's Town Hall to officially announce the
decision _ a ceremony family members said will be bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often heard people talk about closure,'' DelRossi said.
``And I used to say, `What the hell are they talking about? You're
never going to forget them.' That's what I thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, I'm feeling the sense of letting go,'' she said. ``I
don't know how to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was dedicated in 1982, 275
names have been added to the wall. The Department of Defense
studies each claim submitted by family members and the
half-inch-high names are added only if it is certain they are
official casualties of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Libby Hatch, director of special projects for the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial Fund, said she is not certain where Fitzbibbons
name will be added to the 58,214 there already.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be a star by it saying that this is actually the
first death,'' Hatch said. ``Basically every name is just as
important if they died at the beginning or if they died at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the earliest death now memorialized on the wall is
that of Army Capt. Harry G. Cramer, a 31-year-old Californian, who
died in an accidental explosion while training Vietnamese troops in
1957 _ four years before the date officially marked as the start of
the war.
</P>
<P>
   Begines, the Pentagon spokesman, noted that Fitzgibbon's son,
Marine Lance Corporal Richard B. Fitzgibbon III, was killed in
action in Vietnam on Sept. 7, 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our knowledge, they were the only American father and son
service members to die in Vietnam,'' Begines said.
</P>
<P>
   Markey said, ``The son obviously believed that he was fighting
the same war as his father. The historical record is now very clear
that he was fighting the same war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision rectified a great injustice. It makes it
possible for a father who inspired his son to sacrifice his life
for our country to be joined rightfully with that son for eternity
after having died in the very same conflict.''

DISPUTED `LOLITA' SPINOFF IS DROPPED BY PUBLISHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an abrupt reversal that ends a tangled legal and literary
confrontation, Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux said Friday that it had
canceled plans to publish a retelling of ``Lolita'' from the
nymphet's point of view, in part because of copyright concerns by
some of the publishing house's own writers.
</P>
<P>
   The estate of Vladimir Nabokov filed suit in federal court in
October to block American and British publication of the book,
``Lo's Diary,'' by Pia Pera, an Italian short-story writer, calling
it a ``rip-off'' of the legally protected original, published in
1955.
</P>
<P>
   The new novel, in the form of a diary by Lolita giving her
version of the scandalous love affair with her stepfather, has been
published to mixed reviews in Italy and six other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux contested and has now
agreed to settle, raised far-reaching questions that lawyers said
had never been resolved by the courts, including the degree to
which a character in a copyrighted literary work can be reused by
another author.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pera, reached in Italy, said she deplored the decision but
that she did not plan to sue.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said it was not clear whether MacMillan, which had
planned to bring out the book in Britain and was named as a
co-defendant with Farrar, Straus in the lawsuit, intended to
proceed with publication.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Straus, president and chief executive of the publishing
house, said he decided to cancel its planned publication next July
despite objections from his editor in chief, Jonathan Galassi, in
response to concerns by some of his writers that their creations
could be appropriated through the same literary license claimed by
Farrar, Straus.
</P>
<P>
   The publishing house is now owned by Holtzbrinck, the German
publishing conglomerate, but the decision against publication was
made by Straus alone, all parties agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Straus said he had been questioning his decision to publish
``Lo's Diary'' since the uproar began. `` `Is this good for
literature or bad for literature?' is the question we have been
asking ourselves,'' he said. ``Are we standing up for writers and
for literature by proceeding to publish Pia Pera or by acceding to
the wishes of the Nabokov estate?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he said, ``I don't think it right for any publisher
to feed off the reputation of a literary person.'' He declined to
name any of the authors who had voiced concern about the planned
publication.
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation was welcomed by Peter Skolnik, a lawyer for
Dmitri Nabokov, the sole heir and executor of his father's estate.
``Dmitri is, of course, enormously pleased and joins me in thinking
it is the right outcome for the right reasons,'' Skolnik said. He
said the decision to sue had also been difficult because, given the
history of controversy over ``Lolita,'' ``few writers have stood
more for the right of free expression than Nabokov.''
</P>
<P>
   But the estate had to respond to what he called ``esthetic and
literary vampirism,'' Skolnick added. If the appropriation claimed
by Farrar, Straus and Ms. Pera had been allowed to stand, he said,
``the next author is free to say, `Ahh, there's a good idea: I'll
tell it from the perspective of a another character.''' Why would
motion picture producers pay writers for their creations ``if they
could just change the perspective and get away with it?'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Friedman, a lawyer for Farrar, Straus who had been prepared
to defend the book as a ``fair use'' and artistic transformation of
Nabokov's work, called Straus' action ``a literary decision.''
</P>
<P>
   From the Greek legend of ``Pygmalion,'' which became a George
Bernard Shaw play and then ``My Fair Lady,'' literary characters
and entire works have long been fodder for other writers but
usually the works are out of copyright. ``Lolita,'' published in
the United States by Random House, is under copyright until the
year 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pera, 42, reached at home in the Tuscan countryside near
Lucca, said she had heard about the cancellation only hours before
in a call from one of her editors. ``I was disappointed,'' she
said. ``I thought they were going to fight for it. This way we will
never know if we could have won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel what is at stake here are two fundamental rights
clashing: property rights and the right of free expression,'' she
said. ``My book is on some kind of frontier between the two.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that if it were possible to secure publication by
giving up any economic gain from her book, she would agree. She
also said she did not intend to sue Farrar, Straus to enforce
publication. The book, first published in Italy in 1995, later came
out in Brazil, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Finland and Greece.
It was also bought by a French publisher who later dropped it and
turned out to be a cousin of Dmitri Nabokov, Ms. Pera said.
</P>
<P>
   Skolnik said although the Nabokov estate did not sue those
publishers at the time, legal action was still under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Straus' decision to cancel publication was strongly opposed by
Galassi, editor in chief and executive vice president at Farrar,
Straus, and by Ethan Nosowsky, the editor who worked with Galassi
to prepare the manuscript for publication.
</P>
<P>
   Straus said they had argued strenuously for publication but not
acrimoniously. ``It was an intellectual debate, not who shot
John,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the case raised important questions that would
remain unresolved, at least until another publisher came along to
take up the book. ``From a lawyer's point of view,'' Straus said,
``it would have been a delicious case.''

U.S. BANKS CAUTIOUS ON AID TO BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a $30 billion international rescue package for Brazil
nearing completion, U.S. banks, already battered by global
financial turmoil, are sitting on the sidelines. Only a few weeks
ago, some American bankers, including those with Chase Manhattan
Corp., talked openly about the possibility of bolstering the
lending efforts of agencies like the International Monetary Fund by
adding their own funds to any rescue package.
</P>
<P>
   But banks now say they will wait for Brazil _ a far more
important country to most of them than, for example, Indonesia,
South Korea or Russia _ to ask for more money before any is
offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initiative for any private money will have to come from
Brazil,'' said a senior American banker who requested anonymity.
``I think Brazil will want to wait and see what the $30 billion
credit line does to their costs in the sovereign debt markets
before they make another move.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has argued in recent weeks
that any aid to Brazil has to include money from the private sector
_ lest banks and other investors benefit from a bailout without
suffering for any undue risks they took in Brazil. For their part,
bankers face the wrath of their shareholders and regulators if they
throw good money after bad.
</P>
<P>
   Lingering questions remain about the ability of Brazilian
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to invigorate the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, until Brazil's spending plans gain
further momentum and the economic picture becomes clearer,
investors are likely to remain cautious about the country. The U.S.
banks are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I believe there will be an agreement between Brazil and the
IMF sometime next week and immediately thereafter I believe the
Brazilian government plans a road show in the United States, Europe
and Japan to discuss the country's economic programs,'' said
William Rhodes, head of risk management for Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   A great deal is at stake for the U.S. financial institutions.
Compared with exposure of $6.8 billion to Russia, and $44.6 billion
to all Asian borrowers, United States banks had about $27.3 billion
in loans and other financial exposure to Brazil as of June 30,
according to Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   While more current aggregate figures are not available, the
biggest United States banks in Brazil released updated informatiol
about their exposures at the end of September _ and most of them
showed a sharp decline since June.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has $3.8 billion in exposure to Brazil, down from $4.3
billion at the end of June; J.P. Morgan has $2.2 billion, down from
$4 billion; BankAmerica has $3.3 billion, down from $3.9 billion,
and BankBoston has less than $1 billion, down from $1.7 billion.
Citigroup, recently formed by the merger of Citicorp and Travelers
Group Inc., said it had $4.4 billion in Brazilian exposure in June
but does not have more current figures. Both Citigroup and
BankBoston also have large local operations in Brazil that make
them the most heavily involved U.S. banks in the country.
</P>

   ``I think banks are steeling themselves for a currency
devaluation,'' said Diane Glossman of Lehman Brothers Inc. ``Mutual
funds and investment banks also have a big stake in the outcome and
to expect that it's appropriate for the banks to take on the
responsibilities for all of these other investors is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not 1982,'' Ms. Glossman added, referring to a time
when banks were the only big investors in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, any bailout package for Brazil _ with or without
backing from the private sector _ may only prove to be a stopgap
measure given the crushing debt schedule the country faces. Brazil
has more than $150 billion in short-term debt with an average
maturity of about eight months _ a huge amount of money for any
country to pay back so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the question is $30 billion versus $35 billion, I don't
think it will make a difference anyway,'' said Morris Goldstein, a
former IMF official and a senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics in Washington. ``It might look nice, but
the debt payments confronting Brazil go well beyond anything $35
billion will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil is also wrestling with having to pay interest rates of 40
percent to keep dollars from fleeing the country. While about $2
billion to $3 billion a week was being taken out of the country in
recent weeks, analysts said that has now been offset by fresh funds
coming in, meaning that the net capital flow is currently flat.
</P>
<P>
   But the government, with central bank reserves having dropped to
about $40 billion from $70 billion over the last two months, cannot
maintain sky-high interest rates indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Gallo, BankBoston's head of emerging markets trading and
investment banking, said: ``I think Brazil has about 30 to 60 days,
given its current level of reserves, to work out its problems out.
After that, the situation could get very bad.''

LUTHERAN BISHOPS ISSUE PASTORAL LETTER ON YEAR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the numerically interesting date of Jan. 1, 2000, less than
14 months away, evidence grows of widespread anxiety that the
change of calendar may be traumatic. Will the date coincide with a
global computer crash, some have wondered? Or will the New Year be
accompanied by something truly apocalyptic?
</P>
<P>
   For a glimpse of this concern, one need look only as far as the
hot sales of various end-of-the-world books, like the recent novels
that describe earthquakes, fires and assorted chaos afflicting the
United States as a prelude Jesus' Second Coming.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in an effort to offer a theological counterpoint to the
speculation, the bishops of one of the nation's largest Protestant
denominations, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, have
published a pastoral letter on the year 2000, saying, in essence,
don't be afraid.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is definitely the message,'' said Presiding Bishop H.
George Anderson, top official of the 5.2 million-member
denomination. He said that he and 62 other bishops wanted to make a
statement discussing the belief in a Second Coming as a b!sis for
Christian hope, while also declaring that the belief cannot be
linked to a mere change in the calendar. ``The two are in different
dimensions,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, sent to the denomination's nearly 11,000
congregations, also says Christians have ``a mission ahead'' on
Earth, in striving for racial and international reconciliation,
justice for all and preservation of the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be faithful,'' Anderson said, ``there is still work to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``The Year of Our Lord 2000,'' the letter states, ``The
end of the millennium continues to spawn all sorts of wild
prophecies about the end of the world.'' It adds that many
``connect certain dire events in world history with some of our
Lord's words in the New Testament, and they come to the conclusion
that the world is about to go up in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bishops warn that engaging in apocalyptic speculation
misses the ``deepest meaning'' of the Christian belief in the
Second Coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Lord came to beat back the works of evil and establish a
new order, a new time, a time of God's reign of peace,'' the letter
says. ``His return, therefore, will not mean fearsome catastrophe
but rather blessed completion; it will mean the end of the old time
of sin and suffering and the beginning of the new when God shall
wipe away tears from every eye and death shall be no more
(Revelation 21:4).''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the letter says the Bible does not use the word
millennium in direct connection with a Second Coming and it cites
two Scriptural passages (Mark 13:32 and Acts 1:7) in which Jesus
says that no one can know when he might return. (The letter also
notes that ``calendar purists'' would point out that the new
millennium will actually begin after midnight on Dec. 31, 2000, but
acknowledges that most people will celebrate its arrival one year
earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   While the letter has long been in the works, the bishops felt a
special incentive to write it after a mass suicide during Easter
week, 1997. Thirty-nine members of a shadowy sect called Heaven's
Gate killed themselves in a San Diego suburb, leaving behind
documents declaring the world to be evil and doomed to imminent
destruction, while the souls of the sect's members themselves would
rise to be rescued by a spaceship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us the realization that we are likely to see similar
things coming,'' Anderson said. ``We tried to get out ahead of the
scare.''
</P>
<P>
   The four-page letter opens with a reminder that the calendar was
originally based on calculations of the date of Jesus' birth, even
though for many people ``the connection between Jesus Christ and
the way we measure time in society has been lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter includes a reflection on the last 1,000 years of
Christianity, hailing the faith's ``tremendous expansion'' around
the world, and highlighting the importance of the Reformation for
Lutherans and other Protestants, but also lamenting that
Christianity ``has been used to justify'' slavery, the Holocaust
and many wars.
</P>
<P>
   The letter concludes with a look ahead at the church's place on
Earth, saying that in a time when spirituality seems to thrive but
spiritual seekers seem uninterested in religious institutions, the
church may have to undertake ``a mission from the margins'' of
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here for a purpose, to try to be the Kingdom of God and
there are things to do until the Lord comes,'' he said, describing
the letter as ``both a word of comfort and also an agenda, a word
of challenge.''

   She liked him so much, she decided to marry him. Robin L. Kiam,
the founder of a start-up shampoo maker and the daughter of Victor
K. Kiam II, chairman of Remington Products, Ronson and a slew of
other ventures, and Ellen Kiam, who for years ran a company that
imported artifacts from China, is tying the knot with Jonathan E.
Aviv, 38, a head-and-neck surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Wait _ he's an entrepreneur too, the inventor of a device that
prevents aspiration pneumonia in the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to revolutionize the health care industry,'' Ms.
Kiam, 37, exclaimed of his product. As for hers _ Sterling Solution
_ she says it makes gray hair glisten and prevents yellow streaking
in white hair.
</P>
<P>
   After the wedding next Saturday at 55 Wall Street, the former
Merchants Exchange, Ms. Kiam said, the couple will disappear to St.
Bart's in the French West Indies, leaving pagers and laptops
behind.
</P>
<P>
   The bride's sister, by the way, owns a newsletter publishing
house; the groom's father is chief executive of ARC Inc., a maker
of crime-detection systems; his mother is vice president of a
travel agency, and his brother started a company that makes
golfers' wind-testing devices.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kiam's father is known for his Remington commercials: ``I
liked the razor so much, I bought the company.''

   If Ms. Kiam has children, will they be entrepreneurs? ``I want
them to be whatever they want to be,'' she said. &QL;

   Leave it to David C. McCourt to enlist bones in his battle with

   Using the 21 Club for his presentation on Thursday was standard

   Ted Seides is downright proud of winning the contest for
worst-dressed student at the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Seides, 27, attributes his victory last month to a campaign
begun by a friend with the slogan, ``Every girl's crazy 'bout the
worst-dressed man.'' Classmates who hadn't graced a voting booth
for years rallied behind him, he boasts, though he doubts that they
grasped the subtleties of his sartorial style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus has yet to attain an appreciation of the
post-modern undertones of my attire,'' he said. ``For example, when
most of my peers were still wearing leg warmers and other
``Flashdance''-inspired rags in the early 80s, I had donned 70s
gear and bell-bottoms. Which is more fashionable now, you tell
me?''
</P>
<P>
   In the competition, sponsored by the school's Retail and Apparel
Club, two students won best-dressed awards. One, Amanda M. Moore,
28, said Seides got a bum rap except for ``one unfortunate golf
outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   After getting their prize money ($200 for the worst, $100 for
the two bests), she added, she went shopping with Seides because
``he wanted help.''
</P>
<P>
   The other winner, Jean-Baptiste Cordon, 26, a native of France
who is looking at a career in apparel, said he wouldn't cite the
honor on his resume but might bring it up in interviews. &QL;

   When Georgetown University named its business school after
Robert Emmett McDonough last month, it was not the first time a
McDonough was so honored. Both Georgetown's gymnasium and a main
building at its law school are named after McDonoughs, the first a
Jesuit priest and the other an industrialist.
</P>
<P>
   Robert McDonough's $30 million donation to the business school,
though, was the largest single gift in the university's history. In
the late 1960s, Bernard P. McDonough, the industrialist,
contributed $1 million, then the largest gift, to modernize the
school's law school campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just the third McDonough that came along,'' said Robert
McDonough, 76, no relation to the other two. The founder of
Remedytemp Inc. in Aliso Viejo, Calif., he graduated from
Georgetown's School of Foreign Service in 1949, before the business
school was created. When someone mentioned naming a school after
him, McDonough said ``it had a nice ring to it.'' And a mighty
familiar one.

SHOULD YOU BRISTLE AT THESE HEDGES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 8)

<P>
   It's not the sort of thing they are likely to trumpet in
newspaper ads or in 30-second television spots, but increasingly,
mutual fund companies are muscling into the hedge-fund business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last few years, we have seen mutual fund companies
launch an increasing number of hedge funds or hedge funds of
funds,'' said Lois Peltz, managing editor of Managed Account
Reports, a hedge fund newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, hedge funds are now being run by well-known mutual fund
companies like Franklin Templeton, Gabelli, Strong Capital
Management and Wellington Management, which runs several of the
Vanguard Group's mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge funds, investment vehicles for wealthy individuals and
institutions, have the flexibility to sell securities short,
betting that they will decline, or to borrow money, in order to
magnify returns; they can also use a variety of other tactics not
widely available to most mutual funds. Many hedge funds are based
offshore and are not available to American investors.
</P>
<P>
   Should mutual fund investors worry if their fund companies
introduce hedge funds? There are some sticky issues.
</P>
<P>
   A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services in
Summit, N.J., said mutual fund directors and investors should keep
a close eye on a mutual fund's performance if the manager is also
running a hedge fund. The issue is whether the manager will do as
good a job with the mutual fund when he can make more money from
the hedge fund; if the mutual fund's performance declines, he
added, ``the directors should refocus the manager back on the
mutual fund.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other issues, too. Independent hedge funds can sell
their holdings in a stock all at once, but if a hedge fund is part
of a mutual fund company, it generally must sell pari passu _ at an
equal pace _ with the company's mutual funds that hold the same
stock, constraining flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   And what if a company's hedge and mutual funds invest in the
same stocks and those stocks drop? Mutual fund investors, who can
withdraw money at any time, are likely to yank their cash first.
So, as the mutual fund jettisons a stock to meet redemptions, the
value of the stock may drop further, damaging the hedge fund's
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Hedge-fund investors, meanwhile, are generally locked in for at
least six months. According to one investor in the Robertson
Stephens Orphans Hedge fund, which holds illiquid stocks, its value
has fallen over the last 18 months fell as investors in the
Robertson Stephens Contrarian mutual fund, which holds similar
stocks, have been bailing. A spokeswoman for the funds was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these complexities, and the headline-grabbing troubles
of Long Term Capital Management and other hedge funds, mutual fund
companies are likely to keep introducing hedge funds as they seek
to increase fee income and economies of scale, and try to hold onto
sought-after managers.
</P>
<P>
   Rolling out hedge funds lets fund companies employ their core
strengths without much extra overhead. Fund managers on staff are
often all too happy to run a hedge fund on the side, as the pay,
often based on the total fees, can be lucrative. ``The reason
they're doing this is to keep their best managers in house,'' Ms.
Peltz said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, hedge funds get 1 percent of assets as well as 20
percent of gains above its previous high. By contrast, the median
fee on general equity mutual funds is 1.3 percent of assets,
according to Lipper.
</P>
<P>
   Just last August, State Street Research rolled out a hedge fund,
Small Cap Energy, whose . managers, Dan Rice and Tom Moore, also
run the State Street Research Global Resources mutual fund. So far,
the hedge fund has under $11.5 million in assets, compared with
$164 million in the mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   The prime difference, according to Robin Tice, a State Street
spokeswoman, is the mutual fund's broader portfolio, which also
includes natural resources companies. ``We started it because we
have expertise in managing energy and natural resources
investments,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If hedge funds are picking many of the same stocks held by
mutual funds, why pay the higher fees? One hedge-fund expert said
that if an investor believes in a manager, that investor may be
willing to take the hedge fund's additional risks of greater
leverage, or portfolio concentration, to get higher returns. And
hedge funds can invest in often-lucrative private partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance Capital is the biggest mutual fund newcomer in the
hedge-fund business. Since 1994, it has rolled out 13 hedge funds,
six domestic and seven offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Alliance executives are reluctant to talk about them. ``Hedge
funds are basically partnerships, and the SEC does not permit funds
to advertise,'' said Charles Schaffran, who oversees Alliance's
hedge funds. Newspaper interviews, he said, ``might be viewed as
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Some mutual fund companies say the experience of running hedge
funds can yield good investment ideas that are cross-fertilized
with their mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Gabelli, whose Gabelli &AMP; Co. manages 27 mutual funds, has
run risk-arbitrage hedge funds since 1985 and now runs a number of
other hedge funds. ``To the degree that our analyst Laura Lanahan
makes a comment about the Pulitzer merger with Hearst-Argyle, the
arbitrageurs would hitch on,'' he said.

 INVESTING WITH: WILLIAM H. GROSS OF PIMCO TOTAL RETURN FUND

<P>
   William H. Gross may never be popularly seen as challenging
Peter Lynch's or Warren Buffett's status as America's pre-eminent
market sages. After all, what are the chances of hitting investing
grand slams _ with their attendant publicity _ in boring old bonds?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they're quite good. So Gross is gathering as much
acclaim as a bond investor can hope for. Pimco Advisors Holdings,
his employer in Newport Beach, Calif., expects that by the end of
the month it will complete its own TV studio so Gross can better
accommodate the growing requests for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, 54, is portfolio manager of Pimco's Total Return fund,
which has ranked in the top percentile of its peers in virtually
all the standard return periods of the last decade, according to
Morningstar Inc., the Chicago financial publisher. This year, it
gained 8.7 percent through Oct. 31, compared with 6.3 percent for
its peer funds and 7.7 percent for its benchmark, the Lehman
Brothers Aggregate Bond Index. In the last decade, Total Return has
returned 10.26 percent, versus 7.5 percent for its peers and 9
percent for the index.
</P>
<P>
   Widely available to individuals only since last spring _ the
minimum investment, previously $1 million, is now $250 _ the fund
has ballooned to $22.69 billion, twice as large as its nearest
competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, convinced that financial and economic
contagion from Asia was proving more acute than widely recognized,
Gross swung from what he called a milquetoast bullish stance to
what became by summer a bold bet on lower rates. That was just in
time, as a safety-obsessed market drove down the yield on Treasury
securities, which moves in the opposite direction from prices. The
benchmark 30-year bond briefly touched 4.75 percent, the lowest
yield in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Then, about a month ago, Gross retreated a bit, cutting the
duration of his portfolio to a somewhat less aggressive 4.6 years,
from 5. (Duration refers to the average weighted life of all
payments related to a bond, interest as well as the return of
principal when it comes due. Maturity, which is usually longer than
duration, refers simply to the time before a bond is due.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a bit off the table,'' he said, adding that Total
Return was still primed for slight declines in rates over the next
six months _ perhaps to 5 percent, from the current 5.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of general bond portfolios usually adopt the
``top-down'' approach to investing, which gives the most weight to
economic trends. That is because bonds _ at least until recently _
have tended to move in tandem with economic forces.
</P>
<P>
   But to Gross, who contends that the timing of the next recession
is unknowable, there is more involved than just trying to plumb the
business cycle or the impact of distress in Asia. In what Gross
calls Pimco's ``super tops-down'' approach, he steps back to assess
longer-term fundamentals like the graying of the populations of
industrial countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things, like demographics, are known with almost complete
certainty,'' he said. The same, he added, goes for the trend toward
globalization and the worldwide buildup of corporate and government
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Besides deciding on a portfolio's proper duration, bond managers
must also fathom the yield curve _ the array of fixed-income rates
ranging from a matter of days to 30 years or more _ to determine
the best mix for producing that duration.
</P>
<P>
   One common approach, called the ``barbell,'' involves big
commitments to the short and long ends of the curve. That method is
attractive when the long-term sector is expected to do well
relative to intermediate-maturity bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the ``bullet'' _ a heavy concentration in
intermediates due, say, between 2 and 10 years _ a strategy toward
which Gross aggressively shifted the Total Return portfolio in July
and August.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main statements that the portfolio is making is
that it's fairly concentrated in intermediate maturities,'' Gross
said. ``The bullet strategy,'' he added, ``does well when the
Federal Reserve is in the market, so to speak, and is actively
lowering interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Before July, his portfolio had been in a half-barbell,
half-bullet position. That was before he perceived the Federal
Reserve as being seriously concerned about the possibility of a
global meltdown and likely to lower short-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   Total Return, which Gross calls a plain-vanilla bond fund, uses
no leverage, though some 20 percent of its Treasury portfolio is in
higher-returning futures. Because of quarterly expirations, they
tend to magnify the portfolio's turnover rate, which is 173
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Total Return could invest as much as 20 percent of its
portfolio overseas _ and half of this in emerging markets _ Gross
keeps foreign exposure to a minimum and says such holdings should
be confined to the highest possible quality. ``I've not had a
Russian bond and never will,'' said Gross, who is no stranger to
risk-taking: He played blackjack professionally in Las Vegas for
five months after college.
</P>
<P>
   He also doesn't much favor corporate issues these days, even
though this sector has improved lately after its problems helped
prompt the Federal Reserve to cut rates again last month, outside a
scheduled policy meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would continue to be leery about corporates,'' Gross said,
citing what he considers significant risk that they might go into
default in a recession. ``We're hunkering down and climbing into
the bomb shelter,'' he said, keeping to shorter maturities and
stressing high quality.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he added, corporate spreads and yields will become
more attractive, and that ``will be a better time to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is Gross' impact and reputation, however, that he must
shroud such decisions in CIA-like secrecy, using as many as 10
dealers, few if any of them privy to more than minimal information.
</P>
<P>
   He checks Bloomberg and Telerate monitors in his basement at
home before heading for work but doesn't take action before
reaching the office, usually by 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Duke University, Gross honed his
mathematical and analytical skills at the blackjack tables, where
he turned $200 into $10,000 by playing every day for 16 hours,
earning what today would be minimum wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the best,'' said Gross, a card counter who said
he has been thrown out of more than one casino. ``I proved a point,
that I could beat the system.''
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Navy, he intended to find a stock-market
job, but wound up as a credit analyst in the bond department of
Pacific Mutual Life Insurance, from which Pimco evolved. Now he's
the biggest owner of Pimco and the closest thing in the bond
business to a cult figure.
</P>
<P>
   Gross has relatively little involvement in Pimco's management, ,
though he was a co-founder. ``It's very difficult to manage a
business and run a portfolio at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This results in a relatively modest salary of $200,000, but he
makes many times that much in performance pay tied to Pimco's
bottom line. Because he isn't an executive, the amount is not found
in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   As for investing his personal fortune, which runs into nine
figures, Gross said the portion not in Pimco Advisors is mostly
invested in the Total Return fund and in municipal bonds that he
selects himself.
</P>
<P>
   Something else he has been doing is buying more stock, actually
partnership interests, in his own company, Pimco Advisors Holdings,
traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Pimco, growing at 15 percent a year, has a bond-like yield,
largely because it pays no corporate-level income tax, which is
levied against investors. But it provides a way for anybody to bet
on Gross' continued success with bonds, about half Pimco's total
business, while being well paid in the interim.

 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, raising money for a minor communications company
was almost as easy as, well, picking up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the global credit crunch slammed the
junk-bond window shut late this summer. Even a month ago, the idea
of a small company finding buyers for high-yield, high-risk debt
seemed ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that window is opening again, but phone companies are
paying dearly for investors' cash. It's all a lesson in the
potential perils of relying on borrowed money, a lesson that some
small phone companies have been learning the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   ``At its depth, the market correction in high-yield was far more
dramatic than that of the equity market,'' said Lawrence R.
Buchalter, who runs the high-yield underwriting group at Goldman,
Sachs. ``It was very deep and very broad and it was relatively long
as these things go, the better part of 10 weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two weeks,'' he added, ``this market has gone from
ice-cold to red-hot, given the momentum in the equity markets and
because of the accommodating position of the Federal Reserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The market has also been propelled by strong flows of cash into
funds that buy bonds. For the week ended last Monday, high-yield
mutual funds had inflows of $745 million, according to estimates
from Trimtabs.com Investment Research, which tracks flows into and
out of mutual funds. That was about 43 percent more than the
previous week and 135 percent more than the week before that.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, not every communications carrier is finding financing.
Especially squeezed are little players like Telegroup and USN
Communications. Telegroup was actually preparing a bond offering in
August just as the bottom fell out of the market. Other companies
that were not able to tap the debt market over the summer included
Chase Telecommunications, Worldport Communications and Worldxchange
Communications, according to executives involved in the high-yield
market. Those companies have remained shut out.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, USN, based in Chicago, said it would eliminate 46
percent of its work force, or about 650 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very challenging capital markets have prevented USN from
securing capital at this time,'' J. Thomas Elliott, chairman of
USN, said in a statement. ``Therefore, it is necessary to scale
back the company's business, particularly the direct sales force,
in order for the company to focus on serving its existing customer
base as USN continues its efforts to secure new capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Life was a lot easier for the USN's of the world earlier this
year. Consider Esprit Telecom Group of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Esprit, a small phone company, agreed to acquire
Plusnet, a small German carrier, for about $180 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that acquiring Plusnet would use up most of Esprit's
cash. Esprit's advisers assured the company that it would be able
to replenish its coffers in a high-yield deal. Sure enough, on June
19, a mere four days after completing the Plusnet acquisition,
Esprit announced that it had raised about $230 million with bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Access to capital is crucial for small communications carriers,
even when they are not buying one another. Communications
entrepreneurs must often invest hundreds of millions of dollars in
new networks before they can sign up their first customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has really been high-yield that got us all into business,''
said William J. Rouhana Jr., chairman of Winstar Communications, a
wireless company. Seeking additional financing, Winstar recently
arranged to borrow up to $2 billion from Lucent Technologies, from
which it buys equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In the current climate, Esprit might have been able to pull off
the same high-yield deal it did in June, but it surely would have
paid significantly more for the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Esprit guaranteed the buyers of its dollar-denominated
bonds an interest rate of 10.875 percent _ or what was then 533.5
basis points more than the rates paid by Treasuries of the same
maturity. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
Esprit's bonds are now given a very speculative Caa1 rating by
Moody's Investors Service, the bond rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, when Telewest Communications, a British company
about 10 times Esprit's size in market value, issued debt in the
United States two weeks ago, it did so at 11.25 percent, or 668
basis points higher than Treasury bonds. And with a Moody's rating
of B1, those bonds are three notches higher than Esprit's.
</P>
<P>
   At least Telewest was able to do its deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be very real appetite for the proven,
higher-quality, more liquid names,'' said Michael B. Nechamkin, an
analyst for Bankers Trust. ``If you take one step down, there is
still a little demand. But the deals that were being done in the
February-March part of this year, the very speculative deals, could
not be done today.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives involved in the high-yield market pointed to deals in
the spring for Covad Communications Group, Convergent
Communications and Firstworld Communications as the sort that would
be difficult to pull off now.
</P>
<P>
   Between March 6 and April 6, each of those companies issued
between $160 million and $470 million in debt at interest rates
from 737 to 779 basis points above Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those sorts of companies would traditionally have gone to
venture capitalists,'' one big high-yield player said. ``But early
this year the credit markets would fund them, and they were
essentially doing venture capital dressed up like bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not happening any more. Few people are in a better
position to know that than Donald Sturm, Firstworld's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still not back to where it was at the beginning of the
year,'' he said. ``The little guy is still shut out.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the increased rigor of the underwriting process is
not a bad thing for investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that you could get financing by saying, `If we
build it, they will come, and profits will follow at some point,'
'' said John M. Scanlon, chief executive of Global Crossing Ltd., a
new international communications carrier. ``Now you've got to be
ready to show a profit really quick.''

STOCK MARKET ENJOYS THE `JOHN GLENN RALLY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market has spoken. Its tidings: Happy days
are here again.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday's close, most broad market measures were either
close to their summer highs or at them. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed the week at 8,975.46, up 59.99 points for the day
and 4.46 percent for the week. That places the Dow only 3.8 percent
below its July 17 peak and up 19 percent from its Aug. 31 low. For
the year, the Dow is up a respectable 13.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Big-capitalization stocks that make up the Dow average are not
the only ones moving up. The Wilshire 5000 index, the best
approximation for the entire U.S. stock market, has shown an even
better performance. It has jumped 21 percent from its Oct. 8 low,
and is up 12.4 percent for the year. Friday, the Wilshire had a
value of $11.5 trillion. In about one month, the value of the index
has risen more than $2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the market has gone eight sessions without a down
day, its second example of such durability in less than one month.
But extended moves like these are unusual: to find a third example
of such staying power requires a trip back to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What's fueling this move? Traders and strategists point to
several disparate factors.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, perhaps, is a sea change in monetary policy
not just domestically but around the world. Central banks,
beginning with the Federal Reserve back in September and extending
to Britain, Latin America and parts of Asia, have been reducing
interest rates fairly aggressively. According to Jeffrey Applegate,
chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, since the September
rate cut by the Fed, 27 central banks have done the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last month and a half, the global policy outlook has
improved,'' Applegate said. ``Then this week we had a slew of data
that was stock-market friendly. I think the fear trade is out of
the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates are almost always a tonic for stocks
largely because they mean reduced borrowing costs _ and the
potential for higher profit margins _ for corporations. So it is
not surprising that historically, a cut in the discount rate _ the
Fed's borrowing rate for banks _ is followed by an average 12-month
increase in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index of 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks have been getting an additional lift from a giant
increase in the money supply. According to Ian Shepherdson, chief
U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., the
broadest measure of money supply, known as M-2, which includes
currency in circulation, savings accounts and money market mutual
funds, has grown by 2.5 percent in the last two months. The
annualized rate for the last three months is 9.3 percent, the
fastest annual expansion since 1987. ``This tells me that there
isn't a credit crunch,'' Shepherdson said. ``And all this liquidity
sloshing around has got to go somewhere.'' That somewhere appears
to be the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in the money supply comes basically from the Fed
providing reserves to the banking system, which banks use to lend.
``New lending and investing power is created as money turnover
speeds,'' said Robert Parks, an economist and consultant to
institutional investors in Scarborough, N.Y. ``It brings increased
spending power that can go into stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Another supply of money coming into stocks is from investors
selling Treasury holdings in recent days. When Russia effectively
defaulted on its debt in August, Treasuries became the darling of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   No more. The price of the 30-year bond has tumbled this week.
Its yield, which rises when the price falls, ended at 5.38 percent,
up from 5.15 percent a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting, if somewhat obscure, reason for the advance in
equities may be the decline in stock volatility recently.
Volatility _ basically the range from high to low in stocks during
the trading day _ peaked on Oct. 15. Applegate notes that since
1948, the S&AMP;P 500 has risen an average 12 percent in the
twelve-month period after a peak in volatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the policy outlook continues to look good, then
risk aversion should come down, volatility should come down and
returns should come up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the stock market is clearly enjoying the recent spate
of good news, it is choosing to shrug off some troubling
indicators. Corporate earnings, for example. While all the earnings
announcements are not quite in for the third quarter, the period
was a disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Even though many analysts have focused on the positive
announcements, those were a distinct minority. According to John
Manley Jr., equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, of the 428
companies that have reported third-quarter results, fewer than 36
percent recorded a positive surprise. Manley defines a positive
surprise as a company that reports a result greater than the
consensus estimate on Wall Street one month before the quarter
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Neither do stocks seem to care that it is becoming increasingly
likely that the Fed's policy-making committee will not cut rates at
its Nov. 17 meeting. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, said on
Thursday that investors and lenders appear less fearful than they
had been. If the deep freeze in the credit markets is indeed
beginning to thaw, as Greenspan seems to believe, another quick
rate cut is less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are calling the recent moves in stocks the John
Glenn rally. After all, since Glenn blasted off from Cape
Canaveral, the market has rallied nearly 10 percent. As long as he
has been in orbit, so has the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn returns to earth Saturday. Investors clearly hope the
stock market does not follow suit.

NEW ITEMS ON THE ECONOMY AND COMPANIES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ramifications of the most surprising midterm election in recent
memory are still sinking in. Even as the voters were yawning at
Washington's yearlong obsession with the president's sex life, they
opened a host of unexpected new questions about the future
political climate for business and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The most urgent issue for the financial services industry is the
likely ascent of Phil Gramm of Texas to the chairmanship of the
Senate Banking Committee, replacing Alfonse M. D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's single-handed killing of a bill that would have repealed
Depression-era restrictions like the Glass-Steagall Act, and his
past penchant for clashing with Arthur Levitt Jr., chairman of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, are seen on Wall Street as
omens of a coming era of partisanship and contention on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing of congressional Republicans, usually seen as
friendlier to business interests than Democrats, raised the specter
of leadership battles that may distract lawmakers almost as much as
the Lewinsky matter has.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the voters' endorsement of candidates identified
with campaign finance reform, especially Sen. Russell D. Feingold
of Wisconsin, seemed to increase the odds that restrictions on
``soft money'' donations will be enacted by the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Entrepreneurs made little headway as candidates, losing to
sitting governors in New York (Thomas Golisano of Paychex, a
payroll services company) and New Hampshire (Jay Lucas, who runs a
management consultancy). Georgia voters turned away business
founders: Michael Coles of the Great American Cookie Co., for the
Senate, and Guy Millner of Norrell, a temporary-help agency, for
governor (his second failed bid). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Had enough of ``interesting times''? They may be abating for a
while. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the
Securities Industry Association on Thursday what many analysts have
been observing: Investors and lenders seem to be calming down after
weeks of turmoil, easing the threat of a credit crunch and reducing
market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Streeters took his remarks to mean that there is now
less chance of further interest rate cuts, since the Fed explained
the last round by citing investor jitters and the need for market
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
   But an economic case for a rate cut gathered strength when the
October employment report showed the economy gradually cooling, job
growth slowing and wages up only slightly. The Fed survey known as
the beige book report also found growth slowing; the index of
leading indicators remained flat in September. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   October turned out to be one of the strongest months in the car
industry's history, with big sales gains in the United States
market for nearly every auto maker. Over all, consumers bought 1.37
million cars and light trucks last month, nearly 10 percent more
than in October 1997; Chrysler's 20 percent sales increase led the
league.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest surprise may have been General Motors, which
rebounded from summer strikes faster than analysts had expected,
selling 6 percent more vehicles than in the same month last year.
Why such strong sales? Low interest rates and cheap gasoline might
be the reasons. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Citigroup had a president-troubleshooter to make its
founding merger play out smoothly and an ambitious pilot project to
test consumer acceptance of electronic cash. Now both are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup's Citibank and its partner in the venture, Chase
Manhattan, scrapped their smart-card experiment on Manhattan's
Upper West Side because the 100,000 customers who were given the
cards proved disinclined to use them instead of currency to make
cash purchases at local merchants, and merchants were dropping out
in droves.
</P>
<P>
   Tests elsewhere have also collapsed, raising the question of
whether the hyped ``future of money'' has a future.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds gathered around the future of the Citicorp-Travelers
merger as well. The company's co-chairmen, Sanford I. Weill and
John S. Reed, responded to growing friction in their executive
ranks and mounting merger-related losses by asking for the
resignation of the man they had detailed to make it all work, James
E. Dimon, the company's president and heir apparent. Some analysts
expect Dimon's departure to set off a wave of resignations and
turmoil at the company. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SO TO SPEAK &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Check the Calendar &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some human brains seem to be having as much trouble with the
impending turn of the millennium as date-impaired computers are
expected to.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports in Nairobi, the government of Kenya
last week announced the establishment of a commission to study the
Year 2000 problem in the country, with instructions to issue a
report in 18 months _ April 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In Sacramento, meanwhile, Alan and Lori Dechert have applied for
trademark protection for a millennium-bug fix, ``the world's only
year zero calendar,'' and offered a draft resolution that they hope
governments will adopt declaring the year after 1999 to be 0 of the
Global Era.

`THE VIEW': A TALK SHOW FOR AN INDELICATE AGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 8) 
(bl) 
 By NANCY HASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An exchange many viewers probably never expected to
hear from the likes of Meredith Vieira and Barbara Walters occurred
the other day on network television.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vieira, a former ``60 Minutes'' correspondent, described how
her husband used computer lingo when they were having sex. Ms.
Walters, far from being tipped off-balance, came back with an
Internet double entendre of her own.
</P>
<P>
   If it seemed that television couldn't possibly get more surreal
in the age of presidential testimony about a White House affair,
here comes ``The View,'' ABC's salty, year-old talk show on which
dialogue as unexpected as this takes place regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially an unscripted kaffeeklatsch with five bright, brash
women representing different generations, the show is one of
network television's most unlikely hits.
</P>
<P>
   After a slow start in its first season, ratings in the past few
months have jumped by 50 percent among traditional daytime viewers
_ young mothers, older people and the unemployed. But what's even
more surprising is that it has gained something of a cult
following, watched in gyms and coffee shops, and taped for later
viewing by people who are not traditional daytime watchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday Night Live,'' which has been lampooning ``The View''
in a recurring skit since late last year, already counts the
routine among its classics. ``It's great material for us, because
we really don't have to heighten the reality much to make it
absurd,'' said Tina Fey, one of the writers who created the sketch.
She knew ``The View'' was ripe for parody the moment she saw Ms.
Vieria give Wesley Snipes a spontaneous lap dance on air.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Halloween parade in Greenwich Village featured a
bevy of drag queens decked out as the women of ``The View,'' and
they received enthusiastic cheers from parade spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the layered-on glitter of daytime television, it's easy
to imagine the women of ``The View'' as co-workers at, say, a Long
Island insurance firm, who after work go out to talk frankly over
margaritas. ``It works because these are women whom the viewers
wish they could hang out with,'' said Garth Ancier, the president
for entertainment at the WB network, who created ``The Ricki Lake
Show.'' ``They're just a little funnier and a little more
glamorous. But not too much more.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 11 a.m. time slot, the show's ratings are crushing the
talk shows of Sally Jessy Raphael, Roseanne and Montel Williams in
New York, and it is running neck-and-neck with Jerry Springer's
show, at the opposite, darker end of the daytime spectrum. ``The
View'' was nominated for eight Emmys last year and won three.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe every generation gets the talk shows it deserves. ``My
parents had Phil Donahue,'' said David Chen, 20, a film student at
New York University. ``It was all about sensitivity. Whereas we
have `The View.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The View'' is unlikely to be accused of sensitivity. This is
surprising, considering it is the brainchild of Ms. Walters, a
woman known more for her telegenic empathy than for her love of a
bawdy good time. In fact, in the pantheon of daytime talk, from
Oprah Winfrey's do-it-yourself spirituality to Rosie O'Donnell's
child-friendly tour of Broadway, ``The View'' is as smart and salty
as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the women on ``The View,'' all handpicked by Ms.
Walters, plays an amplified version of herself. They were chosen
not only for their on-camera charm but for the different decades
and social backgrounds they represent, in an effort to appeal to a
wide female audience.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Behar, a comedian, is a divorced single mother in her 50s.
Ms. Vieira is a 44-year-old married working mother. Star Jones is a
flamboyant, 36-year-old single black woman. Debbie Matenopoulos,
23, is an NYU graduate with long legs and a tattoo. Ms. Walters
herself, who appears on the set a few times a week when her
schedule permits, appeals to the 60-plus demographic.
</P>
<P>
   As stagy as the show sometimes may seem to be, there is
undeniable chemistry: by all accounts, the stars get along well in
real life. Of course, for all of them except Ms. Walters, the
bonhomie is heightened by their quick rise from relative obscurity
to the big time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty great job,'' said Ms. Behar, who after a
decade on the stand-up circuit and as host of a radio show on WABC
recently completed a wit-and-wisdom book, ``Joy Schtick''
(Hyperion). Ms. Jones, capitalizing on her newfound visibility,
recently released an autobiography, ``You Have to Stand for
Something, or You'll Fall Down,'' (Bantam).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vieira, the group's quasi-moderator, is alternately corny
and self-mocking. Ms. Jones, every inch the plus-size diva (her
term), veers from warm to sarcastic. Ms. Behar, who is the most
comfortable on stage, insures that the conversation never gets too
saccharine. Ms. Matenopoulos plays the dopey kid who needs life
lessons and occasionally deserves a bop on the head (which she gets
on the ``Saturday Night Live'' parody skits). Ms. Walters is the
mom, simultaneously encouraging and reproving, trying to be hip,
but ultimately a bit of a prude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do get a little embarrassed sometimes about what we say, and
I worry that it's going over the top,'' she said on a recent
morning after the show as the phalanx of hair and makeup artists
who trail her like a Secret Service detail finally cleared. She
tries to maintain her image as a ``serious journalist,'' she said,
by not participating in the show's more personal moments, as when
the group shared stories of losing their virginity. ``I make it
look like I'm sharing,'' she said, a little conspiratorially, ``but
I'm actually just moving the focus to the others.'' Still, she
said, ``people don't realize how much I get a kick out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The View'' trots out the usual celebrities, most of whom Ms.
Walters interviews solo with her usual soft-focus style. And
there's a viewer-service section during the last 20 minutes,
dealing with subjects like ``How to Love Only the One You're
With,'' and the pros and cons of Botox injections.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the first 15 minutes of ``The View'' that has the most
verve. That's when ``the ladies,'' as everyone behind the scenes
calls them, sit around the kitchen table of their elaborate
``shabby chic'' set and gab about the morning headlines. It's
similar to the signature loose-patter opener of ``Live With Regis
and Kathie Lee,'' which plays on a monitor in their makeup room.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show's producers brief the hosts on the topics to
be discussed and arm them with factoids culled from the morning
newspapers, the conversation is unrehearsed. Although it is often
frothy banter, it can also be unexpectedly intelligent. At its
best, the talk is a collision of contrivance and spontaneity: racy,
sly, dizzyingly anarchic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A case in point: after DNA confirmation of Thomas Jefferson's
affair with his slave Sally Hemmings, the conversation centered on
how the report might affect impeachment proceedings. Ms. Walters
laid out why the parallels to the Clinton case were shaky,
elucidated some constitutional issues and contended that President
Clinton's indiscretion was worse because he was married.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones, obviously appalled, took issue. ``She was a slave,
Barbara,'' she said, cutting off her boss without a smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read about all this this morning,'' Ms. Walters continued,
gliding past the remark. ``I didn't want you to think I knew it all
before, though I could have pretended.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vieira, not missing a beat, took a potshot at her senior
colleague: ``Well, you were around then.''
</P>
<P>
   The conversation may not be ``Nightline'' or even ``Letterman,''
but it covers topics more sophisticated than ``my boyfriend is
sleeping with my sister,'' a staple of daytime television.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a difficult line to walk,'' said Jessica
Stedman-Guff, a senior producer of ``The View.'' ``We want to be
smart, but you run the risk of alienating the audience if you're,
well, not upbeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Walters is the first to admit it may seem strange that after
working so hard to build a prestigious career as a journalist, she
would return to the daytime ghetto, where she started out as a
co-host of the ``Today'' show. Some of her friends, she concedes,
thought she was ``well, nutty'' to dabble in daytime. ``This time
slot had been a disaster for the network, and so they came to me
and asked me if I had an idea for a daytime show, and it just so
happened I did. The news department didn't want me to do it, but I
didn't listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Her inspiration for ``The View'' was ``Girltalk,'' an early
1960s show starring Virginia Graham, and the last few minutes of
``This Week'' when David Brinkley was the host. ``People just sat
around chatting smartly,'' Ms. Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   A powerhouse at 68, Ms. Walters still does two shows of
``20-20'' each week, which is scheduled to expand to three once
``Monday Night Football'' ends. She also does four specials a year.
``The View'' takes three hours a day at least three days a week, a
big chunk of her time.
</P>
<P>
   On the days she's not on the show, Ms. Walters still exerts
control from afar. She often relays directions mid-show even when
she's in one of her other offices or just away from the set for few
moments. During a recent show, during a short segment that didn't
include her, Ms. Walters was in the green room with her eyes on the
monitor when she relayed a message, from her assistant to a
producer in the control room to Ms. Jones' tiny ear prompt: ``Tell
Star to get to the point,'' Ms. Walters instructed in a clipped
tone.
</P>
<P>
   An instant later, Ms. Jones interrupted her guest. ``Let me get
to the point,'' she said with a flourish. ``Perfect,'' Ms. Walters
said.
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to think of ``The View'' as a mere bagatelle for
Ms. Walters, something she will soon tire of. But in fact it may
turn out to be her idea of a condo in Palm Beach, a nice place to
spend time when she's ready to slow down. ``Chasing the `big get'
is really exhausting,'' she said. ``Maybe this is what I'd like to
do down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage at ``The View,'' its appeal is evident. The scene is
as warm and as girly _ and as crazed _ as a sorority house on a
Saturday night. Just moments before air time, in a cloud of powder
and hairspray, ``the ladies'' dash between the makeup room and
their dressing rooms. (Ms. Jones' is outfitted like a boudoir, Ms.
Matenopoulos' is a dorm disaster of rumpled clothes topped by a
yellow skateboard. Ms. Walters' looks as bare as a motel room).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vieira, who dashes in late because she actually is the
conscientious mom she plays on the show, slides into a makeup chair
and is swallowed up by a gang of hairdressers. (``The View'' won an
Emmy last year for best hair.) A costumer, Fran Taylor, coaxes Ms.
Jones into a maroon ensemble to offset Ms. Walters brown suit. Ms.
Matenopoulos, her blond streaked hair being teased with an inch of
its life, is given a crash course on John Glenn's first historic
mission by a segment producer. (``Trust me, it was amazing,'' the
producer says.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Debbie, darling, how's the cold?'' asked Ms. Walters, frowning
slightly at her stubby nails and iridescent light blue polish.
``Much, much, much, much better,'' said Ms. Matenopoulos, lunging
out of the makeup chair to chase Ms. Walters around for a bear hug.
It's a ritual they seem to have enacted before.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine Ms. Walters doing that with Hugh Downs.
``You're so silly,'' Ms. Walters says. It takes her a moment to
regain her composure, the calm smile bouncing back to her lips out
of sheer instinct. ``Now'' she said, pulling the edge of her suit
jacket back into place, ``Ladies, let's behave. At least a
little.''

LAWYERS FOR CLINTON AND JONES SAY DEAL IS STILL POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Advisers to both Paula Jones and the White House
said Friday they believed it was still possible to agree to a
settlement sometime in the next few weeks in which she would
withdraw her sexual misconduct lawsuit against the president.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts to end the lawsuit have become increasingly
confused, as Mrs. Jones' lawyers and various sets of her advisers
have feuded over strategy. The lawyers who have represented her in
court called President Clinton's lawyer Thursday morning and
offered to withdraw the case if Clinton paid her $950,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the negotiations said Friday that Robert
Bennett, Clinton's attorney, did not accept the offer. He also told
Mrs. Jones' lawyers that under contract law, their new offer meant
that the president's previous offer of $700,000 was no longer on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the White House response, sources in the Clinton
camp said, was to slow down the negotiations but not to end them.
Discussions could resume in the next few weeks, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, large hurdles remain, said lawyers and advisers for
both sides, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The White
House is deeply wary of any agreement with Mrs. Jones that would be
connected to a $1 million offer from Abe Hirschfeld, a New York
real estate developer, perennial political candidate and one-time
owner of the New York Post who is under indictment in Manhattan for
tax fraud.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether Thursday's $950,000 offer was part of
a deal that would have included Hirschfeld's money.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones has hoped to fashion a large settlement package by
adding whatever she is able to get from Clinton to Hirschfeld's $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers from Dallas and Charlottesville, Va., who have
represented Mrs. Jones in court have said that they plan to
withdraw soon from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Carpenter McMillan, a California woman who has befriended
Mrs. Jones and has served as an adviser, said Thursday she believed
it was improper of Mrs. Jones' lawyers to attempt to negotiate with
Clinton if they were planning to withdraw from the case. Asked who
should represent Mrs. Jones in discussions with the White House,
Ms. McMillan replied: ``Bill McMillan,'' her husband, an attorney
who has also been advising Mrs. Jones.

IN WIDE-RANGING REBOUND, BIG LOSERS BOUNCE THE MOST 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sharp run-up in the stock market over the last
month, which has returned the Dow Jones industrial average to
within striking distance of the 9,000 level, has given almost every
major stock group big gains.
</P>
<P>
   The major exception is utility stocks, which had climbed earlier
with Treasury bonds as a refuge from global market uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The fears of a bear market that seemed so palpable in early
October now seem almost forgotten. The U.S. economy continues to
grow; the overseas turmoil, the market seems to have decided, will
be contained.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're celebrating is an absence of disaster,'' said
Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit Suisse
First Boston. ``The consensus view had been entertaining something
that was very close to a full-fledged recession. That's now
unlikely to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines were among the standout performers, soaring 37 percent
in the period, benefiting from low oil prices, heavy bookings and
reports of buoyant third-quarter profits.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in money-center banks, battered through the summer from
losses in emerging markets and then exposure to hedge funds, have
rebounded 35.4 percent since Oct. 8, the day both the Dow
industrials and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 hit their early-autumn
lows.
</P>
<P>
   And auto shares advanced 33.3 percent in the period as sales
proved remarkably resilient in the face of evidence that consumer
confidence was declining.
</P>
<P>
   The volatile technology sector was another stellar performer,
with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index racing ahead by 45.3
percent. Intel climbed 1 7/16 Friday, to 95 7/16, hitting a record.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of capital goods companies climbed 24.3 percent, as
gauged by a Standard &AMP; Poor's index, reflecting investor
reassurance that the economy would continue to expand, analysts
said. Caterpillar, which traded below 40 in late September,
finished Friday at 49\.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, utility shares, outstanding defensive
performers during the summer, slumped 4.4 percent during the last
four weeks. Energy stocks fared a little better, with a 2.7 percent
gain during this period.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's activity produced a gain for the Dow industrials of
59.99 points, or seven-tenths of 1 percent, bringing the index to
8,975.46. This left it 3.8 percent below the July 17 record of
9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   Merck, up 3, to 144 15/16, and accounting for 20 percent of the
Dow's rise, led a powerful drug group, with Bristol-Myers Squibb,
Eli Lilly and Schering-Plough also gaining more than two points
each. The drug group is now up 18 percent since Oct. 8.

   The stars seem to have fallen back into alignment for Abby
Joseph Cohen, the Goldman, Sachs investment strategist. Ms. Cohen,
the bard of the bull market, was promoted to partner at her firm
last month. And, for the first time since summer, her relentlessly
upbeat forecasts for stock prices seem in tune with investor
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen was literally bouncing on her feet last week at the
annual meeting of the Securities Industry Association in Boca
Raton, Fla., as she spoke of rising potential even for battered
sectors of the economy, like semiconductors and energy.
</P>
<P>
   She stuck by her forecast of 9,300 for the Dow Jones industrial
average by year-end, and 1,150 for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500,
targets now clearly in striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she said the gloomiest people these days tend to work
in her industry, finance, which has been hit harder than most by
the turmoil in world markets. Any lasting negative effects could
well be limited ``to lower Manhattan,'' she said, referring, of
course, to Wall Street. For everyone else, her message is simple:
``This bull market is equities is not over.'' &QL;

   Partnership shares in the Boston Celtics, which are relatively
thinly traded on the New York Stock Exchange, have jumped 25.4
percent during the two weeks ended Friday, to $10.50, without
benefit of any corporate developments, raising hopes of fans, not
to mention investors, who have watched the stock fall as low as $7
after a reorganization in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be some optimism about a resolution'' of the labor
dispute, said Andrew Zimbalist, a professor at Smith College and a
consultant to the NBA's players. Then again, he added, the stock's
climb may be a reaction to possibly undue pessimism related to the
reorganization. Or just a revived popularity of small-cap stocks in
general.
</P>
<P>
   Even though teams are being paid by broadcasters when no games
are being played _ the season was to have begun on Election Day _ a

</P>
<P>
   Lots of investors complain about high mutual fund fees and the
poor job that fund companies do of disclosing them. But Harold R.
Evensky, the ubiquitously quoted financial adviser in Coral Gables,
Fla., wants to make a federal case of it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Evensky said he planned to send Congress a statement,
signed by at least 200 financial advisers, that slams fund
companies on the fee issue. The move follows Evensky's
congressional testimony in September on fund fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm required to tell my clients how much money they've paid me
each quarter,'' Evensky said. ``I don't see why funds shouldn't
have to do that also.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement will be sent to the House subcommittee on finance
and hazardous materials. The hazardous materials under the
subcommittee's purview apparently do not include any of the last
quarter's poorly performing mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   Evensky's missive on fees might not be a one-shot deal. ``We
want to start a dialogue and bring public attention to this and
other important mutual fund topics that tend not to get
addressed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other fund-related topics that Evensky hopes to address include
tax efficiency and interfund lending.

 &HT;    Yudof wrestles with change
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Will he be able to ``pin down'' the governor on
university funding? How's his piledriver? Would he prefer to be
called ``Macho Mark'' or ``Malevolent Mark''?
</P>
<P>
   University of Minnesota President Mark Yudof says the e-mail
messages began pouring in as soon as retired pro wrestler and
Reform Party candidate Jesse Ventura _ formerly known as ``The
Body'' _ was elected governor of Minnesota. Ventura's unlikely
triumph attracted national attention, and Yudof's friends all
wanted to know how the former University of Texas provost and Law
School dean was going to deal with the new governor, who now goes
by the moniker ``The Mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Yudof's answer: Very respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very large man,'' said the university president, who's
a good deal shorter and rounder than the state's muscle-bound chief
executive-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Yudof, who left the University of Texas in 1997, met Ventura
when they appeared on the same television show during the campaign,
but he hasn't spoken to him since. Based on that meeting, Yudof
described the governor-elect as intelligent ``not in a bookish sort
of way, but in a street-smart kind of way.'' He said Ventura was
``somewhat brusque,'' with an ``aggressive style of
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells you exactly what he thinks,'' Yudof said. ``If he
thinks something's a stupid idea, he'll tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yudof said higher education wasn't a prominent issue in the
campaign, and he isn't sure what Ventura's views are on the
subject. The governor-elect's own higher education consisted of a
year at Minnesota's North Hennepin Community College in 1974-75,
where he played football and participated in the drama program. To
celebrate his victory, the college has set up a 40-foot lighted
sign outside its entrance with the message ``Jesse The Mind studied
here _ Congratulations, Governor Ventura.''
</P>
<P>
   Yudof says he's trying to set up a meeting with Ventura to
discuss financing issues, but he's hopeful the new governor will
continue the state's recent trend of generosity toward the
university. Yudof said some Minnesotans are ecstatic about
Ventura's victory, some are ``scared to death,'' and some are
adopting a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macho Mark'' is in the third camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really going to be interesting,'' he said.

HOLIDAY VIGIL FOR FEDEX CUSTOMERS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8)

   If the pilots at Federal Express carry out their threat to
strike during the holiday shipping season, it won't be just
traditional mail-order houses that are grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Noah's Ark Original Deli in Teaneck, N.J., ships potato knishes
and rugelach around the world by Federal Express. Customers place
orders through its online catalogue (www.noahsark.net), which is
run by Federal Express for the deli.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ship rugelach to Puerto Rico, Hawaii, everywhere,'' said
David Sokolow, manager of Noah's Ark. ``People have to get their
fix.''
</P>
<P>
   To bind customers like Noah's Ark more closely to them, Federal
Express, like United Parcel Service and other carriers, has gone
far beyond dropping off a stack of shipping labels. Large and small
companies have hitched their business to its technology and
logistics services.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express provides terminals to print shipping labels and
software to manage packages from assembly line to customer.
</P>
<P>
   All that automation could make it harder for customers to switch
carriers if members of the Fedex Pilots Association approve a
strike authorization requested by union management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's set up for Fedex,'' Sokolow said while serving
pastrami to the in-store lunch trade. ``If worse comes to worst,
we'll take the orders through Fedex, and ship them out U.P.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of the strike vote are expected in the first week of
December, just in time for the union's board of directors to
authorize a holiday-disrupting strike. The two sides are deadlocked
over pay.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express executives have issued warnings that the company
is on the verge of losing the business of several major shippers
during the holiday season because of the strike threat.
</P>
<P>
   Customers have been asking for firm assurances that Federal
Express, a unit of the FDX Corp., would be able to deliver, said
Theodore Wiese, the chief executive of Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Clement, a spokesman for the pilots who fly the 326 Federal
Express jets, said the warnings were a typical ``union busting''
ploy meant to bring pressure on the union to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Express' customers include the many of the country's
largest direct retailers and even the General Services
Administration. But unlike smaller companies like Noah's Ark, the
giants are not expressing much worry over the strike threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't envision a major disruption,'' said John Oliver, a
spokesman for L.L. Bean, which ships just 2 percent of its orders
by Federal Express. Recreational Equipment Inc., a Seattle-based
seller of outdoor gear and clothing, says it is watching the
situation closely and making contingency plans, but expects to have
no trouble getting its goods delivered.
</P>
<P>
   The strike threat reinforces a lesson customers learned last
year, when UPS drivers walked out for 15 days: Relying on a single
carrier can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the pilots, none of Federal Express' workers are
unionized. If the pilots strike, the rest of the employees are
expected to keep working, and the company says it will be able to
lease aircraft and flight crews from other companies and increase
reliance on ground transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fedex customers don't know or care whether their packages move
on a plane or a truck,'' said Gregory M. Rossiter, a Federal
Express spokesman. ``But any significant concern about our ability
to be reliable or dependable might force a customer to seek
additional means of shipping.''
</P>
<P>
   Those additional means are likely to be scarce around the
holidays, the busiest time of year, when even the biggest carrier,
UPS, has little spare capacity. ``There won't be room in the
lifeboats,'' said Paul Schlesinger, transportation analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette in Manhattan.

<P>
   John Olson, an engineer at General Electric Co., was
hospitalized for depression for four months in 1991. Soon after he
returned to his job at the company's astrospace unit, he was laid
off in a widespread downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   When a similar position at GE Astrospace, which ultimately
became part of Lockheed Martin Corp., opened up a year later,
Olson, still unemployed, applied. Although he was told, he said,
that he would be recommended for the job, he did not get it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, six years, three federal court opinions and thousands of
lawyers' hours later, Olson is finally set to go to trial. An
appeals court ruled that he had a claim that he was entitled to
pursue _ not because he was mentally disabled under federal law but
because the company might have discriminated by treating him as if
he were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very stigmatizing thing,'' Olson said. ``You don't want
to let your co-workers know'' about mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   With his case scheduled for a jury trial in U.S. District Court
in Camden, N.J., in January, he said, he wants to make it easier
``for other people who have been discriminated against for
suffering from depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Olson's case shows what a legal quagmire is taking shape. Until
now, some plaintiffs like him have been caught in a no-win
situation: They must show that they are qualified for the job in
question, but when they do, courts often rule that they are not
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrific Catch-22,'' said Chai Feldblum, a law
professor at Georgetown University Law Center who was instrumental
in drafting the Americans With Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   But guidelines issued last year by the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission and a recent Supreme Court opinion could
help employees escape that double bind and win more cases.
</P>
<P>
   And there is an explosion of litigation. ``It's one of the
fastest-growing areas of employment law,'' said James McDonald Jr.
of Fisher &AMP; Phillips in Newport Beach, Calif., who represents
management in employment matters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the EEOC recorded 91 complaints of discrimination on
the basis of emotional or psychiatric impairment, or 9.1 percent of
all disability claims.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, with the number of mental disability claims
skyrocketing, that had jumped to 2,789, or 15.3 percent, making
this, for the first time ever, the largest single category of
claims. Complaints outnumbered those related to HIV, cancer,
substance abuse, vision, hearing and diabetes-related disabilities
combined. And preliminary numbers for fiscal 1998 show yet another
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, said Susan Stefan, a professor at the University of
Miami School of Law, many competent employees with mental illnesses
like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression had lost their
cases because courts had found they were not disabled.
</P>
<P>
   And Olson's lawyer, Stephen Klausner, of Klausner, Hunter &AMP;
Rosenberg, in Somerville, N.J., noted: ``If the patient is taking
medication, you've got to make sure the dosage doesn't so adversely
affect him or her that she can't do the work.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1992 through 1997, companies won 92 percent of all final
court decisions under the Americans With Disabilities Act, said
John Parry, director of the American Bar Association's Commission
on Mental and Physical Disability Law. For mental disability cases,
companies won even more often.
</P>
<P>
   But in its new guidelines, the EEOC basically said that a mental
problem can be labeled a disability even if it does not hurt a
person's job performance. And the Supreme Court decision, which
concerned HIV discrimination, may increase employees' chances by
leading courts to broaden their views of disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines have also called attention to employees'
rights and helped educate managers, said Peggy Mastroianni,
associate legal counsel at the EEOC. ``Human resources departments
now understand,'' she said, ``that you can have a very productive
worker who has a psychiatric illness _ that both things can be
true.''
</P>
<P>
   But managing workers who appear to have mental problems is
tricky business. When an employee engages in some bizarre behavior,
``it can be a minefield'' for employers, said Harriet Cooperman,
head of the labor and employment law group at Weinberg &AMP; Green in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If a company takes any action, ``it's subjecting itself to
liability because the employee can turn around and claim that the
employer perceives the employee as having a disability and is
discriminating against the employee on that basis,'' Ms. Cooperman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognizing a problem and referring the employee to counseling
or treatment or suggesting that they get help is the humanitarian
thing to do,'' she said, but it can also expose the company to a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, employee assistance programs are much more risky, said
McDonald, the California lawyer. ``It used to be that employers
could set up programs to help employees deal with mental and
emotional programs,'' he said. ``But now we see in an increasing
number of cases that EAPs are just another source of liability.''
His advice to employers: ``Focus on the conduct, not on the
condition. Don't try to play armchair psychiatrist.''

 &HT;    Hondurans try to reclaim lives ruined by Mitch
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed until Sunday, Nov. 8
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ Amada Zelaya stood over her son,
listening to news reports about Hurricane Mitch even as the storm
hammered her roof with rain.
</P>
<P>
   It was after midnight. Her daughter and grandson slept in
another room.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many communities, the Tegucigalpa neighborhood known as
Nueva Esperanza _ New Hope _ clung precariously to a hillside, a
physical symbol of the precariousness of life in the country that,
behind Haiti, is the second poorest in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   Zelaya is 56 but looks 70. Life here can be hard. Her son is a
paraplegic, the result of a shooting a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Just before 2 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 31, Zelaya leaned over her son
to hear the radio better; the volume was low.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, the whole thing just went down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A large section of the hill split off and fell straight into the
river below.
</P>
<P>
   Zelaya plummeted 100 feet or more as her house churned and
splintered around her.
</P>
<P>
   When it stopped, she was upside-down, her feet in the air, her
head toward the river. She heard her son calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom!'' he shouted. ``We're dead! We're dead!''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' she called back. ``Just hold onto God's hand and we'll
get out of this alive!''
</P>
<P>
   Zelaya`s right hand was broken, but somehow she scrambled up the
near-vertical field of boulders to safety. Someone else pulled her
son out. But her daughter and granddaughter were gone, burried
under tons of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is very powerful, and He is very angry,'' Zelaya said.
Why, she does not know.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the devastation rained on Central America by
Hurricane Mitch is still being determined. Officials say more than
10,000 people have died, but the real number may never be known. A
hospital official in Tegucigalpa said late lastweek that he expects
only half the bodies ever to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they have confirmed that more than 6,000 people
died in Honduras from flooding or landslides, about 4,000 died in
Nicaragua, 239 died in El Salvador, 194 in Guatemala, seven in
Costa Rica and six in southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In Honduras, another 4,600 people are reported missing, which
could raise the death toll in this nation of six million people to
more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In Nicaragua, many deaths were concentrated in a single area,
where a lake in the crater of a volcano spilled over, obliterating
entire communities with mud. But in Honduras, Mitch spread
devastation over a wider area. No area of the country seems to have
escaped damage.
</P>
<P>
   Roads are down, at least 93 major bridges have been washed away
and there may be refugees who have had no access to food or safe
water for a week. Throughout the contry, the infrastructure _
roads, bridges, water lines _ have been so severely damaged that
government officials say the country has been set back decades.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital of Tegucigalpa, residents fear shortages of food
and gas because supplies at Honduran ports cannot be trucked to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Some gas stations have closed. People can be seen pushing their
cars by the door frames along the lines that form at stations that
remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Each customer is allowed to buy only about $4 worth of gas. The
government late last week mandated that cars be driven only every
other day, depending on the last digit of their license plates.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants that earlier in the week had full menus are down to
three or four items. And the government, perhaps concerned about
anger over its response to the crisis, on Friday banned all sales
of alcohol in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the darkened San Francisco Church in downtown
Tegucigalpa, people sleep in the pews. Children lie on blankets on
the floor. Clothing hangs over the church railings. A circle of
people forms near the altar, holding hands and praying.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these people lived in the historic downtown area of the
capital, an area now covered by mud.
</P>
<P>
   By day, people gather with shovels, trying to reclaim their
ruined neighborhood. Residents push one wheelbarrow after another
down the street to deposit the mud in a central spot.
</P>
<P>
   Eight men haul a refrigerator out of the muck. Hundred-year-old
houses have been destroyed; the most people can salvage is stacks
of curved, Spanish-style roofing tile.
</P>
<P>
   Miles of twisted debris line the Rio Choluteca, the river that
cuts through the heart of the city. Bridge after bridge is down,
not spanning the river, but damming it up. The Ministry of
Education is gutted. The Ministry of Health's nutritional center is
ruined. Schools, offices, car dealerships, and other buildings lie
in shambles. Thousands of jobs have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Gomez, who lived in a downtown neighborhood called Barrio
Abajo, had not believed the river could rise so high. She sent her
three oldest children to stay with others, but she and her
youngest, a 3-year-old boy named Victor Manuel, stayed behined.
</P>
<P>
   At 1 a.m. that Saturday morning, she realized how wrong she had
been. She grabbed Victor and fled into the night. With nowhere to
go, she headed for the police station.
</P>
<P>
   Now she lives in the San Francisco Church, and she'll live there
until further notice. Her house was washed away. She used to sell
stockings in a local market; the river carried her inventory away,
too. She has no money to start fresh.
</P>
<P>
   What will she do now?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting for the government's response,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   High on a hillside, 400 people are living in the Gen. Jose San
Martin elementary school, crammed 30 or 40 to a classroom. They
have no food, and they have to walk miles to forage for safe water.
</P>
<P>
   And in this place, any day now, 18-year-old Oneida Martinez will
bear her first child, lying on a soiled mattress in the middle of a
classroom floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't feel right living here once the baby is born,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Portable stoves sit on desks, but there is no kerosene with
which to cook. Seven familes share a single room. A little girl
toddles out the door, clutching to her chest a dirty teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   There are shelters like this all over Honduras. The government,
desperate for some place to house the homeless, has declared the
school year over.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood Martinez and others in the school lived in was
evacuated before it slid down the mountainside. There were no
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   But they, too, are waiting for the government's response. For
they have lost not only their homes but their land. They have no
jobs, no houses _ and no place to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope people will help build Honduras back,'' said Pedro
Palma, the shelter coordinator, ``because it will be very difficult
for the people here to do it on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, there can be no going on until the bodies of their
relatives are found.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nueva Esperanza neighborhood, Amada Zelaya counts herself
among the lucky ones. She lost only a daughter and a grandson, and
her daughter has been found and buried. Only her 3-year-old
grandson remains buried in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   His father comes here every day, climbing over the boulders with
disregard for his own safety to look for his son's body.
</P>
<P>
   Others lost so much more.
</P>
<P>
   Maria de la Cruz begged her sons to evacuate. But they were
ashamed, she said, too shy to spend the night in other people's
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are gone _ Hector, who was 18; Rafael, who was 17; and
Amado, who was 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were good children,'' de la Cruz said. ``Nobody could
ever talk about them. Even though I raised them alone, they were
well bred.'' They had also supported her since her husband died.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors heard them screaming as the river carried them off.
</P>
<P>
   Now their mother wants to bury them. ``Even if I see just their
feet,'' she said, ``I will recognize them.''
</P>
<P>
   People gather every day at the cliff formed when more than 70
houses fell away. Ramona Gomez _ Zelaya's sister _ weeps for her
17-year-old son Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing he told her was, ``Don't worry, Mommy.'' He would
go to a house where it was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Among the boulders, rags flutter from sticks marking spots where
cadaver-sniffing dogs have alerted. No recognizable houses remain
in the rubble _ just a wicker basket here, a dinner plate there, a
child's plastic pail further down.
</P>
<P>
   Firemen come to rappel down the rock field to look for bodies.
De la Cruz said she wants anything left of her son _ even just a
pile of bones _ so she can bury him.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the wreckage, a rooster crows. The wind carries the smell
of death. And the people here say Nueva Esperanza will never be
rebuilt. New Hope, they say, is gone for good.

 UNDATED: armchair psychiatrist.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And despite the success most companies have had in court,
fending off discrimination claims based on mental disability is not
easy. ``Unlike a physical condition that is readily, medically
diagnosable, a mental condition is often very amorphous,'' said
Robert Bernstein, managing partner of the Newark, N.J., office of
Epstein, Becker &AMP; Green and a lawyer for GE Astrospace.
</P>
<P>
   A mental condition, he said, ``is based on essentially the
unverifiable statements of the person who suffers from the
condition, so it becomes very difficult to rebut.'' He declined to
comment on the merits of the Olson case.
</P>
<P>
   Navigating a case through the system is costly. ``These cases
can cost more to fully litigate than the damages,'' Ms. Cooperman
said, ``with attorneys' fees sometimes in the hundreds of thousands
of dollars.'' Plaintiffs can find lawyers to take cases on a
contingency basis, as Olson did, and thus avoid big legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   The GE Astrospace case is a vivid example of how tortured
litigating these cases can be. Olson filed a complaint with the
EEOC after learning he had lost out on the job, but the agency
found no reasonable basis for his claim.
</P>
<P>
   Olson then filed a case in U.S. court, citing what he said were
violations of federal and New Jersey workplace discrimination law.
Again he hit a roadblock. The court dismissed the case, finding
that Olson was not disabled. But again Olson did not walk away.
Instead, he appealed to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and
finally won the decision allowing his case to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said that because New Jersey's law had a broader
definition of disability than did the federal law, Olson had a
potential state claim for discrimination on the basis of having a
mental disability as well as for being regarded as mentally
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for employers: Under disability law, employers
are required to provide reasonable accommodations to disabled
employees. For a physical disability, the form this takes is often
clear _ it might be a ramp for a person in a wheelchair. But with
mental disabilities, accommodation is more complex. Requests for,
say, an isolated cubicle or time off to calm down can be
misunderstood by managers and resented by co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Accommodating employees is not necessarily a one-shot deal but
can be a continuing obligation, as IBM learned the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Criado, who moved from New York state to take a
position with IBM in San Juan, Puerto Rico, had been an
award-winning marketing representative. But after more than six
years she was finding the pressure, including having a new manager,
overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1994, at her new supervisor's suggestion and on the
advice of her doctor, Ms. Criado, then 43, took a leave of absence
for anxiety and depression. IBM expected her to return on Aug. 1,
but her doctor, she said, faxed the company a letter saying she
needed more time.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-August, IBM, which said it had never received the fax,
sent its own letter _ dismissing her. Ms. Criado called and wrote
the company to try to straighten out what she thought was a
misunderstanding. But, she said, there was no reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had put so much of myself in my job,'' she said. ``I had
awards all over the place. I went from being Cinderella to the
wicked witch overnight.'' Finally she sued, claiming discrimination
on the basis of a mental disability.
</P>
<P>
   IBM lost. In June, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld
a jury verdict of more than $500,000, finding that IBM's grant of a
single, finite leave did not fulfill its obligation to accommodate.
For Ms. Criado, who has not had a full-time job since, it was a
bittersweet victory. ``Between what I ended up paying in taxes and
lawyers, I could have made more money working,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   IBM disagrees with the decision, saying it had done all it could
to balance the needs of the employee with the business.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Huvelle, a partner at Covington &AMP; Burling in Washington,
who handled IBM's appeal, said: ``If an employee comes with a
request, companies now have to be very careful in assessing the
information the employee provides. In some cases, that means the
company has to consult its own physician or have the person
examined by its own physician to see if there is a way of
accommodating the workplace demands. The disability law imposes a
particular challenge to small companies that don't have in-house
medical advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers may have to adjust their work standards case by case.
``They are used to enforcing standards of attendance and conduct on
a consistent basis, treating everyone alike,'' he said. ``In part
they do this to ensure they're not treating people differently
based on race, sex or age. But sometimes when an employee has a
mental disability, the law now imposes an obligation to take that
into account.''
</P>
<P>
   But under the law, an employee's needs cannot undercut the
essence of the job itself. Thus, a waitress in Alabama who could
not handle the stress of working busy nights and learning menu
changes was found unqualified for the job and lost her case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, managers should not brush off employee complaints of
mental problems, said Christopher Collins, an lawyer at Proskauer
Rose in New York. ``It's vitally important that employers can point
to a record at the end of the day that they took a request for
accommodation seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   For those cases that do make it to a jury trial, depending on
state law, there may be no cap on liability. With no limit to
punitive damages in New Jersey, Klausner said, there's no telling
what Olson could win.

<P>
   Luther Jerstad, an Oregon mountain guide and member of the first
American team to reach the top of Mount Everest, in 1963, died Oct.
31 in Nepal on a trek up Mount Kala Pattar, a much lesser cousin in
the Great Himalayan Range. He was 61 and lived in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   News reports from Katmandu said Jerstad suffered a heart attack
a mere 500 feet from the summit of the 15,000-foot Kala Pattar,
which is best known for its spectacular vistas of Mount Everest, at
29,028 feet the world's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
   Jerstad, who went by the name of Lute, was a teacher with a
doctorate in drama before he went into business to guide rafting
adventures and tiger photography trips in Asia. He also ran
climbing schools on Mount Hood in Oregon and Mount Rainier in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that happened after he entered the record books as one
of a quintet of American alpinists who scaled Everest from two
sides, intending to meet at the summit in May 1963. Jerstad came
away with a mild frostbite that numbed his fingers and toes.
</P>
<P>
   He and three others nearly died when darkness fell and they had
to spend the night in the open at 28,000 feet with just their
parkas to protect them when the temperature sank to well below
zero. At that time, it was the highest point that climbers ever
lived through a night outdoors, and only the absence of strong
winds saved the men.
</P>
<P>
   Two men had to be evacuated. But Jerstad walked back down all
the way, carrying his movie camera along with the distinction of
being the first man to shoot a film atop the highest spot on earth.
</P>
<P>
   Everest had claimed a number of lives before 1953 when Edmund
Hillary, a New Zealander, and Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa, , conquered
it and the world's attention. Two Swiss teams duplicated their feat
three years later.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team split in two to tackle Everest in the biggest and
best-equipped expedition yet. One fought snowslides and windstorms
along the perilous and untried West Ridge.
</P>
<P>
   The other, including Jerstad, reached the summit via the South
Col, the route taken in the three previous conquests of the
mountain. The two teams missed each other at the very top but met
on a southern ledge just below.
</P>
<P>
   Lute Jerstad grew up on a Minnesota farm and had not seen a real
mountain until his family moved to the Northwest when he was 13. An
outstanding athlete, he honed his mountaineering skills on Rainier
and graduated from Pacific Lutheran University, where he won four
varsity basketball letters.
</P>
<P>
   He also earned a master's degree at Washington State University
and taught high school. He obtained a doctorate at the University
of Oregon and taught there and at Lewis and Clark College.
</P>
<P>
   His career as a professor lasted three years, after which he
began Lute Jerstad Adventures in Portland, a guide service offering
treks and rafting expeditions.
</P>
<P>
   Jerstad is survived by his wife, Susan; two daughters, Kari
Jerstad of Portland, and Jana Cox of McKinley, Calif.; a sister,
Kay Morton of Portland; and three grandchildren.

`X-FILES' TRIES TO KEEP ITS MURKY PROMISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anytime you turn on the ``The X Files,'' you are bound to be
struck by the distinctive look: murky, mysterious and just a little
bit threatening.
</P>
<P>
   As the biggest hit on the Fox network enters its sixth season on
Sunday, the same words might be used for its future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' has reached an age at which many highly regarded
television shows have been known to start losing their way. Plus it
finds itself in a position no television show has ever been in
before: following up a big-budget Hollywood movie packed with
action scenes and the spectacular takeoff of a giant spaceship in
Antarctica, part of an elaborately constructed plot that extended
the story line of the television series.
</P>
<P>
   If the burden of serving as a 22-episode sequel to a movie were
not enough of a challenge, ``The X-Files'' is coming out of a
summer in which ratings for its repeat episodes have drastically
fallen off, most likely as a result of the multiple exposure of
early episodes on cable and broadcast channels.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carter, the creator, producer and chief mythologizer of
``The X-Files,'' is fully aware of what is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, the movie was a calculated risk,'' he said. The
studio behind the movie and the television series, 20th Century
Fox, was clearly looking to create a movie franchise akin to the
one started by another television show with extraterrestrial
themes, ``Star Trek.'' Based on the results of ``The X-Files''
movie, with an $85 million domestic box-office total, the jury is
still out on that prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always take the chance of damaging the series, because if
the movie fails, people might not come back to the show,'' Carter
said. ``You could never recover if you did not do a good movie. But
we didn't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Carter will find that out for sure on Sunday, when
``The X-Files'' returns to the weekly television wars, trying to
maintain momentum while recapping last season's final episode as
well as the movie, complete with selected scenes in letter-box
format.
</P>
<P>
   More than a future movie franchise is riding on the series'
continued success. ``The X-Files,'' the last show to start again in
this television season, is the last hope to provide consistent
quality in what is being widely called a disastrously disappointing
new season.
</P>
<P>
   It is also being counted on heavily by the suddenly struggling
Fox network that needs the buzz that surrounded previous
``X-Files'' premieres to ignite a ratings comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the pressure, Carter dismisses its impact on the work
he is doing on the show. ``All I can do is a good job; it's as
simple and as difficult as that,'' he said. ``We're all saying,
with nine shows done, that this feels like it could possibly be the
best year yet.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have to be, with all the expectations it is carrying.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Harbert, the former chief programmer at ABC and now a
television executive with the Dreamworks studio, said: ``If they
maintain the quality and still tell great stories, they'll be fine.
If not, it could start to erode away like any other show that
starts to age.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie is an unpredictable complication. Carter spent five
years weaving intricate strands of often dense story elements _
suggestions of alien abductions, hints of government conspiracies _
usually offering just enough new information to keep fans intrigued
and confused at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the movie, and Carter recognized that he had to tell a
separate big story that satisfied the longing for some definitive
solutions to the show's many mysteries while attracting _ and not
utterly befuddling _ moviegoers unfamiliar with the television
show. And it all had to be done in the hiatus between the fourth
and fifth season, before last season's episodes had even been
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all fresh ground for us,'' Carter said in a telephone
interview. ``We had to plan long in advance. Of course, we also had
all sorts of unforeseen variables like how the film would be
edited.''
</P>
<P>
   Harbert noted that the difference between movie storytelling and
television storytelling would be instantly apparent. ``The
requirements of the movie arena demand such big action elements,''
Harbert said. ``That's so different from the intimate kind of
storytelling you can do on television.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said Sunday's episode was ``a synthesis of the finale and
the movie, a crystallization of the mythology of the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Mythology has been his word for those episodes of ``The
X-Files'' that update the alien-conspiracy premise, which began
with the initial quest of the show's main character, the FBI agent
Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), to learn the fate of his sister, who
as a child was abducted by aliens, or so he has believed.
</P>
<P>
   His partner, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), a doctor, has been
the voice of scientific reason, demanding empirical evidence of
Mulder's encounters with the paranormal.
</P>
<P>
   Though Carter said that he had never created more than four or
five mythology episodes per season and that ``the rest are just
good scary episodes'' that stand alone, it has been the mythology
shows that have always driven the ratings to their peaks, largely
because it was these shows that inspired the original cult
following for the series.
</P>
<P>
   The following has been intense, and not unlike that for other
cult shows of other generations: the ``Twin Peaks'' phenomenon of
the early 1990s, the ``Prisoner'' cult of the late 1960s and, of
course, the ``Star Trek'' mania of the 1960s and beyond. At least
in terms of first-run episodes most of these television obsessions
were short-lived: one season for ``Twin Peaks,'' one for ``The
Prisoner'' and three seasons for the original ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' has easily outdone the others, though in network
television's diminished empire a cult-size audience is nothing to
sneeze at. But ``The X-Files'' has grown into something much bigger
than a mere cult hit: It is routinely one of the Emmy-nominated
shows for best drama. Its writing and acting have won awards. It is
critically accepted as one of the best shows of any kind on
television.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its continuing cult appeal is evident in its numerous Web
sites, where plot developments are parsed like the Dead Sea
Scrolls, and the sales of books, T-shirts and memorabilia, much of
which is sold at fan conventions held regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Those elements keep ``The X-Files'' television show in the same
league as ``Star Trek,'' which blazed the path in converting
characters created for television into a big box-office movie
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest leap made in the film the alien invasion plot
that had been only dimly decipherable in the series was given
reasonably full credence: Mulder actually saw aliens and Scully was
kidnapped by them. Carter said the new season would not back away
from those revelations, though new twists would be piled on top of
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the show began, I told Fox executives that we would not
see aliens for five years,'' Carter said. The time is up. Aliens do
appear this season.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's episode also gives details of both the film and last
season's finale, which introduced a mind-reading child named Gibson
Praise. Recapping that episode is almost as important as recapping
the movie, because few viewers saw the repeat when it was broadcast
a few weeks ago; the ratings for repeats of ``The X-Files'' this
summer dropped off severely.
</P>
<P>
   Carter accounted for this by pointing out that this was the
first summer ``The X-Files'' had to compete with multiple showings
of its old episodes. But Fox's network competitors will be watching
the ratings carefully this season to see if the added exposure of
episodes in syndication will damage the ``X-Files'' franchise.
</P>
<P>
   One programmer from a rival network pointed to ratings from the
last several episodes last season as giving some hints of possible
problems to come for the series. He said the problems might be
compounded if the movie left some of the longtime fans of the
series as cold as the Antarctic scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Harbert says he doesn't believe that will happen. ``I don't
think it will matter at all, as long as the shows continue to be
good,'' he said, though he added, ``I imagine the film didn't quite
live up to expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not how Carter sees it. ``The film made $150 million
worldwide and $85 million domestically,'' he said. ``I think that
means it was a very successful movie for Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was very big with fans of the show and it was
successful with nonfans, though maybe not quite as successful as
some people expected,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final assessment of the film, it amounted to an
enormous complication in Carter's professional life, which already
rivals that of a mach-speed juggler.
</P>
<P>
   He directed the movie through the spring and summer of 1997
(after writing it in partnership with Frank Spotnitz) while
planning last season's episodes and, from afar, supervising
production of his other Fox show, ``Millennium.'' In addition, this
season he has decided to inject himself back into the day-to-day
running of ``Millennium,'' and his new contract with Fox calls for
him to develop a third series for the network for next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of what I bargained for,'' Carter said. ``This is
the life I've chosen.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Carter said it was not likely that ``The
X-Files'' would go beyond a seventh year. ``The stars' contracts
don't go beyond that,'' he said. He does know the end he is moving
toward. ``I'll resolve the question of what happened to Mulder's
sister in the series finale,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is other unfinished business to attend to before that,
however. ``At some point we will do another film,'' Carter said.
``I had hoped to do it this coming summer, but with my current
schedule I've given that up. But we'll definitely do another.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat
who for almost five decades has been a fixture of American politics
as a presidential adviser, scholar and member of Congress,
announced Friday that he would not run for re-election when his
fourth term ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have been 24 years,'' Moynihan said in an interview,
adding: ``I've been very happy, and there was a very positive note
to this last election. It's time to make room for others.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Moynihan, 71, who has been among the state's
most popular elected officials for years, is certain to trigger
fierce competition in both major parties to replace him. By Friday
afternoon, a dozen of the state's best-known politicians were being
mentioned as possible candidates for the seat, including Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican; state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a
Democrat, and Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary for housing and
urban development, also a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's announcement comes at moment when New York's
congressional delegation has been steadily losing seniority and
influence in the Republican-controlled Congress. In the last two
years, six members of the state's 31- member House delegation have
resigned or announced plans to retire, including its three most
powerful Republicans: Susan Molinari of Staten Island, Bill Paxon
of Buffalo and Gerald Solomon of Glens Falls.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the last remaining
Republican in the Senate from New York, New Jersey or Connecticut,
was defeated by Rep. Charles Schumer, a nine-term Democrat from
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Well before Moynihan first made his announcement that he will
retire, during an interview with Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV, New York
Republicans had been warning that the entire metropolitan area
would lose much clout in Congress if D'Amato was defeated. But
Friday, jubilant Democrats argued that Tuesday's election, in which
their party gained five seats in the House, has led them to believe
that they can recapture control of the House in 2000 and of the
Senate in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same general trends which elected Chuck Schumer and which
produced a complete Democratic Senate delegation in the metro area
will be working in 2000,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's announcement prompted a flood of news releases from
Gov. George Pataki, Giuliani and City Council Speaker Peter Vallone
praising his 22 years in office and bemoaning his decision to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting an assessment of Moynihan in the Almanac of American
Politics, Giuliani called the senator ``the best thinker among
politicians since Lincoln and the best politician among thinkers
since Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan has had a chilly relationship with President Clinton,
and Friday the task of comment on his tenure fell to Vice President
Al Gore. Gore issued a statement that said: ``Daniel Patrick
Moynihan's retirement from the Senate will mark a true milestone in
the history of our nation's public life. Sen. Moynihan has been
both an extraordinary public servant as well as a visionary
thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan has had one of the most varied careers of any member of
the Senate. He started as an aide to Gov. W. Averrel Harriman in
the 1950s, was assistant secretary of labor in the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, chief domestic adviser to President Nixon
and ambassador to the United Nations under President Ford. He has
also been ambassador to India, taught urban studies at Harvard
University and written or edited 18 books, most recently ``Secrecy:
The American Experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, he is the ranking Democrat on the powerful
Finance Committee, where he has played a leading role in shaping
tax, health care and Social Security policies. He was also the main
author of a 1991 law that set aside billions of dollars for highway
and mass transit projects across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although many New York politicians had thought it unlikely that
Moynihan would seek a precedent-setting fifth term _ he had done
very little fund raising to prepare for a race _ few expected him
to declare his plans so soon after the 1998 elections. Privately,
many Democrats said they were relieved that he had made the
announcement early, thereby giving candidates time to raise money
and support before the 2000 primaries.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much grumbling among local Democratic officials
in recent years about Moynihan's lack of involvement in the party,
which had been devastated by the elections of Pataki and Giuliani.
And there had been some speculation in Democratic circles that
Moynihan might face a primary in 2000, just as Sen. Jacob Javits
did in 1980, when D'Amato rose from obscurity to defeat him soundly
on his way to a first term.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts have said it would have been difficult for
even a well-known Democrat to oust the senior senator, who in
almost all of his races has been the Democrats' top vote-getter and
whose margin of victory in 1988 set a record for New York statewide
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moynihan himself said in an interview Friday that he was
concerned that other Democratic candidates would have had to
restrain their campaign preparations until he announced his plans,
and he said he did not want those contenders to endure months of
speculation about whether he would run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let the party know that the seat will be open, and
all comers are welcome,''he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been many questions about Moynihan's health _ at
a campaign event with Schumer last month, he had to be assisted
from the stage when, suffering from the flu, he became dizzy. But
Friday, the senator said he felt in good shape and that his
decision was not influence by health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a problem, which is I have a torn miniscus in my
right knee which I incurred in the Senate, having followed the
instructions of my wife to start exercising about a year ago,'' he
said.

<P>
   HIGHFILL, Ark. _ With his shiny blue-and-white jet parked behind
him, President Clinton appeared Friday in the district where he
lost his first race for federal office. He reflected with a
nostalgic smile on how he and Arkansas have changed in the 24 years
since, ignoring the tumult among his Republican opponents in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned most of what I know driving around on these back
roads,'' Clinton said at a dedication ceremony for the spanking new
Northwest Arkansas Regional Airport here.
</P>
<P>
   The president was accompanied on the podium by former Rep. John
Paul Hammerschmidt, who as the Republican incumbent defeated
Clinton in 1974, and who reminded the president that his political
career began with that race. ``What he didn't say,'' Clinton added,
``was, comma, `when I beat you like a drum up here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Later, as Clinton enthusiastically worked the crowd,
Hammerschmidt remained on the podium, taking pictures of the
president. ``That's my wife he was kissing, almost,'' he said.
Pausing in his picture-taking, Hammerschmidt, who represented the
3rd Congressional District from 1967 to 1993, mused on the
might-have-beens of 1974.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether I did the country a favor or not,''
Hammerschmidt said with a smile. ``That's still to be decided.''
</P>
<P>
   The $109 million airport, with an 8,800-foot runway, was a
longtime project of Hammerschmidt and, it seemed Friday, just about
every other Arkansas politician. It is intended to serve the
growing business community here, which already includes giants like
Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods, though several people in the audience
said there were not yet adequate roads to reach the airport.
</P>
<P>
   School buses and Wal-Mart trucks formed a protective barrier
around the section of the runway as Clinton spoke, on a bright,
cool, windswept afternoon. ``It's not just going from here to
Chicago,'' he said, ``but from here to tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed more focused on memories of his youth working the
narrow, twisting roads here, and on catching up with friends. After
the dedication ceremony, he visited late into the night in the
nearby towns. He spent part of the evening with Jim and Diane
Blair, friends of the Clintons since their days as law professors
at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.
</P>
<P>
   As he pulled up to the Blairs' home just after 6:30, Clinton was
informed by a senior aide, Doug Sosnik, of reports that Newt
Gingrich was planning to step down as House speaker. Later, Clinton
made a statement saying that Gingrich was ``a worthy adversary''
and said he appreciated the work they had done together.

IRWIN WINS FIRST WINSTON CUP POLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, Ga. _ Rookie Kenny Irwin Jr. can only hope to duplicate
three-time champion Jeff Gordon's run of success in NASCAR's
Winston Cup Series.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, however, rookie and champion reversed roles on the
starting grid for tomorrow's NAPA 500.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, the series' leading rookie-of-the-year candidate, bagged
the first pole of his Cup career during qualifying for the
season-ender at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Irwin toured the 1.54-mile
quadoval in 28.657 seconds/193.461 mph on a day when Gordon _ less
than a week removed from earning his 12th victory of 1998 and third
championship _ was relegated to the 21st starting spot.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's speed of 189.980 mph was a whopping 3.481 mph off
Irwin's pace, and saddled Gordon with his second-worst qualifying
effort of the 33-race season. Whether it was just a bad day in the
cockpit or a result of NASCAR's revised aerodynamic rules, Irwin
said don't be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to be where Jeff Gordon is,'' said Irwin,
driver of the No. 28 Texaco Havoline Ford Taurus. ``Everybody wants
to be winning races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like that's why \Rteam owner\S Robert Yates brought me
up here _ that he felt like with some experience we could run up
front and win races like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's speed yesterday did not threaten the AMS qualifying
record of 197.478 mph, set by Geoff Bodine on Nov. 15, 1997. That
was the first weekend of racing on the reconfigured and repaved
racetrack that is part of Bruton Smith's Speedway Motorsports Inc.
empire.
</P>
<P>
   With the driver's championship clinched, NASCAR officials on
Monday announced modifications to its ``Five-and-Five Rule'' for
rear spoilers and front air dams on the three makes of cars in the
series. The ``Five-and-Five'' was introduced to make the cars less
stable through the corners, forcing the drivers to lift off the
accelerator and reduce speed.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Taurus is running here with a rear spoiler that is 61/4
inches high (up from 43/4 inches) and 55 inches wide. The front air
dams on all cars have a mandated 31/2-inch ground clearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't feel too much different,'' said Irwin, comparing
rides. ``It slows you down on the straightaways. If anything, it's
gonna make you faster through the corners because you're gonna have
more downforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting any more out of that \Rpole-winning\S lap,
except maybe a piece of the wall if I was gonna try to push it any
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and drivers racing the Chevrolet Monte Carlo are running
here with a rear spoiler 61/2 inches high (up from five inches) and
57 inches wide. Top speed posted by a Chevy driver was Mike
Skinner's lap of 192.106 mph, good for fifth place. Skinner's No.
31 Lowe's Monte Carlo was the only Chevrolet in the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who could tie Richard Petty's modern era (since 1972)
record of 13 victories tomorrow, qualified slower than his best
practice lap of 191.278 mph. While disappointed with his lap,
Gordon defended the new aero rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This spoiler and air dam is going to help a lot,'' said
Gordon, driver of the No. 24 DuPont Automotive Finishes Chevy.
``This is a very fast racetrack. It takes a good balance, and you
never really get comfortable at this track. But I'm a whole lot
more comfortable right now than I have been since they reconfigured
this track.''

AGGIES, LONGHORNS ON SIMILAR PATHS TO SHOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have clipped the wings of mighty Nebraska, the defending
national champions. They have an opportunity to become the first
team from the Big 12 South Division to record double-digit
victories in a season.
</P>
<P>
   By winning today, they would match the school's longest winning
streak since the year of its final Southwest Conference football
championship.
</P>
<P>
   We speak, of course, about the Texas A&AMP;M Aggies ... and the
Texas Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   All descriptions fit both teams, who have combined to win 13
consecutive games heading into today's brawls with rivals from
north of the Red River. Oklahoma State (3-5, 2-4) plays No. 20
Texas (6-2, 4-1) at 2:30 p.m. in Austin. Oklahoma (3-5, 1-4)
tangles with No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M (8-1, 5-0) at 6 p.m. in College
Station.
</P>
<P>
   An A&AMP;M victory would mathematically assure that only the
Longhorns or Aggies could represent the South Division in the Big
12 championship game, Dec. 5 in St. Louis. It would give the Aggies
a nine-game winning streak, their longest since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A Texas victory would keep the Longhorns on track in the South
race for a possible winner-take-all battle with A&AMP;M on Nov. 27 in
Austin. It would extend the Longhorns' winning streak to six games,
their longest since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement about the possibility of both schools carrying
championship hopes into their season-ending game for only the third
time in the past 11 years is building on both campuses. The
challenge, said A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum, is maintaining focus and
continuing to build on existing momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``An 8-1 record is good. But the reality is, what we do over the
next four weeks will determine how we feel about our year,'' Slocum
said. ``We know we're in a bowl. Now, it's a matter of which one.
At this point, you'd hate to come this far and not maximize what
you've accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get into the Big 12 championship game. Then, if
you do, you're not happy unless you win. There's a lot of great
opportunities out there for us. If we take care of our business,
we'll get some recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   By virtue of last week's 20-16 upset of then-No. 7 Nebraska,
Texas rejoined the Top 25 for the first time since Sept. 12.
Tailback Ricky Williams, the nation's leading rusher (204.3 yards
per game) and scorer (24 touchdowns), strengthened his Heisman
Trophy campaign by rushing for 150 yards and helping end the
Cornhuskers' 47-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't the main lesson Williams took away from Lincoln,
Neb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating Nebraska helps us know more about ourselves,''
Williams said. ``We know if we can beat Nebraska, we can beat
Oklahoma State, Texas Tech and Texas A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   By sweeping their remaining opponents, the Longhorns would play
in the Big 12 title game. The team's confidence level, said
fifth-year senior Wane McGarity, is off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at the highest point for any team I've played on, ever,''
said McGarity, a wide receiver who grabbed the winning touchdown
pass against Nebraska. ``We're a completely different team than we
were after three games \Rwhen Texas had a 1-2 record\S. It's been a
special year. And none of us want to ruin it by looking past
someone and losing a game we shouldn't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been the mantra this week from Texas coach Mack Brown,
whose team lists 13 freshmen on its two-deep list, including
quarterback Major Applewhite.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get back down to earth,'' Brown said. ``We'd better
know we're not experienced enough in any way that if we don't play
well, we'll get beat.''

ZEN BANKING: JAPAN'S NEGATIVE INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Japanese interest rates were already the lowest on
record, so it had seemed impossible that they could go any lower.
But they have: Some interest rates are now dancing into negative
territory.
</P>
<P>
   This week, investors have bought short-term Japanese government
bills that have negative yields. In other words, the buyers are
paying more money than they can expect to earn when the bills
mature in six months, in effect paying simply for the privilege of
holding bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a few foreign banks are paying interest, instead of
earning interest, for clients to borrow their money.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries, bank depositors have occasionally earned
negative real interest rates, meaning that their yields were less
than the inflation rate. But this is much rarer: The nominal
interest rate is negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've basically never seen this before,'' said William
Campbell, a strategist with J.P. Morgan in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The slide below zero shows how some investors have become so
downbeat about the Japanese economy that they are willing to invest
only in government bonds, the safest bets in the country. It also
means that there are so many yen around that some banks, mostly
foreign banks, are willing to pay someone to take them off their
hands for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anyone pay someone else to take his money? Why not
just keep it?
</P>
<P>
   Partly for convenience. A bank could keep the yen, but that
could lead to extra expenses. So long as the interest rate is only
slightly negative, it may prefer to buy bills even if there is a
slight cost. A bank could keep its yen at the Bank of Japan, but
with so much cash, there are transportation costs.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a larger issue. ``It's symptomatic of radical
pessimism of the economy,'' said Jeffrey Young, an economist with
Salomon Smith Barney in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to Treasury bills is virtually an escape from Japanese
banks, analysts say. With the economy in recession and piles of bad
loans eroding the capital bases of the banks, some of Japan's
weakest financial institutions are caught in the struggle for their
corporate lives.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the distrust of Japanese banks that investors may prefer
to pay for the right to put their money in government Treasury
bills for a few months instead. At least, the feeling seems to be,
then it will be safe. Indeed, the same flight to quality drove down
yields on U.S. Treasury bills to virtually zero in the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while Treasury yields typically serve as benchmarks for
lending rates, the negative yields in Japan have not yet led
consumer and corporate rates below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Also this week, a few foreign banks, like Barclays Capital, J.P.
Morgan and Citibank have announced negative interest rates on
lending yen to other banks.
</P>
<P>
   Barclays Capital advised other banks that if they wanted to
borrow yen, they would be charged the equivalent of an annual
interest rate of minus 0.03 percent. That means that Barclays would
pay the borrowers to borrow, so for every million yen borrowed, the
client would over a year's time receive 300 yen.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at Barclays Capital, the investment arm of
Barclays Bank, said, ``We have traded at that rate quite
frequently.'' She added that transactions were also recorded at
negative 0.08 percent as well.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan also offered rates as low as negative 0.0625
percent, but the bank declined to say how many transactions were
concluded at such negative interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Mahony, spokesman for J.P. Morgan in London, said that
in the current market environment, Morgan could still finance
itself with yen so cheaply that it could ``profit by lending at
zero or even slightly negative rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the reason that foreign banks have such cheap access to
yen currency is the troubles in the Japanese economy. Japanese
banks have an acute demand for dollars to help finance their
overseas operations, but U.S. banks are hesitant to lend dollars to
them, because of heightening concern over the Japanese financial
system.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The ``Japan premium,'' the higher costs that Japanese banks have
to pay for dollars, compared with the rates that U.S. banks pay,
has risen sharply.
</P>
<P>
   For months, U.S. banks have been trimming their dollar lending
to Japanese institutions, and in the increasingly uncertain outlook
for the global economy, U.S. institutions have been trying to shed,
rather than increase, their risk. Particularly as the year end
nears, U.S. banks are skittish about having their balance sheets
reflect a great deal of exposure to Japanese banks.
</P>
<P>
   So instead of lending dollars, U.S. institutions are using swaps
to turn over dollars to Japanese banks in exchange for yen.
Recently, the Japanese demand for swapping yen for dollars has
become so intense that U.S. banks have been swapping huge
quantities, leaving them sitting on piles of extremely cheap yen.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many foreigners are sinking their yen into safe
six-month Japanese government bills. And the reason the banks can
accept negative returns on the Treasury bill is that when they
obtain yen from Japanese banks, they are being paid enough to hold
it so that they can profit by lending it to the government at the
barely negative rates they receive on the bills.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts the Bank of Japan in a bit of a quandary. It has
been trying to stimulate the economy and get more money flowing
through the economy to alleviate a credit crunch that is crippling
companies. Instead, foreign banks are ending up with much of the
yen, and the Bank of Japan may need to inject dollars into the
market in a pinch, if foreign banks refuse to supply the dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Bank of Japan is very worried about this,'' said
Xinyi Lu, chief strategist at Paribas Capital Markets Ltd. in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, when the government auctioned Treasury bills worth
$13.6 billion, foreign banks were falling over one another to buy
the government's six-month bills so that the cost to the government
was only 0.03 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there was such an appetite in the Japanese Treasury market
that in the day's trading, prices surged, driving the yield on
certain six-month bills into negative territory for the first time.
(Bond yields and their prices move in opposite directions.) In
other words, investors were so eager to buy the bonds that they
were willing to take slightly negative returns of 0.005 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, then, the government is virtually receiving free
money. But it is not helping the economy very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like saying, while you have cancer, `Don't eat as much,'
'' Campbell said. ``You're just saving on groceries.''

GINGRICH SAYS HE'S STEPPING ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 (htv) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the
Republican revolution of recent years and is overseeing the
impeachment inquiry into President Clinton, was driven from office
Friday by a party that swiftly turned on him after its unexpected
losses in Tuesday's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise,
Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference calls to other
Republicans that he would not seek re-election as Speaker in the
Nov. 18 vote and would leave Congress altogether when his term
expires in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is
in the system,'' Gingrich said, according to a party aide who
listened to one of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's resignation was a stunning reversal for one of the
most combative and personally confrontational politicians in
America. He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one
Democratic speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style
through Tuesday's elections with last-minute commercials reminding
voters of the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   His reflexive pugilistic response was evident even Friday night.
In his second conference call, according to several people who
listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall.
Although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take
control of Congress in 1994, they have become his most bitter
critics in the last two years of his tumultuous speakership. Friday
night he called them cannibals who had ``blackmailed'' him into
quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: ``Newt said all those who
had marginalized the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism.
He said, `Refer to the clips.' He's blaming others.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican described the conference call this way: ``He
started off very statesmanlike, but then you could see the anger
building. When someone asked him why he was leaving, he said, `A
handful of members have blackmailed the conference.' He said,
`They're hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced his move just hours after Rep. Robert L.
Livingston of Louisiana announced he was running for speaker,
putting himself forward as a pragmatist and a manager. After the
Gingrich calls, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas announced he was
considering his own run for speaker. Livingston and Archer are
chairmen of the two most powerful committees in the House.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Gingrich said, ``The Republican conference needs
to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward.'' He said he
hoped his colleagues would pick a successor ``who can both
reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his wife, he told his colleagues he was resigning
from Congress because ``Marianne and I are tired. We need time off
to get to know each other again.''
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged his own knack for bringing negative
attention to himself and his party. ``If I stay,'' he told his
colleagues Friday night, ``my controversial nature would overshadow
any successes we might have,'' an understatement to those who
recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown of
the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the
back of Air Force One on a trip with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   According to another Republican who took notes, Gingrich said of
his resignation: ``There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the
members. So long as I am around, I will always be a target in the
news media, which would mean we would never be able to get our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said: ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary
leading the Republican Party to a majority in the House and joining
me in a great national debate over how best to prepare America for
the 21st century. Despite our profound differences, I appreciate
those times we were able to work together in the national interest,
especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support for America's
continuing leadership for freedom, peace and prosperity in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans took the opportunity to portray Gingrich as a
visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York said that during the
first conference call, ``there was shock and surprise and strong
expressions of appreciation for leading us to the Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said Gingrich had the votes to win the election
to nominate a speaker, which is to be conducted by secret ballot.
But, they agreed, the party's slim, six-vote majority meant every
vote would be a battle.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Duberstein, a former official in the Reagan
administration, said, ``I have no doubt he had the votes to be
speaker, but I'm not sure he had the votes to govern.'' He said
that because of the deep rifts in the party, Gingrich would not
have been able to implement his plans.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually biting reaction, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri,
the Democratic leader, said he hoped that Gingrich's resignation
would clear the fierce partisan air that he had fostered. ``I hope
that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as speaker will immediately
begin the process of repairing the damage that was wrought on this
institution over the last four years,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would
set off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than
had been anticipated. ``There will be a lot of pretenders to the
throne who will test the waters,'' said Boehlert, who had supported
Gingrich for re-election as speaker. ``There won't be any shortage
of candidates.''

CALIFORNIA EXAMINES BRUTAL, DEADLY PRISONS

<P>
   CORCORAN, Calif. _ There was lots of celebrating in this
cotton-growing town in the San Joaquin Valley when a
maximum-security prison opened here 10 years ago. It would bring
jobs and economic growth to the stagnant farm belt, not to mention
put more criminals away. But while the jobs came, the prison has,
more than anything, brought Corcoran a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   Months after it opened as part of a prison construction boom in
California that coincided with a push for tough new sentencing
laws, the state prison at Corcoran began to develop a reputation as
one of the deadliest, most abusive prisons in the biggest, most
troubled prison system in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, state lawmakers and prison officials are examining why
Corcoran, and by extension, the entire state prison system, veered
out of control. From 1988 to late 1994, when whistle-blowers inside
Corcoran went to the FBI, the prison's guards shot to death seven
inmates and wounded 43, more than in all other prisons in the
country combined.
</P>
<P>
   And while the shootings at Corcoran stopped when the federal
authorities moved in, they continued at other California prisons.
At High Desert Prison, guards have killed three inmates and wounded
11 since the maximum-security institution opened three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``California correctional officers, on at least a few occasions,
have shot and killed an inmate who was locked in a cell, in a fist
fight with an inmate, with no weapons in sight,'' said state Sen.
John Vasconcellos, a Democrat from San Jose. ``No other state has
done that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a series of recent legislative hearings on abuses
at Corcoran, Vasconcellos called for a meeting of prison leaders
from other states to review California's prison system,
particularly its violent form of inmate control. But some wonder
what took so long.
</P>
<P>
   In October, five prison guards at Corcoran were indicted on
state charges of conspiracy, accused of having an inmate rape
another inmate in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In February, as part of a four-year federal investigation into
abuses at the prison, eight guards were indicted on civil rights
charges, accused of staging gladiator-style fights among prisoners
in exercise yards and shooting at the inmates when they did not
stop fighting on command.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, a federal judge ruled that treatment of prisoners at
the maximum-security Pelican Bay Prison, at the northern tip of the
state, was cruel and inhumane.
</P>
<P>
   Also in 1995, five supervisors at Corcoran and 10 other guards
were accused by whistle-blowers of beating a busload of handcuffed,
shackled prisoners who had been transferred to the prison. A local
grand jury declined to indict the guards but the Department of
Corrections handed out punishments ranging from dismissal to
demotion. In September, the disciplinary penalties were overturned
by a court on a technicality.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one answer to why California became the model for
how not to run prisons. But the troubles began when the state
embarked on the biggest, fastest prison construction boom in the
country's history. When the building began in 1982, the state had
12 prisons and 31,000 inmates. Now, it has 33 prisons and 160,000
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The boom, prison officials say, was prompted by a series of
tough-on-crime laws drafted by the Legislature (most famously the
``three strikes'' under Gov. Pete Wilson that mandated life terms
for third felony convictions). As prisons were built, the
Department of Corrections hired thousands of prison guards, many of
whom had no experience in law enforcement beyond the six weeks'
training given by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Like the system's critics, C.A. Terhune, who became director of
the corrections department last year, said the system grew too
large, too fast. But he also blamed the state's entrenched prison
gangs, which he called ``second to none'' in the country. Just as
significantly, Terhune said, his department, with an annual budget
of $4 billion, not only has the nation's largest prison population,
it is also near the top in the ratio of inmates to guards, 7.6 to
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``While California was building its prison system, there didn't
seem to be a concurrent budgeting of resources,'' Terhune said.
``It's only begun in this last year or so to really commence the
process of staffing up.''
</P>
<P>
   The prisons' security housing units, or super-maximum prisons
within the prisons, where most of the shootings have taken place,
were built so that one or two guards with high-powered riles could
watch over a yard with dozens of the most troublesome prisoners.
Other states with super-maximum security units have nothing close
to the same numbers of incidents of guards using lethal force. But
in California, use of force was a major factor in the inmate
control equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design, the staffing, and many of the factors that go into
the program operations of the California prison system were based
on having lethal force as a control mechanism,'' Terhune said. ``It
is a reality of life that we have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Terhune acknowledged that the department's use-of-force policy
had not been defined in writing and that it needed to be strictly
defined and enforced. Echoing the Correctional Peace Officers
Union, the second most powerful union in the state after the
teachers' union, he said that the system's 27,000 prison guards
needed reinforcements and more training. ``A lot of good things
happened in these hearings,'' Terhune said, ``and I think one of
the main ones is that a six-week academy is not sufficient for the
task that we ask of our officers.''
</P>
<P>
   But long-time critics of the California prison system remain
skeptical of the department's willingness and ability to reform
itself. Corey Weinstein, a doctor who directs the Corcoran
Committee of California Prison Focus, a San Francisco-based
watchdog group, said recent history suggested it would not happen.
</P>
<P>
   `Only after abuses are exposed in the press do they act,''
Weinstein said. ``Only when the public sector has forced them into
acting have they acted.''

PACEMAKER GIANT MEDTRONIC BUYING MINORITY STAKE IN MINIMED
</HEADLINE>

By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Medtronic Inc., the world's largest manufacturer
of cardiac pacemakers, said it will pay $30 million for a minority
stake in MiniMed Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement between the two companies, Minneapolis-based
Medtronic has already bought the first $14 million worth of MiniMed
shares at $60 each and will pay the remaining $16 million after a
government-required waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is seen as a major vote of confidence from an
established medical devices giant to an upwardly mobile colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mark of credibility,'' said Salomon Smith Barney
analyst Melissa Wilmoth. ``It's a testament to Medtronic's
confidence in MiniMed's growth prospects and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed, based in suburban Sylmar, specializes in
diabetes-control devices, including a popular insulin infusion pump
that eliminates the need for repeated daily injections. The company
has seen its sales climb to roughly $100 million annually, and is
considered the device maker best poised to profit from growing
awareness and treatment of types 1 and 2 diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (insulin pump) market is only 6 to 7 percent penetrated
in the U.S.,'' said Scott Wilkin, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read
in New York. ``There's a lot of legs left in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic, which had $2.6 billion in fiscal 1998 sales, agreed
earlier this month to buy Sofamor Danek Group Inc., the biggest
maker of spinal implants, for $3.6 billion in stock. The deal still
left Medtronic with about $1 billion in cash, ``and (their CEO)
thought he'd get a better return on the money by investing in
MiniMed than leaving it in the bank,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   Medtronic will not receive a position on MiniMed's board of
directors, she said.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed plans to use the cash infusion to fund construction of a
new plant next to and partially on the California State University,
Northridge, campus.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the CSUN project, MiniMed founder and Chairman
Alfred Mann earlier this year announced he was donating about $100
million each to the University of California, Los Angeles, and the
University of Southern California for the construction of
biotechnology research centers on those campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Mann's new relationship with Medtronic is a change for the
engineering entrepreneur. In the 1960s he founded his own pacemaker
company, which competed directly with Medtronic.
</P>
<P>
   That company, Pacesetter Inc., was subsequently sold and resold
and is now owned by St. Jude Medical Inc. of St. Paul, Minn. It is
the nation's second-largest pacemaker manufacturer, behind
Medtronic.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed shares rose $4.75 Friday to close at $65.75.

 CORCORAN, Calif.: they acted.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Weinstein pointed to the catastrophe of the integrated prison
yard policy, in which rival gang members imprisoned in security
units were put in tiny, concrete recreation yards together to force
them to get along.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid 1980s, the policy backfired when guards began
shooting and killing inmates to break up fights at the California
Correctional Institute at Tehachapi. Still, officials continued the
policy when Corcoran and Pelican Bay prisons were opened in 1988
and 1989, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Pelican Bay prison was built to house the ``worst of the
worst.'' It quickly became a place where prisoners claimed they
were beaten, brutalized and tormented. In 1995, a federal court
agreed. In a class-action civil rights case, Judge Thelton
Henderson of U.S. District Court in San Francisco ruled that the
prison caused ``senseless suffering and sometimes wretched
misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many critics of the system, Weinstein blames the prison
guard union for some of the problems. The union, which has
contributed more than $1 million to the political campaigns of Gov.
Wilson and Attorney General Dan Lungren since 1992, has stymied one
investigation after another, largely by directing guards not to
answer questions. Accusations of corruption and abuse of force by
prison guards circulated through all the state's major newspapers
before the governor and attorney general began investigations into
Corcoran in 1996. The investigations failed to uncover any crimes
by officers.
</P>
<P>
   George Galaza, the warden at Corcoran, said the accusations of
continued abuse and neglect at his prison were ``lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be sitting here if that was going on,'' said
Galaza, who became warden of the 5,000-inmate prison in 1996.
``With all the different agencies scrutinizing this place, if
something was going on, I'd be behind bars if anything was going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Guards at Corcoran said they were tired of being made out to be
the criminals, in a prison filled with some of the state's toughest
inmates. Lt. Rob Vella, who has been at Corcoran since it opened,
said that even criticisms of the old integrated yard policy was
simplistic. ``There are just so many facets to it,'' he said.
``When we separate the gangs, the ones that used to get along start
forming rivalries.''
</P>
<P>
   Vella was standing watch in the security housing unit, where
inmates are monitored from across an indoor courtyard, in a control
room where guards lock and unlock doors by remote switches. The
prisoners, locked in their cells for 23 hours a day, were receiving
their lunch by guards wearing protective masks, in anticipation of
being hit by feces and urine.
</P>
<P>
   In the general unit, Lt. Rob Dean, one of a group of guards
accused of wearing black masks and beating inmates who were getting
off a bus in 1995, was watching prisoners walk from their units to
the cafeteria for dinner. Dean said the charges were politically
motivated. ``If we were doing all the things they said, these guys
wouldn't respect us,'' he said.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A red Fiat belching smoke sent shoppers fleeing
moments before it exploded outside a bustling marketplace on Friday
morning, killing the two bombers, injuring 24 other people and
disabling the U.S.-brokered peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli Cabinet immediately suspended deliberations on the
peace accord that was reached in Wye Mills, Md., last month and
called on Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, to prove he was
cracking down on terrorism. Reverberating through the heart of
downtown, the blast Friday morning was the second since the
Israelis and the Palestinians signed the new land-for-security
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis believe that Islamic Holy War, a militant
fundamentalist organization, bears responsibility for the attack at
the heavily guarded Mahane Yehuda market, where terrorists have
staged several deadly bombings before.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred during the typical Friday shopping rush
before the Sabbath. At 9:40 a.m., the Fiat, chugging along like a
car about to quit, began emitting smoke. The smoke served as the
first alarm, followed by a series of small explosions, that sounded
like firecrackers. In the minutes before the final boom, as the car
aimed to climb the sidewalk, the police moved quickly to clear the
busy area, in an effort to minimize the final toll. The bombers
died, their car blown to bits of twisted metal. But once the flames
ebbed and the thick black smoke cleared, only one victim proved to
be badly injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started running like a crazy person,'' said Sigal Yitzer,
who was recovering from minor injuries in a Jerusalem hospital. ``I
thought only of my two 18-month-old twins at home, and if I should
die, who would be their mother?''
</P>
<P>
   Arafat condemned the bombing, spending the day in meetings in
Ramallah with his top security advisers and Cabinet. But his aides
expressed concern that the attack had provided Benjamin Netanyahu,
the Israeli prime minister, with an excuse for reneging on his
commitment to the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sure the result of this terrorist action will be to give
a gift, an umbrella, to Netanyahu,'' said Freich Abu Madein, the
Palestinian minister of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Implementation of the accord was supposed to have begun last
Monday, but the Israelis delayed it, with Netanyahu insisting he
needed the approval of his Cabinet and Parliament first. Then, he
postponed convening his Cabinet, demanding written guarantees that
the Palestinians would arrest 30 fugitives.
</P>
<P>
   When the Israeli ministers finally met, in a rambunctious
all-day session on Thursday, they indicated that they might give
the peace accord only conditional approval, if any. They had just
reconvened on Friday morning when they received news of the
explosion. They immediately moved to suspend their vote on the
accord _ and thus, its implementation _ until Arafat declared
``all-out war'' on terrorism, according to Cabinet Secretary Danny
Naveh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Arafat to do what is being demanded of him,'' said
Silvan Shalom, the Israeli minister of science. ``He needs to
combat the terror infrastructure. He has done that in the past and
he needs to do so now.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu issued no public statements. He did not visit the
scene, and he did not visit the injured at the hospital.

 &HT;    SKETCHES OF A CROP OF CHALLENGERS FOR GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP
 &HT;    Eds: Adds ARMEY, ARCHER, McINTOSH, TALENT.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are personality sketches of Republican House
members who have declared their candidacy for, or interest in,
running for leadership positions in the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   BOB LIVINGSTON
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, few doubt that Bob Livingston is tough enough
for the job of House speaker, for which he declared his candidacy
Friday. At 6 feet, 5 inches in height, the 55-year-old conservative
is an imposing figure.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for a fast and fiery temper. Congressional
Quarterly's ``Politics in America'' describes a 1995 incident when
Livingston nearly came to blows with an aide to Rep. Pat Roberts,
R-Kan., then the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some son of a bitch on your staff has been saying bad stuff
about my staff to the press and I'm tired of it,'' Livingston
reportedly told Roberts before being physically restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is not without a sense of humor, albeit one that is
sometimes pointedly political. On his first day as chairman,
Livingston came to an Appropriations Committee meeting armed with a
machete and a alligator-skinning knife _ ready to cut the federal
budget. In 1993, he wore a clown's hat and a red plastic nose to
ridicule what he called a ``goofy'' Democratic bill to change
campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   As a three-term chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he
holds the federal purse strings and can help Republican colleagues
with funding for projects in their home districts. His position
also is a magnet for hopeful political contributors, so he channels
campaign funds to needy Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1977, Livingston has represented the First
District of Louisiana for
</P>
<P>
   11 terms. Born in Colorado, Livingston grew up in New Orleans.
His parents divorced with he was 7, and he and a younger sister
were reared by their mother. After dropping out of Tulane
University, Livingston joined the Navy. After his hitch ended, he
married in 1965 and returned to Tulane to earn a bachelor's degree
and then to graduate from law school.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to the former Bonnie Robichaux, and they have four
children.
</P>
<P>
   BILL ARCHER
</P>
<P>
   Courteous and soft-spoken, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas has sought
to give his House Ways and Means Committee a bipartisan image, in
contrast to the longtime Democratic Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, who
made little show of respecting the sensitivities of Republicans on
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the patina of accommodation, Archer is known as a
determined conservative and friend of business interests. He has
authored bills to cut the capital gains tax and create tax-free
``enterprise zones,'' and has opposed efforts by other House
Republicans to eliminate ``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, 70, is a native Houstonian. He served in the Air Force
during the Korean War, and over the next decade and a half operated
a feed mill, practiced law and served as a bank director. He was
elected to the Texas House in 1966 as a Democrat and switched
parties in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to Congress in 1970, succeeding then-Rep. George
Bush, who did not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   If Archer were to be elected speaker, he might wish to review an
announcement he made earlier this year: that he would not seek
re-election to the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID McINTOSH
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh's, who has declared his interest in seeking
the speakership, began his House service in the 1994 Republican
sweep that followed Gingrich's Contract With America. But his
involvement and interest in conservative political causes started
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He says it began when he was 18 and saw 29-year-old Dan Quayle
in his first race for Congress in 1976. McIntosh later would
graduate from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law
School, where he studied under Antonin Scalia. McIntosh worked in
the Justice Department during the Reagan administration, and during
the Bush administration became director of the White House Council
on Competitiveness, which was headed by then-Vice President Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, he immediately established himself as the most
vocal House opponent of government regulation, calling for a
moratorium on all new regulations and writing bills to require
agencies to make cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments before
issuing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the House, despite Democrats' complaints that it
was a disguised assault on the environment and workplace safety,
then died in a House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh has not hesitated to criticize Gingrich, and was in the
thick of occasional rebellions by conservative members of the
``Class of '94.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES M. TALENT
</P>
<P>
   The groups that rate members of Congress on the basis of key
votes are pretty clear about Rep. James M. Talent of Missouri. The
liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him a zero rating in
1995, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce rated him 100.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, frequently mentioned Friday as a possible candidate for
the speakership, represents the Second District on the west side of
metropolitan St. Louis, in an affluent area made up of a jigsaw
puzzle of tiny towns and a few large industrial facilities,
including a Ford plant and the McDonnell Douglas aircraft plant,
now owned by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, he has focused on the issue of military readiness
and decried the Clinton administration's defense budget cuts. His
ideas for welfare reform, spelled out in a bill he introduced in
1996, include denying benefits for a second child born while the
mother is on welfare and sending the children of unfit parents to
group homes.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, 42, graduated from Washington University in St. Louis
and the University of Chicago Law School. He was first elected to
the House in 1992, unseating incumbent Democrat Joan Kelly Horn. He
was opposed by Horn in 1996 and easily defeated her again, after
outspending her $1.1 million to $380,000.
</P>
<P>
   DICK ARMEY
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas is known as a
free-market economist and free user of political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Both characteristics can be controversial, but his occasional
loose remarks _ such as the time he told First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton that ``reports on your charm are overstated, and the
reports on your wit are understated'' _ have occasionally gotten
him in hot water.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, he described the Clinton Administration's
ill-fated health care reform initiative as a ``Kevorkian
prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   Army, 58, was first elected to the House in 1984 from Texas's
26th District, which sits in the solidly Republican and unusually
affluent north side of the Dallas-Ft. Worth metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cando, N.D., he attended Jamestown College in
Jamestown, N.D., and received a doctorate in economics from the
University of Oklahoma. He was an economics professor at North
Texas State University at Denton when he decided to run for
Congress and unseated a longtime Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Washington the next January too broke to rent an
apartment, so he slept in the House gym until he was forced to
stop, and then moved to his office couch.
</P>
<P>
   A chief architect of the 1994 ``Contract with America,'' which
ushered in the Republican majority in the House, he advocates
elimination of farm subsidies and a national flat tax of 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has publicly supported Gingrich in previous
controversies, there have been persistent reports of private moves
on his part to succeed to the speakership in the event Gingrich had
to leave the post.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statement Friday night praising Gingrich, Armey he
seemed to rule out any attempt to move up in the hierarchy by
saying, ``I will continue to seek the Majority Leader's post, to
provide our Conference with stability in managing the floor and
developing legislation as we undergo this difficult transition.''
</P>
<P>
   STEVE LARGENT
</P>
<P>
   Steve Largent is ready for the next chapter in his all-American
life.
</P>
<P>
   When he was born in Tulsa, Okla., 43 years ago, a nurse put a
toy football in his hospital crib. Sure enough, that blue-eyed baby
grew up to be a Hall of Fame wide receiver for the Seattle
Seahawks. ``People'' magazine proclaimed him one of its ``50 Most
Beautiful People in the World'' and Wheaties put his face on a
cereal box. He's been married to his high school sweetheart for 23
years and is devoted to their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an easy re-election to a third term as a Republican
congressman, Largent has decided to take on Armey in a battle over
the leadership and direction of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are hardly new for Largent. After attending the
University of Tulsa on a football scholarship, he was deemed too
small and too slow for the National Football League. He signed as a
free agent with the Seahawks and retired 14 years later with the
NFL career records for receptions, receiving yards and touchdown
catches.
</P>
<P>
   After working for several years as a marketing consultant and
appearing in TV commercials, he ran for Congress in 1994 as a
Christian conservative promising ``my faith, my family and my
values will give me the strength to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he has stubbornly set his own course _ voting
against the 1997 GOP budget deal and sparking headlines by
denouncing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE RADANOVICH
</P>
<P>
   A banker by trade, George Radanovich long dreamed of setting up
a winery amid the fertile fields and rolling pastures of
California's Central Valley. So in 1983, while working days as an
assistant bank manager, he founded the first winery in his native
Mariposa County. Each year, Radanovich Winery now produces several
thousand cases of sauvignon blanc, merlot and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   The vintner, meanwhile, has turned his attention from grapes to
the GOP. First elected to Congress in 1994, Radanovich is
challenging Rep. John Boehner of Ohio to be chairman of the House
Republican Conference, the caucus of all GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Croatian immigrants, Radanovich is an avowed
conservative who believes cutting taxes and easing environmental
restrictions on farmers and ranchers are keys to economic growth.
He wants to limit the scope of both the federal government and the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Cal Tech graduate with a degree in agriculture business
management, the 43-year-old Radanovich is married to the former
Ethie Weaver, and the couple has one child.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER DUNN
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins the Republican rebellion, Jennifer Dunn of
Washington is unlikely to lose her position as the highest-ranking
woman in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   All sides know the party can't afford an all-male top team.
After her election as vice chairman of the House Republican
Conference in 1996, Dunn declared the vote ``a validation of the
fact a woman has a place not only in the Republican Party but in
the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Active in GOP politics since the 1960s, Dunn is a Stanford
graduate, a former IBM systems engineer and divorced mother of two
grown sons (one of whom is named Reagan). In 1992, she was elected
to Congress from a district made up mostly of Seattle's affluent
suburbs and has sought to put a kinder face on her party since her
arrival in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a proponent of softening our rhetoric,''
she said before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a steadfast supporter of Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., who in return has backed her rise in the Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally conservative and pro-business, she has supported free
trade policies that benefit exporters around Seattle and policies
to advance Microsoft and other high-tech industries in her
district.
</P>
<P>
   JIM McCRERY
</P>
<P>
   Grits vs. Gumbo? Not really. In the fight for the chairmanship
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, incumbent Rep.
John Linder of Georgia is no good ol' boy, and his potential
challenger, Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, is no Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   While Linder grew up in Minnesota, though, McCrery was reared
amid the piney woods and oil refineries of northern Louisiana _ a
strait-laced Protestant region more akin to Alabama than to the
free-rolling Catholic bayous of southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from Shreveport, McCrery has been both a social and
fiscal conservative since he left his job as a regional manager for
Georgia-Pacific Corp. in 1988 to win election to Congress. He is a
steadfast opponent of abortion and a supporter of gun owners'
rights and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In his votes, he has been generally loyal to the GOP leadership,
although he voted against the 1990 tax increase backed by the Bush
administration and questioned the $500-per-child tax credit in the
1996 budget.
</P>

 JERUSALEM: the hospital. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On her way to work on Friday morning, Yehudit Levy, a bank
clerk, had stopped at the Haba bakery on Jaffa Street to buy a
chocolate croissant for breakfast when she noticed the smoking
Fiat, which she later called ``a real jalopy.'' Concerned for the
driver, she ran to rap on his window, motioning toward the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the face of the terrorist,'' she said. ``It was dark,
thin and kind of pinched. He gripped the steering wheel hard and
stared straight in front of him. He looked scared. I couldn't
understand why he wasn't getting out of this dangerous car. I
wanted to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two border police officers came running toward her, shouting for
her to move away from the car. People were pushing each other out
of the way, whimpering and screaming. Smoke was pouring from the
exhaust pipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smoke saved us,'' Levy said. ``We ran away from the smoke.
If it wasn't for the smoke, there would have been a terrible
massacre because it was very crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Aryeh Mizrachi, a fruit vendor, said he saw sparks and heard a
put-put sound, followed by an explosion that knocked him and dozens
of others off their feet. The flaming car shot into the air,
splintering into shards of metal and glass that littered the
marketplace and the charred street. Many people crawled into
alleyways and shops.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was hysteria,'' said Eliad Duan, an Israeli border
policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Levy, who had run to shelter, emerged to see a border
policeman lying on his back in the street, and two mangled corpses,
one of whom was the driver, his face sheared away.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the operation as amateurish, Israeli police later
said that it was unclear whether the bombers intended to commit
suicide or to plant the bomb and flee. Israeli television reported
on Friday night that two suitcases filled with explosives may have
been detonated in desperation because the Fiat was breaking down. A
Palestinian official said the bombers carried Israeli
identification cards and lived in East Jerusalem. He identified one
as Yousef Izghaiar, 22, who was released four months ago from an
Israeli jail where he spent two years for taking part in Islamic
Holy War operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that there are certain types of attacks where our
deployment, no matter how tight and reinforced, is not hermetic,''
Police Chief Yehuda Wilk said. `But this is the type of incident
which could have ended much, much worse, especially if the
explosion had happened inside the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Barely a half hour after the bombing, shoppers had resumed their
errands in the market, and some even begged the police to allow
them to cross the barricades so they could visit their favorite
spice or dried-fruit stalls. ``Unfortunately, we've gotten used to
this,'' said Ariel Twito, 36, as he ate a banana across the street
from where the bombers' corpses lay under tarps.
</P>
<P>
   But Chada Weinberg, an elderly woman, was distraught. Her
husband had gone to the market to buy chicken while she stayed home
cleaning for the Sabbath dinner. When she heard of the bombing on
the radio, she rushed over. Her husband always waited for the bus
in the crosswalk where the explosion had taken place, she said, and
he was very late in returning.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Mrs. Weinberg said, after another terrorist
attack, she had accompanied her sister to the Mahane Yehuda market
to search for her brother-in-law. He had ended up a casualty, and
her sister a widow with seven children.
</P>
<P>
   Shaking and crying, Mrs. Weinberg collapsed at an olive stand as
yeshiva students with cell phones called hospitals for her. They
finally located her husband _ home with a chicken waiting to be
broiled. Mrs. Weinberg wiped her eyes and hugged the vendors, the
yeshiva students and the journalist by her side. ``Thanks be to
God,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish settlers in the West Bank, who vehemently oppose the
land-for-security deal as a betrayal, called on Netanyahu to
respond to the terrorist attack by abandoning the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more he continues these terrible peace agreements, the
more terrorist attacks we will have,'' said Aharon Domb, the
settlers' leader.
</P>
<P>
   But several Israelis criticized Netanyahu's government for
responding to the terrorists' provocation by backing away from the
peace accord, which has a tight, 12-week implementation schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a grave thing that in the wake of such an act, the
government stops its talks,'' said Yossi Beilin, a Labor Party
member of Parliament and an architect of the Oslo interim peace
agreement. ``After all, this is exactly what the terrorists want.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first act of terrorism that followed the signing of the
accord, a suicide bomber attempting to blow up a schoolbus of
children near a Jewish settlement in Gaza was foiled by a jeep of
soldiers, one of whom was killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians responded to that incident with an instant
crackdown on Hamas, arresting more than a hundred members and
placing its spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In Gaza on Friday, several thousand militant Palestinians
rallied to protest Yassin's arrest, the peace accord, and the
detention of Palestinians in Palestinian jails. They chanted
anti-Israeli, anti-American and anti-Arafat slogans. No Hamas
leaders attended, surprising the organizers.
</P>
<P>
   `` Netanyahu, if he stays with his stubbornness, there will be
many arrows directed at his head,'' said one speaker, Imad Falouji,
the communications minister for the Palestinian Authority.

BARNES &AMP; NOBLE PURCHASES MAJOR BOOK WHOLESALER 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In another shift in the landscape of the book
industry, Barnes &AMP; Noble, the nation's largest bookseller,
announced the $600 million purchase Friday of the leading
wholesaler Ingram Book Group. An organization of independent
booksellers immediately denounced the deal as ``devastating,'' and
an authors' group compared it to a wedding of Godzilla and King
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Pressing to expand its distribution network, Barnes &AMP; Noble
agreed to acquire the privately held subsidiary of Ingram
Industries Inc. for $200 million in cash and $400 million in stock.
The arrangement will give the company access to 11 distribution
centers, which will help it cut costs and reduce delivery time for
its growing base of online customers,
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't possibly spell out all of the many benefits and
synergies we will realize as a result of this transaction,''
Leonard Riggio, the chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble, said in a statement
announcing the agreement, which was struck after several weeks of
negotiations with Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes amid a series of moves by the bookstore
giant. It recently formed an alliance with the media conglomerate
Bertelsmann AG to run its online bookstore as a joint venture and
announced earlier this week the selection of Jonathan Bulkeley as
chief executive of the venture. Barnes and Noble has been
struggling to increase its share in the growing online market,
where the pioneering Amazon.com is the clear leader.
</P>
<P>
   For independent booksellers, the worst fear is that a new book
conglomerate mixing Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble could ultimately
affect such issues as their credit, speed of delivery and access to
popular titles that are in short supply. Although Ingram, which is
based in Nashville, is a dominant force in book distribution, it
does not disclose its market share. Barnes &AMP; Noble accounts for one
of every eight books sold in the United States, according to
Hoover's Inc., a research company.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, which got its start by relying on wholesalers to
fill its orders, also depends on the services of Ingram, which has
been its leading supplier, filling more than 58 percent of its
orders, according to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Seattle-based Amazon.com issued a statement
stressing that it purchases books from a variety of sources,
including Ingram, and will continue to increase its direct
purchasing from publishers. However, the company also raised
concerns about the combination of the country's biggest book
retailer with its biggest distributor, expressing the hope that
Ingram will show ``a strong commitment to treating all bookstores
fairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To our customers: Worry not,'' Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos,
said in the company statement. ``Those who make choices that are
genuinely good for customers, authors and publishers will prevail.
Goliath is always in range of a good slingshot.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators must review the purchase for any antitrust
violations under the Hart Scott Rodino Act. That analysis will
include scrutiny of such elements as prices, delivery and special
deals.
</P>
<P>
   David Brodwin, an associate partner at Andersen Consulting, a
management and technology consulting firm, said the bookstore chain
was obviously trying to become a more competitive force in
electronic commerce so that customers get their deliveries faster
and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``As E-commerce takes hold, it puts severe pressure on the
distribution to be more efficient,'' he said. ``This isn't a
completely new thing. This is a continuation of all the price
competition that's hit book retailing. Electronic retailing makes
it much more severe than ever before so that by pulling together
entities like this it's possible to get much lower operating
costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodwin said the acquisition probably posed great hazards for
independent booksellers, who had subscribed to the unwritten rule
that ``people in the distribution channel don't compete with their
customers, their retailers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, when there's a merger like this, it makes the
retailers feel threatened,'' he said. ``They feel they might not
get the best pricing or they might not get the most current
availability of a book when they want a hot title.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Booksellers Association, the trade organization for
independents, said it had already prepared letters for the Justice
Department and the Federal Trade Commission demanding an
investigation of the purchase. Barnes &AMP; Noble said it would apply
on Monday for the review by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the booksellers group called the deal a
``devastating development that threatens the viability of
competition in the book industry.'' Asked if the organization was
considering forming a distribution cooperative of its own, its
executive director, Avin Mark Domnitz, said it was examining all
options, including new ``alliances and strategic partnerships.''
</P>
<P>
   Many smaller bookstores rely primarily on Ingram for book
orders, he said, although typically the larger stores place orders
directly through the publishers, Ingram, and the second-largest
wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times Co.has a marketing partnership with Barnes
and Noble that allows readers of the newspaper's World Wide Web
site to order books directly from the bookseller. The Times
receives a transaction fee.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Authors Guild also expressed qualms about the
effect of the purchase on the shrinking base of independent
bookstores. ``If I were an independent bookseller, I would be
scared to death by this,'' said Paul Aiken, the executive director
of the guild. ``The Godzilla of publishing is wedding the King Kong
of distribution. These are the two huge players in the field and
from an author's concern, the independent bookstores have been our
strongest allies for the barely known author.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Riggio, the vice-chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble and brother
of Leonard Riggio, insisted Friday that Ingram customers will be
treated no differently than Barnes &AMP; Noble stores are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue service to all of Ingram's
customers,'' he said. ``We will continue to provide them with the
same level of outstanding service. They're obviously free to buy
whomever they choose, but as I said we not only intend to deliver
the same level of service, but to increase it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said that he expected the deal to close in the next 35 to
45 days.

PARCELLS: HOW TO BE, OR NOT TO BE, IN FIRST PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ You cannot separate the man from his words.
Coach Bill Parcells has given his midseason soliloquy to the New
York Jets. He laid out for them how this pennant race is going to
unfold, and then Friday he put them in pads, a rarity for a Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But why not? This is a big deal _ on Sunday the Jets are
fighting to stay in first place against the Buffalo Bills as they
start the second half of the campaign. And good teams, Parcells has
said in his little green-and-white book, ``put together winning
streaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have produced three straight victories. If they win
Sunday at Giants Stadium, they will become only the second Jets
team since the 1986 season to win four straight games. Parcells'
theory is that without winning streaks, teams never go beyond the
ordinary by season's end. The Bills have won five straight. Each
team has done it with quarterbacks who last made it on the national
stage during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   From western New York, where Flutie Flakes are flying off the
shelves, all the way to the South Shore of Long Island, where they
once held a parade for Vinny Testaverde, the teams and their fans
have been energized with the kind of excitement that only playoff
dreams can produce.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo has been playing in these kinds of big games for years.
But the Jets are still learning about themselves. Even Friday,
Parcells said he did not know how they would react, but he believed
they were listening.
</P>
<P>
   Will he mention to them the fact that they have lost six
straight to the Bills and are 3-13 against Buffalo in the 1990s?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``It's not 1994. You know why Buffalo had the
streak. They were the best team. I think it's irrelevant now, a
different set of circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Parcells has often evoked Jets history to rid his players
of the burden. He has warned them of past collapses after halftime,
or their inability to win on the road, or their failure to hold
leads, or their mediocre home record.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Parcells has been telling them about themselves,
and about what they need to do:
</P>
<P>
   _ In training camp, the T-shirts he distributed to everyone
read, ``Take Another Step.'' (Last year's read, ``Who Says We
Can't?'')
</P>
<P>
   _ A sign on a wall reads, ``Great Players Inspire Others.''
</P>
<P>
   _ On their way into the locker room, the players see signs that
read, ``Prove you can win on the road,'' and ``Smart players very
seldom do dumb things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling the team yesterday that all the clubs in this
division have weaknesses,'' Parcells said Friday after calling
recent practices ``pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the problem is each team presents a unique problem; this
guy,'' he said, referring to Bills quarterback Doug Flutie, ``is
someone different. It's kind of out of the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells still does not know how much resiliency the Jets have
week to week. He wonders how much they will carry over what they
have learned during recent victories over New England, Atlanta and
Kansas City. He has told the team that almost everybody in pro
football has been zeroing in on the four teams tied for the
American Football Conference East lead _ the Jets and Bills share
5-3 records with Miami and New England _ but that most people don't
even mention the Colts, who are 1-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fifth team,'' Parcells suggested, ``could be the one to
decide this division.''
</P>
<P>
   That fifth team has Peyton Manning, who has improved
significantly from his first tentative days as a professional
quarterback. The Colts have a second game left against the Jets,
the Bills and the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the players exactly what's going to happen to all four
teams,'' Parcells said.
</P>
<P>
   And what would that be? ``I'd rather not say publicly,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But why tell them now? ``To get their minds focused,'' Parcells
said. ``This team we're playing this week could be the team to
beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Jets' Bryan Cox reflected on streaks. ``Both winning
and losing is contagious,'' said the veteran linebacker, who has
been with the Jets only since last summer. ``When you start to win
it makes the team believe it's something it can do every week. And
when you lose a lot you start to accept it. Winning and losing have
the same result on your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Left guard Todd Burger said: ``Looking at the standing is a
matter of common sense. I've heard it said that winning breeds
confidence, and we're a confident team right now. But I'm a lot
more realistic than a lot of the mugs in this room. When you want
to keep winning, you can't take anything for granted, you can't
think that just because you're rolling, it continues by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this was an upbeat day for Parcells at his news
conference. Most Fridays are when he thinks the team is
``behaving'' _ one of his favorite words _ in the right way. He was
alternately philosophical and humorous. Perhaps he senses
something.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ As expected, LEON JOHNSON will be sidelined as the third-down
back and punt returner because of a sprained knee. DEDRIC WARD will
return punts and RICHIE ANDERSON and JERALD SOWELL may spell CURTIS
MARTIN on short yardage or third downs. Players have been told not
to discuss their injuries with the news media, so Johnson asked the
reporters he did not know to write down their names for him. ``Then
I'll check out the stories to see if they're true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The three-game winning streak has helped the Jets lower their
points-against average to 17.3 a game. If the rate continues, it
will be the third-best figure in team history.
</P>
<P>
   _ The game on CBS is the first National Football League
broadcast of high-definition television (HDTV). Because it will
require two separate crews, and it also is broadcast over regular
television, 175 CBS workers will be swarming in, out and around the
Meadowlands.

   DOYLE-FILMS (Hollywood) _ An interview with Christopher Doyle,

and who is working on his first American film, Gus Van Sant's
remake of ``Psycho.'' By David Hay. (Moved). Photo.

   VELVET-GOLDMINE-FILM (Undated) _ Anyone who watches ``Velvet
Goldmine,'' Todd Haynes's extravagant, silver-spangled, $7 million
valentine to glam rock, is bound to wonder if the filmmaker was
himself once a glitter-crazed teen-age rebel who hennaed his hair,
experimented with cross-dressing, and pranced around in six-inch
platform shoes. The answer is no. ``Velvet Goldmine,'' which is set
mostly in London in the early 1970s, follows the rise, fall and
mysterious disappearance of Brian Slade, a David Bowie-like
superstar whose stage alter-ego, Maxwell Demon, bears striking
similarities to Bowie's most notorious invention, that
flame-haired, extraterrestrial androgyne Ziggy Stardust. By Stephen
Holden. (Moved). Photo.

   DANCE

<P>
   CITY-CENTER-DANCE (New York) _ City Center used to be a place
where, as one critic complained, a cloud of dust rose when Tosca
stamped her foot. The neo-Moorish fantasy on West 55th Street had
begun its second life in 1943 as a ``people's theater,'' where the
performing arts could be enjoyed for a mere $5.95 an orchestra
seat, a price raised only in 1968. The former Shriners' temple soon
became known as a lovably dowdy home for the arts, where
generations of audiences grew up watching all-American companies
like the New York City Opera, New York City Ballet and the Joffrey
Ballet grow with them. By Jennifer Dunning. (Moved). Photo.

   PUBLIC-THEATER-DANCE (Undated) _ George C. Wolfe, the music
director of the Public Theater, has hired a new choreographer.
Keith Young, 45, a choreographer from Los Angeles and a total
stranger to the Great White Way. What drew Young was the chance to
work on Broadway with Wolfe, whom he considers to be the top man in

<P>
   TOP-BRITISH-ACTRESS (London) _ Who is the greatest living
British actress? Maybe the question is silly, since it makes an
infinitely demanding art sound like a steeplechase for mature
fillies, and maybe it is meaningless. After all, it is not exactly
easy to measure Maggie Smith, with her droll wit and sly timing,
against Diana Rigg, who is currently giving a fierce, febrile
performance as Racine's Phedre in the West End. Or Dame Maggie
against Vanessa Redgrave, who, sadly, seldom brings that wonderful
emotional clarity of hers to the stage these days, or Dame Diana
against Helen Mirren, of whom more in a moment. But if I were to
nominate a woman for top spot at the theater's top table today, it
would be Judi Dench. By Benedict Nightingale. (Moved).

<P>
   ANNA-KARENINA-THEATER (London) _ The stripped-down version of
Leo Tolstoy's ``Anna Karenina,'' arriving on Wednesday at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater, is a production by
Shared Experience _ another London theater company that makes
imaginative use of relatively few props. But this is no simple
exercise in minimalist theater. For more than two decades, the
touring troupe has put the actor at the center of the event,
enhanced by only as much set design as is needed to release the
affective heart of the story. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo.

   BEL-CANTO-OPERAS (Undated) _ A new generation of bel cantists
has arrived, and some notables among them are represented in a wave
of new recordings: from RCA, Bellini's ``Capuleti e i Montecchi,''
featuring the exciting Bulgarian mezzo-soprano Vesselina Kasarova
and the Italian soprano Eva Mei; from Decca/London, Rossini's
``Turco in Italia,'' with the acclaimed mezzo-soprano Cecilia
Bartoli, and from Sony, ``Lucia di Lammermoor,'' with the Hungarian
soprano Andrea Rost, and Charles Mackerras conducting the
period-instrument Hanover Band. The overall affinity for the style
manifested by the singers and conductors in these releases is most
striking. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BABBITT-MUSIC (Undated) _ What is it about music? If Milton
Babbitt were a painter, and not a composer, his work would be a
familiar part of the mental landscape. By now, at 82, he would have
had a major retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum. Tableware
decorated with his imagery would be available at the Museum of
Modern Art gift shop. No museum would be able to consider its
collection of contemporary American art adequate if it did not own
an earlyish example of his work. If, as a composer, Babbitt has so
far failed to make it with the large public, the first performance
of his Piano Concerto No. 2, next Sunday at Carnegie Hall, may
start a turnaround. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).

   POP MUSIC

<P>
   MUTATIONS-ALBUM (Pasadena, Calif.) _ Beck sees dead ends
everywhere on his new album, ``Mutations.'' Creativity and culture
are played out, love has faded away. There aren't even any new
jokes to be told. ``Who wants to be there to sweep the debris, to
harness dead horses?'' he sings. Well, for the length of the album,
it seems that Beck does. He contemplates entropy and decay with his
most lucid and unguarded songs, as he renounces his old studio
tomfoolery. Some of the songs could be about long-lost love, but
nearly all of them also read as impressions of a time when the only
certainty is a free-floating sense of loss. By Jon Pareles.

   SALVADOR-DALI-ART (Restabal, Spain) _ In January 1986, Ian
Gibson received a message he had awaited for years: Salvador Dali
was ready to see him. An Irish-born author, Gibson was writing a
biography of Federico Garcia Lorca, the Andalusian poet, and Dali
had finally agreed to talk about his intimate friendship with
Garcia Lorca, forged during their school days in Madrid. Though
this was Gibson's only meeting with the artist, who died in 1989,
he went on to know him all too well. He spent six years working on
an 800-page biography, ``The Shameful Life of Salvador Dali,''
which was published here this month by Norton. By Robin Cembalest.

   KIASMA-MUSEUM-ARCH (Undated) _ I recently went to Finland to see
Kiasma, Helsinki's new museum of contemporary art. The building,
which opened in May, was designed by Steven Holl, one of New York's
most gifted architects. It shouldn't be necessary for a New Yorker
to endure jet lag to check out one of his buildings. Fortunately,
Helsinki's new museum is worth the trip, in part because it is
informed by an awareness of the twists and surprises of
contemporary life, the unexpected departures from plans, the vast
tracts of unknown experience that reside even in a built-up,
shrinking world. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).

<P>
   BECKER-TV (Undated) _ ``You know who I want to meet?'' the good
doctor asks. ``The sick, twisted little bean counter who came up
with the health maintenance organization.'' As a prickly but
secretly noble physician who spouts outrageous truths, Ted Danson's
John Becker is no more believable than the saintly Marcus Welby
was. But here, in a promotional spot for the new CBS sitcom
``Becker,'' he sounds oddly realistic, echoing opinions heard more
and more often, on and off television. By Caryn James. (Moved).

   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   MAORI-WARRIOR-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ The near-life-size wood
carving of a Maori warrior exudes raw power. The eyes, made of
shells, gleam white with seeming rage against the tatooed face, and
the large, claw-like hands and the short, thick, muscular legs
project brute strength. The figure depicts an ancestor of a Maori
chief and symbolizes the pride of a tribe. The figure originally
served as the base of the central post of a mid-19th century
meeting house on the eastern coast of New Zealand. It will be sold
at Sotheby's on Nov. 22, and the auction house expects it will
bring between $1 million and $1.5 million, 10 times what its owner
paid in 1978. By Rita Reif. (Moved).

1931's Universal production of ``Frankenstein,'' yet his death
almost went unnoticed. By Bob Strauss.

SLOWING THE MONEY TRAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What will slow the rise in executive pay?
</P>
<P>
   A bear market would help, many experts say, because shareholders
would start voting down management plans for issuing shares to
reward top executives and other employees. Even now, votes against
such proposals are rising.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, experts say, the key is for directors to act more
like shareholders. Charles M. Elson, a Stetson College law
professor who serves on three corporate boards, argued that
director nominees should be required to buy a considerable amount
of company stock _ say, $100,000 worth _ before joining a board and
then be compensated with stock for their services.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Elson said, directors will consider the company's money
their own and be more likely to resist a chief executive who wants
an unreasonably large share of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, any penny that is overpaid comes out of the
director's pocket as opposed to some vague force known as the
company,'' he said. The amounts involved, he acknowledged, may
amount to no more than pennies a share, but people nevertheless
have a keen sense of what is rightfully theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Elson has seen the process work first-hand. When he was
appointed a director of the Sunbeam Corp. in 1996, he was required
to invest $100,000 of his own money to buy 5,000 shares in the
company. Indeed, Elson had advised Albert J. Dunlap, then Sunbeam's
chief executive, to impose the requirement on all his directors.
</P>
<P>
   With the additional compensation he received in Sunbeam stock in
subsequent years, the total value of Elson's holdings rose to
$250,000. But after the company foundered earlier this year under
Dunlap's leadership, the value of Elson's holdings fell steeply, to
less than $50,000 at one point.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Elson who, in June, made the motion to the Sunbeam
board to remove Dunlap. The Sunbeam board has been widely reported
to be fighting with Dunlap over his severance pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a large equity stake in a company,'' Elson said,
``really wakes you up.''

   Germany: U.S. Lawyer Presses Slave-Labor Case
</P>
<P>
   An American lawyer who has sued companies over slave labor in
World War II demanded that the new government include his group in
talks about a compensation fund. The lawyer, Edward Fagan, said he
would never agree to a government-run fund.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Pinochet Extradition Requested
</P>
<P>
   The government agreed to seek the extradition from Britain of
Gen. Augusto Pinochet, a move that could send the general, the
ex-dictator of Chile, to trial on a charge of genocide. The Chilean
government immediately recalled its ambassador, and the Spanish
foreign minister, Abel Matutes, conceded that the case ``inevitably
has important political repercussions.''

   The government announced it would launch four
intelligence-gathering satellites, increasing its military
abilities in ways that are widely expected to cause unease at home
and regionally. The Cabinet approved the launchings by the spring
of 2003. Japan became alarmed when North Korea launched a rocket
over its territory in September.

   China: Controls on MIxed Marriages
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai has moved to control the increasing number of marriages
between residents and foreigners, BBC World News reported. Starting
next month, the BBC said, Chinese in Shanghai who want to marry a
foreigner have to register with city authorities, who will rule in
a month on allowing or prohibiting marriages. Shanghai had 3,000
mixed marriages last year.
</P>
<P>
   China: Campaign Against AIDS
</P>
<P>
   Health officials are developing a campaign to slow the spread of
AIDS. An estimated 300,000 people are believed infected with HIV,
and experts say it is spreading rapidly, mostly from drug users who
share needles. The program aims to hold the total number of
infections to fewer than 1{ million by 2010.

forfeiting its vote in the General Assembly. The United States,
which was voted off the panel, the Advisory Committee on
Administrative and Budgetary Questions, in 1996, finished last in a

   The New York Times News Service will send the following Money
and Business articles for release Sunday, Nov. 8, 1998:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   EXECUTIVE-PAY (Undated) _ Has executive pay gotten completely
out of hand? An examination of the interplay of chief executives,
compensation committees of boards of directors and consultants who
help set pay levels calls into question whether ``pay for
performance,'' a mantra that companies have used for two decades to
explain their strategy for setting pay, accurately describes what
is happening behind closed boardroom doors. Through an elaborate
process that is fraught with conflicts of interest and marred by
questionable assumptions, executive pay is often set with methods
imported from Lake Wobegon, the place where Garrison Keillor
imagines that ``all children are above average.'' By Adam
Bryant. &UR;  &LR; (Moved). Plus sidebar.
</P>
<P>
   With Graphic.
</P>
<P>
   COMPANIES-SOFTWARE (Undated) _ They call it corporate root
canal: Installing enterprise software, the monster
run-the-whole-show software packages made by SAP, Baan, PeopleSoft
and others that promise to boost efficiency, provide much better
management information and control and slash costs, can turn the
whole company painfully upside-down to get there. We get inside
three companies at different stages of the years-long process. By
Claudia H. Deutsch. (Moved). Plus sidebar.
</P>
<P>

Proposition 9 last Tuesday, 73 percent to 27 percent, to the

</P>
<P>
   BIZ-TELECOMS (Undated) _ When the bull market pooped out this
fall, a whole generation of telecomm startups were left in a tight
spot. Their business plans were predicated on getting big
injections of new capital around now through secondary equity
offerings, to pay the huge capital costs of getting going in the
phone business. With new equity now a non-starter for all but the
biggest, safest companies, the phone newbies have had to scramble
to find a plan B. We say what they are up to, and list about 8 that
have found alternative money in the past couple of weeks. By Seth
Schiesel. (Moved).

THE TRUTH IS OUT HERE _ IN SUNNY L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A shot of a blazing-hot sun. Pan down to a desert
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulder, we're not in Vancouver anymore?'' a bewildered FBI
agent Dana Scully asks her partner, Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right, Dana. We seem to be on some kind of alien
terrain,'' replies Mulder, snapping on a pair of Ray-Bans.
</P>
<P>
   OK. So the dialogue doesn't happen on tonight's season premiere
of ``The X-Files,'' but the hit Fox series has moved from rainy,
dark Vancouver, British Columbia, to sunny Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   But don't count on Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian
Anderson) playing beach blanket bingo. The mind behind ``The
X-Files'' has no intention of letting those creepy paranoid
qualities that made the show so successful slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Vancouver, we were limited to mountains and forests and
verdant landscapes. Here we've got so much more,'' says Chris
Carter, the show's creator and probably the only man on Earth who
could tie all of ``The X-Files'' conspiracies together.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, Carter is directing the Christmas episode on the
20th Century Fox lot. Series star Duchovny, looking relaxed and
wearing a T-shirt, is bouncing between doing takes with Anderson
and talking about pickup basketball, the show's move to L.A. and
all the traveling that has entailed.
</P>
<P>
   For the opening episode, says Duchovny, ``we filmed in Lancaster
and Palmdale for six days in a row. It was an hour and 40 minutes
to get out there, and we came out at 2 a.m. one night to shoot a
scene. I said, `This is no reflection on anybody here or the crew,
but I'd like to move the show to L.A.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny's joke was a wry reference to the talk surrounding the
move of ``The X-Files'' down here. It was widely reported that the
then-newly married Duchovny threatened to leave the show if
production remained in Canada because he wanted to be closer to his
wife, actress Tea Leoni.
</P>
<P>
   ``They moved the show and look what happened,'' he said. ``She
got pregnant. I can't imagine being apart from her working while
she's pregnant.'' Leoni is reportedly three to four months along,
but Duchovny declined to be specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The move) became a public issue discussed by 99 percent of
people who have no idea what they were talking about, and the 1
percent, myself, the crew _ the people I've worked with for five
years understood me completely that my motives weren't capricious
or whimsical.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning to L.A. was endorsed by his co-star. ``Overall it's
easier to do the show here,'' say Anderson. ``I am a person who is
affected very strongly by the weather. Vancouver is a beautiful,
beautiful city, but it is dark when you get up in the morning. It
makes you depressed ... I felt very cooped-up there.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Here comes the sun
</P>
<P>
   But the stay in L.A. isn't likely to last as long as the five
years in Vancouver. Carter, Duchovny and Anderson are only signed
through next season, and there is little indication that the series
will live on after that except possibly in movies. Another feature
is planned for 2000, but Duchovny isn't aboard yet.
</P>
<P>
   So this may be a pivotal year for the franchise. And the signs
for the new season are mixed. (As anyone watching the series knows,
signs are important.)
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent Nielsen television ratings survey,
``X-Files'' viewers are among the most loyal. But last summer's
feature-film spin-off, ``The X-Files: Fight the Future,'' though
doing decent box-office business ($83 million domestically), was
disappointing to some hard-core fans. It's also impossible to tell
if the film scared up any new X-philers for the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ratings for show's reruns on Fox this summer have
been less than stellar, though the movie video has been among the
top 10 in rental and sales since its release more than three weeks
ago. And that may be a good sign, indicating that fans are gearing
up for tonight's premiere, titled ``The Beginning,'' which will
pick up where last season's finale, ``The End,'' left off while
also weaving in parts from the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to that shot of the sun. The move south hasn't
come without a price.
</P>
<P>
   All the sets had to be rebuilt on a soundstage on the Fox lot.
All that remains from the Vancouver set are a few props. Even the
smoke machine is new.
</P>
<P>
   An entirely new crew _ with the exceptions of Duchovny's and
Anderson's hair and makeup artists _ had to be hired, and it costs
more to film a show in Los Angeles. Though Carter wouldn't say how
much, the phrase an ``arm and a leg'' came up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standards of quality have been maintained,'' Carter said,
``L.A. gives it a different look, but that's a virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that different look is the San Fernando Valley, which
Carter says, they'll use ``a lot, but as everything but the San
Fernando Valley.'' They have already filmed in Thousand Oaks,
Encino, Glendale and Altadena.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sunny locales in which X-Files investigations will
take place this year are Texas, Arizona, Nevada and Colorado _ but
don't be surprised if it looks like someplace just down the street.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, however, the show will maintain its dark
look. Most scenes are set indoors, and many external scenes are
filmed at night. Besides, Duchovny says, location has nothing to do
with the success of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ```The X-Files' is not location specific,'' he said. ``It's
about the stories. If the stories are good, the show is good. If
the stories stink, no amount of rain will help. I don't think
people are tuning in at 9 and saying, `Let's see some rain.' If
that were the case, any show shot in Vancouver would be a hit and
any show shot in Seattle would be a hit. There are certain shows
that have to be shot where they are shot. `Baywatch' would look
silly if it were shot in Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   Plotting the season
</P>
<P>
   And it's the stories, as weird as they might be, that make ``The
X-Files'' distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're writing good scripts,'' Carter says. ``David is really
excited, so is Gillian, and they're both extremely happy not just
to be here but think the work is really good this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny, for his part, is taking the opportunity to write an
episode and is slated to direct as well.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is also trying some innovative approaches this season.
The third episode, shot aboard the Queen Mary, was done in linear
time, with every shot connecting to the next. Carter wrote and
directed the hour in which Mulder and Scully appear to be caught in
a Nazi-era time warp. It will be shown in a letter-box format.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says thatshe has seen ``more humor in the scripts this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   A thought echoed by Carter. ``I think this year there are quite
a few funnier stories in the beginning of the year ... before we
come back to solid `X-Files' scare.''
</P>
<P>
   Being in town also has helped land a new crop of guest stars. Ed
Asner and Lily Tomlin will play ghosts in the Christmas episode.
Michael McKeon, Victoria Jackson and Nora Dunn will also show up in
roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to a point in Vancouver,'' Carter said, ``that we
started to use the fine, but shallow, pool of actors three, four
and five times. Now we have a much larger pool of actors.''
</P>
<P>
   An interesting fact is that ``The X-Files'' was never intended
to be produced abroad. The pilot was to be filmed in Hollywood, but
a suitable forest could not be found to support the plot line so
off to Vancouver they went.
</P>
<P>
   Paraphrasing Duchovny, Carter says, ``Two weeks turned into five
years.''
</P>
<P>
   And Duchovny won't miss all that frequent flying. ``I can circle
the Earth for the rest of my life and not pay for it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But will they miss the rain?
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny insists he is a fan of the precipitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad thing about the whole discussion is that my wife is in
love with the rain,'' Duchovny said. ``She lives for it. I, too _
even though I am portrayed as a guy who hates rain _ love it. For
my wife, it's an excuse not to work. You don't have to go out and
be productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, too, said he likes rain, even though it slows down
production.
</P>
<P>
   Rain can be faked, though. But what he won't be able to
replicate easily is the nippy nights of the Great White North.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Steven Spielberg,'' Carter said, ``and he told me
the only thing I will miss is (visible) breath. They can do it
digitally, like in the movie, but it's a little prohibitive.''
</P>
<P>
   So for the time being, barring El Nino's return, Duchovny can
put off fixing that broken windshield wiper on his burgundy BMW
convertible, and ``The X-Files'' crew can enjoy their time in the
sun.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It seemed somehow the ultimate irony of this
strange political year, the year stigmatized by President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Instead of Bill Clinton being the one
to fall, it was Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the Georgia Republican was hailed as the
visionary who won control of Congress for his party in 1994,
Gingrich stepped down Friday night, facing a mutiny from
Republicans who insisted that his flaws could cost them the very
majority he had created.
</P>
<P>
   In more heady days, the mercurial Georgia Republican had called
himself a ``transformational figure'' and a ``definer of
civilization.'' But Friday evening at 6:30 p.m., ET, facing a
leadership challenge, Gingrich told his fellow House Republicans in
conference calls that he was ``a target'' and would step down for
the good of the party. He was not just leaving as speaker. He was
leaving Congress at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that he tried to discuss his decision with
dignity. But they said he could not hide his bitterness and sadness
as he spoke of those who would ``cannibalize'' the party because
they wanted things their way or no way.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's sudden fall came just four days after a midterm
election that dealt Republicans a setback even more unexpected than
their 52-seat pickup which he organized in 1994. But losing five
seats was the occasion, and yet not the cause, for the antagonism
that brought Gingrich's turbulent rein as House Speaker to such an
extraordinary end.
</P>
<P>
   The anger against him had been building all year and Republicans
say that by Friday Gingrich's troubles ran extremely deep _ fueled
by his miscalculations on election strategy, his persistent
unpopularity with the public and his failure to rally the divided
House Republicans around an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, House Republicans ran and won on an organizing theme,
the ``Contract with America,'' which stressed less regulation, tax
cuts, term limits and a balanced budget. But once they worked out a
balanced budget, with tax cuts, in 1997, they seemed an
ideologically spent force.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans went into this year's election largely running
on the past. And its result provided one more reason for change.
Gingrich is almost universally disliked by House Democrats, and
some Republicans said that now that they have an almost unworkable
six-vote majority, they need a speaker who can work with Democrats,
not infuriate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I believe desperately needs to take place is to heal the
alienation that currently exists,'' said Rep. Steve Largent of
Oklahoma, a conservative football Hall of Famer who announced his
own challenge Friday to Gingrich's second-in-command, Rep. Dick
Armey. Largent cited the rifts not just inside the Republican
caucus, but between House Republicans and Democrats, House
Republicans and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the speaker's problems, many Republicans said, is
that he had never made an adequate adjustment from minority to
majority, from intense backbench opposition to governing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolutionizing takes some talents _ many talents,''
Gingrich's challenger, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana said, as he
announced the candidacy for speaker that drove Gingrich from
office. ``My friend, Newt Gingrich, brought those talents to bear,
put the Republicans in the majority. Day-to-day governing takes
others.''
</P>
<P>
   As a minority firebrand, Gingrich attacked Democrats, including
Speaker Jim Wright, over ethics issues. Throughout 1996, they
returned the favor, and as Congress convened in 1997, he was barely
re-elected speaker, and then reprimanded and fined $300,000 for
bringing discredit on the House by using tax-exempt money to
promote Republican goals.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-edged partisan bite that worked for Gingrich in the
minority came across as stridency in power, Republicans said.
``Whenever we try to go on the offensive the White House tries to
make Newt the issue and whenever that happens we lose,'' said Peter
King.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gingrich and Clinton have been locked for years in a
strange symbiotic competition. It was Clinton's failed attempt to
pass national health care that helped bring Gingrich into the
majority. It was the Speaker's gamble on shutting down the
government in the winter of 1995-96 that assured Clinton his own
re-election. And this year it was Gingrich's misreading of the
public mood on impeachment that helped bring about his own demise.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Gingrich's problems had nothing to do with Clinton.
In a fractured Republican caucus struggling to define itself, he
could never satisfy every ideological instinct and faction. So at
the end he came under attack from moderates and conservatives, and
was not even defended eagerly by some of those for whom he raised
hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   It was those same ideological divisions that made it so hard for
him to craft an agenda for his party this year, even on fiscal
issues which once unified Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich allowed Rep. John Kasich, the budget committee
chairman, to try to rally House Republicans around a conservative
blueprint for more than $100 billion in new savings, the moderates
refused to back it.
</P>
<P>
   When House Republicans supported a $70 billion tax cut, Senate
Republicans refused to pass it. The disarray was so complete that
Congress for the first time since 1974 failed to ever pass an
actual budget.
</P>
<P>
   That stalemate put the Republicans in the weakened state that
left them with little alternative in October but to reach an
agreement with Clinton on a massive $500 billion spending bill that
alienated their conservative base on the eve of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's defenders said their colleagues were being
hypocrites, blaming him for their own unwillingness to strike
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a problem with leadership,'' said Rep. Mike Parker,
a Mississippi Republican who is retiring and thus barred from
voting in the leadership election. ``It was a problem of
followership. We had all these people who wouldn't get along. We
couldn't get the rank and file members of the Republican conference
to take the votes necessary even down to passing a budget.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich's critics say it was his role to bridge these
divisions. ``That's the challenge of leadership,'' said Rep. Marge
Roukema, R-N.J. ``I'm sorry. The Democratic Party used to be very
fractured between its southerners and the liberals. That's the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gingrich might have survived if he had not already had
such a tumultuous political history, leaving enemies, Democrat and
Republican alike in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   He has had more admirers than friends among House Republicans.
His raw ambition _ he wanted to be speaker from the time he was 14,
said _ scared some colleagues and awed others. His inability to
keep from sounding boastful, or in 1995, complaining about not
getting a good seat on Air Force One en route to Yitzhak Rabin's
funeral. But, until Friday, he always rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   When his own firebrand conservatives and leadership tried to
mount a coup against him in the summer of 1997 _ before the
balanced budget deal, he survived by drawing support from the
barons of the party _ the committee chairmen. And one of the most
important of them had been Livingston, who let it be known that he
would wield his power over spending to keep rebels in line.
</P>
<P>
   As a new rebellion brewed this his week, Gingrich looked for
support. Just hours before he stepped down, his spokeswoman
Christina Martin said he had made 50 calls since Wednesday seeking
commitments. But his party wanted to avoid the bruising
confrontation that would come with a leadership struggle.
Republicans said Gingrich understood he had to leave when Rep. Bill
Archer, the Ways and Means chairman, who had originally promised
his support, called back later and told him it was time for him to
go.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday night he left, saying ``I urge my colleagues to pick
leaders who can both reconcile and discipline, who can work
together and communicate effectively.'' he added, ''They have my
prayers and my thoughts as they undertake this task.''

` GOD'S AND MONSTERS' EXPLORES LIFE, ART OF UNSUNG DIRECTOR
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The surprise critical hit of the season is,
ironically, a movie about a filmmaker who's never been properly
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters,'' an adaptation of Christopher Bram's novel
``Father of Frankenstein,'' is a fictionalized account of the last
days of James Whale. One of the most influential directors in
Hollywood history, Whale set the pattern for all horror films to
come with the 1931 Universal production of ``Frankenstein.''
</P>
<P>
   He made three other outstanding fright films _ ``Bride of
Frankenstein,'' ``The Old Dark House'' and ``The Invisible Man'' _
that were marvels of expressionistic composition, wry wit and
bizarre imagination. And like ``Frankenstein'' but unlike the
majority of '30s films, they remain entertaining viewing today.
</P>
<P>
   Permitted an unusual amount of creative freedom by Universal's
production chief Carl Laemmle Jr., Whale also made the first, still
impressive screen versions of the musical ``Show Boat,'' the
sublimely soapy ``Waterloo Bridge,'' and the Dumas swashbuckler
``The Man in the Iron Mask,'' among other fine films.
</P>
<P>
   But a change in studio ownership led to increased interference
with his work. So the English-born Whale, who made a killing in
real estate, retired comfortably in the early 1940s. By 1957, when
his fully clothed body was found in the pool at his Pacific
Palisades home, Whale was all but forgotten in film circles, though
the monster he'd brought to life had attained a kind of pop-culture
immortality. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Those who did know Whale at the time of his death suspected
foul play, that perhaps the openly gay director died at the hands
of some angry lover or hustler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gods and Monsters,'' which was adapted and directed by Bill
Condon, proposes a different theory. Starring Sir Ian McKellen, in
a performance many feel deserves an Oscar nomination, and Brendan
Fraser, as Whale's hulking, handsome and entirely heterosexual
gardener Clayton Boone, the film does suggest that Whale's death
was connected to an odd relationship _ but in a way that had
nothing to do with sex or violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novel was just so rich thematically,'' says Condon, who
directed the films ``Sister, Sister'' and ``Candyman: Farewell to
the Flesh.'' ``It went beyond anything parochial about the story of
a gay man. And it seemed like it would be an amazing opportunity to
make a movie about Whale but, also, a tribute to what he did in
movies. We added a lot of Whale touches as we went along.''
</P>
<P>
   Filmed mostly in the flatly lit, wide-screen Technicolor that
was popular at the time of Whale's death, the film also
incorporates gothically staged flashback shards (the aftereffects
of a stroke cause Whale to lose control of his memory, among other
capabilities, throughout the story), bits from his movies and
dead-on re-creations of '30s Hollywood film sets. Gradually, Condon
and his director of photography Stephen M. Katz merge the widely
divergent styles together as Whale and Boone's unlikely, sometimes
difficult friendship deepens, and the film's themes interweave and
crystalize.
</P>
<P>
   And what, exactly, are those themes? Executive producer Clive
Barker, the horror writer and sometime filmmaker (``Hellraiser,''
``Nightbreed'') who'd first worked with Condon on the ``Candyman''
thriller, agrees with the director that ``Gods and Monsters'' is
more than just a tribute to a fellow gay frightmeister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've long said that Whale was the great, unsung master,'' says
Barker. ``And here was the chance to tell his story, albeit a sad
slice of his life. But it has all of my favorite themes in it:
mortality, the failure of flesh and the `Is it a man, is it a
monster?' question. That's a big theme in my stuff: At what point
does the man become monstrous and the monster become human?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful two-way street in the movie. Whale is
obviously reconfiguring Clayton in his imagination as the monster,
but at the same time Clayton is revealing his own human complexity.
It's wonderfully ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   McKellen, too, brought much of his own experience to the role.
But he also strove to capture Whale's personality as accurately as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Ian and I were concerned about staying true to the real
person,'' Condon explains. ``Luckily, there are enough people we
could talk to who knew him. They would all mention immediately
Whale's kindness, his gentleness and generosity, and how he never
took himself too seriously. We made adjustments just based on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one informed viewer confirms that that side, at least,
of a beloved former collaborator was captured perfectly.
``Titanic's'' Gloria Stuart, who after decades in retirement was
nominated for an Academy Award this year, appeared in three Whale
films, ``The Old Dark House,'' ``Invisible Man'' and ``The Kiss
Before the Mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of cliche phrase, but the thing about James his
movies express the most is his mordant wit,'' says Stuart. ``He was
extremely witty, sharp and quick _ (he) could cut you off at the
pass with a word. It's not an affectionate attribute; he wasn't
always amusing, he was cutting, and there isn't very much of that
in the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, he was very kind, very considerate with me,
and the film captures that. I loved him. I was not aware of his
homosexuality at that time _ it wouldn't have made any difference
to me anyway, it never has _ so that had no bearing on my affection
for him. I think Bill Condon has done a very tasteful job with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say too tasteful, to the director's amusement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been a few gay people who read it as pat that
Clayton stays straight throughout the film,'' Condon says. ``Well,
the fact is that he is straight; there is nothing interesting about
reading this thing like, if it was 20 years later, they'd be in the
sack together. They just don't want to believe that he's completely
straight _ and that's something that, from the straight point of
view, can be nettlesome at best. It certainly is for Clayton in the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common ground for these two is something so much more
basic than sexuality. It's a recognition that they're both outcasts
in some way, and that they've come to each other at a moment in
time when they both need to be listened to and loved. The fact that
they can overcome their vast differences and extend that to each
other is what makes the story go beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   With Stuart's comeback, James Curtis' new, nonfictionalized
biography of Whale hitting bookstores, a collection of Universal's
classic horror films touring the country (they hit the Nuart in
West L.A. starting Dec. 4) and ``Gods and Monsters'' in
circulation, Condon hopes that Whale is now finally taking his
proper place in the cinematic pantheon.
</P>
<P>
   A place that the ever-ironic Englishman would doubtless find
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what he would make of all this, 40 years after
being completely obscure and forgotten,'' Condon says. ``But
because his films so fully reflect his personality and his take on
the world, because they are so odd and so out there, I think that's
what keeps them so fresh.''

FOR LUKAS, THE MORE ENTRIES (8) THE MERRIER THE OUTCOME MAY BE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ On the eve of the Breeders' Cup, it was not
clear whether D. Wayne Lukas would win any of Saturday's seven
races with their prize money of $13.2 million. But it was
absolutely certain that he would outnumber everybody else at
Churchill Downs, as he has done in his record-setting past.
</P>
<P>
   The 63-year-old trainer has entered 112 horses in the 14
Breeders' Cup series coming into this year, and has won with 13,
more than any other trainer in the business. He will run eight more
in Saturday's races, five of them in the Juvenile alone.
</P>
<P>
   And he does it all in an almost military manner by arriving at
his barn at 4:30 in the morning, checking by telephone on his
multitude of horses at race tracks around the country, then riding
out to the track here on his pony to supervise the drills of those
in Barn 44, the command post for all that activity.
</P>
<P>
   But five horses in one race? It has been done before _ most
dramatically by Lukas. He ran five in the 1988 Breeders' Cup
Juvenile Fillies, and they finished 1-2-3. He also won the Sprint
and the Juvenile that day, which gave him three winners in three $1
million races. Even in the Kentucky Derby, which is also run at
Churchill Downs, he usually gets there first with the most. In
1996, he entered five horses in the Run for the Roses, and won it
with Grindstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting paid to do that,'' Lukas said, while getting his
small herd ready for their big day at the races. ``But if you took
these same five horses and stationed them around the backstretch to
different trainers and owners, all of them would still rate a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   It still is a neat trick, especially in this era when it is
difficult and expensive to keep any horse together long enough to
run in the Breeders' Cup. But Lukas is a past master at running
multiple entries in races, and he has the honors to show for it. He
also leads all other trainers in prize money won.
</P>
<P>
   In the Juvenile, he will saddle three colts for one client: Cat
Thief, Mountain Range and Tactical Cat for Overbrook Farm, owned by
William T. Young, with whom he has collaborated in the Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The colts in the Juvenile will be coupled as a betting entry. He
also will saddle two other 2-year-old colts for Padua Stable: Yes
It's True and Time Bandit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Juvenile Fillies, he will send out Unbridled Delight, a
daughter of Unbridled, for the Padua Stable. And in the Sprint, he
comes in with Partner's Hero for the Horton Stable and Grand Slam
for Robert Baker, David Cornstein and William Mack.
</P>
<P>
   His success probably stems from his ability to treat each horse
differently, depending on his talent and personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cat Thief is an alley fighter,'' he said the other day. ``Of
all the horses I'm training for the Juvenile, he's probably the
most rugged. And we gave Mountain Range a little more work. He has
run as many as three races in a month, but he hasn't raced since
September. We might get burned, but I think you have to have a
fresh horse.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the 4-year-old Partner's Hero breeze half a mile
the other day, Lukas noted that the colt had won his last two
starts, and said with satisfaction: ``He's dead fit. He's had two
good races. He didn't need much.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Yes It's True, who won five of six but then lost two
straight, he reasoned: ``In a 14-horse field, seasoning becomes a
factor. He has the most notches in his belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has hired a small army of jockeys to ride his horses in
the Breeders' Cup, and it reads like an all-star cast. In the
Juvenile, he has signed Gary Stevens, Pat Day, Calvin Borel and
Shane Sellers, and he even drew Michael Kinane from Ireland.

 &HT;      BOEHNER WILL BE CHALLENGED FOR HIS LEADERSHIP POST
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 -- Congressman John Boehner, R-West Chester,
announced Friday he will seek re-election as chairman of the House
Republican Conference. More than half a dozen members of Congress
have been mentioned as potential challengers to Boehner, who some
Republicans hold partially responsible for the party's losses in
Tuesday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner's announcement came two hours before House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., made public his decision to resign from Congress
-- creating a power vacuum atop the Republican House hierarchy.
Boehner was on route back to Washington at the time of Gingrich's
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Some political observers speculated Boehner might take advantage
of Republicans' dissatisfaction with Gingrich and House Majority
Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, by attempting to move up in the
House G.O.P. leadership. A number of House Republicans had been
promoting Boehner for Armey's spot, which is number two on the GOP
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Boehner) has made it pretty clear that he would welcome the
opportunity to advance in the leadership at the right time,'' said
David Schnittger, Boehner's press secretary. ``He made a
determination today that although some members were openly
encouraging him to run for majority leader, he felt the moment was
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican Conference is scheduled to hold leadership
elections November 18-20. If Boehner is re-elected conference
chairman he will continue to be instrumental in managing coalitions
and public communication for the party.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner did not openly criticize Gingrich or Armey for their
role in Republican losses, but the Washington Post reported Boehner
had called Gingrich Thursday evening and told the speaker he should
consider resigning. Schnittger said the call took place, but would
neither confirm nor deny if Boehner asked Gingrich to step down.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, however, believe Boehner is as much to blame for
Republican losses as other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the Cable News Network's ``Inside Politics,''
conservative columnist and political analyst Robert Novak predicted
Armey and Boehner both will be removed from their leadership posts.
Of Boehner, Novak said ``his image is tainted'' as a result of the
Republicans' poor showing in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategist Frank Luntz also predicted Boehner would
be removed from his position as GOP conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That position is in charge of communications and that is where
the Republicans failed in the last election,'' Luntz said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of potential challengers to Boehner includes House
Republican Conference vice-chair Jennifer B. Dunn, R-Wash.; Rep.
J.C. Watts, R-Okla.; Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Ind.; Rep. George P.
Radanovich, R-Calif.; Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.; and Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y. Only Hoekstra and Radanovich have officially
announced they will run against Boehner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got whipped, and when that happens I think you need to
evaluate everything from the CEO to the janitor,'' said Watts, who
is also considering other leadership positions. ``I'm not willing
to push the panic button, but I think this is an opportunity to
evaluate every part of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boehner has his supporters. Rep. David L. Hobson,
R-Springfield, will actively work on Boehner's campaign and Rep.
John R. Kasich, R-Westerville -- who some are touting as Gingrich's
successor -- already said he will support Boehner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he tried to manage the message for the party he was
countered by Armey and (House Republican Whip Tom) DeLay. (Boehner)
would get furious,'' said an aide to one Midwest Republican who is
likely to support Boehner. ``We need a cohesive message but they
haven't let John Boehner do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boehner camp said it is not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great many members made it known that they didn't consider
John Boehner part of the problem,'' Schnittger said. ``We're very
confident that John will receive the support of a majority of the
conference.''

<P>
   Having second thoughts about your chosen occupation?
</P>
<P>
   You're not alone. A new survey has found that 43 percent of
college-educated workers in the prime of their careers would choose
a different field and college major if they had the chance to do it
again.
</P>
<P>
   And most of those would pick science or technology the second
time around, according to the survey, which was commissioned by
George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., and Potomac Knowledge Way,
a technology and business group in the Washington area. The other
most popular choices for those dreaming of new directions were
liberal arts and business.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey polled 400 employed college graduates aged
30 to 55 who had been in the work force for at least 10 years. Over
all, 51 percent of the respondents said they had switched careers
at least once since college and about one in five expected to
switch in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also reported that workers who were in white-hot
demand _ those in information technology _ felt restless and
unfulfilled, despite being showered with bonuses and other perks.
</P>
<P>
   These workers were almost twice as likely to want to switch
careers as the average employee _ and their choices would most
often be in nontechnical areas like education. Asked for their
reasons, they overwhelmingly cited personal satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent said they would choose different paths for their
own enjoyment; only 26 percent said a new choice would be motivated
by career interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that nontechnical people want to know more about
technology, while technology people are finding there's more to
life than bits and bytes,'' said Alan G. Merten, president of
George Mason. ``The results are a healthy sign that people are
looking to balance their lives and fill in the gaps.'' &QL;

   Social Security's Higher Ceiling &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bar keeps rising. The amount of wages subject to Social
Security taxes will jump to $72,600 next year from $68,400 this
year, an increase of 6.1 percent. That means the maximum tax
withheld from a worker's paychecks will rise by $260.40, to
$4,501.20, according to CCH Inc., a publisher of tax and pension
information.
</P>
<P>
   For the self-employed, the maximum tax will rise by $520.80, to
$9,002.40, half of which is deductible on income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.1 percent increase is derived from a federal estimate of
total wage growth this year.

<P>
   A Slight Climb in Rates
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates began to move up again last week. A survey of 200
lenders by Bank Rate Monitor, the tracking service, found that the
average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose 0.05 percent,
to 6.84 percent, while the 15-year rose 0.09 percent, to 6.49
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest move was in one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, up
0.13 percent, to 5.60 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But rates could drop again, and soon. Brian O'Connor, managing
editor of the company's Web site, www.bankrate.com, said experts
have suggested that slowing housing starts and new-home sales may
prompt lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The market is taking a wait-and-see attitude on rate cuts by the
Federal Reserve, even though Alan Greeenspan, the Fed chairman, has
signaled that the need for a short-term rate cut is not urgent.

ENERGY PLAN GETS A LIFT IN CALIFORNIA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 8) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deregulation of the electricity industry dodged a bullet when
California voters thumpingly defeated Proposition 9 last Tuesday,
73 percent to 27 percent, to the industry's great relief.
</P>
<P>
   The complex model of competition introduced in California last
year is now free to proceed there and in other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept has been sanctified,'' said Dan Scotto, an analyst
for Carnegie, Childs &AMP; Co. ``For two years, many states sat on the
fence. They are now going to feel a lot more comfortable going
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Combined with the defeat of a similar measure in Massachusetts,
the vote was a major setback to consumer groups' efforts to secure
bigger rate cuts for consumers while forcing utilities and their
shareholders to absorb more of the costs of utility plants that are
no longer economically viable after deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities in California will be reimbursed for most of their $28
billion in these costs, known as stranded costs, under a compromise
negotiated two years ago. Consumer surcharges for the reimbursement
spurred much of the support for Proposition 9.
</P>
<P>
   The battle drew attention to a process that had been dominated
by utilities, politicians and regulators. The large industrial
power consumers, who have demanded lower rates, have been the main
force pushing deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Residential and smaller commercial customers have had little
voice in the process, and few have chosen to buy power from the new
unregulated suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the utilities won at the polls, some economists are
beginning to question whether reimbursing utilities for stranded
costs makes sense. Consumer advocates said that they were building
support in spite of the measure's defeat and that they would keep
pushing for a more favorable deal for small ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two million Californians voting for this,'' said Harry
M. Snyder of Consumers Union, a leader in the effort. ``We'll just
keep coming at them.''

   NO. 1 BOOKSTORE CHAIN TO BUY TOP WHOLESALER
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, the United States' largest bookseller, announced
the $600 million purchase of Ingram Book Group, a leading
wholesaler, in a deal that an organization of independent
booksellers denounced as ``devastating'' and an authors group
compared to a wedding of Godzilla and King Kong.

   CREDIT GROWTH ACCELERATES
</P>
<P>
   Consumers picked up the pace of their borrowing in September.
The Federal Reserve Board said outstanding credit grew at a 7.9
percent annual rate during the month, up from August's 4.2 percent
rate and faster than the 5.2 percent average for the year so far.
</P>
<P>
   MARKET'S STRENGTH IS WIDESPREAD
</P>
<P>
   The sharp run-up in the stock market over the last month, which
has returned the Dow Jones industrial average to within striking
distance of the 9,000 level, has given almost every major stock
group big gains. The big exception is the utility sector.
</P>
<P>
   ACCORD ON U.S. FOOD AID FOR RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Russia's economic desperation, Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's aides put aside their pride and concluded an
agreement with the United States for $625 million worth of grain,
meat and other food assistance. Agriculture Department officials
say that without aid the Russians will run out of wheat before
their next harvest.
</P>
<P>
   RULE NEAR ON CHILD SAFETY SEATS
</P>

   After years of negotiations with manufacturers of cars and child
safety seats, the Transportation Department plans to publish a rule

child safety seats in new cars without using seat belts.

   U.S. BANKERS HESITATE ON BRAZIL
</P>
<P>
   As institutions led by the International Monetary Fund prepare a
$30 billion economic rescue package for Brazil, U.S. banks find
themselves sitting on the sidelines. With questions lingering about
the ability of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to reinvigorate
the Brazilian economy, U.S. bankers say they will wait for Brazil
to ask them for more money before any is offered.

   SWEEPSTAKES OPERATOR IS ACCUSED

   The pitfalls of installing enterprise resource planning programs
_ software packages that coordinate a manufacturer's entire
operation _ are legion. Technology and operations workers may find
themselves working at cross-purposes, for example, or management
may fail to set or enforce deadlines. Or maybe the company is
biting off more sweeping changes than it can chew.
</P>
<P>
   Vendors, consultants and rueful been-there, done-that customers
say the companies that avoid the worst headaches have these
characteristics in common. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)The project has a high-level sponsor.(end italics)
``Middle management makes the system work, but middle management
takes its clues heavily from senior management,'' said David
Alschuler, a vice president of the Aberdeen Group, a market
research firm in Boston that has studied ERP installations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)The goals are specific and manageable.(end italics)
For example, a program can be set up to allocate inventory
efficiently _ to large customers first, to high-priority countries
first, or to fill orders as they come in. But it can't do all three
at once. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ (italics)Business changes are made before the software is
configured.(end italics) If the company is about to start selling
over the Internet, for example, the new sales system is put in
place before locking in the way the E.R.P. software will handle
sales and distribution. &QL;

   _ (italics)End-users are on the project team.(end italics) The
system has to do what operations managers need, not what
technologists think they need. ``The I.T. department may be

consulting practice. &QL;

FORMER LOUISIANA GOVERNOR INDICTED IN EXTORTION CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ After an investigation that lasted more than
two years, a federal grand jury Friday indicted former Gov. Edwin
Edwards, his son Stephen and four associates in a racketeering
conspiracy to extort millions of dollars from businesses seeking to
win lucrative riverboat casino licenses in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The 93-page indictment depicts a series of five schemes, each
involving a separate riverboat license, in which either Edwin
Edwards or various middlemen allegedly extorted bribes from
companies bidding for casino licenses. The common thread was
Edwards' ability to either control or influence the decisions of
the state's gaming board, both while he was serving the last of his
four terms as governor and after he left office early in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors contended that one former riverboat casino owner,
Robert Guidry, agreed while Edwards was governor to pay $100,000 a
month to the two Edwardses and a former aide, Andrew Martin, in
order to guarantee that his license would be approved. The payments
began the month after Edwards left office, continued for 15 months,
and were sometimes left in trash cans and Dumpsters for Martin to
retrieve, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1997, the indictment said, an FBI agent watched Guidry
deliver $65,000 to Edwin and Stephen Edwards at a Baton Rouge
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards maintains that he did nothing illegal, that he never
received questionable payments while in office, and that any
payments he accepted from casino companies after leaving office
were for legitimate consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment charges that Edwards and his co-defendants
illegally collected at least $3.1 million in either direct or
laundered payments. It also alleges that Edwards paid thousands of
dollars to a Mississippi man to illegally wiretap the telephones of
FBI agents working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of all 28 felony counts filed against him, the
71-year-old Edwards could receive a sentence of up to 350 years in
prison and fines of up to $7.25 million, and be required to forfeit
the $3.1 million in payments.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Eddie Jordan Jr. expressed confidence that he
would convict the former governor, who was tried twice in the 1980s
but not convicted. Edwards' 1985 trial in a hospital licensing
fraud and racketeering case ended with a deadlocked jury, and a
retrial the following year resulted in acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the prosecutors in the previous case against Edwards,
Jordan will have the use of thousands of hours of taped
conversations from wiretaps and other secret recordings. He also
has the cooperation of four friends and business associates of
Edwards, each of whom pleaded guilty to relatively minor offenses
in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to convict the former governor and the other
defendants on the basis of their own words,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   The irrepressible Edwards, who appeared at the federal
courthouse here immediately after the indictment was issued,
predicted that he would once again prove his innocence. The former
governor, known for being glib under even the direst of
circumstances, indulged his fondness for taunting the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less than I expected,'' he said of the indictment. ``I'm
not charged at all with the Oklahoma City bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards attributed his problems to former friends who could not
withstand the pressure of a prolonged investigation, including
Edward DeBartolo Jr., the part-owner of the San Francisco 49ers
football team, who pleaded guilty last month to failing to report a
felony. Asked how he felt about those who had betrayed him, Edwards
said, ``I have a minimum amount of high respect for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, dapper in a black bowler hat, said Friday's indictment
was a landmark for a state with a storied tradition of public
corruption. The investigation, he said, had exposed ``a pattern of
predatory conduct.'' He added: ``It's important for us to have an
environment in this state where there is a sense on the part of
citizens where they can conduct business without paying public
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   The Edwards investigation is only the latest trauma for
Louisiana's gambling industry, which was born in 1991. Several
riverboats have suffered financial difficulties. The Harrah's
casino in New Orleans, planned as the world's largest, went
bankrupt three years ago when it was only half-built. The project
has since been reorganized, and it won approval to open from the
Gaming Control Board last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the accusations of corruption in the granting of casino
licenses, both while Edwards was in office and under a
reconstituted gaming board appointed by the current governor, Mike
Foster, could be even more damaging.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I am very disturbed by the allegations in the indictments and
the harm done to Louisiana's image,'' Foster said in a statement
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Gaming Control Board and the attorney general have hired a
former federal prosecutor to investigate the original licensing of
Louisiana's riverboat casinos. Three members of the control board
have testified before the grand jury investigating Edwards. Foster
has requested, but failed to receive, the resignations of two of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have suggested that one of those board members
helped State Sen. Gregory Tarver, who was indicted Friday, in
obtaining confidential information about casino applicants
competing against DeBartolo for the state's 15th and final casino
license. Prosecutors say that information was then provided to
Edwards, who in turn sent it to DeBartolo. Another board member may
have had an improper meeting with Edwards about DeBartolo's bid.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo has testified that he gave Edwards $400,000 because he
was led to believe that his pursuit of a license was otherwise
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two Edwardses, Martin and Tarver, the other
men indicted Friday are Cecil Brown, who was Edwards' assistant
when he was governor, and Bobby Johnson, another longtime Edwards
friend. The indictment states that when one casino executive
complained to Brown about the money he had to pay to secure a
license, Brown explained, ``This is the way it's done in
Louisiana.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Edwards said Friday that he had rejected a plea offer from
prosecutors last year, and would do so again if offered the chance.
``I had an opportunity a year ago to make an unbelievably good deal
for myself, with my son getting total immunity with no
responsibility whatsoever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan refused to confirm any offer of a plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor also said he recognized that some observers
may judge his business practices to be ``rather bizarre and a
little bit strange.'' But he emphasized that there were no
illegalities. And he acknowledged that courtroom observers at his
trial are likely to be entertained by what they hear on the wiretap
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had my phones tapped, they had my home bugged, they had
my automobile bugged, they followed me around,'' he said. ``One
good thing you fellows can rest assured of is that whatever
skullduggery, bad habits or things that I have done, they'll know
about because they had me covered from A to Z.''

 DiMAGGIO WORSENS AND MUST STAY IN HOSPITAL AT LEAST 6 WEEKS  
 (bl)  
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Fla. _ Joe DiMaggio's condition has worsened and the
former New York Yankee star is expected to remain hospitalized for
at least another six to eight weeks, according to Morris Engelberg,
his lawyer and friend.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who has pneumonia and a lung infection, will be
sedated for the next four to six days so he can breathe easier,
Engelberg said. DiMaggio, a Hall of Famer, has been in intensive
care at the Hollywood Memorial Regional Hospital since Oct. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg told The Associated Press on Friday that DiMaggio was
``very sick.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, 83, has had pneumonia now for more than three and a
half months, Engelberg said, but initially thought he could shake
it without requiring hospitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Even when he was finally admitted to Hollywood Memorial,
DiMaggio expected to be released within 10 days. He was well enough
to watch the Yankees win the World Series in four games and have a
few visitors.
</P>
<P>
   A week into his stay, Engelberg told The Associated Press,
``He's a stallion; he's tough,'' while predicting a hospital
release for him that week.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio's breathing became mostly labored and he has had to
have his lungs drained several times, Engelberg said. DiMaggio's
breathing now is aided by an oxygen apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer acknowledged fearing for DiMaggio's life at one
point, considering his age and the severity of his pneumonia. But
he contended Friday that doctors _ DiMaggio has six _ had told him
that DiMaggio's life was not in immediate danger.
</P>
<P>
   Engelberg also said the doctors told him that DiMaggio likely
regressed because he tried to be too active after getting out of
bed last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   According to Engelberg, DiMaggio faces a significant
rehabilitation once he is able to leave the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Hollywood Memorial have refused all along to
disclose DiMaggio's condition. Two security guards insure his
privacy, and callers to his room are connected only when they give
a password.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, voted baseball's greatest living player in the sport's
centennial year, 1969, made the most of a 13-season Yankee career
that ended in 1951. He played in 11 All-Star Games and 10 World
Series, and in 1941 he hit in 56 consecutive games, one of sport's
longest-lived records.
</P>
<P>
   On the final day of the regular season in late September, the
Yankees honored him with a Joe DiMaggio Day. The Yankees' principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, surprised him by giving him replicas of
the eight diamond-studded World Series rings that were stolen from
him in 1960.

BOB KANE, 83, CARTOONIST WHO CREATED `BATMAN' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif)  (bl) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Kane, the cartoonist who created Batman the Caped Crusader
and his sidekick, Robin the Boy Wonder, died Nov. 3 at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center in Los Angeles. He was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Batman and Robin, the characters that Kane created with his
partner, Bill Finger, nearly 60 years ago, are some of the
longest-lived comic-book heroes in the world. They are ``up there
with Superman, Mickey Mouse, Bugs Bunny and Oz,'' said Paul Levitz,
the executive vice president and publisher of DC Comics.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York City, Kane attended Cooper Union and the Art
Students League. His first comic strips, ``Peter Pupp'' and ``Hiram
Hick,'' were published in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 he started drawing adventure strips, ``Rusty and His
Pals'' and ``Clip Carson,'' for National Comics. That same year, a
comic-book hero called Superman appeared. Vincent Sullivan, the
editor of National Comics, which also owned Superman, asked Kane
and Finger to come up with a Supercompetitor. They developed Batman
on a single weekend. Kane was 18.
</P>
<P>
   The first Batman strip came out in May 1939 in Detective Comics,
one year after the debut of Superman. Batman's first adventure was
called ``The Case of the Chemical Syndicate.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was another kind of superhero entirely. Batman wasn't as
strong as Superman, but he was much more agile, a better dresser
and had better contraptions and a cooler place to live.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in the Batcave, drove the Batmobile, which had a crime
lab and a closed-circuit television in the back, and owned a
Batplane. He also kept a lot of tools in his utility belt,
including knockout gas, a smoke screen and a radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he had no superpowers, he had to rely only on his
physical and his mental skills,'' said Allan Asherman, the
librarian of DC Comics.
</P>
<P>
   Batman's fictional history, which was created years after the
character himself, was dark. According to Batlegend, under his cape
Batman was really a man named Bruce Wayne who, as a child, watched
as his parents were murdered in the dark streets of Gotham City
while they were walking home from a movie. Traumatized, young Bruce
vowed to avenge their deaths by punishing criminals everywhere. He
studied criminology, trained his body and assembled an assortment
of tools to fight crime in Gotham. One night, startled by a bat
outside his window, he made up his mind to dress up as a bat to put
fear into the ``cowardly and superstitious'' hearts of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Superman is an optimist's myth,'' Levitz said, Batman is
a hero for the guy who thinks ``the world is a tough place.''
</P>
<P>
   In creating Batman Kane said he drew on a number of sources: a
1920s movie called ``The Mark of Zorro,'' a radio show called ``The
Shadow'' and a 1930 movie called ``The Bat Whispers.'' That movie
featured a criminal with a cape who shines his bat insignia on the
wall just before he is about to kill his victims, and who, in at
least one scene, stands on the roof of a building and spreads his
cape out. ``I guess anyone who wears a cape is tempted to do
that,'' Asherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Kane also credited Leonardo da Vinci: ``I remember when I was 12
or 13 I was an ardent reader of books on how things began . . . and
I came across a book about Leonardo da Vinci. This had a picture of
a flying machine with huge bat wings . . . . It looked like a bat
man to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was Finger, Kane said, who chose some of Batman's most
memorable features. He suggested the cape with scalloped edges, the
cowl and the blank white eyes. ``When I first drew him I had eyes
in there and it didn't look right,'' Kane once admitted. ``Bill
Finger said, `Take them out.''' Finger also came up with the name
Bruce Wayne (which, it has been observed, sounds a lot like Bob
Kane).
</P>
<P>
   Robin, the Boy Wonder, appeared a year after Batman. ``He was
basically a younger edition of Batman.'' Asherman said. ``There was
a need for a kid sidekick, so kids could identify with him, and for
a character who would tone down the violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin's story echoed Batman's. Under his costume, Robin was Dick
Grayson, an aerialist who saw his parents fall to their deaths when
the circus failed to pay some racketeers protection money. Bruce
Wayne happened to be watching and offered to become Grayson's
guardian. Robin got a less elaborate costume: a red vest, green
boots, a yellow cape and no tights. But he was a far better flyer.
</P>
<P>
   Batman's villains also had pedigrees. The Joker is descended not
only from the face on playing cards but also, Asherman said, from
``The Man Who Laughs,'' a 1920s movie based on a Victor Hugo story
about a disfigured man in medieval France who moves in royal
circles. The Penguin, Asherman said, was probably inspired by the
penguin who used to be on packets of Kool cigarettes. The Riddler?
Asher had no idea: ``He is just a psychopath who likes to send
riddles to the police.''
</P>
<P>
   For an action comic, the style of Batman was strangely quiet,
and much was made of the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   As the superhero became popular, he began starring in other
venues. In the 1940s Columbia Pictures released two serial films,
``Batman,'' in 15 chapters, and ``The New Adventures of Batman and
Robin,'' also in 15 segments. In 1966 came the television show,
which starred Adam West.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the 1980's there were more Batman movies. And
Batman toys and costumes continue to sell year after year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He adapts to each era,'' Kane said. ``He fights against all
injustices in the world. He fights the battle for the little man.''
But it was not Batman's sense of justice, Kane believed, that made
him so popular. It was his campiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batman and Robin were always punning and wisecracking and so
were the villains,'' he said in an interview in 1965. ``It was camp
way ahead of its time.'' Did that mean he didn't take his
superheroes seriously? ``How could you?''
</P>
<P>
   As Batman's popularity increased, Kane did less and less of the
drawing. Although his name appeared on the strip until 1964, the
work was done mostly by other artists, whom Kane called his
``ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Sanders Kane, an actress;
a daughter, Deborah Majeski of New Jersey; a sister, Doris Atlas of
New York; a grandson, Matthew Alderman, and, of course, Batman,
Robin, the Joker, the Riddler, the Penguin and the Catwoman.

EDITORIAL: MOYNIHAN'S DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 7:
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Patrick Moynihan grew up in Hell's Kitchen on Manhattan's
West Side, trained as a teacher and scholar and served four
presidents as a domestic adviser and diplomat before running for
the Senate in 1976. The Almanac of American Politics describes him
as ``the nation's best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and
its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   The formulation seems a little over the top, but it also fits a
man who always liked to surround his serious concerns with
extravagant language and gestures. Now, at 71, he has announced his
intention to retire in 2000, depriving the Senate of one of its
most distinctive, elegant and independent voices.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan has certainly reveled in the image of cerebral public
statesman, aloof from the muck of politics and patronage. But the
truth is more complex. He has been an astonishing vote-getter who
worked as hard and as effectively, though in his own way, to
deliver for New York as has his colleague Alfonse D'Amato. On the
Finance Committee he showed how New York gets cheated on federal
dollars, and delivered aid and tax breaks for New York's teaching
hospitals, universities and museums. He won billions in
transportation funds, and worked to transform the old Post Office
building in Manhattan into a new Penn Station that could, quite
properly, be named for him.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's announcement may diminish his leverage over the next
two years, and his departure will cost New York's congressional
delegation seniority and influence. But in return he gives both
Democrats and Republicans time to seek a worthy successor.
Moreover, his authority in the Senate has always rested less on his
committee positions than on the power of his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He made auto safety an issue before Ralph Nader. His pioneering
study of breakdowns among black families was first vilified, then
seen as prophetic. With Nathan Glazer he practically invented the
modern study of ethnicity, and warned in his 1993 book
``Pandemonium'' of ethnic conflicts around the world. He has
battled most recently against mindless government secrecy and what
he calls ``defining deviancy down,'' the notion that society is too
tolerant of destructive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The issue driving Moynihan all his career has been welfare and
the poor, and here he leaves a formidable legacy. As a soldier in
the War on Poverty, he came to criticize its obsession with citizen
participation. As President Nixon's domestic adviser he fought and
lost his battle for a guaranteed income for the poor, but later, in
the welfare reforms of 1988, he saw his proposals for work
incentives and child support codified into law.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted President Clinton for focusing on health care instead
of welfare in 1994, advice that many around the president later
wished they had taken. When Clinton signed a punitive welfare bill,
Moynihan declared, ``Shame on the president.'' The happiest aspect
of Moynihan's retirement is that he is certain to remain within
earshot as a teacher, writer and strong voice of public conscience.

EDITORIAL: THE GINGRICH COUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also REPUBS-GINGRICH, REPUBS-LEADERSHIP) 
(bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 7:
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich was swept away by the congressional
equivalent of a barracks coup, and it happened with a speed that
actually merits one of the most overused adjectives in the
political dictionary. It was, in fact, stunning.
</P>
<P>
   Our guess is that earlier in the day, Gingrich was himself
stunned as he measured by telephone the erosion of his support in
the Republican conference that he and such hard-handed deputies as
Dick Armey had run with harsh efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   As he sought votes among the 223 Republican House members who
survived the Tuesday election, Gingrich discovered that it is hard
to spin professional spinners. He had argued that the loss of five
GOP seats rather than the expected gain of 10 to 20 was, in fact, a
good showing. It was only if you accepted his spin that maintaining
razor-thin majority control was a victory. Not even his closest
supporters bought that.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, they thought the Gingrich-endorsed television ad blitz
about the Clinton sex scandal was a huge strategic blunder. So they
forced out the leader who took them to control of the House in
1994. It was a fitting if unpredictable end for a man who always
saw politics as blood combat.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich was the intellectual architect and chief spokesman for
the '94 sweep. He did it by nationalizing the 435 separate House
contests, a brilliant tactical coup that stunned President Clinton
and the Democrats. Then hubris set in. His contempt for
fund-raising laws and House ethics and his role in the 1995
government shutdown frightened the public enough to make him one of
the nation's most unpopular figures. His handling of the 1998
election frightened fellow Republicans enough to make them start
shopping for a new speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The transit of Newt Gingrich from party superstar to repudiated
prophet illustrates how hard it is for a radical, polarizing figure
to last in leadership. He scorned the conventional wisdom of
figures as different as Richard Nixon, Lyndon Johnson and Bill
Clinton about commanding the bipartisan center. ``I am a
revolutionary,'' he crowed. The Democrats, he said, ``are the
genuine reactionaries. We are going to change their world.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, he who lives by macho bluster may be undone
by it. As a matter of survival, Gingrich's fellow Republicans
decided to change his world and save their own. The skills that had
made him brilliant in opposition and cunning in insurrection were
not suited to enduring leadership. The revolution he had started
claimed him.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Gingrich may be more mourned in the White House
than in the Republican caucus. He was Clinton's most reliable foil.
On foreign-policy issues he was often a White House ally. But the
White House also knows that with his passage, much of the energy
will fade from the impeachment process. The Republicans, for their
part, face a leadership struggle and a definitional crisis. From
Gingrich's example, they should see the dangers of ferocious
rhetoric and abandonment of the center. He was, after all, an
expert in how to seize power, but a novice in holding it.

CLINTON SAYS BOMBING SHOULD NOT DERAIL ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton expressed sympathy to Israel
Friday after a car-bomb explosion in a Jerusalem market wounded 24
people but said the attack should not derail the recent
land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the accord that he helped mediate last month
was ``the best way to safety for the Israelis, the best way to
achieve the aspirations of the Palestinians and, in the end, the
only answer to Friday's act of criminal terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Two suicide bombers died in the attack in Jerusalem, which
appeared to be an effort to undermine the Wye agreement, named for
the Maryland conference center where the settlement was reached
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat signed the
Wye River agreement, they knew they would face this moment,'' the
president said, interrupting a bill signing ceremony at the White
House to discuss the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew when they went home, both of them would be under
more danger and that terrorists would target innocent civilians;
they knew they would have to muster a lot of courage in their
people,'' he said, expressing ``my sympathy to the people of
Israel, who this morning were once again the target of a vicious
terrorist attack.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation should live under the threat of violence and terror
that they live under every day,'' he said. ``I ask for your prayers
and support today for the Israelis and the Palestinians who believe
in this agreement and who are determined to carry out their
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Wye accord, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
Israel agreed to relinquish a further 13 percent of the West Bank,
and Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, promised to crack down
on Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had telephoned Netanyahu to express her condolences and to urge him
to move quickly, despite the violence, to carry out the agreement
reached with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The latest terrorist attack prompted the Israeli Cabinet to
delay further consideration of the agreement, a decision that
Albright said was appropriate as long as it was temporary. ``It is
customary for there to be a short pause in the wake of this kind of
attack,'' she said at a news conference after speaking with
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``It is important for the Israeli Cabinet to
resume its deliberations quickly. I believe, based on my
conversations with the prime minister, that he wants to find a way
to do this.''

ONE YEAR LATER, A COUPLE'S DISAPPEARANCE REMAINS A MYSTERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year after Camden Sylvia and Michael Sullivan
disappeared, their loft in lower Manhattan is silent and unchanged,
as if awaiting their return. Their bed, their watercolors, the
table and chairs, stand in the dusty shadows like stage props. A
vase wants fresh flowers. The clothes still hang neatly, unused.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who lived at 76 Pearl St., puttered with plants and
paintings and jogged along the old lanes of the financial district,
were last seen on Nov. 7, 1997, after a dispute with their
landlord, Robert Rodriguez, who is the focus of suspicion by their
friends and the police.
</P>
<P>
   Without bodies or other evidence of a crime, however, police
have been powerless to question the landlord, who cannot be called
a suspect, or even to search his upstate home. By twists and turns,
the case has become one of the strangest and most frustrating in
the annals of New York's unsolved crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But on the first anniversary of their disappearance Saturday,
Ms. Sylvia and Sullivan have not been forgotten. Friends are
planning a vigil, from noon Monday to noon Tuesday, outside their
building to remember them, to protest at the door of Rodriguez's
ground-floor locksmith shop, and to keep the public and police
focused on a case that has been agonizing for many.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to describe the torment this has been for the
family and friends,'' said Kim Magistro, a neighbor and one of the
vigil's organizers, who, like many, voiced frustration with a
stymied police investigation. ``And to think that the prime suspect
is not cooperating, it's not just.''
</P>
<P>
   There are others suffering similarly. In the last year, several
people have disappeared under circumstances that have left families
and friends bereft and emotionally unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   In July an 82-year-old widow, Irene Silverman, vanished from her
East Side town house, and officials say they believe _ but have no
solid proof _ that she was killed by mother-and-son swindlers
seeking her fortune.
</P>
<P>
   And two weeks ago, Kristine Kupka, 28, a pregnant Baruch College
student, vanished after going out with a man believed to be the
father of her unborn baby. Police have no evidence against him, but
relatives and friends of Ms. Kupka's have voiced suspicions and
campaigned to widen attention to the case.
</P>
<P>
   They, too, have been invited to the vigil.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of tragic things happen in life,'' said Charles Delaney,
a neighbor of the missing couple. ``But in most cases _ death at an
early age, a car crash _ people who love and miss the departed ones
have some knowledge of what happened, and are able to have closure.
We have been denied that. We are trapped in a mystery, like
something out of Conrad or Kafka.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago Saturday, witnesses say, Ms. Sylvia, 36, an artist
and real estate agent, and her companion, Sullivan, 54, an actor
and art gallery worker, argued with their landlord over a lack of
heat, and they threatened to withhold the $300-a-month rent on
their fifth-floor, rent-stabilized walkup loft.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, they rented a movie, ``Addicted to Love,'' at a
video store on Park Row near City Hall. Then they disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that they were creatures of habit, that it was
unthinkable that they would go off on an adventure without telling
anybody. In their loft, there were signs they had not gone away:
Sullivan's wallet on a table, a set of keys, a passport, their
clothing in place.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, as detectives sought to question him, Rodriguez
vanished from his home in Slate Hill, Orange County, telling his
family he was going to Manhattan to talk to police. He resurfaced
two weeks later, but has since refused to talk to the police or to
let them search his property.
</P>
<P>
   In a cat-and-mouse game, police have flown over the seven-acre
property in helicopters and sent dogs sniffing around its edges for
something that would provide cause for a search warrant; they also
have questioned 100 potential witnesses and conducted a
wide-ranging search for the couple, all to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   While Rodriguez is not formally a suspect, police have focused
their suspicions on him, saying he has never explained his dispute
or last contacts with the couple, or his own two-week
disappearance. And they assume that the couple were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investigating a missing persons' case technically, but
we are using the resources of the Manhattan South homicide squad,
anticipating that foul play has been employed,'' said Assistant
Chief Kevin Farrell, the commander of Manhattan detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Police have found that Rodriguez bought his loft building in
1993 for $205,000, paying in part with insurance money from a
suspicious fire at his upstate home. They also have reopened an
inquiry into the 1991 disappearance of a Rodriguez associate, David
King, after the two had a business dispute.
</P>
<P>
   But the results of the inquiry into the couple's disappearance
have been disappointing to many.
</P>
<P>
   ``My main frustration continues to be that the police have not
brought in the landlord for questioning,'' said Jerry Goldfeder,
who represents the missing couple's families. ``It's very, very
difficult not knowing whether your loved ones are alive or dead.
There's no closure.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ms. Sylvia's mother, Laurie Sylvia, an advocate for the
disabled, had continued to pay the rent on the couple's loft after
their disappearance. While Rodriguez rejected the payments, he has
made no eviction effort. ``Can you imagine any judge granting an
order of eviction?'' the lawyer asked. ``It would raise questions
as to his motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   So the loft at the top of 76 Pearl St. remains as it was a year
ago. But neighbors doubt that the couple will ever come back to
reclaim it. ``I think my neighbors are dead,'' said Delaney. ``I
think somebody killed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez did not respond to messages left at his shop, but his
lawyer, Joseph Marro, said his client knew nothing about the
couple's disappearance or whereabouts. He said suspicions voiced by
police and others were unfair to Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said Rodriguez last saw Ms. Sylvia on Nov. 7, 1997,
when she gave him a letter complaining about a lack of heat. He
said the landlord let uniformed officers into his building several
days later, when the couple were reported missing, and even
responded to questions at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Police insist that hope is alive, if not for the couple, at
least for a resolution of the case. ``I believe that in time we
will solve this mystery,'' Farrell said. ``A homicide is not closed
until it is solved. The person or persons who are responsible for
the disappearance of Camden Sylvia and Michael Sullivan should not
rest easy.''

RISING STAR LEHTINEN ACCELERATES PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Mike Heika 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So what more do you want from Jere Lehtinen, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars winger has the Selke Trophy to back up his stature as
the best defensive forward in the NHL. His scoring has improved in
each of his first three seasons in the league.
</P>
<P>
   And, the scary thing is, he's just getting started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, we do think he can do a lot more offensively, and we
do think he will do a lot more offensively,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``This is a world-class player here, but he's still
learning the finer points of the game, and finishing is one of the
finer points.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock also says Lehtinen has been the team's best forward so
far this season. Stars general manager Bob Gainey adds: ``Jere
Lehtinen and off-game do not often go in the same sentence
together.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 25 and in his fourth NHL season, Lehtinen could be on the
cusp of superstardom. Heading into tonight's 8:30 road game against
the Los Angeles Kings, Lehtinen probably is the most consistent
performer on the 6-2-2 Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feeds off Jere and his ability to get up and down
the ice,'' said center Mike Modano, who has been teamed with
Lehtinen for three seasons. ``He gives an honest effort every
shift; he never gives up on the puck. It's something to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   If Modano says the team feeds off Lehtinen, what more does the
guy have to do? Well, that's part of the problem in assessing
Lehtinen. Nobody really knows what more he can do. He has shown
quantum leaps of improvement each season, so there's no telling
what the top end is for the quietly tough native of Espoo, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once a European player makes the adjustment to the smaller
surface, you really see his strength come through,'' Hitchcock
said.
</P>
<P>
   Where Lehtinen is beginning to see improvement is in goal
scoring. He made an impressive step last season, going from 16
goals in 1996-97 to 23. Through 10 games this season, he is tied
for the team lead with four and on pace to score 33. Just as
important, his shot totals have jumped from 134 to 201 to a
projected 230 this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am feeling more confident now, shooting more instead of
passing,'' Lehtinen said. ``Of course, I try not to think about
things, just react on ice. The shots are just coming naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock might expect the game to come naturally to Lehtinen
because of athletic prowess. He has led the Stars in preseason V02
(the body's ability to process oxygen) scores every season. He has
the lowest percentage of body fat on the team. His legs are bionic,
teammates say.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't believe the comments on both benches when he's
out there,'' Stars defenseman Craig Ludwig said. ``He never gets
tired. He gets run over and gets right back up. He never stops
working. You can see someone lose the puck and look over the
shoulder and say, `Oh, Jere will get him.' And then he does.''
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the style that won Lehtinen the Selke Trophy last
season and had him ranked third in balloting for the same award two
seasons ago. Now, he is trying to adapt those skills into making
himself a more dangerous offensive threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in trying to size him up in statistics or on paper is
missing the essence of his game,'' Gainey said. ``Will he get
better? We think he will. But you don't want to pass over the
subtleties in his game trying to get something or somewhere else.
Maybe the best thing about Jere will be watching him develop as a
player.''

STOLID LOUISIANIAN LEADS LIST OF POTENTIAL SPEAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Fla., Calif., N.Y., S.C.)  (lb) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All year long, Rep. Robert Livingston made no
effort to mask his lean and hungry look.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm running whether they like it or not,'' the Louisiana
Republican declared in his genial, plodding way last March when he
ignored the warnings of shocked party leaders that he dare not go
around openly campaigning to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can sew it up,'' Livingston announced serenely, months
before many caucus members were ready to listen to him in his
unalloyed ambition.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept to his rounds and they are listening now, reeling
from the trauma of Tuesday's election failures and the even bigger
aftershock of Gingrich's decision to resign the speakership Friday
night in the face of the uprising brought to a head with
Livingston's public challenge of his old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him dearly,'' Livingston declared in disowning the
knife-wielding role of a Brutus in confronting Gingrich with the
message that his leadership time was over.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican scramble that followed, talk emerged of a
flood of other possible candidates, but none would prove so bold as
Livingston in daring to bell the wily gray cat in the first place.
His boldness forced Republicans to weigh the tempting possibility
of forgoing an all-out fight in favor of someone as unsensational
as Livingston _ an 11-term, 55-year-old traditionalist who quietly
cuts legislative deals as if politics were carpentry, not the
thrust-and-chop martial arts that Gingrich often seemed to prefer.
</P>
<P>
   In the first wave of potential rivals, other lawmakers being
mentioned included Bill Archer, the Ways and Means chairman,
Christopher Cox of California, James Talent of Missouri, and
others, with one of Livingston's lieutenants spreading the word
that a host of national Republican leaders had been calling
Livingston encouragingly in the wake of the election.
</P>
<P>
   The callers supposedly included Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and
his brother, Jeb, the governor-elect of Florida, as well as Govs.
George Pataki of New York, John Engler of Michigan and Tommy
Thompson of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it comes down to leadership,'' Livingston said gently in
formally throwing down the gauntlet, sounding as taciturn as an
anti-hero in a black-and-white Western. By nightfall, Gingrich had
decided not to put up a fight.
</P>
<P>
   In his long, unspectacular months of campaigning for the
speakership, Livingston slowly measured House Republicans' wariness
at the clenched-fist image of Gingrich that, they feared, was
giving voters ever deeper pause at the Republican voting lever.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Livingston's supporters found him soothingly
colorless in announcing his challenge. He talked of being a
``stay-at-home'' House manager, a ``straightforward'' caucus
leader, but, mercifully in the view of Gingrich critics, hardly
another ``revolutionary'' to generate heated headlines from the
ramparts.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans far from settled on their new speaker, the
stolid Livingston presented his own sales pitch as a politician
whose instincts run to fiscal fine print more than combative sound
bites.
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich was spending the past four years fatally
compounding his reputation for scrappiness, Livingston was serving
as chairman of the Appropriations Committee, building power as the
``Pope of Congress'' with ranking authority over the ``cardinals,''
the 13 subcommittee chairmen who handle the nation's major fiscal
legislation. ``He holds the checkbook,'' one member noted
reverently.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a dedicated study in gray amid a day of Republican
turmoil, indeed offered himself as a pontiff of sorts for House
Republicans _ a leader who supporters say could best bridge jagged
party factions, cut back on aggressive oratory and deliver major
bills to passage.
</P>
<P>
   As Gingrich was toppled, rivals were already targeting
Livingston as just the sort of legislative technocrat,
wide-spectrum compromiser and backroom friend of Democrats whom the
revolutionaries of 1994 loved to castigate. But stark Republican
losses in the last two congressional elections had dampened the
fervor of revolutionaries and moderates alike for the style of
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a party that might be ready to have a
low-profile speaker,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough, one of the most
outspoken firebrands from the 1994 Contract With America class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given Bob Livingston more hell than anybody, but now
we want the trains to run on time,'' said Scarborough, a Florida
lawmaker, echoing one of Livingston's mundanely phrased speakership
promises. Scarborough said the election on Tuesday delivered the
bitter lesson that Republican campaign attack advertisements were
no substitute for solid delivery on the workaday issues dear to
voters.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Livingston understands the House and offers something closer
to the style of Tom Foley and Tip O'Neill,'' added Scarborough, a
tooth-and-claw conservative incongruously appreciating two former
Democratic speakers for their skills in managing their party's
agenda. It remains to be seen whether other conservatives agree or
opt for candidates more sharp-edged in their partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the challenge remains Livingston, who was on the
verge of quitting politics last year in favor of a lucrative
lobbyist's job when Gingrich convinced him to stay. Gingrich
indicated he might run for president in 2000, leaving Livingston a
peaceable path to the speakership. After the shrinkage of the
Republican House majority by the voters, however, Livingston put
his simmering ambition on full boil.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Newt, we've had a very partisan, confrontational
atmosphere,'' said Rep. Ron Packard of California, who has been
active all year in garnering private promises of support for
Livingston. ``Now, with our margin reduced, we just don't have a
lot of wiggle room. Bob's ability to work with all parts of the
conference is even more necessary if we're going to get things
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Packard said a symptom of the problem was Gingrich's decision to
emphasize an attack message about President Clinton's impeachment
inquiry in the closing hours of the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were never consulted on whether to spend a lot of money on
those Clinton ads,'' he said, citing House Republicans' resentment
of Gingrich's imperiousness. ``We were never even asked.'' In
contrast, he insisted, Livingston would be a model of
inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's tendency to be overlooked can serve him well. In
the controversial ``train wreck'' budget showdown of 1995, when
Republicans were blamed for shutting down the government,
Livingston was hardly the great compromiser as he thundered in
debate, ``We will stay here until doomsday!'' But it was Gingrich,
not his appropriations chairman, who came to personify the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Livingston would come across to the public as being reassuring
_ he carries no baggage,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., waiting to
see how the field of candidates might develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Newt, we could never really break loose,'' King said.
``We couldn't get back on the offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's past fights include staunch support for the Reagan
administration's aid to the contra fighters in Nicaragua and for
the proposal for a vast ``Star Wars'' missile defense. But he has
survived more as a fiscal conservative than as a social-issue
ideologue _ a politician whose leadership style has the quality
more of a cement block than of a flaming comet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public had simply decided not to listen to Speaker
Gingrich,'' said another House Republican firebrand, Lindsey Graham
of South Carolina, in a political eulogy rooted in an appreciation
of Livingston as just the lackluster man of the hour the
Republicans needed. ``Newt was our Moses: He led us toward the
Promised Land but did not quite get there himself.''

U.S. WEIGHS MOVE TO TRY PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Justice Department officials are discussing whether
to seek the extradition of Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of
Chile, in connection with four killings that took place under his
regime more than 20 years ago, Justice Department officials said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   They said the move could take place if Pinochet is set free by
Britain's House of Lords, which is reviewing a request for his
extradition on genocide charges filed by Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the killings under discussion took place in Washington in
1976. The victims were a former Chilean foreign minister, Orlando
Letelier, who had escaped the Pinochet regime and worked at a
liberal research institute, and his American colleague, Ronni
Moffitt.
</P>
<P>
   They were blown up in a car about a mile from the White House,
by a time bomb detonated by two members of the Chilean secret
police. The former chief of the Chilean police, Manuel Contreras,
went to prison three years ago for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   In the two other killings, which took place in Chile, the
victims were two Americans who disappeared in the 1973 coup that
swept Pinochet's military government to power. They were Charles
Horman, a 31-year-old Harvard graduate working in Chile as a
filmmaker and writer, and Frank Teruggi, who like Horman was
associated with a left-leaning magazine published in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The film ``Missing'' was based on the story of Horman's
disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said the move could take place if
the British House of Lords rejects Spain's request to extradite the
82-year-old general, who ruled Chile from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are discussing the extradition of Pinochet as a backup if
he gets immunity in the U.K.,'' said a Justice Department official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It's one of the options we
are discussing.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Justice Department spokesman, Bert Brandenberg, said the
issue is under consideration at the middle ranks of the Justice
Department. The move has not been formally discussed or approved by
Attorney General Janet Reno or by the White House, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suits have been filed against the retired general by at least
seven European countries. In Spain, Switzerland and France,
prosecutors have asked for his extradition. Pinochet was arrested
in Britain on a Spanish warrant three weeks ago. Spain's national
court ruled last week that he can be tried in Spain on genocide
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Chile's goverment has acknowledged that more than 3,000 people
died or disappeared as the general, his troops and his secret
police crushed dissent after taking power. The dead included some
foreigners _ Spanish, French and American citizens among them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Pinochet case has few precedents. Attempts by nations to
bring foreign rulers to justice for crimes against humanity are
excursions into uncharted legal waters. It is uncertain how or
where Pinochet could be tried if he is released by Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the Justice Department ``could open up a can of
worms'' in secret U.S. government files, a former senior U.S.
intelligence officer who served in Chile in the 1970s said.
President Richard Nixon, his national security adviser, Henry
Kissinger, and the CIA were deeply involved in attempts to
overthrow the elected president of Chile, Salvador Allende, a
Marxist, before he was killed in Pinochet's 1973 coup.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was keenly aware of the murder and torture committed by
the Pinochet regime, said the retired intelligence officer, who
asked that his name not be published.
</P>
<P>
   ``The torture that they used was completely barbaric,'' he said.
``But their army felt that they were in a war and the guys that
they captured and tortured and killed were guys that would have
killed them if they could. And Pinochet was the head honcho so he's
responsible for that war.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet cannot be tried in Chile. He has immunity from
prosecution as a senator-for-life, a job that he created in a
constitution that he shaped before he ended his 17-year
dictatorship and stepped down in 1990. A British court has ruled
that he has absolute immunity from prosecution as a former head of
state. A five-judge panel in Britain's House of Lords is hearing an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Chilean secret police organization that killed Letelier and
Moffet, the directorate of national intelligence, worked closely
with the CIA in Chile, sharing intelligence on suspected
communists. It was disbanded in 1977. Thousands of U.S. government
files on the era remain secret.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 8, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION-REVIEW _ After a year of misery and distraction, White
House aides repeated this joke with unabashed, glee given their
surprising good fortune in last Tuesday's elections: ``The Monica
Strategy: It worked.'' The reality is that _ intended or not _ an
election that had been billed as a referendum on Bill Clinton ended
up as much a referendum on the Republican Party. The verdict: A
traditional and pragmatic Republican agenda of fiscal conservatism
is in. A single-minded focus on social issues is out. By Richard L.
Berke. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-REVIEW _ After more than two years of hearings into
apartheid-era atrocities, the commission last week unveiled a
3,500-page report naming dozens of people it believes were up to
their elbows in the gore but never applied for amnesty. So, the
prosecutions should begin soon, right? Not so fast. The five volume
study was barely in the hands of President Nelson Mandela before
talk of new amnesty deals had begun. It seems that virtually all of
South Africa's political parties _ including the ruling African
National Congress _ have key officials who could end up in the dock
because of the commission's report. Suddenly, there is lots of talk
about how the country really can not withstand a round of
politically divisive trials, and many political analysts here are
betting that an agreement ``of mutual benefit'' is in the offing.
By Suzanne Daley. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FINANCE-MINISTERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ This is supposed to be the
Age of the finance minister. In the mythology of the 1990s, they
are the titans of this unnamed era following the post-cold war. In
many countries these days, the guardians of the treasury are
running the show. By David E. Sanger. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-GAMBLING-REVIEW _ When California voters approved a
measure last week giving Indian tribes broad permission to run
casinos unhampered by state control, it was a big loss for the
Coalition for Unregulated Gambling, one of the measure's fiercest
opponents. By Timothy L. O'Brien. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEMS-BLACKS-REVIEW _ What a difference a decade makes. In the
late 1980s and early 1990s, Democrats fretted that they had been
soundly thrashed in three successive presidential elections because
the party had become too closely associated with black people, thus
driving away white voters. This year, blacks have became the
Democrats' new best friends. The party spent millions of dollars
advertising on black radio. Congressional candidates were urged by
party leaders to make as many appearances as possible in black
neighborhoods. By Steven A. Holmes. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GAMBLING-WORKOUT-REVIEW _ Amid the hundreds of exhibits at the
recent World Gaming Congress and Exposition, no new products better
summed up gambling's place in the American psyche than the ``Pedal
'N Play'' cycle and the ``Money Mill'' treadmill. What better way
to get the heart pounding and the palms perspiring than to wager
money while exercising? The stationary cycle and the treadmill both
have slot machines attached, allowing casino customers to sweat and
bet at the same time, or as they say in gambling parlance, to
``stay in action,'' even while they're working out. By Brett
Pulley. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-LAW-REVIEW _ Britain may have passed for the moment on
joining Europe's new currency, the Euro, but this doesn't mean
Brits are immune to the winds of change. Even the Royal Family will
feel the bite of progress this month when the monarchy loses its
centuries-old right to all whale carcasses found on England's
beaches. This little known provision of English law _ which further
stipulates that the head goes to the king and the tail to the queen
_ is but one of hundreds of obscure laws that will become null and
void when parliament passes The Statute Law Repeals Act of 1998, as
it is expected to do in the next few weeks. By David Wallis. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HURRICANES-REVIEW _ A natural disaster as terrible as Hurricane
Mitch, which killed more than 10,000 people in Central America in

SPORTS COLUMN: A FAR CRY FROM THE FUN OF THE DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ This is Churchill Downs, but somehow the place
has a different feel and texture this week. Not so light and
effervescent, as when it is host to the event for which it is so
widely known _ the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   This is a different atmosphere. There is the familiar early
morning buzz of activity as grooms, trainers and practice riders
move through the bone-chilling dawn air in brisk, syncopated
rhythms, getting the horses ready, moving them out, bringing them
back in. But what you feel is not excitement but tightly wound
tension, the tension of a truly great competition. Instead of the
Derby, it is the 15th Breeders' Cup _ in particular, the
mile-and-a-quarter Classic, which is being portrayed as one of the
great horse races of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby attracts a crowd of about 140,000 on the first
Saturday in May; the seven races in this Saturday's Breeders' Cup
will draw half that many. A large number of those who attend the
Derby are not horse racing fans but tourists, or students who crowd
the infield, or novices drawn by the lure of an event that has run
nonstop for 123 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby is a party. The Breeders' Cup, especially this one, is
not. It's a celebration of racing at its finest, but no party. The
mood, like the weather, is crisp, clear and highly focused. ``This
is like the races of races,'' said the trainer Patrick Byrne, who
will have a significant role in Saturday's drama. ``This is more
about the industry, the breeders, the core racing fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The featured event Saturday afternoon is a long-awaited meeting
between Skip Away, the 1997 Classic winner and the loser of only
one race this year, and Silver Charm, the 1997 Kentucky Derby and
Preakness winner and the 1998 winner of the Dubai Cup. They're
competing in a field of 10 horses that is being called one of the
strongest ever assembled. The Breeders' Cup Classic hasn't seen a
drumroll like this since Sunday Silence edged Easy Goer in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic had one other highly anticipated duel, and it also
lived up to expectations. In 1987, Ferdinand and Alysheba staged
the first race between two Kentucky Derby winners. Ferdinand, a
year older than Alysheba, beat him by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made over the financial implications of the race:
if Skip Away finishes third or better, he overtakes Cigar and
becomes the first race horse to earn $10 million. Earlier in the
week, R.D. Hubbard became the first owner to pay an $800,000 fee
for the right to run a horse in a race when he supplemented
Gentlemen into the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I'm not intrigued by the financial implications of this
great race. In fact, I'm tired of financial implications as a
marker of an athlete's value _ be they human or be they horse. The
most compelling dimension of this Breeders' Cup is that, in the
Classic, it is providing one of the great showdowns in racing
history: Skip Away; Silver Charm; Gentlemen, with his 13 victories
in 23 career starts; Awesome Again, a Byrne horse who is undefeated
in five starts this year; Touch Gold, Byrne's other horse in the
race and the winner of the Belmont Stakes a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   We're looking at the equivalent of undefeated teams meeting in
the Super Bowl, or the perfect-game pitcher facing the champion
home run hitter. This is one of those days _ too rare in horse
racing, boxing and track and field _ when the best meets the best.
</P>
<P>
   The low-key Byrne is right in the middle of it. Last year at
this time he was reveling in the glow of seeing his 2-year-old
horse, Favorite Trick, win the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, a victory
that clinched Horse of the Year honors for the horse and Trainer of
the Year honors for Byrne. But Byrne had to abandon Favorite Trick
when he signed a five-year contract to become the trainer for Frank
Stronach.
</P>
<P>
   Friday afternoon, Byrne admitted that he was feeling the
pressure, not simply of having two horses in the Classic, but of
the weight of having been a king and trying to do it again. ``Once
you've hit the big times and you start to produce these major
stakes winners, you're expected to turn out stakes winners,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have four running tomorrow and expect to have a good shot
in the Classic and the Sprint,'' he added. But, good chance or not,
that tension was there, and Byrne acknowledged it, attributing it
to the uncertainty of the seven races and the knowledge that in a
race of the Classic's magnitude, with an unprecedented field, even
the very best effort might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the thing about horse racing,'' he said, walking back
to his stable. ``Anything can happen. You just never know.''

 &HT;    Gingrich bows out as speaker
 &HT;    `I won't allow them to cannibalize party'
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich, the political revolutionary who took
the House by storm, stunned the nation Friday by deciding to end
his reign as speaker and probably his congressional career as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, 55, made the surprise decision late Friday afternoon,
just three days after he easily won re-election Tuesday to an 11th
term in the House and Republicans retained their majority in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   But they suffered an unanticipated loss of five seats, and
rivals for his job as speaker and harsh criticism of his leadership
surfaced almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Once-loyal followers who waxed ecstatic over his visionary
leadership this week said they would not vote for Gingrich again.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich passed the news on to Republican leaders in an early
evening conference call.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm in the way of your success. I'm stepping
down,''' said Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Linder and other members said Gingrich told them he would resign
his seat, but a Gingrich aide said that decision has not yet been
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unlikely he will serve out his full term,'' said Andrew
Weinstein, a Gingrich spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   If Gingrich were to give up his seat, it would likely set off a
lively fight in Georgia's 6th Congressional District. Georgia
Republican Party Chairman Rusty Paul said he would meet this
morning with party activists who want him to run.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 4:30 p.m., Gingrich aides were talking up Gingrich's
campaign to remain speaker and pointing out some of his rivals'
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety minutes later, they listened to their boss, via telephone
from his Marietta office, explain that he was abandoning the fight.
``There was shock, sadness and some moist eyes,'' one staff member
said. ``There was also a sense of relief, because he sounded
relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   In his chat with other House members and top Republicans,
Gingrich said the disappointing election results had unleashed a
stream of ``bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke of unnamed Republicans who were trying to divide the
party into warring conservative and moderate factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't allow them to cannibalize the party,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   He concluded the 20-minute conversation this way: ``I will miss
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In a public statement, Gingrich said, ``The Republican
conference needs to be unified, and it is time for me to move
forward where I believe I still have a significant role to play for
our country and our party. My party will have my full support, and
I will do all I can to help us win in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's immediate plans were unknown Friday night. But Linder
said his longtime friend, with whom relations frayed this week
following the election, indicated he and his wife, Marianne, may
take a six-month break.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in some ways the speaker's alter ego, praised
Gingrich in the wake of his announcement. ``Newt Gingrich has been
a worthy adversary,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich forced his way into public prominence soon after his
election to Congress in 1978 as a thorn in the side of Democrats
and Republicans who were not as aggressive as he would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   He moved from back-bencher to the number-two job in the
Republican minority. Then, poised to take over as minority leader,
Gingrich led a Republican takeover of the House in the 1994
election, ending 40 years of Democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   His installation as speaker was more coronation than election as
he reaped the credit of the Republican victory.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, legislative blunders and an ethics scandal
almost robbed Gingrich of his leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   He survived, however, defying predictions as he had time and
again. Many Republicans believe he would have prevailed again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston (R-La.), the House Appropriations
Committee, announced his candidacy Friday. ``We must choose between
inspirational speeches and perspiration-filled achievement,''
Livingston said at a news conference outside the Capitol, just
hours before Gingrich spread the word of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer (R-Texas), another powerful committee chairman,
will make up his mind over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to replace Gingrich is expected to intensify in the
days leading up to the Nov. 18 vote for leaders in the next
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich confidantes said the speaker had no doubt he could have
won a third term. ``He reasoned that he could not effectively lead
the conference following a divisive fight,'' said former Rep. Vin
Weber, who spoke to Gingrich Friday afternoon.

NYC AND TOPLESS BAR CLASH OVER ADULTS-ONLY CLAUSE IN LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The City Council is moving to repeal the adults-only
clause of the law restricting sex-related entertainment to thwart a
recent court ruling allowing a topless club to stay open by saying
it would admit minors.
</P>
<P>
   But the club's lawyer said the proposed revision would subject
the law to further constitutional challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The latest maneuvering over the city's campaign to curb
sex-related businesses was prompted by a ruling Wednesday by state
Supreme Court Justice Stephen Crane of in the case of Ten's World
Class Cabaret on East 21st Street.
</P>
<P>
   The city had tried to close the club, citing a ban against such
businesses within 500 feet of a church. But Ten's argued that its
policy of admitting minors meant the club was exempt from the law
because part of its legal definition of sex-related businesses is
that they exclude minors. The judge agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani denounced the ruling as absurd, ordered
the city to appeal and predicted that Crane's decision would be
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, City Council Speaker Peter Vallone announced that the
council was preparing to delete the exclusion of minors from the
legal definition. He said that he would present the change to the
council on Thursday and that it would take about two months to wend
its way through the land-use review process, which includes
Planning Commission approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spirit of our city's zoning regulations on adult
entertainment businesses has been misinterpreted, and that is a
shame,'' Vallone said. ``Anyone who thinks a strip club is an
acceptable place to bring children is not using common sense. I
have instructed my land-use and legal staff to immediately draft
remedial legislation to amend the zoning text so that this type of
legal maneuvering does not have an unintended result again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer for Ten's, Mark Alonso, said he would welcome the
revision, which he said would make the law unconstitutionally
broad, barring most movie theaters from showing R-rated movies and
Broadway theaters from running shows with nudity. ``That means the
testing of the entire constitutionality starts all over again,'' he
said
</P>
<P>
   Another critic of the law, Norman Siegel, the executive director
of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said the proposed change
``opens the door to additional legal and constitutional
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Vallone said his revision would proceed even if the
mayor's court appeal overturned Crane's decision. But later,
Vallone's spokeswoman, Carolyn Daly, said the council was preparing
the revision as a backup in case the court appeal failed.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor continued his attack Friday on Crane's decision.
``Common sense would dictate that an adult establishment that is
involved in sexual activities does not become any better because
children are brought in,'' he said.

GINGRICH WON'T SEEK HOUSE SPEAKER'S POST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the firebrand leader
of the Republican revolution in 1994, decided Friday amid a
rebellion by his once-loyal followers to step down as speaker at
the end of this term.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning fall after a spectacular rise from the back
benches of Congress to the apex of national politics, Gingrich
agreed to relinquish power in the face of an insurgent challenge
Friday from Representative Bob Livingston of Louisiana, his
longtime friend and ally who is chairman of the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Defiant at first, Gingrich abruptly abandoned the fight after he
struggled to rally the GOP rank-and-file behind him and received
only tepid support. He informed House Republicans of his decision
to step down in a conference call at about 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I have reached a difficult personal decision,'' Gingrich
said in a brief, written statement afterward. ``I will not be a
candidate for speaker of the 106th Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who is also expected to leave the House in January
after a tumultuous, 20-year career, immediately tossed the
Republican caucus into turmoil with his momentous announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, GOP lawmakers rushed to telephones and
microphones to cast themselves as possible successors to Gingrich
and members of his highly vulnerable leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Cox of California, chairman of the
House Republican Policy Committee, quickly announced his candidacy
for the speaker's job Friday night. Notable among the others
considering pursuing the speaker's gavel are Representatives Bill
Archer of Texas, chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee; John Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the Budget Committee;
and James Talent of Missouri, chairman of the Small Business
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several GOP members were urging House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde to enter the free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's resignation came just days after the House GOP
suffered damaging losses in the midterm elections, a setback
Gingrich attributed in part to his own miscalculations. Many
Republican lawmakers also blamed Gingrich for House GOP losses in
the 1996 election and for what they described as lackluster
legislative results in the 105th Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican conference needs to be unified and it is time
for me to move forward, where I believe I still have a significant
role to play for our country and our party,'' Gingrich said. ``My
party will have my full support and I will do all I can to help us
win in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who has said he will consider running for president in
2000, made his announcement in the midst of a House impeachment
investigation of President Clinton, an inquiry that Gingrich
vigorously supports but much of the public apparently disdains.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who clashed often with Gingrich and sometimes benefited
from casting the conservative Georgian as the enemy of mainstream
initiatives, issued a statement noting Gingrich's greatest
achievement: leading the way as Republicans seized control of
Congress in 1994 after languishing in the minority for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary, leading the
Republican Party to a majority in the House, and joining me in a
great national debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st
Century,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The House Democratic leader, Representative Richard A. Gephardt
of Missouri, issued a statement that underscored the raw
partisanship that has consumed much of the chamber's proceedings in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich's resignation as speaker was the aftershock from
Tuesday's political earthquake,'' Gephardt said. ``The American
people sent a strong message that the Repubican Congress was a
failure, that its leadership didn't address the issues they cared
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the uprising against Gingrich, his top lieutenant,
Representative Dick Armey of Texas, also came under attack, as
Representative Steve Largent of Oklahoma, announced he will try to
wrest control of Armey's job as majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Other House Republicans were scrambling to topple nearly every
member of Gingrich's leadership group, from the GOP conference
chairman to the chief of the House Republican Campaign Committee.
Some of the aspirants were among a group of conservatives who
engineered a failed coup attempt against Gingrich last year.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the members of Gingrich's leadership team, the only one
considered likely to survive is House Minority Whip Tom DeLay of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The House GOP caucus will vote by secret ballot on Nov. 18 for
speaker and the other leadership posts. The full House will vote in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot say that I have a majority,'' Livingston said in a
news conference on Capitol Hill before Gingrich's announcement.
``But I do believe when the dust settles, you will see that I am
the next speaker of the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Livingston and Largent, who entered Congress in 1994 after
a Hall of Fame career in the National Football League, ended the
day trying to protect their flanks from rank-and-file rivals after
beginning the day attacking Gingrich and his leadership allies.
</P>
<P>
   Largent said ``the Republican party hit an iceberg'' in the
elections with Gingrich's team at the helm. ``The question before
our conference today,'' he said, ``is whether we retain the crew of
the Titanic or look for some new leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he will fight for his job, although he was given
little chance by some of his colleagues of faring any better than
Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Gingrich initially balked when Livingston
suggested in a recent conversation that he yield the speakership
without a fight. ``I don't believe he entertained it for more than
12 seconds,'' Livingston said.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after Livingston announced his candidacy, Gingrich's
spokeswoman, Christina Martin, said, ``The speaker was obviously
saddened by today's announcement,'' particularly because of his
``long and close relationship'' with Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   It was Livingston who helped organize support for Gingrich that
helped him stave off last year's coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Gingrich announced his resignation to lawmakers on
the conference call Friday, he was ``obviously distressed,''
according to one GOP member who participated in the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the bitterness out,'' Gingrich said during the
call. ``It is clear that as long as I'm around that won't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Christopher Shays of Connecticut, one of only
four House Republicans from New England, took part in the
conference call after privately expressing reservations about
Gingrich's leadership for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt played a huge role in bringing us into the majority,''
Shays said after Gingrich's public announcement. ``But he has been
the story for far too long. Tonight he did something honorable and
appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Gingrich's possible succesors, Cox, who has a conservative
voting record over his five terms in the House, is seen by many
colleagues as more conciliatory than Gingrich or Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   As for Archer, he said, ``I will spend this weekend with my
family considering how I can best serve our nation and the low-tax,
less-government cause in which I believe.''

COMMENTARY: BIRDS' HAVEN IS HEADACHE FOR TENANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Too bad pigeons don't head south for the winter. Then
Silvia Medrano's family could get a good night's rest.
Unfortunately, a brood of cooing birds poked and clawed their way
into a part of the roof that hangs over her third-floor apartment
in a Brooklyn housing project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, my aunt came here to stay,'' Ms. Medrano said.
``She got up at night and said someone was trying to open the door.
She said: `Listen. Get a knife, there's a man coming in!' I told
her no, it was just the pigeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Medrano has put up with the birds for a year. Ragged bits of
roofing dangle outside her windows, which stay closed and streaked
because of the unending pile of pigeon droppings. The birds make
such a scary racket at night that her daughters have abandoned
their bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   This Hitchcockian headache is among the causes taken up by a
tenant group in the Hope Gardens housing project in Bushwick. While
other residents have been spared the birds, they have not been so
lucky in staying dry. Leaky roofs and ceilings in some buildings
once forced tenants to open their umbrellas on rainy days just to
step into the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   The city's Housing Authority has embarked on a $13.5 million
repair and modernization program that should be completed by March.
But with winter approaching, members of Hope Gardens Leaders for
Action want to meet with Ruben Franco, the chairman of the city's
Housing Authority, to discuss what emergency measures are planned
for those buildings that have yet to be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked many, many times to sit down with him and get a
grasp of what the Housing Authority is going to do,'' said Msgr.
John Powis, a clergyman from the neighborhood who helped organize
the tenants. ``We want to push him hard to say what is going to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hope Gardens Leaders for Action is not the officially elected
tenant association for the mostly low-rise complex spread over a
30-block area of Bushwick that was devastated in the 1970s. Members
said they formed their alternative group not to supplant the
officially elected association, but to spur action on problems they
suspected resulted from shoddy construction.
</P>
<P>
   When it opened in the 1980s, the complex was a dramatic
departure from the towering projects that had become infamous
failures across the nation. Pleased as they were with the complex,
tenants soon discovered that poor insulation left them shivering in
the winter, gutters and roof panels were stripped away by high
winds and water dripped through the seams in the ceiling panels.
</P>
<P>
   ``This started small five years ago,'' said Maria Melendez, as
she pointed to tiny cracks in her ceiling. ``They never came to fix
it.'' Her downstairs neighbor has a similar problem; the walls
around her windows are soft to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Ms. Melendez said, showing a soggy box of curtains on
her closet floor. ``You tell me if I don't have a right to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   That has been one of the biggest complaints from her group.
Organizers said they had been subtly rebuffed by city officials,
who urged them to work with the officially elected tenant
association. In 1994, an official with the Housing Authority
claimed _ incorrectly _ that federal regulations prohibited city
officials from meeting with anyone but the official association.
Hilly Gross, a Housing Authority spokesman, said, ``We absolutely
disown'' that comment, adding that the agency would now endeavor to
schedule a meeting with the group.
</P>
<P>
   But members of Hope Gardens Leaders for Change were frustrated
enough with city officials that they appealed for help from the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the federal agency
that provides $1 billion annually to the city. Bill de Blasio, who
is the HUD secretary's representative for New York and New Jersey,
inspected the development and found merit in the group's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been open with the Housing Authority that there has
not been the best communication on this,'' de Blasio said. ``We
believe they are better served to have met with them, not to the
detriment of the official tenant association, but to engage them.
Some of this information might have helped put them at ease and
helped the Housing Authority understand what's happening on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Medrano would prefer they look a little higher _ exactly
three flights up. Her patience is as ragged as the roof, where the
pigeons await the winter.

US TO HALT DEPORTATIONS TO CENTRAL AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER   AND ALISA VALDES-RODRIGUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, reacting to appeals by
governments hard hit by Hurricane Mitch, decided Friday to
immediately stop deporting foreign nationals to the Central
American nations.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to urgent requests from Senator Edward M. Kennedy,
Representative J. Joseph Moakley and Cardinal Bernard Law, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to stop deporting
residents of Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala at
least through Nov. 23.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, congressional sources said, the administration is
poised to grant ``temporary protected status'' to visitors from all
four countries, which would block their deportation for six months
or longer.
</P>
<P>
   The policy affects tens of thousands of Central American
students, tourists, business people, and individuals who are
visiting friends and families across the country.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 12,000 undocumented Central Americans living in
Massachusetts will be affected by the ruling, according to Juan
Gonzalez, director of community eduction for Centro Presente, a
Cambridge organization that provides services for Latinos. Most
Central American immigrants here live in East Boston, Somerville,
Chelsea and Worcester.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter by lawmakers to Attorney General Janet Reno, they
wrote: ``The governments of Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and
Guatemala should not be burdened by the deportation of their
nationals at this time. All their efforts must be concentrated on
burying the dead, caring for the injured and homeless, and
rebuilding the infrastructure destroyed by torrential rains and mud
slides.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a move had been requested by Honduran President Carlos
Flores, whose nation was perhaps the hardest-hit by the storm,
which killed thousands and left more than 1 million people
homeless. Much of the region is in the throes of a public health
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   David Leavy, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
a final decision had yet to be made on granting the foreign
nationals ``temporary protected status,'' which is generally
extended to visitors from countries that are wracked by civil
strife or natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   But Leavy said Reno is consulting with the State Department and
``actively considering'' recommending that ``temporary protected
status'' be granted.
</P>
<P>
   The policy does not prevent the government from deporting
foreign nationals for reasons of national security or public
safety. That means foreign nationals involved in criminal
activities would continue to be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who is the highest ranking Democrat on the Senate
subcommittee on immigration, led the anti-deportation effort after
speaking several times in recent days with Cardinal Law, who toured
the devastation in Honduras on Thursday and in Nicaragua Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley, who was instrumental several years ago in securing
``temporary protected status'' for refugees from government
repression in El Salvador, joined Kennedy and Cardinal Law in the
current effort.
</P>
<P>
   The US move was met with a mixture of relief and skepticism by
those working with undocumented Central American immigrants in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, of Cambridge's Centro Presente, and others said it was
a logical decision, given the devastation in Central American, but
stressed that the time the immigrants should be allowed to stay in
the US must be extended ``indefinitely, until economic and
political conditions improve enough to ensure them a safe life
there.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 8,000 Massachusetts-based Guatemalans, Hondurans and
Salvadorans on a list of people involved in a local lawsuit brought
by the American Baptist Church against the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, for allegedly discriminating against them
in doling out refugee status.

NO ROOM LEFT FOR WILLIAMS NOW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ If the Red Sox are pursuing free agent center fielder
Bernie Williams, that's news to the incumbent, Darren Lewis, who
Thursday signed a three-year, $7 million deal to remain with the
club.
</P>
<P>
   ``That never even came up,'' said Lewis, who brought a Gold
Glove-caliber defense to the Red Sox last season and was rewarded
with a contract that is to pay him $2.1 million in 1999, $2.4
million in 2000, and $2.5 million in 2001, a quantum leap from the
$500,000 he was paid in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happens in the offseason is that there is a lot
of speculation this time of year,'' Lewis added. ``The Boston Red
Sox signing me this early shows me they want me to come back and
that they appreciate what I did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season was the first time in his career Lewis, who doesn't
have the arm for the position, played right field. He made 46
starts there and said that at times, he felt uncomfortable. He had
only one assist in right, and all three errors he made came while
he was playing there.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it would seem to be a stretch to believe that the Red Sox
are targeting Williams, who won a Gold Glove in center for the New
York Yankees, though one party familiar with Boston's plans says
the American League batting champion should not be dismissed as an
option if Mo Vaughn goes elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis did not rule out playing right field. ``You guys realize
I'm going to do whatever it takes to win,'' he said. ``As for where
I'm going to play, it doesn't matter. I know Jimy (Williams) knows
that, and I know Dan (Duquette) knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's agents spoke Friday with both the Dodgers and Angels,
though it is unlikely anything will heat up until the general
managers' meetings, which begin tomorrow in Naples, Fla. There was
no word on whether they spoke with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are also pursuing free agent lefthander Randy
Johnson, while the Dodgers Friday signed free agent center fielder
Devon White and would seemingly need to unload both salary (Bobby
Bonilla) and a first baseman (Eric Karros) to make room for Vaughn.
The Orioles also have interest in Vaughn, but new general manager
Frank Wren also wants the team to have more athleticism and is
talking to Williams as well.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said it was never his intention to leave the Red Sox, even
though he filed for free agency after declining a club option that
would have paid him $1.1 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about going anywhere else,'' said Lewis,
adding that he doesn't believe his agents heard from any other
clubs before he signed with the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``My time in Boston, I really enjoyed my teammates, the coaching
staff, and I enjoyed the city. I had a great time playing there.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Lewis was a White Sox teammate of Albert Belle, the
free agent left fielder whose agent has spoken with the Red Sox.
Lewis paused before answering whether Belle would be a good fit
with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to comment on that,'' he said. ``I don't have
anything to do with the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``But playing with Albert Belle, he was one of the fiercest
competitors I've ever played with on a day-to-day basis. Off the
field ... I don't have a comment on that. Basically, that doesn't
have anything to do with me. But he's a great ballplayer, a great
ballplayer.''

NYC PUBLIC ADVOCATE WINS RIGHT TO SEE POLICE FILES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a ruling embraced by Public Advocate Mark Green as
confirmation of his mandate as a city watchdog, a state appellate
court has ruled that the New York Police Department must grant the
Public Advocate's request _ nearly two years old now _ to review
the case files of hundreds of police officers suspected of
misconduct or brutality.
</P>
<P>
   A four-judge panel of the Appellate Division of State Supreme
Court ruled unanimously this week that the public advocate ``is
entitled to the records in question in furtherance of his
independent duties under the New York City Charter.'' That ruling
upheld a decision issued in January by state Supreme Court Justice
Edward Lehner, who ruled that the public advocate was entitled to
the records in his capacity as both ``a watchdog over city
government and a counterweight to the powers of the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the administration of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who frequently
suggests that the public advocate's post is a waste of tax money
and office space, plans to continue to appeal. Whether it will be
successful remains unclear; because the decision was unanimous, the
city must seek the permission of the Appellate Division to bring
the case to the state Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Although this case focuses primarily on the distribution of
power in city government, it is one in a series of legal battles in
which the Giuliani administration has resisted releasing
information that could be seen as embarrassing. Elected officials,
members of the public and news organizations, including The New
York Times, have fought with the city _ often in court _ for access
to public information.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, Marilyn Mode, the Police Department's deputy
commissioner for public information, said the public advocate's
request was denied because `` Green's motivations are political.''
She added, ``We're going to appeal it.'' When asked what she was
basing her assessment of Green's motivations on, Ms. Mode answered,
``Our feelings and his track record.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of appeal did not temper Green's exuberance
during a news conference Friday at City Hall. He called the ruling
the ``most important legal decision'' in the history of the office
of public advocate. His role, he said, ``is supposed to be a
vigilant ombudsman, watching City Hall, cutting red tape and
getting essential information.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's opinion is decidedly less grandiose; he has often
suggested that the public advocate's office is more of a municipal
annoyance than anything else. And several months ago, the mayor
asked his own charter revision commission to consider proposing the
elimination of the office. That request went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, Green asked for records that would help him
assess how the Police Department handled complaints of brutality
and misconduct that had been substantiated by the Civilian
Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   He sought the records after learning that in the first half of
1996, the department declined to take action in 53 of 96 cases in
which the independent review board had substantiated and
recommended discipline. Police Commissioner Howard Safir has since
maintained that the civilian board's investigations were sometimes
poorly conducted, and that the department had to prove a case
beyond probable cause to punish an officer.
</P>
<P>
   The city refused Green's request, and said that providing the
records would jeopardize the confidentiality rights of police
officers under the state Civil Rights Law. Green's offer to have
the identities of the officers blacked out did little to resolve
the matter, and he sued the city in May 1997. Green contends that
the charter grants him the right to seek such records _ which are
not available to the public _ directly, in keeping with his
responsibility as an internal monitor of city government.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Koerner, the city's chief assistant corporation counsel,
said Friday that the lawsuit raised a ``novel issue'' regarding the
structure of city government. He also said that Green could always
have gained access to the records by asking the Council to issue a
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no guarantee of that with this administration,'' said
Joe DePlasco, Green's spokesman. Besides, he added, the larger
point is the right of the public advocate to the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now five judges have upheld that decision,'' he said. &QL;

 &HT;    Defense to get boost; Hall, Crockett ready
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons defensive tackle Travis Hall returned to
practice Friday, but before getting too excited, fans should
remember he practiced the past two Fridays as well.
</P>
<P>
   But he missed the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Friday practices are not in pads, and involve no serious
contact. That said, Hall, who had surgery last Saturday to remove a
piece of debris from behind a kneecap, looked comfortable and was
not one of four players placed on the early inactive list for
Sunday's game at New England (5-3).
</P>
<P>
   A decision likely will be made Sunday morning between Hall and
first-year man Shawn Swayda.
</P>
<P>
   ''Travis could play, but if he does it will only be in spots,''
coach Dan Reeves said. ''He would be used the same way Swayda will
be if he's active.''
</P>
<P>
   That means defensive end Lester Archambeau (6 feet 5, 275
pounds) will move inside for the second straight week to tackle,
and John Burrough (6-5, 275) will get his second straight start at
end.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver-punt returner Todd Kinchen, who suffered a
concussion last Sunday, will play.
</P>
<P>
   Strongside linebacker Henri Crockett, who has missed the past
six games after dislocating his wrist, will play, but won't start.
Craig Sauer will.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver-punt returner Tim Dwight and CB Ronnie Bradford,
will miss their second consecutive game each with sprained medial
collateral knee ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Early inactives
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' early inactive players are Bradford, Dwight, rookie
safety Omar Brown, and center-guard Dave Widell. The Patriots'
early inactives are wide receiver Vincent Brisby (broken finger),
wide receiver Tony Brown (ankle), fullback Tony Carter (knee
surgery), and wide receiver Terry Glenn (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   Pats update
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are still uncertain about the status of defensive
end Willie McGinest, who has missed the past two games with a groin
injury. He practiced this week, but is not assured of playing.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Henry Thomas, who has a sprained ankle, did not
practice all week, and is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   New England's pass rush has suffered miserably (no sacks last
week against the Colts) without McGinest and backup defensive
tackle Brandon Mitchell, who broke his foot two weeks ago. Also,
outside linebacker Henry Slade, who has had knee problems, is
battling a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Starting defensive tackle Chad Eaton (6-5, 300), a college
teammate of Falcons center Robbie Tobeck, has actually become a
pillar. He was drafted and cut by Arizona in '95, claimed and cut
by the Jets that season, and finally spent that season on the
practice squad in Cleveland. In '96, he was on the Pats' practice
squad, playing a little late. Alas, Eaton has a sore thigh now. ...
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Todd Collins enrolled at Georgia in '88, left after
breaking his foot, went to Tennessee and then left there for
Carson-Newman, had 99 tackles last season, and has 51 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sellout coming?
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have sold more than 66,000 tickets for next Sunday's
home game with the 49ers (NFC West). Chances are excellent that it
will become the team's first sellout in more than three seasons.The
Falcons last sold out a game Oct. 29, 1995, a 28-13 loss to Dallas.
Atlanta must sell roughly 3,600 more tickets by 1p.m. Thursday to
have the NFL lift its local TV blackout for the first time in 25
Falcons home games. All remaining tickets are in the upper deck at
prices of $30 and $20 (top seven rows).
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Shocking fact of the day: There is only one player from the
Falcons' 1996 draft still on the team _ strongside linebacker Craig
Sauer, who took over for injured Crockett. From the '95 draft,
Hall, Burrough, and safety Devin Bush remain. Running back Jamal
Anderson is the only remnant from the '94 draft, and there are none
left from the '93 draft. That means if everybody were healthy, the
only starters from the last four pre-Reeves drafts would be
Anderson and Hall. Of the 53 players on the active roster, 38 have
joined the team in the past two seasons. ... After Sunday's game,
the Falcons play their final seven games in domes, four at home,
one in New Orleans, one in St. Louis and one in Detroit.

 &HT;    `I'm having one of my best years'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons weakside linebacker Cornelius Bennett isn't
playing like a man who had a troubled offseason. Or maybe he is.
Maybe he decided he had something to prove after spending 35 days
in jail last spring for sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year veteran from Alabama, who went to four Super Bowls in
nine seasons with Buffalo, he said before the season he is a
changed man after becoming a reborn Christian. He's definitely a
changed linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett is leading the Falcons with 67 tackles, 14 more than
middle linebacker Jessie Tuggle, who has led Atlanta nine years in
a row. Bennett's on the field more than any other defender except
for cornerback Ray Buchanan and free safety Eugene Robinson, and
his role has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the first half of last season, the 6-foot-2, 237-pounder
is rarely called upon to blitz and instead is being used in pass
coverage. That's why he has no sacks, after getting seven last
year, and 62.5 in his career, including 36.5 his first five years.
</P>
<P>
   He also plays in the nickel and dime defenses and is doing so
well in the base defense that first-round draft pick Keith Brooking
can hardly get on the field. In Sunday's game against the Patriots,
Bennett will be matched often against tight end Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution talked with Bennett, who has
played in New England more than any other Falcons player.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're on pace to tie your career high of 134 tackles (1995),
yet you have no sacks. How would you assess your play?
</P>
<P>
   A: I feel good, to be 33 years old. I'm not all banged up and
nicked up. It's hard to compare to previous years. Last year, I had
(six) sacks by this time, but I'm making a lot of tackles this
year. I'm proud of myself in the open field. I hope people don't
judge me by my sacks. Overall, I think I'm having one of my best
years.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why do you think your role has changed?
</P>
<P>
   A: I've been asked to do a lot more covering (of backs and tight
ends). Used to be, I just used my natural ability and instincts,
but now I understand coverage schemes and see things better, and I
can still run.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Typically, you play weakside, or away from the tight end, but
Atlanta figures to play a lot of ``nickel'' against the Patriots so
you'll see a lot of Ben Coates. What's the most important thing in
slowing him down?
</P>
<P>
   A: They move the tight end around quite a bit, and I'm glad I'm
familiar with his style of play. He's physical, he likes to push
off, so I'm going to have a talk with the officials before the game
to remind them that's part of his game. If they let him do it, they
need to let me do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What effect did your offseason have on the season you're
having?
</P>
<P>
   A: What happened in the offseason has nothing to do with this
season. I'm just part of the puzzle here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Come on.
</P>
<P>
   A: Of course it's different because I no longer practice those
bad habits. I'm weighing in every week at 237; last year it was
242. I'm not putting those bad things (alcohol, junk food, etc.) in
my body, and I'm getting my proper rest and getting to work early.
I've got guys teasing me about having so much energy in practice,
but I know what it's attributable to _ my change in lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As an AFC East alum, you've played at Foxboro Stadium quite a
bit. What can you tell your teammates about the Falcons' last
outdoor game before closing the season with seven straight in
domes?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's not the best field to play on _ we should take a
couple of pairs of shoes. This time of year, the field never dries
out. The frost hits it every night, and the moisture just sits
there, and then the next day it gets soggy. The (fans) are kind of
close to the field; it's a nice stadium for football as far as fans
are concerned. They can get a little rowdy.

 &HT;    Second 67 jumps Fryatt to the front
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ It's becoming considerably more meaningful for
Edward Fryatt than a mere tuneup for the finals of PGA Tour
Qualifying School in two weeks. Leading the Subaru Sarazen World
Open by two shots after 36 holes, Fryatt, 27, has positioned
himself for potentially the biggest weekend of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But guess who isn't sweating. Fryatt has played his way around
the world, winning the China Open and Malaysia Open this year as a
regular on the Asian Omega Tour, and visited countless places where
drinking the water is more dangerous than playing over it.
</P>
<P>
   What could transpire over the next two days _ winning $360,000
and joining a list of Sarazen champions that includes Frank Nobilo,
Ernie Els and Mark Calcavecchia _ is nothing but a mind-boggling
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows who I am,'' Fryatt said Friday. ``You guys didn't
know who I was until this week. If anything, there's pressure on
those PGA Tour guys to do well. I'm just going to relax, make some
good swings, hit it in the fairway and enjoy myself.''
</P>
<P>
   A stroke behind Bob Tway when play began Friday, Fryatt managed
his second straight 67 to move to 10-under-par 134. Tway remained
solid with 2-under 70. Fryatt birdied four of his first five holes
Friday, making an opening statement by draining a 40-footer at No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to roll it up close and it happened to fall
in from just off the fringe,'' he said. ``It's so nice to shoot two
67's and not hit it that great. I've been fortunate that the putter
has been really hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Three strokes off the pace are Scotland's Andrew Coltart (68)
and Argentine Ricardo Gonzalez (68). Smyrna's Stewart Cink (68),
Greg Turner of New Zealand (72), Germany's Bernhard Langer (72) and
Peter O'Malley of Australia (67) are among those tied for fifth at
4-under 140.
</P>
<P>
   The cut came at 4-over 148, with 56 players advancing. Among
those just hitting the cut were two-time champion Nobilo of New
Zealand (76-72), former Georgia Tech player Tripp Isenhour (77-71)
and Germany's Sven Struver (73-75).
</P>
<P>
   Prominent players missing the cut included American Tom Kite
(74-75_149), Scotland's Sam Torrance (75-75_150) and Sweden's
Mathias Gronberg (72-79_151). Defending champion Calcavecchia has
spent a quiet 36 holes, shooting a 74 Friday to stand at 2-over
146.
</P>
<P>
   While Fryatt is relatively unknown on this continent, his
biography is as worldly as his schedule. He lives in Las Vegas but
is a citizen of the United Kingdom, born in England. Despite a
missed cut at the U.S. Open, a 33rd-place finish at the Memorial
and 16 missed cuts in 25 events on the Nike Tour, his colleagues do
not minimize his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played with some of these so-called no-names and I know
they can win,'' Cink said. ``They're not professionals for nothing.

 &HT;    Swaim is top Junior in ARCA
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The junior league of stock-car racing dominated the
Winn-Dixie 250 at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Friday. Mike Swaim Jr.,
the 22-year-old son of veteran Daytona Dash driver Mike Swaim,
outdueled Bobby Hamilton Jr., 21, the son of Winston Cup driver
Bobby Hamilton, to get his first ARCA win in just his seventh
start.
</P>
<P>
   Swaim took advantage of quick pit work to move from fourth to
second place during a caution midway through the event and was able
to hold off Hamilton, who lost ground after being penalized for
running past his pit stall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave Blaney's Busch (Grand National Series) crew pitted the
car for us, and that was the biggest key,'' Swaim said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no better feeling, no matter what I've accomplished,
than to see my son be successful,'' Swaim said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton Jr., who started from the pole and led 40 laps, had his
dad on the radio giving driving advice.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Kimmel, who had clinched the ARCA season championship
before Friday's race, finished third after leading the middle
portion of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The race was slowed six times, and 52 of the 102 laps were run
under the yellow caution flag.

 &HT;    Earnhardt Jr. on fast track
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dale Earnhardt Jr. strutted toward the video camera in
front of his hauler, got near the overhead microphone and recited
his line, ``Do you think you can handle it?''
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR TV promo required only five takes. Then ``Little E''
signed autographs and posed for photos with fans. After that, none
other than Miss Winston stopped by the truck to chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's causing a stir,'' Earnhardt's PR woman, Teresa
Underdown, said. ``Miss Winston doesn't come to the Busch garage
very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the benefits of being stock-car racing's next big thing.
Little E will move to Winston Cup next year with a $10 million job.
But first he has to complete his undergraduate studies.
</P>
<P>
   The next-to-final exam is today's Stihl 300 Busch Grand National
Race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Earnhardt qualified sixth for the
event at 185.592 mph in the No. 3 Chevrolet. Winston Cup veteran
Dick Trickle starts on the pole in the No. 64 Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt leads the Busch series by 146 points over Matt
Kenseth, who starts on the outside pole today, and needs only to
finish 17th in the two remaining races to win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real happy, because that takes a lot of the pressure off
in the last couple of races,'' Earnhardt said, ``allowing us to
focus on the weekend instead of the whole championship picture. It
makes it makes it a little easier to sleep at night, knowing you
don't have all that pressure on you. I ain't saying we're just a
top-five team every week, but 17th ain't too difficult for this
team.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he believes his car is in good shape, and the
driver is, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The car is good enough, good enough for 17th. I feel good,
anxious to get the race started. It's tough to pass on this track,
but the more laps we get around on it, the more comfortable we feel
about running side by side and stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Little E clearly is enjoying himself as he matures into a
national figure. He said the TV spot he cut Friday for NASCAR
wasn't his first.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty easy,'' he said. ``Normally, they got a whole
mess for you to memorize. I didn't go into stock-car racing to
become an actor, but that's part of the job.

 &HT;    Craven to honor Steelers' No. 58
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Next season, Ricky Craven will be in a car bearing the
No. 58 in honor of Jack Lambert, the once-ferocious linebacker for
the Pittsburgh Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Ford team is owned by Scott G. Barbour, who owns a
Florida-based company that sells jet engines andparts to major
airlines. He's a big Steelers fan and was especially fond of
Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   The team, based in Huntersville, N.C., already has four cars
built. It will debut in the NASCAR exhibition race in two weeks in
Japan and be driven by Rich Bickle. Barbour sponsored Bickle in two
Craftsman Truck Series this year and will put him in Busch series
car for the season finale Nov. 15 at Homestead, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Craven had a miserable year in 1998. He started out in the No.
50 car, suffered a concussion at Atlanta Motor Speedway in the
Primestar 500 in March and missed the next 12 races with
post-concussion syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   He came back in July to win the pole for the Jiffy Lube 300 at
Loudon, N.H., but finished 29th. He drove three more times before
being fired by Hendrick Motorsports. Craven has subbed for the
injured Ernie Irvan the last two races in the No. 36 Pontiac. He
qualified 40th Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Green gets a ride
</P>
<P>
   David Green will drive the No. 41 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for the
1999 Winston Cup season. He drove the car four times as a
substitute driver for Hedrick Motorsports. Green finished 26th in
the car last week at North Carolina Motor Speedway. The week
before, he drove it to its best qualifying spot of the season,
ninth, at Phoenix. Green, 40, was the Busch Grand National champion
in 1994 and was second in 1996, when he was named Most Popular
Driver. He was a runnerup to Mike Skinner for Winston Cup Rookie of
the Year in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy in the compound
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Kennedy, crew chief for Kyle Petty's car, will move to the
No. 7 Ford after Sunday's race, replacing Pete Peterson. Peterson
has been the No. 7's crew chief since April, when he replaced Tim
Brewer. Kennedy will make his debut with the No. 7, along with
driver Michael Waltrip, at the NASCAR exhibition race Nov. 22 in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   They said it
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know how the rule change affects the car until
Sunday. The more I think about it, the more sense it doesn't make
as to why they did it ... there still are a lot of us battling for
some crucial spots in the point standings.'' _ Jeff Burton

 &HT;    Rookie Irwin takes pole
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ That rookie Kenny Irwin started in March with a
fifth-place finish in the Primestar 500, he built on Friday at
Atlanta Motor Speedway, winning the pole for Sunday's season-ending
NAPA 500.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin put his first career pole on the board with a lap of
193.461 mph on the 1.54-mile high-banked superspeedway. Ward Burton
was second-fastest in 193.400.
</P>
<P>
   Completing the top five were Dale Jarrett at 193.083 in a Ford,
Mark Martin at 192.113 in another Ford and Mike Skinner at 192.105
in a Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who clinched his third Winston Cup championship
last week at Rockingham, starts 21st.
</P>
<P>
   Although still a rookie, familiarity with the new Atlanta track
worked in Irwin's favor Friday. In last year's race, after the
reconfiguration of AMS, he qualified eighth and finished 27th. In
the spring event, he ran fifth despite qualifying 28th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to run this race last year, so the more time we have at
the tracks the better out of the box,'' Irwin said. ``The more time
I can learn these tracks and the more I can figure these race cars
out, the better we get each week.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been an uneven year for the Robert Yates Racing rookie. He
had three top-10 finishes in the first 15 races, but only one in
the past 16.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's outside pole performance was the best for a Pontiac,
but it came as no surprise. He has two poles, both on
superspeedways, and has three top-10 finishes in the past five
events _ second at Charlotte, seventh at Daytona and Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just gave the pole away,'' Burton said. ``I'm still real
happy; I'm just a little disappointed at the same time. On the new
rules, I don't think any of us have any idea how much a difference
they will make until we practice in the morning. You're going to
have side-by-side racing here anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was well off his usual qualifying performance, but it
made little difference to the new champion. A huge amount of
tension is removed from his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved and excited at the same time,'' Gordon said.
``We're still putting pressure on ourselves to run well here. We
were running in the top 10 in practice, and we're a little
disappointed with our qualifying efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the new rules regarding taller spoilers and lower front
air dams to improve handling, Gordon said he doesn't think any
changes would make the track what it was before the
reconfiguration. ``I'm not saying this is bad. It's just that this
configuration is never going to offer the type of racing they've
had here before.''

 &HT;    Racing now a numbers game
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While NASCAR drivers and owners ponder the fairness of
multicar teams in stock-car racing, the controversy has grown
beyond the sport's inner circle to the pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Pat Evans, who runs a ministry named Racing with Jesus,
writes a column in an auto-racing tabloid. He quotes scripture,
sells merchandise and covers wide-ranging topics: illegal welfare
recipients, night racing, multicar teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of us agree that multicar teams are not good for
the sport, crowding out worthy single-car teams as they do,'' the
Rev. Evans wrote in his column. ``Multicar teams also siphon off
sponsorships that should go to deserving single-car teams. ...
Multicar teams have such a huge advantage in research and
development over single-car teams, it is a wonder any single-car
teams still exist in Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he hear an ``Amen''? Certainly, in the garages and haulers
of the single-car teams.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a hot issue for NASCAR, because the concept of
successful one-owner, one-car competitors has started to go the way
of convertible racing. Only about 20 single-car operations remain.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Roush Racing has five cars, Felix Sabates' Team Sabco
and Hendrick Motorsports have three cars each, and at least five
team owners enter two cars in each race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair,'' said Cale Yarborough, who has just one
victory in more than 10 years as a single-car owner. ``It makes it
tough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tell the tale:
</P>
<P>
   _ The top nine drivers _ and 11 of the top 15 _ in the Winston
Cup points standings are involved with multicar race teams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Multicar teams have won 28 of the 32 races in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ The past four Winston Cup championships have been won by one
of Hendrick Motorsports' three drivers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, the top seven drivers in the Winston Cup point
standings were members of teams that entered two or three cars in
every event.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1997, 27 of the 32 races were won by drivers who were
members of multicar teams.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of multicar garages are many, including shared
resources of research and development, fewer employees per car and
more opportunity to test the cars. They also have more money to
entice crew members to jump teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of keeping good people continues to escalate,'' said
Bill Elliott, a driver-owner from Dawsonville. ``Most of the tool
boxes are built with wheels on them.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR limits owners to two cars under their own names, but
multicar owners get around that rule by registering other cars in
the names of relatives, including wives. Bill France Jr., president
of NASCAR, said a strict ownership rule would be too hard to
enforce. ``We tried to investigate this ownership thing once, and
the string led us everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jack Roush only has the 6 car in his name,'' NASCAR spokesman
Jeff Motley said. ``Roush Racing has five cars that work out of
that company shop. We're in a free-enterprise system. If somebody
wants to build a race shop, build 10 race cars, and they're fast
enough to qualify for the race and they buy NASCAR licenses and
have approved drivers, then I don't know where it would be our
place to tell them they can't race.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabates predicts that by the year 2000 there won't be a
competitive single-car team left in NASCAR. Richard Childress, who
owns two cars, said he'll probably add a third next season. ``lt'll
come to a point where if you don't have two or three teams, you're
going to be pretty much in trouble,'' Childress said.
</P>
<P>
   That's making the one-car owners and drivers feel like New York
City cabs running into Godzilla's toe. And they aren't happy about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten out of hand,'' said Darrell Waltrip, the
once-dominant driver whose brief career as a team owner ended
earlier this season when he lost his sponsor. ``And I'm sure it
will get more out of hand if they don't do something, make a rule
saying that one owner can only own two cars.''
</P>
<P>
   The multicar teams make a mockery of NASCAR's limit of seven
test runs at various tracks. That number obviously is multiplied
for the multicar teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's so disruptive,'' driver Derrike Cope said.
``We're a one-car entity. I'm probably going to get to test at
seven race tracks. The Roush teams have tested every week
somewhere, and there's like five teams that are testing. On a
recent week off, two of their cars were testing at Sears Point, one
was in Michigan, one was in Richmond, and one was in Dover. When
you do that, you compile all that data, you're blanketing all the
race tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR should eliminate testing altogether,'' Yarborough said.
``Open up the race track a day before we're going to qualify, and
everybody gets the same amount of time to test.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR is studying a proposal that would give each team seven
testing sessions, but only three will be at tracks of the teams'
choosing. NASCAR will allow teams four ``manufacturer'' tests at
Daytona, Talladega, Charlotte and Indianapolis. Each team will be
allowed two cars and one transporter per test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in whatever we do is to try and establish more
control in knowing who goes where and when, with whom,'' said Kirk
Triplett, director of operations for NASCAR. ``The whole thing with
the testing policy is economics.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR also is expected to police which teams participate, but
that's only half the battle.
</P>
<P>
   There also are growing concerns that the competitive edge of
multicar teams could undermine the integrity of racing. Millions of
dollars are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Eyebrows and voices were raised last season, when Mark Martin
slowed enough at Texas Speedway to allow teammate Jeff Burton to
make up a lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what racing's all about,'' Waltrip said. ``It's
supposed to be everybody against everybody. This is not a team
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip stops short of saying teammates can control a race. ``I
guess you could manipulate a race,'' he said. ``Certainly, no one
is in control of what happens mechanically or things that go on
around you. But we've seen teammates working together. I remember
the Hendricks cars going 1-2-3 at Daytona; they kind of sucked up
on ol' Bill Elliott. ... If I was NASCAR, I'd be concerned about
that. This is supposed to be, `Drop the green flag (and) let the
best man and the best car win.' Nobody wants to see any hanky-panky
in the middle of all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cope, who drives on a one-car team, takes a dim view of
teammates helping teammates. ``The guy who lets a teammate help him
to get a lap back has no confidence in his own ability and his
car,'' Cope said. ``Obviously, at the speedways, where drafting is
an important factor, it's a bit more important to know where your
teammates are, if you get a drafting partner to come up there and
do the dance with you.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR has heard all of this. Officials contend that the
organization can't control a free-market system but that it is
policing fair competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with helping a teammate by drafting with
them at Daytona or Talladega,'' Motley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) if you're talking about a guy deliberately blocking
someone to let his teammate go through,'' he said, ``we certainly
would not allow that to happen. If we saw something like that
happening, we would step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at Texas, Martin let Jeff Burton get his lap back,''
Motley said. ``But I've seen drivers allow non-teammates to do
that. That's certainly not hurting any other competitor. If you're
doing something to help a competitor without hurting any other
competitor on the track, then I don't know what's wrong with that.
We've got a lot of gentlemen's agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a gentlemen's agreement that when the caution flag
comes out that you don't race a guy on your lap back to the line.
The leader can race back to the line, and a guy can race him back
to get his lap back. If a caution comes out, maybe the leader
doesn't want to race back to the line because our gentlemen's
agreement says that the car behind him isn't supposed to pass him,
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Those same type of ``agreements'' existed in the 1950s, when
NASCAR encountered its first multicar concept. Carl Kiekhaefer, a
millionaire manufacturer who got into auto racing to sell his boat
motors, built a team of the best drivers and mechanics for his six
Chryslers. His team won 52 races in 1955 and 1956, including 16 in
a row in '56.

 &HT;    Time to talk seriously, Corbin says
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA and its players are going to try again next week in New
York to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent forward Tyrone Corbin said Friday he was notified
Thursday night of an executive board meeting for the players
association Sunday night, preceding a negotiating session on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Corbin said he is going up with a commitment to work out a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sat in a room and talked, but we haven't really
negotiated fully,'' he said. ``I think it's time for us to do that,
because the season's getting away from us. I'm going to urge the
guys to sit down with the league and stay at it until we have an
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbin said he is intrigued by several points commissioner David
Stern made Wednesday on an increased minimum-pay scale and a more
generous salary-cap exception annually for each team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a chance to study all the details,'' Corbin
said, ``but it seems like the owners are offering to spread the
money around to the middle class, and that's what's important.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get a fair percentage, and we want to make sure the
system is put in place that will allow everyone to get a fair
wage,'' he said. ``What we can't have is a system that funnels all
the money to a few guys at the top and leaves the crumbs for the
rest of the guys in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides have met occasionally, Corbin said there
has not been a free exchange of ideas and certainly no real
bargaining at the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to come together and decide what our final offer will
be and make it at the table,'' he said. ``As players, we feel like
we've been negotiating with ourselves for a long time. We change
this, change that, and the owners basically stick to their same
position. I hope we're seeing a little give on their sides and that
we can finally get together on an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The framework for an agreement is in place, Corbin said, ``but
we've been stuck on percentages. We're at 60 and they're at 50. I
think we'll give some, and I hear they're willing to give some.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's see what happens when we get in the room.

 &HT;    Surgery, rehab results may be factor in decisions
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A factor in the Braves' trade talks about Fernando
Vina is Keith Lockhart's left shoulder, surgically repaired Oct. 23
in Birmingham by Dr. James Andrews. Lockhart played the entire year
with a tear in his non-throwing rotator cuff. It was not known
until the operation that he had sustained a complete thickness tear
and he may be under trainer's restrictions when spring camp opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fix that through the arthroscope,'' Braves
orthopedist Joe Chandler said. ``You have to open that up and bring
the tendon back down and reattach it to the bone. That means a long
offseason of extensive rehabilitation, but he should be able to do
most everything by the start of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, it was his non-dominant arm. Keith is tough. He would
not be able to do what he's done if this was his throwing arm or
even his lead shoulder in hitting. It's a blessing he's a
left-handed hitter and a right-handed thrower.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery check
</P>
<P>
   Outfield George Lombard also is rehabbing from surgery on his
non-throwing shoulder, his left, to tighten the joint. Lombard, the
Braves' player of the year at Class AA Greenville, was injured
making a diving catch in the first half of the season. Although he
was able to hit .308, the shoulder began to trouble him again in
the Arizona Fall League. He underwent an arthroscopic
capsular-shrinkage procedure to tighten the shoulder and had scar
tissue removed from the bursa sac, but he is expected to be 100
percent for spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, right-hander reliever Russ Springer is expected to be
at full-strength after having bone spurs and bone chips removed
from his right elbow. Los Angeles orthopedist Lew Yokum performed
the surgery, the second time he has cleaned out Springer's elbow in
four years.
</P>
<P>
   They're free
</P>
<P>
   Of the five Braves to file for free agency _ Rafael Belliard,
Norm Charlton, Greg Colbrunn, Ozzie Guillen and Dennis Martinez _
GM John Schuerholz has had communication only with representatives
for Guillen and Charlton, who is considering retirement. Colbrunn,
as he did last winter, is seeking a full-time job as a first
baseman with another team rather than returning to Atlanta's bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are interested in keeping Guillen, who hit .277 in 83
games, 58 of them starts, in support of Walt Weiss, even though
retaining Guillen would officially end Belliard's eight-year
affiliation with the club. Clubs have until Dec.7 to offer
arbitration to their free agents. Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beauchamp, the reassigned bench coach, has accepted a newly
created job as the minor-league coodinator for outfield
instruction. Clarence Jones has not yet accepted an offer to coach
at Class AAA Richmond.

 &HT;    Seminoles must have big margin vs. Virginia
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASEE, Fla. _ With Georgia and Georgia Tech off, you might
think this is a slow week in college football. Don't say that to
Florida State coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Since Florida State lost to N.C. State on Sept.12, Bowden has
known that his team has no margin for error if it wants to finish
in the final top four for the 12th consecutive year and get back
into contention for the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got no breathing room,'' Bowden said. ``That means every
Saturday could be your last one near the top, if you stumble.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Bowden is taking today's game with No.12 Virginia so
seriously. His team, ranked No.6, needs to pound Virginia today,
Wake Forest next week and find a way to knock off the Florida
Gators, who come calling on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Do all that, and beat somebody good in a bowl game, and Florida
State could get back into that top four. Even so, with four teams
still undefeated _ Ohio State, Tennessee, UCLA, Kansas State _ the
national title is a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't worry about that now, because we shot ourselves in
the foot,'' Bowden said. ``We just have to keep winning and see how
this thing shakes out.''
</P>
<P>
   With quarterback Chris Weinke in a streak of 202 passes without
an interception, the Seminoles should have a good afternoon. But in
this strange season, with Nebraska already losing twice, maybe
anything is possible.
</P>
<P>
   This week's picks:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 12 Virginia (7-1) at No. 6 Florida State (8-1), 3:30 p.m.,
WSB: Look for Florida State wide receiver Peter Warrick to have
another big day, with Virginia safety Anthony Poindexter out with
an injury. The Seminoles have been getting stronger with every
game. With a win, they can clinch another ACC championship by
beating Wake Forest next week. Florida State 31, Virginia 14.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 3 UCLA at Oregon Shome victory over Ole Miss (6-2). If the
Razorbacks win, they would need one more victory, over Mississippi

 &HT;    Play slows after Hoch withdraws
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASELTON, Ga. _ Andrew Coltart found contrasting news Friday
before playing his second round of the Subaru Sarazen World Open.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: The long johns he had worn were not needed on a
morning that was milder than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: He and Australia's Stephen Allan suddenly were a
twosome, thanks to Thursday's withdrawal by Scott Hoch after a
first-round 74.
</P>
<P>
   This might not sound like a major issue, but when everyone else
is playing as a threesome, it means that the guys taking only
two-thirds as much time are going to be waiting every shot.
Although Coltart still shot a 4-under-par 68 to stay within three
shots of leader Edward Fryatt, the slow play worked on his
patience.
</P>
<P>
   ''We waited every shot,'' Coltart said, ''and that annoyed me.
My rhythm was obviously upset. We couldn't walk slow enough.
Nothing against Scott, but it was difficult for us when you know
you're going to get held up as soon as the gun went off.''
</P>
<P>
   Coltart seemed more confused with Hoch's exit than anything
else. It's not as though Hoch had failed to break 80 , but he told
tournament officials Thursday, ''I need to get out of here before I
make an ass of myself.'' Hoch had played miserably at the Tour
Championship, where he snapped his 3-wood and 4-putted once, and
could not wait for the week at East Lake to end. Although Hoch
officially listed a stiff back as his reason for withdrawal, he did
not mention that to tournament director Lon Fellenz.
</P>
<P>
   ''I enjoyed the game with Scott (on Thursday),'' Coltart said.
''He hit a few bad shots, but I thought he still had a chance in
the tournament considering how good of a player he is. I think he
was trying to make it (his play) worse than it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Two venues in Europe possible
</P>
<P>
   Chateau Elan owner Don Panoz said Friday that in addition to his
resort, two unspecified European sites are being considered as
venues for the Sarazen World Open next year. Panoz said the
96-year-old Sarazen ''is very pleased that his concepts and his
idea of golf around the world has gotten a little CPR.'' ... Panoz,
on why the European Tour was more receptive to his ideas than the
PGA Tour: ''People are entitled to their decisions. God knows, I am
certainly not part of their inner sanctum. They don't invite me to
meetings. I don't know what is under the table cloth. ... But it
should be obvious that they would be, that the European Tour would
be, and that every other tour would be interested in things that
are right for golf. For whatever reason, the Sarazen wasn't
necessarily in their agenda. I personally believe it could have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   Langer gets a ''Freddie''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Bernhard Langer certainly found some similarities to
Augusta National's par-3 12th Friday at the Legends Course's par-3
15th, which was built to resemble it. Langer did a decent Fred
Couples impersonation, getting a ball to stop on the steep bank
without rolling into the water. ''I better get up there quick,''
Langer said from the teebox, then got up and down for par. .. .
Gainesville's Tim Conley, the last player added to the field, made
the cut with 72-74_146, thanks for a back-nine burst of three
birdies in his first five holes. ... The field will play off both
No.1 and No.10 tees today, beginning at 10:30 a.m., but just the
No.1 tee on Sunday.

 &HT;    KIND WORDS MARK END OF CLINTON'S LONG BATTLE WITH GINGRICH
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was perhaps the most dramatic duel in modern
American politics, but the six-year standoff between President
Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich ended Friday not with a
bang, but a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary, leading the
Republican Party to a majority in the House, and joining me in a
great national debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st
century,'' Clinton said in a two-sentence statement released late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite our profound differences,'' Clinton said, ''I
appreciate those times we were able to work together in the
national interest, and especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support
for America's continuing leadership for freedom, peace and
prosperity in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Having won the contest so decisively, there was little reason
for Clinton to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clinton was gracious in victory, Gingrich's long-term
House rival, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., was not.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people sent a strong message that the Republican
Congress was a failure, that it's leadership didn't address the
issues they cared about,'' Gephardt said in a statement his office
released late Friday. ''The speaker's resignation is a reaction to
that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt criticized ''the intense partisanship'' of Gingrich's
tenure as speaker and to assail what he called ''the damage that
was wrought on this institution over the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he scolded that ''it is critically important that the
next speaker has a stronger sense of respect for the institution of
the House and for members on the other side of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after spending nearly 11 months worrying whether the
Monica Lewinsky scandal might cost him his job, watched the matter
play a central role in the broader political drama that would
eventually lead to Gingrich's announcement Friday that he would
resign as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you wrote it in a novel,'' said political analyst Stephen
Hess, ''nobody would believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since two political figures more clearly
defined their parties than Clinton and Gingrich have in recent
years, or that the two leading national figures of both parties
were so starkly different.
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically opposed on a long list of issues ranging from
taxes and health care to the future of Social Security, the two men
harbored mutual animosity that some interpreted as personal.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can count on two hands the number of times they really
collaborated,'' said University of Virginia professor of government
Larry Sabato. ''And they had a great dislike for each other,
despite the olive branches they would occasionally throw each
other's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly they were as different intellectually as they were
ideologically.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that Clinton has anywhere near the creative mind
that Gingrich has,'' said Hess. ''Gingrich was a bizarre
politician. He was a revolutionary ...but he was no tactician at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, ''can be a brilliant strategist and
a very endearing person when he needs to be,'' said Hess. ''Those
are not Gingrich's qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Each was behind the darkest moments of the other.
</P>
<P>
   After leading Republicans to take the House in 1994, Gingrich
sent Clinton into a smoldering funk, with the chastened president
alternately blaming himself and others for his party's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, it was Clinton who outmaneuvered the speaker in
a budget battle that led to the shutdown of the federal government.
A disgusted public largely blamed Gingrich, and his popularity
never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Never did the public more clearly draw the line between the two
men, however, than in recent months, as Clinton, even shadowed by
scandal and the prospect of impeachment, managed to maintain job
approval ratings of 60 percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Voters time and again denounced the Republican effort to hold
the president to account for the sex and deception scandal, and
Gingrich became the target of much of the public's furor.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to forgive Clinton for one alleged misstep after another,
the public never fully embraced Gingrich in anywhere near the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to explain, but, fundamentally, Americans just
didn't like the little guy,'' said Sabato. ''It wasn't
issue-oriented as much as it was personality-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell how much Democrats are helped, or hurt, by
the abrupt bowing out of Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, after all, have lost a very high-profile whipping
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just spoke two hours ago to a Democratic congressman, and he
said, and I'm quoting him exactly, 'We had precisely three days to
celebrate.' He was very glum,'' said Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats,'' he said, ''have lost their devil figure.''

 GINGRICH SAYS HE'S STEPPING ASIDE 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also REPUBS-GINGRICH) 
(htv) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who orchestrated the
Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 and pressed the impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton, was driven from office Friday by a
party that swiftly turned on him after its unexpected losses in
Tuesday's midterm elections.
</P>
<P>
   Catching virtually everyone on Capitol Hill by surprise,
Gingrich announced Friday night in two conference calls to other
Republicans that he would not seek re-election as Speaker and would
leave Congress altogether when his term expired in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us a chance to purge some of the poison that is
in the system,'' Gingrich said, according to a party aide who heard
one of the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's decision to resign was a stunning reversal for one of
the most combative and personally confrontational politicians in
America. He made his name a decade ago by bringing down one
Democratic Speaker, Jim Wright, and continued his assaultive style
through the elections with last-minute commercials reminding voters
of the Clinton scandal.
</P>
<P>
   His reflexive pugilistic response was evident even Friday night.
In his second conference call, according to several members who
listened, Gingrich blamed House conservatives for his downfall.
Although it was their revolutionary zeal he harnessed to take
control of Congress, they have become his most bitter critics in
the last two years of his tumultuous tenure as speaker. On Friday
night he called them cannibals who had ``blackmailed'' him into
quitting, said those who has listened to the call.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael P. Forbes, R-N.Y., said: ``Newt said all those who
had marginalized the Republican Party had engaged in cannibalism.
He said, `Refer to the clips.' He's blaming others.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
described the conference call this way: ``He started off very
statesmanlike, but then you could see the anger building. When
someone asked him why he was leaving, he said, `A handful of
members have blackmailed the conference.' He said, `They're
hateful.' And he said, `They're cannibals.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's move set up a scramble for a successor in the
powerful post. The speaker, who is second only to the Vice
President in line for succession to the Presidency, controls the
legislative agenda, committee assignments and chairmanships in the
House of Representatives. Gingrich consolidated the power of the
office to a greater extent than other speakers in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The 105th Congress is now in adjournment, but Gingrich has said
that he would call the House back into session to vote on articles
of impeachment, if they are approved by the House Judiciary
Committee. He said he would step down at the end of the year, just
before the 106th Congress takes office.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced his move just hours after Rep. Robert L.
Livingston, R-La. announced he was running for speaker, putting
himself forward as a pragmatist and a manager. After the Gingrich
calls, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, announced he was considering his
own run. Livingston and Archer are chairmen of the two most
powerful committees in the House, Appropriations and Ways and
Means, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox of California, chairman of the Republican
policy committee, also announced his candidacy for speaker tonight,
on CNN's ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Gingrich said, ``The Republican conference needs
to be unified, and it is time for me to move forward.'' He said he
hoped his colleagues would pick a successor ``who can both
reconcile and discipline, who can work together and communicate
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to his wife, he told his colleagues he was resigning
from Congress because ``Marianne and I are tired. We need time off
to get to know each other again.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged his own knack for bringing negative
attention to himself and to his party. ``If I stay,'' he told his
colleagues Friday night, ``my controversial nature would overshadow
any successes we might have,'' an understatement to those who
recalled his suggestion two years ago that he forced a shutdown of
the government because he was miffed about having to sit in the
back of Air Force One on a trip with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Republican who took notes on one of the calls,
Gingrich said: ``There is a lot of bitterness amongst some of the
members. So long as I am around, I will always be a target in the
news media, which would mean we would never be able to get our
message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was traveling in Arkansas Friday, said: ``Newt
Gingrich has been a worthy adversary leading the Republican Party
to a majority in the House and joining me in a great national
debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st century.
Despite our profound differences, I appreciate those times we were
able to work together in the national interest, especially Speaker
Gingrich's strong support for America's continuing leadership for
freedom, peace and prosperity in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans took the opportunity to portray Gingrich as a
visionary. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert of New York said that during the
first conference call, ``there was shock and surprise and strong
expressions of appreciation for leading us to the Promised Land.''
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said Gingrich had the votes to win re-election as
speaker, a vote to be conducted by secret ballot on Nov. 18.
Kenneth Duberstein, a former official in the Reagan administration,
said, ``I have no doubt he had the votes to be Speaker, but I'm not
sure he had the votes to govern.'' He said that because of the deep
rifts in the party, Gingrich would not have been able to implement
his plans.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually biting reaction, Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic leader, said he hoped that Gingrich's
resignation would clear the fierce partisan air that he had
fostered. ``I hope that whoever succeeds Newt Gingrich as Speaker
will immediately begin the process of repairing the damage that was
wrought on this institution over the last four years,'' Gephardt
said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans predicted that Gingrich's resignation would
set off a more wide-ranging and hectic scramble to replace him than
had been anticipated. ``There will be a lot of pretenders to the
throne who will test the waters,'' said Boehlert, who had supported
Gingrich for re-election. ``There won't be any shortage of
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's name gained currency earlier Friday when conservatives,
who were already furious with Gingrich, said they were dissatisfied
with Livingston as well.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's actions captured the dizzying pace at which events
unfolded _ and the appeal of having Gingrich out of the race. His
aides said Friday afternoon that Archer was ``reviewing his
options'' and that if he decided to run, he would announce his
candidacy next week. They faxed a statement at 7:29 Friday night
saying that Archer was ``saddened'' by Gingrich's resignation.
Eleven minutes later, they faxed a statement from Archer saying he
was ``actively considering'' running for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston has a huge head start. He had been campaigning for
speaker anyway on the chance that Gingrich might step aside to run
for President. Since Tuesday, he has converted those long-range
plans into an extensive and immediate telephone campaign to shore
up support. He has contacted not only Republican House members but
an array of prominent Republicans across the country, including
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference outside the Capitol Friday afternoon,
Livingston said he was running.
</P>
<P>
   He cast himself as someone who could make the trains run on time
and who would not lose himself in the high-blown revolutionary
speechifying that he implied had consumed Gingrich, who has spent
much of his time traveling and raising money. ``I'll be more of a
stay-at-home type of speaker who wants to get the job done,''
Livingston told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich remained at his home in Georgia Friday, calling members
and seeking their support. His press secretary, Christina Martin,
issued a statement Friday afternoon saying: ``As architect of the
Republican majority, Speaker Gingrich is determined to correct the
mistakes of the past and implement a positive, issue-oriented
legislative agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   She said in an interview tonight that Gingrich had broached the
possibility of resigning with his wife on Thursday and that he had
reached a decision Friday afternoon. His staff was caught by
surprise. ``This office was in full vote-counting mode,'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's plans beyond resignation were uncertain. He said he
would take six months off next year. But he made no mention of his
earlier notion of running for President, a path that many of his
friends said they presumed was now impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Engler of Michigan, a Republican, suggested that he
replace Jim Nicholson as chairman of the Republican National
Committee. ``I would love for Newt to become our national chairman
right now,'' he said. In a sign of the turmoil aswirl in the party,
the governor said Gingrich would be more adept at handling the
press than Nicholson. ``The media circus surrounding politicians is
not his strength,'' he said of Nicholson.
</P>
<P>
   Engler said he spoke by telephone with Gingrich. ``He's weary
and said he was tired _ it's been a grueling campaign,'' Engler
said.

HISTORIC BASEBALL IS FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATT ROSENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Christopher Scala decided to dress up as Babe
Ruth for a school project two years ago, it brought back memories
for his great-grandmother. Viola Bevilacque recalled that her late
husband, Charles, had been given a ball bearing Ruth's signature
back in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   A hunt through her attic in Chatham, N.J., turned up the ball
that Ruth is believed to have hit for the first home run in Yankee
Stadium. And the ball is expected to fetch a record price when it
is sold Thursday at Leland's, an auction house specializing in
sports memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday morning at the Official All Star
Cafe in Manhattan, Leland's chairman Joshua Leland Evans said the
minimum bid allowed would be $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the most important thing we've ever
auctioned,'' Evans said. ``It could sell for a lot of money.'' He
refused to guess how much, but he cited the current record price
for a baseball, $93,500, which the actor Charlie Sheen paid for the
ball that the Mets' Mookie Wilson hit between the legs of Boston's
Bill Buckner to score the winning run in Game 6 of the 1986 World
Series. Evans said he thought that this ball was considerably more
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   Evans and Mark Scala _ Christopher's father, who, along with his
family, was also at Friday's news conference _ both noted the
timing of the sale, on the heels of a baseball season dominated by
the race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa to break the
single-season home run record. Evans and Scala said they expected
this to boost the selling price of that baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Leland's catalog here, and this ball has been
generating a lot of interest,'' said Phil Castinetti, who owns a
sports memorabilia store in Boston and runs sports memorabilia
auctions. ``It's not the flavor of the moment, but it could easily
go for over a hundred thousand, if it's authentic.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans and Scala both said they were convinced the baseball was
the one Ruth hit in 1923. Evans said three factors were considered
when the baseball was evaluated: who and where the ball came from;
whether it was made with the materials and methods of the day,
which the ball's Reach logo and its alternating red and blue
stitching prove it was, and the autograph and inscription, which
reads, ``First home run hit in Yankee Stadium, April 18, 1923,''
and is signed, ``Babe Ruth.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is the inscription by Babe Ruth, and
we've sold, over the last 20 years, thousands of Babe Ruth
signatures, and you just learn what a Babe Ruth signature is,''
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   The ball was found when Scala mentioned to his grandmother that
Christopher was dressing up as Ruth for school. Bevilacque
remembered the baseball given to her husband as a prize for being
named to a New Jersey all-state high school baseball team. But it
was not until Scala heard the date of Ruth's first home run in
Yankee Stadium during the broadcast of the 1996 World Series
between the Yankees and the Atlanta Braves that he realized it was
the same as the one scribbled on the yellow, tattered baseball, and
that his family owned what might be a piece of Yankee history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy deciding to sell it, but we're middle-class
people and I have to think about my family's future,'' said Scala,
42, a graphic designer who lives in Ramsey, N.J. ``Whatever it's
sold for, we are going to make a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   He would not elaborate on what the money would be used for.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher, 11, said he would be sad to see the ball go, but he
did not see the point in keeping it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that someone buys it who lets other people see it,'' he
said. ``It would be great if it ended up in the Hall of Fame.''

WILLIAMS' SUITORS COVER THEMSELVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Yankees are concerned about Bernie Williams showing up in
center field at Fenway Park next season _ wearing the home uniform
_ they should not breathe a sigh of relief just because the Red Sox
re-signed their own center fielder, Darren Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox and the Colorado Rockies, a baseball lawyer
suggested yesterday, are playing a game of misdirection. Both
re-signed their free-agent center fielders _ Lewis with Boston,
Darryl Hamilton with Colorado _ but both remain interested in
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers do not. After talking about Williams
only the day before, Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager,
went out and signed center fielder Devon White yesterday to a
three-year, $12.4 million contract. White, six years older than the
30-year-old Williams, was the first free agent to sign following
the filing period.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that center field was a hole in the Dodgers'
lineup, Malone had said it was logical for them to pursue Williams
as they focused on the high-profile free agents. ``But,'' he added,
``we also have other directions we can go concerning other free
agents who aren't as high profile as the big four.''
</P>
<P>
   White, with a .279 batting average and 85 runs batted in, was
the Arizona Diamondbacks' top hitter last season after the Florida
Marlins traded him to Arizona as part of their payroll purge. He
had signed with the Marlins as a free agent in 1995, receiving $9.9
million for three years. He is three years older, but his new
contract with the Dodgers is better than that one was.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees remain interested in Williams, but another day went
by without an offer emanating from Yankee Stadium. George
Steinbrenner obviously is not prepared to make one yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott and I had a conversation, a lengthy one, but I have not
made an offer,'' Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman said,
referring to Williams' agent, Scott Boras. Cashman and Boras also
talked about Kevin Brown, one of the two best pitchers in the
free-agent market, but the Yankees did not make Brown an offer
either.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it appeared the Red Sox and the Rockies had
abandoned thoughts of going after Williams. The Red Sox signed
Lewis to a three-year, $7 million contract, and the Rockies
retained Hamilton with a three-year, $10.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   But both center fielders, who had filed for free agency, agreed
to new contracts on Thursday, the final day of the 15-day filing
period. Their signing before the end of the period means they do
not fall under the trade restrictions that clubs face with free
agents who sign after the period. A free agent who signs from
yesterday on cannot be traded without his consent until June 16. If
the Red Sox or the Rockies should sign Williams, they could trade
Lewis or Hamilton without his approval.
</P>
<P>
   By signing their own players, the baseball lawyer said, the
clubs gave themselves flexibility. ``If they don't get the premier
center fielder,'' he said, ``they are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras said some clubs made offers for Williams and Brown on
Friday, but he declined to identify the teams or discuss their
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just say there were no surprises about where the market
is for either player,'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   Boras had previously said he wanted seven years for Williams,
six for Brown, with Williams' money exceeding Mike Piazza's $91
million, and Brown's money exceeding Pedro Martinez's $75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Boras said he received one surprise Friday but again declined to
name the team or even the player the team called about. ``You get
calls sometimes that you didn't anticipate getting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees want to protect themselves in case they do not sign
Williams, which is why Cashman spoke Friday with Jim Turner, Brian
Jordan's agent. ``I tried to touch base with a number of agents,''
Cashman said. ``I tried to get a little clearer picture of what
their interests and dollar expectations are.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, late of the St. Louis Cardinals, also has attracted the
Mets' attention. He is a productive hitter (.316, 25 home runs, 91
runs batted in) who will not cost nearly as much as Williams.
</P>
<P>
   After speaking with Cashman, Turner said: ``They are not
prepared to make a proposal now and wanted me to know that. We
talked about the overall picture. I gather that they are going to
hold off on talking seriously to anyone else until they make
overtures to their own guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he had not heard recently from Steve Phillips, the
Mets' general manager, but had received a request for information
from Phillips' office Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   One of RANDY JOHNSON's agents, ALAN NERO, said Friday that the
free-agent pitcher had planned to visit New York but now might ask
GEORGE STEINBRENNER to visit Johnson at his home in the Phoenix
area. ``This process is starting to get lengthy and wearisome, so
we're considering that maybe, in the interest of time, it makes
sense for the Yankees to come out and visit Randy,'' Nero said.
Johnson planned to visit the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Anaheim
Angels in the next couple of weeks, Nero said. &QL;

ABC SAYS IT IS DROPPING STONE SPECIAL ABOUT CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Citing the potential for confusion among viewers between
``fact-based entertainment and hard news,'' executives of the ABC
television network said Friday that the network had dropped plans
to broadcast a prime-time special, produced by the filmmaker Oliver
Stone, about the theory that long-range missiles caused the crash
of Trans World Airlines Flight 800 off Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after several ABC journalists had expressed
dismay to their superiors about the proposed program, called
``Oliver Stone's Declassified,'' fearing that viewers would
perceive it as an ABC News report. ABC News has reported that the
missile theories are groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Oliver Stone is a gifted writer-director with a
strong record of producing compelling dramatic movies,'' a
statement issued by ABC said. ``On reflection, we believe this
genre may not be appropriate for a television network with a strong
news record and identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Matson, the network's chief spokeswoman, said no ABC
executive would comment further.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stone nor a spokesman for his company, Illusion
Entertainment, returned phone calls seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Assorted theories about bombs and missiles have been widely
discredited since the crash of TWA Flight 800, on July 17, 1996, in
which 230 people died. Most aviation experts believe a spark of
unknown origin in the center fuel tank caused the plane to explode
over Long Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, the FBI and the CIA
have all said there is no evidence to support the theory that the
crash was caused by a missile or missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But several former military officers, citing witnesses' accounts
of streaks of light in the sky before the plane exploded, insist
that the missile hypothesis has never been adequately examined.
Some people have accused the FBI of suppressing evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times first reported ABC's decision Friday, after
the newspaper's aviation industry reporter, Chuck Taylor,
telephoned the relatives of many of the victims to ask how they
felt about the Oliver Stone television program. According to his
report, most of the people he spoke to agree with the conclusions
of the safety board and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also reported that some victims' relatives said they had
written to ABC Entertainment's president, Jamie Tarses, urging the
network to abandon the Stone project.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, Ms. Tarses said she had not received the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Brockman, a spokesman for ABC Entertainment in Los
Angeles, said 50 to 60 specials went into development each year and
about half of them ultimately appeared on the air. Neither he nor
Ms. Matson would comment on the amount of money invested in the
Stone project.

TALKS HIT STALEMATE AND BREAK OFF FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The chances of ending the National Basketball
Association's labor conflict grew bleaker on Friday. Talks between
the chief negotiators broke off indefinitely, another week of games
was stricken from the schedule, and the union executive director,
Billy Hunter, again accused the NBA of trying to shatter the
players' solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, Commissioner David Stern and their internal negotiating
teams emerged from a one-hour meeting in Manhattan and gave no
indication of when negotiations would resume. It was the first time
talks had been suspended since Aug. 6, when the owners walked out
of a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides holding firm and no bargaining sessions planned,
it appears that the lockout _ in its 129th day _ will push up
against Stern's unofficial, early-December deadline for reaching a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt pressure was growing, Hunter replied that there
was pressure on both sides. ``We're not going to take a bad deal,''
he said. ``If it means we don't play until January or February,
that's what it means.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, nothing has changed this week,'' said Russ
Granik, the league's deputy commissioner. ``We are still very, very
far apart. We haven't moved closer at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik added: ``As each day goes by, there are just huge dollars
that are lost. It's hard for me to say there is a particular date
as to when the window closes to make a deal, but I'm hoping we
don't get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   With Granik out of town to attend U.S.A. Basketball meetings
early next week, the earliest possible negotiation between the
league and the union could not take place until late next week.
That would probably mean another week of games would be canceled,
which would reduce the season to around 60 games.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a participant in Wednesday's negotiating session said
the union had offered mediation to help resolve the dispute _ a
tool that major-league baseball players and owners unsuccessfully
used in 1994. But the league rejected the use of a mediator, the
participant said.
</P>
<P>
   League officials claimed they never received a new proposal that
the players promised. Hunter, who admitted that he and his legal
team had decided not to send a new proposal, accused Stern and the
owners of using the next two weeks to lobby the players and exert
pressure on the union to sign a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear they're trying to split the players,'' Hunter said,
adding that he knew of seven teams that had contacted players to
discuss the league's latest proposal. ``They want to take a poll
and see where our players stand.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Stern lifted a 4-month-old moratorium that would
allow team officials with knowledge of the negotiations to explain
the deal to players. The agreement does not constitute unfair labor
practice and the league contends it is doing so for only
informational purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the move angered Hunter and he has scheduled a meeting
next week of the union's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to stand by and let the owners and league
attempt to have unfettered access to our players and let them
manipulate them without going back out there and clearing the
record up,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations over the key economic issues _ among them, total
revenue distribution and the implementation of an escrow system _
continue to lag. A week after both sides boasted that a framework
had been agreed upon, talks have become so unproductive that a
fifth week has been deleted from the season. That means the NBA
could not start earlier than Dec. 8.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hunter identified Miami Heat owner Micky Arison and team
president and coach Pat Riley as having talked to players about the
deal, along with Celtics president and coach Rick Pitino, Boston
General Manager Chris Wallace, Boston owner Paul Gaston, Milwaukee
coach George Karl and Cleveland Cavaliers General Manager Wayne
Embry.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we've heard, they're talking to the players about
how good the deal is,'' Hunter said. ``Our players know the
difference between a good deal and a bad deal. We're confident
about that. I'm just worried this will create a rift between
management and players.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the union decided not to make changes in its most
recent proposal, Hunter added, ``Our position is, we're not going
to show movement until they show movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners believe totally that they will not operate until we
have a fair deal,'' Granik said. ``And if that means missing the
whole season, that's what it means. Obviously it's not anything
anybody wants to do.''

 &HT;    Gingrich's unexpected exit leaves `strange sense' among
officials
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There was no warning, not even a hint. Then came
the news flash on CNN: House Speaker Newt Gingrich was planning to
step down.
</P>
<P>
   The phone lines burned between congressional offices on Capitol
Hill and district offices across the country where most members are
still recovering from the frenzy of election day. Within minutes
came a call from Gingrich's Office. A Republican conference call
would be taking place.
</P>
<P>
   One hour after that hastily assembled conference call, Georgia
Republican Rep. Bob Barr was still shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I simply listened with my mouth hanging open,'' said Barr.
Gingrich told those listening to the conference call that he felt
compelled to step down because of all the divisiveness swirling
around him and the rancor within the conference over the loss of
five GOP seats earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very noble thing that he has done,'' Barr said. ``One
wishes the president would do what Newt has done.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing Gingrich will be a major loss for the state of Georgia
and for Barr personally. ``It really is a very strange sense,''
said Barr. ``I have been very much a part of Newt's family as a
member of the Georgia delegation. It is like we lost a father.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Friday, the Republican members of the Georgia
delegation other than Gingrich, nicknamed the ``G-7,''
</P>
<P>
   spoke in a conference call about the state of the GOP after the
election day in the aftermath of election day losses both across
the state and the nation. During that hour-long call, all of the
Republican members said they pledged to support Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's being blamed for things that are not his fault,''
said Rep. Jack Kingston (R-Ga.), who is chairman of the G-7, in an
interview only two hours before the unexpected resignation.
``Running the Republican Conference is a difficult job given all of
the factions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main problems facing Gingrich is that the 1995
Contract for America was extremely successful, Kingston said, and
``we were never able to do another encore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not imploding, we are having a family shuffle, a family
squabble,'' said Kingston. ``The cracks in the dam will end up
being a bridge to the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingston's sentiment was echoed throughout the delegation
earlier in the day and it shows just how unaware the members were
that Gingrich was contemplating his depature.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, who has been at odds with Gingrich since the
election, said the speaker was ``very gracious'' during the
conference call. ``He will be, in terms of party building, sorely
missed,'' Linder said. He got us here and everybody recognized
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Noticeably quiet about the resignation were the Democratic
members of the 11-member Georgia delegation. Rep. John Lewis, the
chief deputy whip of the Democratic Party, will now become the
senior member of the delegation. Lewis, who has had a testy
relationship with Gingrich in the past, declined to discuss his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   When Charlie Norwood first ran for Congress in 1994, he went to
Gingrich in search of his blessing, to which Gingrich quipped, ``I
already have a dentist, go buy an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the last four years, the pair have built up a close
relationship. ``I am a loyal kind of fellow,'' said Norwood earlier
in the day about his support for Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am saddened by the news of the speaker's resignation, but it
is certainly understandable with the way the speaker has been
demonized by the national press,'' Norwood said. As Gingrich steps
down, Norwood said that Congress should ``remember that it was the
speaker's efforts that balanced the federal budget and ended the
federal borrowing and the national debt. ``
</P>
<P>
   And Norwood took a swipe at the White House. ``President Clinton
could take a lesson in honor from the speaker,'' Norwood said. ``If
Clinton would step down we really would have a fresh start, a new
speaker, a new president.''

 &HT;    SKETCHES OF A CROP OF CHALLENGERS FOR GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP
 &HT;    Eds: Adds COX.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are personality sketches of Republican House
members who have declared their candidacy for, or interest in,
running for leadership positions in the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   BOB LIVINGSTON
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, few doubt that Bob Livingston is tough enough
for the job of House speaker, for which he declared his candidacy
Friday. At 6 feet, 5 inches in height, the 55-year-old conservative
is an imposing figure.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for a fast and fiery temper. Congressional
Quarterly's ``Politics in America'' describes a 1995 incident when
Livingston nearly came to blows with an aide to Rep. Pat Roberts,
R-Kan., then the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some son of a bitch on your staff has been saying bad stuff
about my staff to the press and I'm tired of it,'' Livingston
reportedly told Roberts before being physically restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is not without a sense of humor, albeit one that is
sometimes pointedly political. On his first day as chairman,
Livingston came to an Appropriations Committee meeting armed with a
machete and a alligator-skinning knife _ ready to cut the federal
budget. In 1993, he wore a clown's hat and a red plastic nose to
ridicule what he called a ``goofy'' Democratic bill to change
campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   As a three-term chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he
holds the federal purse strings and can help Republican colleagues
with funding for projects in their home districts. His position
also is a magnet for hopeful political contributors, so he channels
campaign funds to needy Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1977, Livingston has represented the First
District of Louisiana for
</P>
<P>
   11 terms. Born in Colorado, Livingston grew up in New Orleans.
His parents divorced with he was 7, and he and a younger sister
were reared by their mother. After dropping out of Tulane
University, Livingston joined the Navy. After his hitch ended, he
married in 1965 and returned to Tulane to earn a bachelor's degree
and then to graduate from law school.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to the former Bonnie Robichaux, and they have four
children.
</P>
<P>
   BILL ARCHER
</P>
<P>
   Courteous and soft-spoken, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas has sought
to give his House Ways and Means Committee a bipartisan image, in
contrast to the longtime Democratic Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, who
made little show of respecting the sensitivities of Republicans on
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the patina of accommodation, Archer is known as a
determined conservative and friend of business interests. He has
authored bills to cut the capital gains tax and create tax-free
``enterprise zones,'' and has opposed efforts by other House
Republicans to eliminate ``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, 70, is a native Houstonian. He served in the Air Force
during the Korean War, and over the next decade and a half operated
a feed mill, practiced law and served as a bank director. He was
elected to the Texas House in 1966 as a Democrat and switched
parties in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to Congress in 1970, succeeding then-Rep. George
Bush, who did not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   If Archer were to be elected speaker, he might wish to review an
announcement he made earlier this year: that he would not seek
re-election to the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTOPHER COX
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox of California, who confirmed on a TV talk
show Friday night that he would run for the speakership, has forged
partnerships all over the House since his first election in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He is rated among Congress's most conservative members. Yet he
worked in 1991 with Rep. Barney Frank, the liberal Massachusetts
Democrat (and Cox's Harvard Law School classmate more than 20 years
ago) to eliminate the federal helium reserve program.
</P>
<P>
   He teamed up with liberal Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden (now a
member of the Senate) from Oregon to pass the Internet Freedom and
Family Empowerment Act in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One of Congress's first advocates of term limits, he opposed
most-favored-nation trade status for China, fought the 1995 Mexico
bailout legislation and got the House to go on record in 1996
supporting NATO membership extended to Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1952 in St. Paul, Minn., he went to California to attend
the University of Southern California, then attended Harvard's law
school and business school jointly. Returning to southern
California, he practiced law in Orange County, then was part of the
White House counsel's staff during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   He has been supported in his political races by film director
Oliver North and conservative jurist Robert Bork, and has been
mentioned as a possible Republican opponent for both of
California's Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein. His 47th District, east of Los Angeles, is one of the
most reliably Republican districts in America.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID McINTOSH
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh's, who has declared his interest in seeking
the speakership, began his House service in the 1994 Republican
sweep that followed Gingrich's Contract With America. But his
involvement and interest in conservative political causes started
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He says it began when he was 18 and saw 29-year-old Dan Quayle
in his first race for Congress in 1976. McIntosh later would
graduate from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law
School, where he studied under Antonin Scalia. McIntosh worked in
the Justice Department during the Reagan administration, and during
the Bush administration became director of the White House Council
on Competitiveness, which was headed by then-Vice President Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, he immediately established himself as the most
vocal House opponent of government regulation, calling for a
moratorium on all new regulations and writing bills to require
agencies to make cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments before
issuing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the House, despite Democrats' complaints that it
was a disguised assault on the environment and workplace safety,
then died in a House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh has not hesitated to criticize Gingrich, and was in the
thick of occasional rebellions by conservative members of the
``Class of '94.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES M. TALENT
</P>
<P>
   The groups that rate members of Congress on the basis of key
votes are pretty clear about Rep. James M. Talent of Missouri. The
liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him a zero rating in
1995, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce rated him 100.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, frequently mentioned Friday as a possible candidate for
the speakership, represents the Second District on the west side of
metropolitan St. Louis, in an affluent area made up of a jigsaw
puzzle of tiny towns and a few large industrial facilities,
including a Ford plant and the McDonnell Douglas aircraft plant,
now owned by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, he has focused on the issue of military readiness
and decried the Clinton administration's defense budget cuts. His
ideas for welfare reform, spelled out in a bill he introduced in
1996, include denying benefits for a second child born while the
mother is on welfare and sending the children of unfit parents to
group homes.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, 42, graduated from Washington University in St. Louis
and the University of Chicago Law School. He was first elected to
the House in 1992, unseating incumbent Democrat Joan Kelly Horn. He
was opposed by Horn in 1996 and easily defeated her again, after
outspending her $1.1 million to $380,000.
</P>
<P>
   DICK ARMEY
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas is known as a
free-market economist and free user of political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Both characteristics can be controversial, but his occasional
loose remarks _ such as the time he told First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton that ``reports on your charm are overstated, and the
reports on your wit are understated'' _ have occasionally gotten
him in hot water.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, he described the Clinton Administration's
ill-fated health care reform initiative as a ``Kevorkian
prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   Army, 58, was first elected to the House in 1984 from Texas's
26th District, which sits in the solidly Republican and unusually
affluent north side of the Dallas-Ft. Worth metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cando, N.D., he attended Jamestown College in
Jamestown, N.D., and received a doctorate in economics from the
University of Oklahoma. He was an economics professor at North
Texas State University at Denton when he decided to run for
Congress and unseated a longtime Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Washington the next January too broke to rent an
apartment, so he slept in the House gym until he was forced to
stop, and then moved to his office couch.
</P>
<P>
   A chief architect of the 1994 ``Contract with America,'' which
ushered in the Republican majority in the House, he advocates
elimination of farm subsidies and a national flat tax of 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has publicly supported Gingrich in previous
controversies, there have been persistent reports of private moves
on his part to succeed to the speakership in the event Gingrich had
to leave the post.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statement Friday night praising Gingrich, Armey he
seemed to rule out any attempt to move up in the hierarchy by
saying, ``I will continue to seek the Majority Leader's post, to
provide our Conference with stability in managing the floor and
developing legislation as we undergo this difficult transition.''
</P>
<P>
   STEVE LARGENT
</P>
<P>
   Steve Largent is ready for the next chapter in his all-American
life.
</P>
<P>
   When he was born in Tulsa, Okla., 43 years ago, a nurse put a
toy football in his hospital crib. Sure enough, that blue-eyed baby
grew up to be a Hall of Fame wide receiver for the Seattle
Seahawks. ``People'' magazine proclaimed him one of its ``50 Most
Beautiful People in the World'' and Wheaties put his face on a
cereal box. He's been married to his high school sweetheart for 23
years and is devoted to their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an easy re-election to a third term as a Republican
congressman, Largent has decided to take on Armey in a battle over
the leadership and direction of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are hardly new for Largent. After attending the
University of Tulsa on a football scholarship, he was deemed too
small and too slow for the National Football League. He signed as a
free agent with the Seahawks and retired 14 years later with the
NFL career records for receptions, receiving yards and touchdown
catches.
</P>
<P>
   After working for several years as a marketing consultant and
appearing in TV commercials, he ran for Congress in 1994 as a
Christian conservative promising ``my faith, my family and my
values will give me the strength to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he has stubbornly set his own course _ voting
against the 1997 GOP budget deal and sparking headlines by
denouncing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE RADANOVICH
</P>
<P>
   A banker by trade, George Radanovich long dreamed of setting up
a winery amid the fertile fields and rolling pastures of
California's Central Valley. So in 1983, while working days as an
assistant bank manager, he founded the first winery in his native
Mariposa County. Each year, Radanovich Winery now produces several
thousand cases of sauvignon blanc, merlot and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   The vintner, meanwhile, has turned his attention from grapes to
the GOP. First elected to Congress in 1994, Radanovich is
challenging Rep. John Boehner of Ohio to be chairman of the House
Republican Conference, the caucus of all GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Croatian immigrants, Radanovich is an avowed
conservative who believes cutting taxes and easing environmental
restrictions on farmers and ranchers are keys to economic growth.
He wants to limit the scope of both the federal government and the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Cal Tech graduate with a degree in agriculture business
management, the 43-year-old Radanovich is married to the former
Ethie Weaver, and the couple has one child.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER DUNN
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins the Republican rebellion, Jennifer Dunn of
Washington is unlikely to lose her position as the highest-ranking
woman in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   All sides know the party can't afford an all-male top team.
After her election as vice chairman of the House Republican
Conference in 1996, Dunn declared the vote ``a validation of the
fact a woman has a place not only in the Republican Party but in
the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Active in GOP politics since the 1960s, Dunn is a Stanford
graduate, a former IBM systems engineer and divorced mother of two
grown sons (one of whom is named Reagan). In 1992, she was elected
to Congress from a district made up mostly of Seattle's affluent
suburbs and has sought to put a kinder face on her party since her
arrival in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a proponent of softening our rhetoric,''
she said before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a steadfast supporter of Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., who in return has backed her rise in the Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally conservative and pro-business, she has supported free
trade policies that benefit exporters around Seattle and policies
to advance Microsoft and other high-tech industries in her
district.
</P>
<P>
   JIM McCRERY
</P>
<P>
   Grits vs. Gumbo? Not really. In the fight for the chairmanship
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, incumbent Rep.
John Linder of Georgia is no good ol' boy, and his potential
challenger, Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, is no Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   While Linder grew up in Minnesota, though, McCrery was reared
amid the piney woods and oil refineries of northern Louisiana _ a
strait-laced Protestant region more akin to Alabama than to the
free-rolling Catholic bayous of southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from Shreveport, McCrery has been both a social and
fiscal conservative since he left his job as a regional manager for
Georgia-Pacific Corp. in 1988 to win election to Congress. He is a
steadfast opponent of abortion and a supporter of gun owners'
rights and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In his votes, he has been generally loyal to the GOP leadership,
although he voted against the 1990 tax increase backed by the Bush
administration and questioned the $500-per-child tax credit in the
1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
   McCrery, 49, is a graduate of Louisiana Tech and the Louisiana
State University law school. He is married to the former Johnette
Hawkins, and the couple has two children.

Christian conservative promising ``my faith, my family and my
values will give me the strength to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he has stubbornly set his own course _ voting
against the 1997 GOP budget deal and sparking headlines by
denouncing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE RADANOVICH
</P>
<P>
   A banker by trade, George Radanovich long dreamed of setting up
a winery amid the fertile fields and rolling pastures of
California's Central Valley. So in 1983, while working days as an
assistant bank manager, he founded the first winery in his native
Mariposa County. Each year, Radanovich Winery now produces several
thousand cases of sauvignon blanc, merlot and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   The vintner, meanwhile, has turned his attention from grapes to
the GOP. First elected to Congress in 1994, Radanovich is
challenging Rep. John Boehner of Ohio to be chairman of the House
Republican Conference, the caucus of all GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Croatian immigrants, Radanovich is an avowed
conservative who believes cutting taxes and easing environmental
restrictions on farmers and ranchers are keys to economic growth.
He wants to limit the scope of both the federal government and the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Cal Tech graduate with a degree in agriculture business
management, the 43-year-old Radanovich is married to the former
Ethie Weaver, and the couple has one child.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER DUNN
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins the Republican rebellion, Jennifer Dunn of
Washington is unlikely to lose her position as the highest-ranking
woman in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   All sides know the party can't afford an all-male top team.
After her election as vice chairman of the House Republican
Conference in 1996, Dunn declared the vote ``a validation of the
fact a woman has a place not only in the Republican Party but in
the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Active in GOP politics since the 1960s, Dunn is a Stanford
graduate, a former IBM systems engineer and divorced mother of two
grown sons (one of whom is named Reagan). In 1992, she was elected
to Congress from a district made up mostly of Seattle's affluent
suburbs and has sought to put a kinder face on her party since her
arrival in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a proponent of softening our rhetoric,''
she said before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a steadfast supporter of Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., who in return has backed her rise in the Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally conservative and pro-business, she has supported free
trade policies that benefit exporters around Seattle and policies
to advance Microsoft and other high-tech industries in her
district.
</P>
<P>
   JIM McCRERY
</P>
<P>
   Grits vs. Gumbo? Not really. In the fight for the chairmanship
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, incumbent Rep.
John Linder of Georgia is no good ol' boy, and his potential
challenger, Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, is no Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   While Linder grew up in Minnesota, though, McCrery was reared
amid the piney woods and oil refineries of northern Louisiana _ a
strait-laced Protestant region more akin to Alabama than to the
free-rolling Catholic bayous of southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from Shreveport, McCrery has been both a social and
fiscal conservative since he left his job as a regional manager for
Georgia-Pacific Corp. in 1988 to win election to Congress. He is a
steadfast opponent of abortion and a supporter of gun owners'
rights and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In his votes, he has been generally loyal to the GOP leadership,
although he voted against the 1990 tax increase backed by the Bush
administration and questioned the $500-per-child tax credit in the
1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
   McCrery, 49, is a graduate of Louisiana Tech and the Louisiana
State University law school. He is married to the former Johnette
Hawkins, and the couple has two children.

 &HT;    SKETCHES OF A CROP OF CHALLENGERS FOR GOP HOUSE LEADERSHIP
 &HT;    Eds: Adds COX.
 &HT;    By BOB DART and JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are personality sketches of Republican House
members who have declared their candidacy for, or interest in,
running for leadership positions in the new Congress.
</P>
<P>
   BOB LIVINGSTON
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, few doubt that Bob Livingston is tough enough
for the job of House speaker, for which he declared his candidacy
Friday. At 6 feet, 5 inches in height, the 55-year-old conservative
is an imposing figure.
</P>
<P>
   He is known for a fast and fiery temper. Congressional
Quarterly's ``Politics in America'' describes a 1995 incident when
Livingston nearly came to blows with an aide to Rep. Pat Roberts,
R-Kan., then the chairman of the Agriculture Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some son of a bitch on your staff has been saying bad stuff
about my staff to the press and I'm tired of it,'' Livingston
reportedly told Roberts before being physically restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is not without a sense of humor, albeit one that is
sometimes pointedly political. On his first day as chairman,
Livingston came to an Appropriations Committee meeting armed with a
machete and a alligator-skinning knife _ ready to cut the federal
budget. In 1993, he wore a clown's hat and a red plastic nose to
ridicule what he called a ``goofy'' Democratic bill to change
campaign finance rules.
</P>
<P>
   As a three-term chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he
holds the federal purse strings and can help Republican colleagues
with funding for projects in their home districts. His position
also is a magnet for hopeful political contributors, so he channels
campaign funds to needy Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1977, Livingston has represented the First
District of Louisiana for
</P>
<P>
   11 terms. Born in Colorado, Livingston grew up in New Orleans.
His parents divorced with he was 7, and he and a younger sister
were reared by their mother. After dropping out of Tulane
University, Livingston joined the Navy. After his hitch ended, he
married in 1965 and returned to Tulane to earn a bachelor's degree
and then to graduate from law school.
</P>
<P>
   He is married to the former Bonnie Robichaux, and they have four
children.
</P>
<P>
   BILL ARCHER
</P>
<P>
   Courteous and soft-spoken, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas has sought
to give his House Ways and Means Committee a bipartisan image, in
contrast to the longtime Democratic Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, who
made little show of respecting the sensitivities of Republicans on
the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the patina of accommodation, Archer is known as a
determined conservative and friend of business interests. He has
authored bills to cut the capital gains tax and create tax-free
``enterprise zones,'' and has opposed efforts by other House
Republicans to eliminate ``corporate welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer, 70, is a native Houstonian. He served in the Air Force
during the Korean War, and over the next decade and a half operated
a feed mill, practiced law and served as a bank director. He was
elected to the Texas House in 1966 as a Democrat and switched
parties in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to Congress in 1970, succeeding then-Rep. George
Bush, who did not seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   If Archer were to be elected speaker, he might wish to review an
announcement he made earlier this year: that he would not seek
re-election to the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   CHRISTOPHER COX
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox of California, who confirmed on a TV talk
show Friday night that he would run for the speakership, has forged
partnerships all over the House since his first election in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He is rated among Congress's most conservative members. Yet he
worked in 1991 with Rep. Barney Frank, the liberal Massachusetts
Democrat (and Cox's Harvard Law School classmate more than 20 years
ago) to eliminate the federal helium reserve program.
</P>
<P>
   He teamed up with liberal Democratic Rep. Ron Wyden (now a
member of the Senate) from Oregon to pass the Internet Freedom and
Family Empowerment Act in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   One of Congress's first advocates of term limits, he opposed
most-favored-nation trade status for China, fought the 1995 Mexico
bailout legislation and got the House to go on record in 1996
supporting NATO membership extended to Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1952 in St. Paul, Minn., he went to California to attend
the University of Southern California, then attended Harvard's law
school and business school jointly. Returning to southern
California, he practiced law in Orange County, then was part of the
White House counsel's staff during the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   He has been supported in his political races by film director
Oliver North and conservative jurist Robert Bork, and has been
mentioned as a possible Republican opponent for both of
California's Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein. His 47th District, east of Los Angeles, is one of the
most reliably Republican districts in America.
</P>
<P>
   DAVID McINTOSH
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh's, who has declared his interest in seeking
the speakership, began his House service in the 1994 Republican
sweep that followed Gingrich's Contract With America. But his
involvement and interest in conservative political causes started
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   He says it began when he was 18 and saw 29-year-old Dan Quayle
in his first race for Congress in 1976. McIntosh later would
graduate from Yale University and the University of Chicago Law
School, where he studied under Antonin Scalia. McIntosh worked in
the Justice Department during the Reagan administration, and during
the Bush administration became director of the White House Council
on Competitiveness, which was headed by then-Vice President Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, he immediately established himself as the most
vocal House opponent of government regulation, calling for a
moratorium on all new regulations and writing bills to require
agencies to make cost-benefit analyses and risk assessments before
issuing new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed the House, despite Democrats' complaints that it
was a disguised assault on the environment and workplace safety,
then died in a House-Senate conference committee.
</P>
<P>
   McIntosh has not hesitated to criticize Gingrich, and was in the
thick of occasional rebellions by conservative members of the
``Class of '94.''
</P>
<P>
   JAMES M. TALENT
</P>
<P>
   The groups that rate members of Congress on the basis of key
votes are pretty clear about Rep. James M. Talent of Missouri. The
liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him a zero rating in
1995, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce rated him 100.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, frequently mentioned Friday as a possible candidate for
the speakership, represents the Second District on the west side of
metropolitan St. Louis, in an affluent area made up of a jigsaw
puzzle of tiny towns and a few large industrial facilities,
including a Ford plant and the McDonnell Douglas aircraft plant,
now owned by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, he has focused on the issue of military readiness
and decried the Clinton administration's defense budget cuts. His
ideas for welfare reform, spelled out in a bill he introduced in
1996, include denying benefits for a second child born while the
mother is on welfare and sending the children of unfit parents to
group homes.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, 42, graduated from Washington University in St. Louis
and the University of Chicago Law School. He was first elected to
the House in 1992, unseating incumbent Democrat Joan Kelly Horn. He
was opposed by Horn in 1996 and easily defeated her again, after
outspending her $1.1 million to $380,000.
</P>
<P>
   DICK ARMEY
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas is known as a
free-market economist and free user of political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Both characteristics can be controversial, but his occasional
loose remarks _ such as the time he told First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton that ``reports on your charm are overstated, and the
reports on your wit are understated'' _ have occasionally gotten
him in hot water.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, he described the Clinton Administration's
ill-fated health care reform initiative as a ``Kevorkian
prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   Army, 58, was first elected to the House in 1984 from Texas's
26th District, which sits in the solidly Republican and unusually
affluent north side of the Dallas-Ft. Worth metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cando, N.D., he attended Jamestown College in
Jamestown, N.D., and received a doctorate in economics from the
University of Oklahoma. He was an economics professor at North
Texas State University at Denton when he decided to run for
Congress and unseated a longtime Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Washington the next January too broke to rent an
apartment, so he slept in the House gym until he was forced to
stop, and then moved to his office couch.
</P>
<P>
   A chief architect of the 1994 ``Contract with America,'' which
ushered in the Republican majority in the House, he advocates
elimination of farm subsidies and a national flat tax of 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has publicly supported Gingrich in previous
controversies, there have been persistent reports of private moves
on his part to succeed to the speakership in the event Gingrich had
to leave the post.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statement Friday night praising Gingrich, Armey he
seemed to rule out any attempt to move up in the hierarchy by
saying, ``I will continue to seek the Majority Leader's post, to
provide our Conference with stability in managing the floor and
developing legislation as we undergo this difficult transition.''
</P>
<P>
   STEVE LARGENT
</P>
<P>
   Steve Largent is ready for the next chapter in his all-American
life.
</P>
<P>
   When he was born in Tulsa, Okla., 43 years ago, a nurse put a
toy football in his hospital crib. Sure enough, that blue-eyed baby
grew up to be a Hall of Fame wide receiver for the Seattle
Seahawks. ``People'' magazine proclaimed him one of its ``50 Most
Beautiful People in the World'' and Wheaties put his face on a
cereal box. He's been married to his high school sweetheart for 23
years and is devoted to their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an easy re-election to a third term as a Republican
congressman, Largent has decided to take on Armey in a battle over
the leadership and direction of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are hardly new for Largent. After attending the
University of Tulsa on a football scholarship, he was deemed too
small and too slow for the National Football League. He signed as a
free agent with the Seahawks and retired 14 years later with the
NFL career records for receptions, receiving yards and touchdown
catches.
</P>
<P>
   After working for several years as a marketing consultant and
appearing in TV commercials, he ran for Congress in 1994 as a
Christian conservative promising ``my faith, my family and my
values will give me the strength to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he has stubbornly set his own course _ voting
against the 1997 GOP budget deal and sparking headlines by
denouncing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE RADANOVICH
</P>

   A banker by trade, George Radanovich long dreamed of setting up
a winery amid the fertile fields and rolling pastures of
California's Central Valley. So in 1983, while working days as an
assistant bank manager, he founded the first winery in his native
Mariposa County. Each year, Radanovich Winery now produces several
thousand cases of sauvignon blanc, merlot and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>

the GOP. First elected to Congress in 1994, Radanovich is

He wants to limit the scope of both the federal government and the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Cal Tech graduate with a degree in agriculture business
management, the 43-year-old Radanovich is married to the former
Ethie Weaver, and the couple has one child.
</P>

liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave him a zero rating in
1995, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce rated him 100.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, frequently mentioned Friday as a possible candidate for
the speakership, represents the Second District on the west side of
metropolitan St. Louis, in an affluent area made up of a jigsaw
puzzle of tiny towns and a few large industrial facilities,
including a Ford plant and the McDonnell Douglas aircraft plant,
now owned by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, he has focused on the issue of military readiness
and decried the Clinton administration's defense budget cuts. His
ideas for welfare reform, spelled out in a bill he introduced in
1996, include denying benefits for a second child born while the
mother is on welfare and sending the children of unfit parents to
group homes.
</P>
<P>
   Talent, 42, graduated from Washington University in St. Louis
and the University of Chicago Law School. He was first elected to
the House in 1992, unseating incumbent Democrat Joan Kelly Horn. He
was opposed by Horn in 1996 and easily defeated her again, after
outspending her $1.1 million to $380,000.
</P>
<P>
   DICK ARMEY
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas is known as a
free-market economist and free user of political rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Both characteristics can be controversial, but his occasional
loose remarks _ such as the time he told First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton that ``reports on your charm are overstated, and the
reports on your wit are understated'' _ have occasionally gotten
him in hot water.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, he described the Clinton Administration's
ill-fated health care reform initiative as a ``Kevorkian
prescription.''
</P>
<P>
   Army, 58, was first elected to the House in 1984 from Texas's
26th District, which sits in the solidly Republican and unusually
affluent north side of the Dallas-Ft. Worth metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Cando, N.D., he attended Jamestown College in
Jamestown, N.D., and received a doctorate in economics from the
University of Oklahoma. He was an economics professor at North
Texas State University at Denton when he decided to run for
Congress and unseated a longtime Democratic incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Washington the next January too broke to rent an
apartment, so he slept in the House gym until he was forced to
stop, and then moved to his office couch.
</P>
<P>
   A chief architect of the 1994 ``Contract with America,'' which
ushered in the Republican majority in the House, he advocates
elimination of farm subsidies and a national flat tax of 17
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has publicly supported Gingrich in previous
controversies, there have been persistent reports of private moves
on his part to succeed to the speakership in the event Gingrich had
to leave the post.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a statement Friday night praising Gingrich, Armey he
seemed to rule out any attempt to move up in the hierarchy by
saying, ``I will continue to seek the Majority Leader's post, to
provide our Conference with stability in managing the floor and
developing legislation as we undergo this difficult transition.''
</P>
<P>
   STEVE LARGENT
</P>
<P>
   Steve Largent is ready for the next chapter in his all-American
life.
</P>
<P>
   When he was born in Tulsa, Okla., 43 years ago, a nurse put a
toy football in his hospital crib. Sure enough, that blue-eyed baby
grew up to be a Hall of Fame wide receiver for the Seattle
Seahawks. ``People'' magazine proclaimed him one of its ``50 Most
Beautiful People in the World'' and Wheaties put his face on a
cereal box. He's been married to his high school sweetheart for 23
years and is devoted to their four children.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after an easy re-election to a third term as a Republican
congressman, Largent has decided to take on Armey in a battle over
the leadership and direction of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Challenges are hardly new for Largent. After attending the
University of Tulsa on a football scholarship, he was deemed too
small and too slow for the National Football League. He signed as a
free agent with the Seahawks and retired 14 years later with the
NFL career records for receptions, receiving yards and touchdown
catches.
</P>
<P>
   After working for several years as a marketing consultant and
appearing in TV commercials, he ran for Congress in 1994 as a
Christian conservative promising ``my faith, my family and my
values will give me the strength to make the right decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he has stubbornly set his own course _ voting
against the 1997 GOP budget deal and sparking headlines by
denouncing same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE RADANOVICH
</P>
<P>
   A banker by trade, George Radanovich long dreamed of setting up
a winery amid the fertile fields and rolling pastures of
California's Central Valley. So in 1983, while working days as an
assistant bank manager, he founded the first winery in his native
Mariposa County. Each year, Radanovich Winery now produces several
thousand cases of sauvignon blanc, merlot and chardonnay.
</P>
<P>
   The vintner, meanwhile, has turned his attention from grapes to
the GOP. First elected to Congress in 1994, Radanovich is
challenging Rep. John Boehner of Ohio to be chairman of the House
Republican Conference, the caucus of all GOP members.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Croatian immigrants, Radanovich is an avowed
conservative who believes cutting taxes and easing environmental
restrictions on farmers and ranchers are keys to economic growth.
He wants to limit the scope of both the federal government and the
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   A Cal Tech graduate with a degree in agriculture business
management, the 43-year-old Radanovich is married to the former
Ethie Weaver, and the couple has one child.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER DUNN
</P>
<P>
   No matter who wins the Republican rebellion, Jennifer Dunn of
Washington is unlikely to lose her position as the highest-ranking
woman in the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   All sides know the party can't afford an all-male top team.
After her election as vice chairman of the House Republican
Conference in 1996, Dunn declared the vote ``a validation of the
fact a woman has a place not only in the Republican Party but in
the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Active in GOP politics since the 1960s, Dunn is a Stanford
graduate, a former IBM systems engineer and divorced mother of two
grown sons (one of whom is named Reagan). In 1992, she was elected
to Congress from a district made up mostly of Seattle's affluent
suburbs and has sought to put a kinder face on her party since her
arrival in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always been a proponent of softening our rhetoric,''
she said before the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   She has been a steadfast supporter of Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., who in return has backed her rise in the Republican ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscally conservative and pro-business, she has supported free
trade policies that benefit exporters around Seattle and policies
to advance Microsoft and other high-tech industries in her
district.
</P>
<P>
   JIM McCRERY
</P>
<P>
   Grits vs. Gumbo? Not really. In the fight for the chairmanship
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, incumbent Rep.
John Linder of Georgia is no good ol' boy, and his potential
challenger, Rep. Jim McCrery of Louisiana, is no Cajun.
</P>
<P>
   While Linder grew up in Minnesota, though, McCrery was reared
amid the piney woods and oil refineries of northern Louisiana _ a
strait-laced Protestant region more akin to Alabama than to the
free-rolling Catholic bayous of southern Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer from Shreveport, McCrery has been both a social and
fiscal conservative since he left his job as a regional manager for
Georgia-Pacific Corp. in 1988 to win election to Congress. He is a
steadfast opponent of abortion and a supporter of gun owners'
rights and the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   In his votes, he has been generally loyal to the GOP leadership,
although he voted against the 1990 tax increase backed by the Bush
administration and questioned the $500-per-child tax credit in the
1996 budget.
</P>
<P>
   McCrery, 49, is a graduate of Louisiana Tech and the Louisiana
State University law school. He is married to the former Johnette
Hawkins, and the couple has two children.

 &HT;    KIND WORDS MARK END OF CLINTON'S LONG BATTLE WITH GINGRICH
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was perhaps the most dramatic duel in modern
American politics, but the six-year standoff between President
Clinton and House Speaker Newt Gingrich ended Friday not with a
bang, but a whimper.
</P>
<P>
   ''Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary, leading the
Republican Party to a majority in the House, and joining me in a
great national debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st
century,'' Clinton said in a two-sentence statement released late
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite our profound differences,'' Clinton said, ''I
appreciate those times we were able to work together in the
national interest, and especially Speaker Gingrich's strong support
for America's continuing leadership for freedom, peace and
prosperity in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Having won the contest so decisively, there was little reason
for Clinton to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clinton was gracious in victory, Gingrich's long-term
House rival, Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., was not.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people sent a strong message that the Republican
Congress was a failure, that it's leadership didn't address the
issues they cared about,'' Gephardt said in a statement his office
released late Friday. ''The speaker's resignation is a reaction to
that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt criticized ''the intense partisanship'' of Gingrich's
tenure as speaker and to assail what he called ''the damage that
was wrought on this institution over the last four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he scolded that ''it is critically important that the
next speaker has a stronger sense of respect for the institution of
the House and for members on the other side of the aisle.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, after spending nearly 11 months worrying whether the
Monica Lewinsky scandal might cost him his job, watched the matter
play a central role in the broader political drama that would
eventually lead to Gingrich's announcement Friday that he would
resign as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you wrote it in a novel,'' said political analyst Stephen
Hess, ''nobody would believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since two political figures more clearly
defined their parties than Clinton and Gingrich have in recent
years, or that the two leading national figures of both parties
were so starkly different.
</P>
<P>
   Ideologically opposed on a long list of issues ranging from
taxes and health care to the future of Social Security, the two men
harbored mutual animosity that some interpreted as personal.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can count on two hands the number of times they really
collaborated,'' said University of Virginia professor of government
Larry Sabato. ''And they had a great dislike for each other,
despite the olive branches they would occasionally throw each
other's way.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly they were as different intellectually as they were
ideologically.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that Clinton has anywhere near the creative mind
that Gingrich has,'' said Hess. ''Gingrich was a bizarre
politician. He was a revolutionary ...but he was no tactician at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, ''can be a brilliant strategist and
a very endearing person when he needs to be,'' said Hess. ''Those
are not Gingrich's qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Each was behind the darkest moments of the other.
</P>
<P>
   After leading Republicans to take the House in 1994, Gingrich
sent Clinton into a smoldering funk, with the chastened president
alternately blaming himself and others for his party's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, it was Clinton who outmaneuvered the speaker in
a budget battle that led to the shutdown of the federal government.
A disgusted public largely blamed Gingrich, and his popularity
never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Never did the public more clearly draw the line between the two
men, however, than in recent months, as Clinton, even shadowed by
scandal and the prospect of impeachment, managed to maintain job
approval ratings of 60 percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Voters time and again denounced the Republican effort to hold
the president to account for the sex and deception scandal, and
Gingrich became the target of much of the public's furor.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to forgive Clinton for one alleged misstep after another,
the public never fully embraced Gingrich in anywhere near the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's difficult to explain, but, fundamentally, Americans just
didn't like the little guy,'' said Sabato. ''It wasn't
issue-oriented as much as it was personality-driven.''
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell how much Democrats are helped, or hurt, by
the abrupt bowing out of Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, after all, have lost a very high-profile whipping
boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just spoke two hours ago to a Democratic congressman, and he
said, and I'm quoting him exactly, 'We had precisely three days to
celebrate.' He was very glum,'' said Sabato.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democrats,'' he said, ''have lost their devil figure.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of Arab-Americans gathered outside a Times
Square movie theater Friday night to protest the debut of a new
thriller, ``The Siege,'' saying that the movie equates Arabs and
Islam with terrorism. But after the film received tepid reviews
this week, other Arab-American groups decided to cancel their
protests for fear of giving the film free publicity.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 people stood outside the Criterion Theater, on Broadway
at 45th Street, waving some placards that criticized the movie and
others that gave away the ending. Other protesters, from the
advocacy group New Yorkers For A Just Middle East Peace, tried to
talk to moviegoers about the film, which opened across the country
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforced negative stereotypes of Arabs and Muslims in
America,'' said Laura Haddad, an organizer of the protest.
</P>
<P>
   The film stars Denzel Washington as an FBI agent investigating a
series of terrorist bombings in New York City. Bruce Willis plays a
general who is put in charge of the city after martial law is
imposed in an effort to stop the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of the film among Arab-Americans began while the movie
was being filmed in Brooklyn and some details of the plot were
revealed. The controversy intensified after previews appeared in
movie theaters last summer. Arab-American groups in other parts of
the country have been faxing letters to the studios, writing to
advocacy groups and holding news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the film, Edward Zwick, said he intended to make
a film about the difficulty an Arab-American has dealing with Arab
terrorism and American racism. One of the film's heroes is an
Arab-American FBI agent. The character, portrayed by Tony Shaloub,
who is of Lebanese descent, is torn when the government detains
Arab-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie makes the point that it is impossible to generalize
about Arab-Americans,'' Zwick said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the moviegoers in Times Square on Friday night agreed.
Angel Swanson, 20, left the theater and confronted Ms. Haddad. ``I
saw it as a way of showing people racism about Arabs is just as bad
as racism against anyone,'' Ms. Swanson said.

 &HT;    German ambassador to U.S. focuses on action, not remorse
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ An hour after arriving from Washington
to speak to a synagogue full of people his father's generation
tried to exterminate, Germany's ambassador to the United States
talks about his country's relationship with the world Jewish
community.
</P>
<P>
   Not once does he use the word remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Juergen Chrobog talks about action. Sitting in the
veranda of the Brazilian Court Hotel in a blue, double-breasted
pinstripe suit, Chrobog talks about the Holocaust curriculum taught
to all German students. ``The best in the world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He talks about Israel, after America, Germany's most important
ally. He talks about the $120 billion in war reparations Germany
has paid to the world Jewish community; about youth exchange
programs; about the burgeoning Jewish community (now 75,000) back
home; about additional restitution being considered by private
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Chrobog paints a picture of the new Germany. A Germany which has
taken responsibility for its actions and acted on its
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In five hours the highest ranking German diplomat in America
will don a yarmulke and enter a synagogue for the first time in his
life. He will answer questions about the Germany of his father's
generation posed by survivors and the children of survivors, some
of whom still will not buy a German car.
</P>
<P>
   He is not nervous, he says. ``I have a lot to share.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday marks the 60th anniversary of Kristalnacht, the night the
anti-Semitism that had been simmering in Germany for decades boiled
over.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 9, 1938, in a state-sponsored, nation-wide riot, German
hooligans torched 101 synagogues, vandalized 7,500 Jewish
businesses and killed 91 Jews. The word itself translates to night
of broken glass, referring to the thousands of smashed Jewish
storefronts windows.
</P>
<P>
   Kristalnacht was the beginning of the end, says Rabbi Leonid
Feldman, who invited Chrobog to speak at Temple Beth-El of Palm
Beach. It was the day the German people gave Hitler tacit
permission to carry out his final solution.
</P>
<P>
   But Feldman's message Friday night, he says, will be ``that this
is a different world.'' Sixty years after the government sponsored
terrorism, a high government representative will be sitting next to
a torah in a synagogue, and he will be listening to what the
survivors of his father's generation have to say.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he thinks his successor a decade or two from now
will make appearances similar to the one he is making tonight,
Chrobog pauses briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a long time to go. Sixty years, it seems to
become a long time, but it's not long enough.''

 &HT;    Mitch's soaking may entitle area to federal relief
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Palm Beach and Martin counties may
qualify for federal disaster aid because of the multimillion-dollar
pounding they suffered at the hands of Tropical Storm Mitch, Gov.
Lawton Chiles said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles asked President Clinton to declare a disaster area in the
Keys, which took the brunt of Mitch's wrath just six weeks after
Hurricane Georges pounded the islands. He said Palm Beach, Martin,
Broward and Miami-Dade counties might request the same federal help
later.
</P>
<P>
   Homes, crops ruined
</P>
<P>
   Besides destroying at least $10 million in Palm Beach County
vegetable crops and an untold amount of newly planted sugar cane,
Mitch's deluge flooded hundreds of homes. The flooding was
especially acute around Boynton Beach, where more than a foot of
rain fell Wednesday and early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pumps and floodgates furiously dumped water into Lake
Okeechobee, the Everglades, the Lake Worth Lagoon and anyplace else
that could take it Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While some homeowners mopped up mud-spattered floors, other
residents counted the damage in different ways:
</P>
<P>
   Beaches eroded, including as much as 5 feet of shoreline in
Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Boats capsized or went scattering as rain swelled lakes and
canals. That included a $30,000 ski boat that capsized and jammed
against a bridge in the Lake Ida area between Boynton Beach and
Delray Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Rough surf spawned by Mitch also smashed the Jean Cabot, an
80-foot cabin cruiser that had been beached in Boca Raton since
Oct. 27. South Inlet Park reopened Friday, a day after closing
because of the danger posed by the strewn chunks of wood and metal.
</P>
<P>
   In Jupiter Farms and other parts of north Palm Beach County,
roads that had become ponds were mostly clear Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just nuisance flooding that dissipated very quickly,''
said Gale English of the South Indian River Water Control District,
which drains Jupiter Farms and Palm Beach Country Estates.
</P>
<P>
   In The Acreage, the typically swampy region was relatively dry
but draining slowly, said John Bonde, administrator of the Indian
Trails Improvement District.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Power &AMP; Light reported all electricity restored Friday,
after gusts blew power lines down or into trees and left more than
177,000 customers throughout the state without power.
</P>
<P>
   State emergency managers had no estimate of the total damage in
Palm Beach County., which fared much more easily than Central
America, where more than 10,000 people died in flooding and
mudslides spawned by Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers, who had expected Mitch to drop no more than 4 to
6 inches in Palm Beach County, admitted it surprised them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was going to be heavy, but we didn't forecast
this,'' said Eric Swartz, meteorologist at the South Florida Water
Management District. He said the storm slowed slightly and widened
as it crossed the peninsula, so South Florida spent more time than
expected in heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers said the area has seen more intense rains than
Mitch, especially a 20-inch downpour centered in north Palm Beach
County that flooded nearly 1,200 homes in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitch created the most widespread deluge in at least 15
years, dumping an average of 5.3 inches across 16 counties from Key
West to Orlando, Swartz said. The previous record-holder was a
freak storm in January 1991 that dropped 3.5 inches across the
region, including as much as 9 inches in the Glades.
</P>
<P>
   Local drainage managers and farmers generally gave the water
district good marks in its handling of this downpour. An exception
was in south Palm Beach County, where one local drainage manager
accused the district of acting too slowly to widen its floodgates.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers continued Friday to defend their conduct, with
paperwork to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   La Nia arrives
</P>
<P>
   According to district records, water managers opened their
coastal floodgates in Delray Beach and the Boynton Inlet by 2.5 to
5 feet around noon Wednesday, ahead of the storm, and had them at 8
to 9 feet by Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight Wednesday, the gates were open so wide that they
almost certainly caused some erosion downstream, district
Operations Manager Ron Mierau said. Had they been wider, he said,
the erosion could have damaged the gates and made future storms
harder to handle.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Winters, director of the Lake Worth Drainage District in
Delray Beach, said Friday he's not convinced. He said he thinks the
water managers opened their gates only after he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the damage the rain cause, water managers offered one
bit of consolation:
</P>
<P>
   The November-to-May dry season is under way, and might become
even drier than usual because of La Nia _ the opposite of last
year's rain-bringing El Nio weather pattern. So the rain that Mitch

GIANTS AIM TO KEEP HEADS UP AND SANDERS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Dallas Cowboys' Deion Sanders spent
more time in the New York Giants' end zone than any Giants player
during the first meeting between the teams this season.
</P>
<P>
   In a humiliating 31-7 loss to the Cowboys on ``Monday Night
Football'' on Sept. 21, the Giants floundered as Sanders took a
punt and weaved 59 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't all. Sanders also helped open a 24-7 lead in the
third quarter with a 55-yard pass reception in key a touchdown
drive and then ended the scoring in the fourth quarter with an
80-yard interception return for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the Giants can easily recognize their mistakes.
The punt was intended to hug the sideline, but Brad Maynard
misplaced the ball and it went only 37 yards, right down the middle
of the field with a hang time of only 2.8 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On the interception, a Giants receiver fell down. But the common
denominator was that every one of the mistakes provided an
opportunity, and Sanders took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   So it was only natural that the Giants (3-5) paid special
attention to special teams for their rematch against the Cowboys
(5-3) in Texas on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a play,'' coach Jim Fassel said. ``That's what great
players do. When they're presented an opportunity to make a play,
they make plays. We'll do everything we can to keep him out of the
end zone. I'm not going to divulge what I'm going to do with our
punt team, but it's pretty obvious we don't want his hands on the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry MacDuff, the special teams coach, added: ``I don't want
this guy to be made out to be some superhuman being that can't be
stopped because he certainly can. But he makes you pay for
mistakes. He's done that on offense; he's done that on defense. Put
the ball in the wrong place and he slices it and goes. There's
going to be times every week that he gets his hands on the ball and
then it's an 11-man proposition. The punter is a big factor
involved in that, but the other guys, as far as protection and
coverage, it's a team thing. It's a total unit of 11 guys doing
their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are not the only team that has been caught in
Sanders' whirlwind this season. Already, he has returned punts of
69, 60, 59 and 43 yards this season, as well as a 70-yard touchdown
that was called back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the most amazing athletes that I've ever been
around,'' the Cowboys first-year head coach Chan Gailey, said.
``Great things just seem to happen around him, and after a while
you have to realize that it's no coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Strahan's Back Improving
</P>
<P>
   Michael Strahan practiced for the first time this week after
back spasms forced him out of the lineup after only two plays last
Sunday. Even though he felt better than he had all week, he is
uncertain whether he will be able to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a lot better than I did yesterday,'' Strahan said.
``Every day has gotten better. I'm glad we have a couple more days
before the game because it gives me an opportunity to play. At this
point, I don't think I could go out there and do every play or
every down. I don't know if my back would hold up. I don't know if
the muscles in my back would get tired. The way it felt today,
maybe I can do spot duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my back is messed up I'm not doing myself or the team any
good if I play hurt. It would be great if it was something that I
could say, `Oh, my knee is a little twisted or my ankle is a little
sore and I could go out there and chance it.' But with a back, it's
something that can affect not only football, it will affect me
getting up and walking around my house. It's not like an ankle
where I can limp around a little bit until it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's messed up I won't play. Right now, it's better. I
don't know if I'm playing or not.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It seemed somehow the ultimate irony of this
strange political year, the year stigmatized by President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky. Instead of Bill Clinton being the one
to fall, it was Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Four years after the Georgia Republican was hailed as the
visionary who won control of Congress for his party in 1994,
Gingrich stepped down Friday night, facing a mutiny from
Republicans who insisted that his flaws could cost them the very
majority he had created.
</P>
<P>
   In more heady days, the mercurial Georgia Republican had called
himself a ``transformational figure'' and a ``definer of
civilization.'' But Friday evening at 6:30 p.m., ET, facing a
leadership challenge, Gingrich told his fellow House Republicans in
conference calls that he was ``a target'' and would step down for
the good of the party. He was not just leaving as speaker. He was
leaving Congress at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that he tried to discuss his decision with
dignity. But they said he could not hide his bitterness and sadness
as he spoke of those who would ``cannibalize'' the party because
they wanted things their way or no way.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's sudden fall came just four days after a midterm
election that dealt Republicans a setback even more unexpected than
their 52-seat pickup which he organized in 1994. But losing five
seats was the occasion, and yet not the cause, for the antagonism
that brought Gingrich's turbulent rein as House Speaker to such an
extraordinary end.
</P>
<P>
   The anger against him had been building all year and Republicans
say that by Friday Gingrich's troubles ran extremely deep _ fueled
by his miscalculations on election strategy, his persistent
unpopularity with the public and his failure to rally the divided
House Republicans around an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, House Republicans ran and won on an organizing theme,
the ``Contract with America,'' which stressed less regulation, tax
cuts, term limits and a balanced budget. But once they worked out a
balanced budget, with tax cuts, in 1997, they seemed an
ideologically spent force.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans went into this year's election largely running
on the past. And its result provided one more reason for change.
Gingrich is almost universally disliked by House Democrats, and
some Republicans said that now that they have an almost unworkable
six-vote majority, they need a speaker who can work with Democrats,
not infuriate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I believe desperately needs to take place is to heal the
alienation that currently exists,'' said Rep. Steve Largent of
Oklahoma, a conservative football Hall of Famer who announced his
own challenge Friday to Gingrich's second-in-command, Rep. Dick
Armey. Largent cited the rifts not just inside the Republican
caucus, but between House Republicans and Democrats, House
Republicans and the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the speaker's problems, many Republicans said, is
that he had never made an adequate adjustment from minority to
majority, from intense backbench opposition to governing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revolutionizing takes some talents _ many talents,''
Gingrich's challenger, Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana said, as he
announced the candidacy for speaker that drove Gingrich from
office. ``My friend, Newt Gingrich, brought those talents to bear,
put the Republicans in the majority. Day-to-day governing takes
others.''
</P>
<P>
   As a minority firebrand, Gingrich attacked Democrats, including
Speaker Jim Wright, over ethics issues. Throughout 1996, they
returned the favor, and as Congress convened in 1997, he was barely
re-elected speaker, and then reprimanded and fined $300,000 for
bringing discredit on the House by using tax-exempt money to
promote Republican goals.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-edged partisan bite that worked for Gingrich in the
minority came across as stridency in power, Republicans said.
``Whenever we try to go on the offensive the White House tries to
make Newt the issue and whenever that happens we lose,'' said Peter
King.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Gingrich and Clinton have been locked for years in a
strange symbiotic competition. It was Clinton's failed attempt to
pass national health care that helped bring Gingrich into the
majority. It was the Speaker's gamble on shutting down the
government in the winter of 1995-96 that assured Clinton his own
re-election. And this year it was Gingrich's misreading of the
public mood on impeachment that helped bring about his own demise.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Gingrich's problems had nothing to do with Clinton.
In a fractured Republican caucus struggling to define itself, he
could never satisfy every ideological instinct and faction. So at
the end he came under attack from moderates and conservatives, and
was not even defended eagerly by some of those for whom he raised
hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign funds.
</P>
<P>
   It was those same ideological divisions that made it so hard for
him to craft an agenda for his party this year, even on fiscal
issues which once unified Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   When Gingrich allowed Rep. John Kasich, the budget committee
chairman, to try to rally House Republicans around a conservative
blueprint for more than $100 billion in new savings, the moderates
refused to back it.
</P>
<P>
   When House Republicans supported a $70 billion tax cut, Senate
Republicans refused to pass it. The disarray was so complete that
Congress for the first time since 1974 failed to ever pass an
actual budget.
</P>
<P>
   That stalemate put the Republicans in the weakened state that
left them with little alternative in October but to reach an
agreement with Clinton on a massive $500 billion spending bill that
alienated their conservative base on the eve of the election.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's defenders said their colleagues were being
hypocrites, blaming him for their own unwillingness to strike
compromises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a problem with leadership,'' said Rep. Mike Parker,
a Mississippi Republican who is retiring and thus barred from
voting in the leadership election. ``It was a problem of
followership. We had all these people who wouldn't get along. We
couldn't get the rank and file members of the Republican conference
to take the votes necessary even down to passing a budget.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich's critics say it was his role to bridge these
divisions. ``That's the challenge of leadership,'' said Rep. Marge
Roukema, R-N.J. ``I'm sorry. The Democratic Party used to be very
fractured between its southerners and the liberals. That's the
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Gingrich might have survived if he had not already had
such a tumultuous political history, leaving enemies, Democrat and
Republican alike in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   He has had more admirers than friends among House Republicans.
His raw ambition _ he wanted to be speaker from the time he was 14,
said _ scared some colleagues and awed others. His inability to
keep from sounding boastful, or in 1995, complaining about not
getting a good seat on Air Force One en route to Yitzhak Rabin's
funeral. But, until Friday, he always rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   When his own firebrand conservatives and leadership tried to
mount a coup against him in the summer of 1997 _ before the
balanced budget deal, he survived by drawing support from the
barons of the party _ the committee chairmen. And one of the most
important of them had been Livingston, who let it be known that he
would wield his power over spending to keep rebels in line.
</P>
<P>
   As a new rebellion brewed this his week, Gingrich looked for
support. Just hours before he stepped down, his spokeswoman
Christina Martin said he had made 50 calls since Wednesday seeking
commitments. But his party wanted to avoid the bruising
confrontation that would come with a leadership struggle.
Republicans said Gingrich understood he had to leave when Rep. Bill
Archer, the Ways and Means chairman, who had originally promised
his support, called back later and told him it was time for him to
go.
</P>
<P>
   So Friday night he left, saying ``I urge my colleagues to pick
leaders who can both reconcile and discipline, who can work
together and communicate effectively.'' He added, ''They have my
prayers and my thoughts as they undertake this task.''

KINGS' BLAKE OUT 6-8 WEEKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Kings' epidemic of serious injuries
reached its most distressing level yet Friday with the news that
captain Rob Blake, the NHL's best defenseman last season, has a
broken right foot and will be sidelined for six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Blake suffered the injury eight days ago in a 3-0 loss to Tampa
Bay when he was struck by a puck. X-rays were negative, and he
played 27 minutes, 57 seconds in a 3-0 loss to Phoenix on Sunday
and 22:26 in Thursday night's 2-2 tie with St. Louis. All the
while, severe pain persisted, and an MRI on Friday revealed the
injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings (4-5-3), who play host to Dallas at 6:30 tonight, are
down to five healthy defensemen as a result of Blake's injury and
the broken hand suffered Sunday by Doug Bodger.
</P>
<P>
   They did not recall a defenseman Friday from the Long Beach Ice
Dogs. Their options are limited by exhibition season injuries: a
bruised leg suffered by Jaroslav Modry and the broken hand suffered
by Mark Visheau. Most likely to be called up is 22-year-old Jan
Nemecek of the Ice Dogs, who has never appeared in an NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, relatively healthy last season, have been hit hard by
injuries this season, with extended absences by goalies Stephane
Fiset and Jamie Storr (groin strains); Blake, Bodger, centers Ian
Laperriere (knee injury) and Jozef Stumpel (hip-flexor strain) and
wingers Sandy Moger (back strain) and Steve McKenna (abdominal
strain).
</P>
<P>
   Bylsma's back: McKenna was hurt in a first-period tussle
Thursday with St. Louis tough guy Tony Twist, and will be sidelined
indefinitely. As a result, the Kings recalled role-playing winger
Dan Bylsma from the Ice Dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any profession, you want to strive to be at the highest
level, and that's being in the NHL,'' Bylsma said. ``That's my goal
at the beginning of the season, the end of the season and all the
time. To get sent down is certainly a disappointment. It's my job
just to get a positive out of any situation, and when I get the
opportunity, to do the best I can and prove I deserve another
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Loose pucks: Coach Larry Robinson and general manager Dave
Taylor met Friday afternoon with Kings co-owner Philip Anschutz,
the purpose of the meeting undisclosed. The latest trade rumor,
this one in a Calgary Sun article, has the Kings hotly pursuing
Flames free-agent-to-be Theo Fleury. Taylor has declined to answer
questions about trade possibilities.... Stumpel has skated the last
three days but won't be back for a week or two. Storr is closer to
returning than Fiset, and could be cleared to play by Monday.
Whether his first action will be with the Kings or Ice Dogs has yet
to be announced.

EDITORIAL: A BAN ON CELLS THAT COULD HEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Nov. 7:
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough in growing human stem cells in the laboratory
with private funding is not only a stunning achievement, it is a
rebuke to Congress for banning federal funding of this exciting
research. Scientists are now poised to explore new therapies for
dreaded diseases. Yet, thanks to a congressional ban on federal
funding for most research on embryos, the government may find it
hard to accelerate a promising field or monitor its ethical issues.
</P>
<P>
   The research involves cultivating ``human embryonic stem cells''
before they have begun to differentiate into the specialized cells
that form the individual parts of the body. It opens the way to
grow heart cells for cardiac patients, brain tissue for Parkinson's
patients, or bone marrow to treat leukemia and other cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Such treatments are years away. Scientists must first learn how
to nudge the stem cells to develop into specific tissues and
organs, and they must keep the transplanted cells from being
rejected by a patient's immune system. Thus the first use of the
cells will almost certainly be for research.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the government can play a significant role is uncertain.
At least one of the studies just reported would almost certainly
have been barred from federal funding by the congressional ban on
embryo research. This is a sad state given that the gains are
potentially enormous and the ethical problems appear minimal. One
research team used cells from fertilized eggs that would otherwise
have been discarded after treating infertile couples, and the other
used cells from already aborted fetuses. They literally created a
major advance from cells that would otherwise have been wasted.

U.S. EQUESTRIAN TEAM WINS JUMPING COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paced by Eric Hasbrouck's faultless ride aboard Miss
Fio in the second round, the U.S. Equestrian Team won the Samsung
Nations' Cup international jumping competition Friday night at the
National Horse Show at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The host team's score of 32 faults sent the trophy back to the
USET's trophy case for the third year in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring the best three rounds put in by each team's four horse
and rider combinations in each of two rounds, Canada led after the
first session with 18 1/4 faults. The USET's Alison Firestone,
riding Major, and Hasbrouck each had four faults. Leslie
Burr-Howard collected 16 astride After Eight, giving the squad 24
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   After Firestone and Major scored four faults in the second
phase, Hasbrouck, riding in his seventh Nations' Cup, moved the
Americans into contention with a clear round within the time
allowed of 79 seconds. After Burr-Howard and After Eight jumped all
the fences but the next-to-last one without a knockdown, the U.S
lead was wide enough to allow the fourth rider, Margie
Goldstein-Engle, aboard Hidden Creek's Alvaretto, to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's best performance was put in by Tani Tops-Zeidler,
aboard Starvos, scoring zero jumping faults and one time fault in
the first round. Sixteen faults charged to Sarah Watt and her
mount, Arabian, in the second round, coupled with 28 from Frankie
Chesler, riding Ravenna Z, caused the Canadians to settle for
second with 68 faults.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat
who for almost five decades has been a fixture of American politics
as a presidential adviser, scholar and member of Congress,
announced Friday that he would not run for re-election when his
fourth term ends in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have been 24 years,'' Moynihan said in an interview,
adding: ``I've been very happy, and there was a very positive note
to this last election. It's time to make room for others.''
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Moynihan, 71, who has been among the state's
most popular elected officials for years, is certain to trigger
fierce competition in both major parties to replace him. By Friday
afternoon, a dozen of the state's best-known politicians were being
mentioned as possible candidates for the seat, including New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, and Democrats H. Carl McCall,
the state comptroller; Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of Housing
and Urban Development, and Donna Shalala, the U.S. secretary of
Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's announcement comes at moment when New York's
congressional delegation has been steadily losing seniority and
influence in the Republican-controlled Congress. In the last two
years, six members of the state's 31- member House delegation have
resigned or announced plans to retire, including its three most
powerful Republicans: Susan Molinari of Staten Island, Bill Paxon
of Buffalo and Gerald Solomon of Glens Falls.
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, the last remaining
Republican in the Senate from the metropolitan region of New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut, was defeated by Rep. Charles Schumer, a
nine-term Democrat from Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Well before Moynihan first made his announcement that he would
retire, during an interview with Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV in New
York, New York Republicans had been warning that the entire
metropolitan area would lose much clout in Congress if D'Amato was
defeated. But Friday, jubilant Democrats argued that Tuesday's
election, in which their party gained five seats in the House, had
led them to believe that they could recapture control of the House
in 2000 and of the Senate in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same general trends which elected Chuck Schumer and which
produced a complete Democratic Senate delegation in the metro area
will be working in 2000,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan's announcement prompted a flood of news releases from
Gov. George Pataki, Giuliani and New York City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone praising his 22 years in office and bemoaning his
decision to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting an assessment of Moynihan in the Almanac of American
Politics, Giuliani called the senator ``the best thinker among
politicians since Lincoln and the best politician among thinkers
since Jefferson.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan has had a chilly relationship with President Clinton,
and Friday the task of comment on his tenure fell to Vice President
Al Gore. Gore issued a statement that said: ``Daniel Patrick
Moynihan's retirement from the Senate will mark a true milestone in
the history of our nation's public life. Sen. Moynihan has been
both an extraordinary public servant as well as a visionary
thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan has had one of the most varied careers of any member of
the Senate. He started as an aide to Gov. W. Averell Harriman in
the 1950s, was assistant secretary of labor in the Kennedy and
Johnson administrations, chief domestic adviser to President Nixon
and chief representative to the United Nations under President
Ford. He has also been ambassador to India, taught urban studies at
Harvard University and written or edited 18 books.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, he is the ranking Democrat on the powerful
Finance Committee, where he has played a leading role in shaping
tax, health care and Social Security policies. He was also the main
author of a 1991 law that set aside billions of dollars for highway
and mass transit projects across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But arguably Moynihan's impact was greater as a writer and
thinker than as a legislator. Known for his tweed jackets, knit
ties and untamed shock of white hair, he often expounded on the
floor of the Senate and to reporters on issues as far-ranging as
race relations, welfare policy, nuclear arms proliferation,
relations between India and Pakistan and the history of
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Beyond the Melting Pot,'' which he wrote with Nathan Glazer
in 1963, Moynihan analyzed the impact of ethnic rivalries on
American politics. In a 1965 report, he warned about the growth of
single-parent families. And in his most recent book, ``Secrecy: The
American Experience,'' he warns against the dangers of government
secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview with Pressman, Moynihan said his wife and
closest political adviser, Elizabeth, had ``made up our mind four
years ago'' about not running. ``I'll have served four terms in the
Senate, just as dear Jack Javits had done,'' he said, adding
parenthetically, ``I wished he had let it stay at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan noted in the interview that he had read a news article
last week in which McCall, the state comptroller, mused about
running for the Senate in 2000. Looking into the camera, Moynihan
said, ``This is to say, Carl, I won't be in that primary _ I hope
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., the Senate's only
black member, was defeated on Tuesday, Moynihan said that McCall
``may decide that he owes it to his community'' to run. ``I hope he
does,'' he continued. ``It's not right that the U.S. Senate should
be all white.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many New York politicians had thought it unlikely that
Moynihan would seek a precedent-setting fifth term _ he had done
very little fund raising to prepare for a race _ few expected him
to declare his plans so soon after the 1998 elections. Privately,
many Democrats said they were relieved that he had made the
announcement early, thereby giving candidates time to raise money
and support before the 2000 primaries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There has been much grumbling among local Democratic officials
in recent years about Moynihan's lack of involvement in the party,
which had been devastated by the elections of Pataki and Giuliani.
And there had been some speculation in Democratic circles that
Moynihan might face a primary in 2000, just as Sen. Jacob Javits
did in 1980, when D'Amato rose from obscurity to defeat him soundly
on his way to a first term.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts have said it would be difficult for even a
well-known Democrat to oust the senior senator, who in almost all
of his races has been the Democrats' top vote-getter and whose
margin of victory in 1988 set a record for New York statewide
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Moynihan himself said in an interview Friday that he was
concerned that other Democratic candidates would have had to
restrain their campaign preparations until he announced his plans,
and he said he did not want those contenders to endure months of
speculation about whether he would run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to let the party know that the seat will be open, and
all comers are welcome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been many questions about Moynihan's health. At
a campaign event with Schumer last month, he had to be assisted
from the stage when, suffering from the flu, he became dizzy. But
on Friday the senator said he felt good, and that his decision was
not influenced by health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a problem, which is I have a torn miniscus in my
right knee which I incurred in the Senate, having followed the
instructions of my wife to start exercising about a year ago,'' he
said.

ON ANTI-ABORTION FRONT LINE, A RIGOROUS ROUTINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Rosina Lotempio was standing outside abortion
clinics here before Operation Rescue stormed into town in 1992 for
the rowdy Spring of Life rallies, in which hundreds were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   She was there before Lambs of Christ demonstrators came to town
in 1993. She was on the sidewalk outside Buffalo GYN Womenservices
the morning of Oct. 23, about 12 hours before Barnett Slepian, the
clinic doctor, was fatally shot in his home.
</P>
<P>
   And she was there Friday, brown rosary beads in her hands, a
small gold cross on a chain around her neck, quietly praying for
abortions to stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken when I have to come here,'' Mrs. Lotempio, 58,
said as she stood in the cold, wearing small black earmuffs and a
white turtleneck adorned with a tiny silver pin of baby feet.
``It's very difficult out here; I depend on God,'' she said, after
praying for several moments to decide whether to talk to a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The bombings, the fiery rhetoric of abortion opponents and the
posters of bloody fetuses may capture the attention of the news
media, but people like Mrs. Lotempio are the foot soldiers in the
abortion battle.
</P>
<P>
   They call themselves street counselors and come to the clinic
whenever they believe abortions are being performed. They pray and
they talk to women, hoping to change their minds. Some scream
profanities. Others, like Mrs. Lotempio, denounce not only the
violence against doctors and clinics, but also the blocking of
doors and the shouting of ugly epithets at clinic workers and
patients.
</P>
<P>
   For the approximately 80 abortion opponents here, their protest
is more like a job than a political activity. There is a schedule.
People count on them to show up.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lotempio, a mother of three and grandmother of six,
connects her involvement to a conversation in the 1970s in which
she helped a friend decide to abort an unwanted pregnancy. Two
decades later, she was haunted by her own question: whether the
fetus was male or female. ``I just felt horrible and I felt
guilty,'' she said, tears in her eyes. ``I thought that if I was at
the clinic doing something, I could make up for that baby's life.''
</P>
<P>
   During Mrs. Lotempio's 8 a.m.-to-10 a.m. shift Friday, about a
dozen people circled the area in front of the Buffalo clinic,
saying the ``Hail Mary.'' Others take her spot on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays. She returns on Saturdays, when up to 40 people crowd
the sidewalk. Similar bands of protesters march in front of
abortion clinics throughout the United States, and local protesters
are often joined by bands of people who roam the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the clinic on Main Street, north of downtown Buffalo, there
is an odd sense of community. Local protesters greet Dick, the
security guard, by name. They sometimes see the ``enemy'' _
abortion-rights volunteers who escort patients in and out of the
clinic _ in the supermarket or on the soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Behn, one of the protest leaders, even spent two hours
talking about abortion over breakfast last year with Slepian. And
several said they cried when they heard of Slepian's death.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the protesters, including Mrs. Lotempio, were among the
thousands of people arrested here in 1992, the height of
anti-abortion activity in Buffalo. But if Operation Rescue returns,
as planned, for a Spring of Life reunion in April, Mrs. Lotempio
said, she will not be there. Instead, she plans to stay in church
and pray, to avoid the militancy she says she finds uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Murray, a lawyer for Womenservices clinic, said: ``When
people from out of town show up, that is when we feel the most
danger. The local people are a known quantity. We know most of the
local people by name.''

<P>
   Buffalo has been among a handful of hot spots for abortion
protesters for the last decade. It is a heavily Catholic city where
thousands of protesters from around the country demonstrated for
two weeks in 1992. They failed to close abortion clinics, but 500
people were arrested in rallies that snarled traffic and drew
national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Those rallies, as well as earlier protests and continuing
sidewalk vigils, have had an impact, people on both sides of the
abortion issue say. The number of clinics performing abortions in
the Buffalo area has dropped to one from three. And after Slepian's
death and the retirement this week of another doctor, there are
only two doctors in the area for whom abortions form a significant
part of their practices.
</P>
<P>
   The daily demonstrators count this as progress. But their perch
outside the clinic means they witness far more of what they believe
are murders than what they call rescues. About 30 women a day might
go into the clinic. After eight years, Mrs. Lotempio can count
eight women who changed their minds and did not get abortions while
she was at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the clinic, the protests just make a hard job harder,
many clinic workers say. While some demonstrators simply repeat the
rosary, other protesters call out to patients as they drive into
the parking lot behind the building, or walk up to the fortresslike
front. They ask questions like ``Do you know what your baby looks
like?'' or ``Is it a boy or a girl?'' Sometimes they accuse people
of murder and torture and sin, or threaten them with damnation.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law bars protesters from coming within 15 feet of the
clinic entrances, and from leaning signs against its walls. Some
push the limits, frustrating clinic workers and guards. The rules
protect people from physical harassment, but because of the
distance, they turn what could be quiet conversations into catcalls
and taunts.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient goes into the clinic, the protesters ``take on a
different persona,'' said Melinda DuBois, director of the Buffalo
clinic. ``They scream and yell and call us names. They lie. Some
days we're immune to it, but other days it's just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Palm, 51, marching at the clinic on Friday, said she
identified with the clinic patients. When she was 23, she said, she
struggled with the difficulties of being unmarried and pregnant
herself, but decided to have her child, and married the father. She
began protesting in 1990, after attending an abortion protest march
in Albany.

 &HT;    Did he see this one coming?
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a historian, Newt Gingrich must know of many rulers
who, through their own inattention, let relatively ordinary
setbacks unhorse their grand ambitions. Yet the end of his
speakership has come with a shattering, ahistorical suddenness, as
if he really didn't see this one coming.
</P>
<P>
   With his talent for talking about things in epochal terms,
Gingrich could have portrayed this year's election as nothing more
than a speed bump in the great historical parade. In an election
year as tricky and unpredictable as this one, it would have been
wise to play down expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even after the polls closed Tuesday night _ when as it
turned out his own fate already was sealed _ Gingrich was pumping
up a Republican crowd at the Cobb Galleria with the vastly
overconfident prediction that at worst, the GOP would still add to
their majority in House and Senate seats and governorships.
</P>
<P>
   The same overconfidence, expressed earlier in the day in a
conference call with nervous Republican House members, led
precipitously to their post-election rebellion and Gingrich's
decision to leave Congress for what seems a rather _ well, you have
to say it _ Napoleonic exile.
</P>
<P>
   In a grand irony, the House Republican Caucus will meet to
choose Gingrich's successor within days after Kenneth Starr takes
his lonely trip to Capitol Hill to make his dramatically
scaled-back argument for the impeachment of William Jefferson
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   During his first year as speaker, Gingrich got burned badly
enough in his dealings with Clinton that he was able to write an
entire book about what he had learned from his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   At times this year it appeared he really had learned. His calls
for soberness and order in the impeachment seemed not only
appropriate but a sign of political respect for Starr's quarry.
</P>
<P>
   But this was against the larger backdrop of a grand strategy _
put in place before the Republicans won the House and never
expunged, as often as it has proven ineffective _ of dealing with
this administration by attacking its legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Once convinced Clinton did not deserve to be in the White House,
the Republican leadership could not cope with the problem of what
to do with him while he is there. Lulled by a year of Lewinsky
buzz, they let this session end with no discernable progress toward
a tax cut and sleep-walked into the election with no conception of
how much they had turned off their own electorate and turned the
other side on.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, drawn irresistably toward the Arkansas tar baby,
Gingrich took a personal hand in the impeachment proceedings and
became linked to the anti-Clinton ads that were the last
punctuation marks on a yearlong political mistake.
</P>
<P>
   A close-focus picture of Gingrich, his face drawn into a
sardonic grin that makes him look like Chucky, the horror-movie
clown, appears beside a scary picture of Starr in one of the last
mailings sent to African-American families in Georgia last week.
Always susceptible to caricature, he had let himself become the
ultimate foil.
</P>
<P>
   What does the world historical figure leave behind him? A
Republican majority, but a bare one, with no clearly evident
leader. No one who has witnessed the carnage of Bob Livingston
being taken apart by former Louisiana governor and present indictee
Edwin Edwards in a debate can be surprised he already has rivals in
his bid for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich leaves a conservative movement in turmoil over what
direction to take next. And he leaves Bill Clinton in the White
House, where he should have left him all along.

NO SHORTAGE OF POSSIBLE CANDIDATES FOR SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also NY-MOYNIHAN-RETIRE)  
(lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Before word had leaked very far on Friday, before
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan had confirmed that yes, he would
retire at the end of his term in two years, the jostling for
position was under way by potential successors and their
surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1958 _ when Kenneth Keating was elected to replace
Irving Ives _ has there been a race for an open Senate seat in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said that on the Democratic side, the early
front-runner would be Andrew Cuomo, the U.S. secretary of housing
and urban development, and son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   For the Republicans, the heavyweights were said to be New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who lost his
seat to Rep. Charles Schumer in Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Carl McCall, a Democrat just three days
removed from winning re-election to a second term, came closest to
declaring his candidacy, and friends of Donna Shalala, U.S.
secretary of health and human services and the former president of
Hunter College, told friends she was looking at the prospect of
running for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's aides have been saying for several days that he might
run for the Senate. Then came word that Moynihan had specifically
mentioned McCall as a possible successor, noting that with the
defeat on Tuesday of Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, a Democrat from
Illinois, there would not be any blacks left in the Senate. McCall,
who was re-elected with 64 percent of the vote, is the only black
to be elected to statewide office in New York's history.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon McCall told reporters, ``I have to think
about what I might do, and at the top of my list at this point
would be to run for Pat Moynihan's seat.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall was widely mentioned as one of the stronger potential
Democratic contenders, along with Cuomo, Shalala and Robert F.
Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer and son of the late senator
and attorney general. Cuomo is married to Kennedy's sister, Kerry.
Kennedy, who aides said was traveling, did not respond to telephone
messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to say it's Cuomo by name, by stature, by
resources,'' said a Democratic political consultant, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Carl would be formidable. Bobby might be.
But I can't really see them beating Andrew Cuomo.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo knows what it takes to run a statewide campaign. He
managed his father's 1986 campaign for governor, which produced a
record landslide win. He has access to a national base of
contributors, and some powerful friends, like Vice President Al
Gore. His father has many Democratic friends, too, as well as a
mercurial, ambiguous interest in running himself for another
political office some day. The former governor did not return two
telephone calls to his office.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Andrew Cuomo, Karen Hinton, said that he would
not speak to reporters on Friday. She read a statement from him
that called Moynihan ``irreplaceable'' but did not address Cuomo's
own future.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato put out a similar statement, and his spokesman, Chris
Staszak, said that the senator, too, would not speak to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't spoken to him, but I would hazard a guess that
another race is the last thing on his mind right now,'' said Kieran
Mahoney, D'Amato's campaign consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is one of the state's best-known political figures, and
his base in New York City, normally a Democratic stronghold, would
make him hard to beat in a general election. The problem for him
would be the Republican primary, and the fact that he might be too
moderate to gain the Conservative Party nomination that is often
crucial to Republicans seeking statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who cannot run for a third term in 2001 because of
term limits, has not been shy about his desire for higher office,
but he has mostly encouraged speculation that he might run for
president or vice president in 2000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``This is too early to discuss whether somebody is interested or
not interested in that job,'' Giuliani told reporters Friday
evening. ``People are still absorbing two things in one week _ the
loss of Senator D'Amato, who was a very, very important part of why
New York was able to achieve what it has achieved over the last 18
years, and Senator Moynihan now saying he's going to step down.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican prospect is former Rep. Susan Molinari. And
several Republicans pointed to Thomas Gulotta, the Nassau County
executive, as a potent fund-raiser with support within the party.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green, the New York City public advocate, is another
obvious Democratic prospect. He ran for D'Amato's Senate seat this
year, finishing third in the Democratic primary, and he ran for it
in 1986, when he won the primary before losing to D'Amato. But he
is also said to be interested in running for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a time to speculate on anything,'' Green said Friday.
``I love elective public service, but I have come to no conclusions
about what I might do.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Rev. Al Sharpton has run for the Senate twice, in
1992 and 1994, losing both times in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Moynihan's decision had been made public Friday, an
aide to Assemblyman Michael Bragman was calling reporters to say,
``We're seriously looking at the race and pursuing some of the
organizational work.'' Bragman, who lives just outside Syracuse, is
the majority leader in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, an aide to Sheldon Silver, a New York City Democrat
who is the speaker of the Assembly, called around to let reporters
know, in case they were wondering, that he would not seek the post.

EDITORIAL: PEACE AND TERROR IN THE MIDEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Nov. 7:
</P>
<P>
   It is a depressingly safe prediction that terrorism will haunt
peacemaking between Israel and the Palestinians in the months
ahead. That was shown again Friday when two suicide bombers
detonated a car bomb in a crowded Jerusalem market. Fortunately,
the device went off prematurely and only the bombers were killed,
although more than 20 innocent people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide bombings are a sure way for extremist groups like Hamas
and Islamic Jihad to roil Israeli society and frustrate the desire
of most Israelis and Palestinians for peace. Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu must
learn to manage a terrorist threat they cannot yet eliminate. They
must start now or risk the unraveling of the peace agreement they
negotiated in Maryland barely two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The bombers struck as Israel's Cabinet was belatedly preparing
to ratify that agreement. The attack came despite two weeks of
intense Palestinian police pressure against Hamas and other violent
groups. Arafat must increase that pressure. Stopping every
terrorist may not be possible. But that should remain Arafat's
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu must also respond wisely to the latest terrorist
challenge, making sure it does not deflect or delay already overdue
steps toward peace. Israel can never afford to grow numb or
tolerant toward terror.
</P>
<P>
   But every violent incident should not become the occasion for
new political maneuvers or negotiating breakdowns with the
Palestinians. Israel's touchstone must be not whether terror
occurs, but how hard Palestinian authorities work to prevent and
punish it.

 &HT;    Gingrich supporters left with sadness, surprise
 &HT;    By Clint Williams and Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Supporters of U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich _ and
in Cobb County, Ga., it's hard to find anyone else _ expressed
surprise, and some sadness, upon hearing news that the suburban
Atlanta Republican would step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been reasonably pleased with what he has done as
speaker,'' said 40-year-old Bill Ellington, picking up a pizza at a
west Cobb Papa John's.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Montgomery, who voted for Gingrich on Tuesday, said she was
very surprised because ``he is such a power-monger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich came under fire from Republicans after Democrats picked
up five House seats in Tuesday's election. But Ellington and
Montgomery said they don't blame Gingrich for the poor GOP showing.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Essigmann of Marietta said Gingrich was a scapegoat for
other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure they have to have somebody to pick on and he is
always outspoken and a target,'' said Essigmann while shopping at a
west Cobb Target store.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans who said they voted for Gingrich thought
he was right to give up the speaker's post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some new leadership,'' said Bill Hawkins of Kennesaw.
``He took the glory in 1994, and he's got to pay the price now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked him but his leadership obviously wasn't there,'' said
Bob Harrris.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is immensely popular in his district, which spans
Atlanta's northern suburbs from Cobb and South Cherokee to
Gwinnett, having received 71 percent of the vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll in September showed the
former college history professor with a 48 percent approval among
voters in Georgia, where Democrats remain the dominant party.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Friday night whether Gingrich intended to
resign his congressional seat as well as the speaker's post.
</P>
<P>
   Many constituents interviewed said they would be disappointed if
Gingrich resigned from the congressional seat he has held for 20
years, even surviving a jerrymandering in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does that its sour grapes _ he's going to take his ball
and go home,'' said Hawkins. ``If he leaves now, I would never vote
for him again
</P>
<P>
   Said Essigmann: ``We wasted our vote if that is what he is going
to do,'' said Essigmann.
</P>
<P>
   If Gingrich were to leave the Congress, it would be bad for
Cobb, said state Sen. Chuck Clay, a Marietta Republican who
finished third in the party primary for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's awful for us to lose that clout we've had in
Congress for the last two terms,'' said Clay.

 &HT;    Will astronauts land on mars for nasa's 50th anniversary?
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``The Earth is the cradle of the mind -
but one cannot eternally live in a cradle.'' - Konstantin
Eduardovitch Tsiolkovsky, 1857-1935, considered the father of
astronautics
</P>
<P>
   Like John Glenn, NASA is playing time travel.
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old former astronaut's return to space links the
national space agency with its whiz-bang past in the same month it
celebrates its 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   But while NASA's first two decades were a whirlwind of giant
leaps - it went from its first manned flight to stepping on the
moon in just eight years - the second half of the agency's life has
mostly been a routine of workmanlike space shuttle missions.
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change.
</P>
<P>
   NASA is working with several other countries to assemble a space
station. It's talking about sending people to Mars. And it's
mulling rocket designs that use nuclear fission, plasma, even
anti-matter. One shoots cargo out of a giant gas gun. Another
magnetically levitates astronauts over a miles-long track, then
whips them into the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   It was 5,500 years from the dawn of history to Christopher
Columbus, four more centuries to Kitty Hawk, and less than a half
century to NASA. Then, in 40 years, the agency did what our ancient
forebears could only imagine as they threw rocks to scare away the
stars. Men or their machines went to the moon, to the points of
light at our solar system's outer reaches, and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Well, mostly machines. The graduating class of 1998 wasn't born
the last time humans left Earth's orbit for open space. In the
space race's heady days, dreamers dreamed of stations on the moon
and Mars and piloted missions to the outer planets by the turn of
the millennium. It hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   The NASA of the 1960s was staggering from the embarrassment of
having been beaten to space by the Evil Empire, which might just
use that technology to vaporize American cities before John F.
Kennedy could get to his secret bomb shelter on Peanut Island. Then
it was immersed in a frantic, spare-no-expense sprint to beat said
Russians to the moon for America's pride, can-do reputation and
pioneer image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dared to dream,'' NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said
Oct. 1 on NASA's anniversary. ``We imagined what could be possible.
And then along with our partners in industry and academia, we went
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s and 1980s, NASA had settled into the SpaceLab and
Space Shuttle programs. Then the Challenger disaster put piloted
space flight on hold for more than two years and raised questions
about whether familiarity had bred complacency and carelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Now NASA plans to replace the space shuttle in the next few
years with a new breed of spaceship that specializes in utility and
efficiency: reusable vehicles that operate at a fraction of the
cost, can take off from a number of sites and in the kind of
weather that would scrub a shuttle launch, and boast a turnaround
time of days rather than weeks. NASA will be going from Porsche to
Honda Civic.
</P>
<P>
   NASA wants to lower the cost per launch from $10,000 per pound
of cargo on the space shuttle or $5,000 on a pilotless rocket down
to $1,000 in the next decade and $100 in the decade after that. And
the agency envisions a new partnership with private companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our role is to develop the high-risk technologies that
industry cannot afford,'' Goldin has said. ``But we won't build the
vehicle. Industry will. NASA will be a user, not an operator.''
</P>
<P>
   The new, cheaper rockets will expand the space business:
communications and science satellites; servicing the International
Space Station; special laboratories taking advantage of near-zero
gravity; even private leisure flights into space. And maybe a trip
to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   But which NASA will lead the charge?
</P>
<P>
   There are two NASAs, complains Robert Park, a physics professor
at the University of Maryland and director of public information
for the American Physical Society, an international organization of
more than 40,000 physicists.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them has advanced human knowledge and given us enormous
returns for our investment in the dazzling array of space uses we
have now,'' Park says. He complains the other NASA bowed to
pressure to send Americans aboard the rickety Russian Mir station,
poured billions of dollars into the international space station
with its partners, and operated a space shuttle program he calls
``a complete waste. There is no field science that has been
measurably advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   The breathtaking triumph of the Mars Pathfinder was a two-edged
sword. It showed what NASA could do working cheap - the $266
million mission cost less than a single B-1 bomber - and without
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``America could have a better space program for less money if
NASA would cancel the . . . space station and build more
Pathfinder-type missions that are cheaper, use telecommunications
technology, and yield more science than the space station ever
will,'' said Ralph DeGennaro, executive director for Taxpayers for
Common Sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our robots get better every day; human beings haven't changed
in 35,000,'' says the American Physical Society's Park, who says
NASA can do the same thing with robots at a tenth of the cost of
people and should simply quit sending people at all.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants NASA to scale back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mars,'' John Pike says succinctly.
</P>
<P>
   With people?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   Pike, space policy analyst for the Federation of American
Scientists, believes the technology spinoff from the space program
is ``grotesquely overplayed'' and that space flight has ``turned
out to be a lot more difficult than we thought it was.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says extending ``human presence in the solar system''
should be the top goal of NASA, and it should seek help from
Earth's two emerging superpowers, China and India, to cooperate in
space instead of competing with missiles.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's challenge is to balance politics, science, finances and
ideals to shape its future course. It says it is doing just that.
Some aren't sure it has been doing it very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA excels when our nation has a clear, binding, national
space policy,'' Keith Cowing, a former NASA scientist and head of
the Internet newsletter NASA Watch, told a House Subcommittee on
Space and Aeronautics on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not certain just what America's guiding vision for the
exploration of space should be,'' Cowing said. ``All I know is that
we are in desperate need of one.''

 &HT;    Gingrich supporters left with sadness, surprise
 &HT;    By Clint Williams and Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Supporters of U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich _ and
in Cobb County, Ga., it's hard to find anyone else _ expressed
surprise, and some sadness, upon hearing news that the suburban
Atlanta Republican would step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been reasonably pleased with what he has done as
speaker,'' said 40-year-old Bill Ellington, picking up a pizza at a
west Cobb Papa John's.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Montgomery, who voted for Gingrich on Tuesday, said she was
very surprised because ``he is such a power-monger.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich came under fire from Republicans after Democrats picked
up five House seats in Tuesday's election. But Ellington and
Montgomery said they don't blame Gingrich for the poor GOP showing.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Essigmann of Marietta said Gingrich was a scapegoat for
other Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure they have to have somebody to pick on and he is
always outspoken and a target,'' said Essigmann while shopping at a
west Cobb Target store.
</P>
<P>
   But several Republicans who said they voted for Gingrich thought
he was right to give up the speaker's post.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some new leadership,'' said Bill Hawkins of Kennesaw.
``He took the glory in 1994, and he's got to pay the price now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked him but his leadership obviously wasn't there,'' said
Bob Harrris.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is immensely popular in his district, which spans
Atlanta's northern suburbs from Cobb and South Cherokee to
Gwinnett, having received 71 percent of the vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll in September showed the
former college history professor with a 48 percent approval among
voters in Georgia, where Democrats remain the dominant party.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear Friday night whether Gingrich intended to
resign his congressional seat as well as the speaker's post.
</P>
<P>
   Many constituents interviewed said they would be disappointed if
Gingrich resigned from the congressional seat he has held for 20
years, even surviving a jerrymandering in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does that its sour grapes _ he's going to take his ball
and go home,'' said Hawkins. ``If he leaves now, I would never vote
for him again
</P>
<P>
   Said Essigmann: ``We wasted our vote if that is what he is going
to do,'' said Essigmann.
</P>
<P>
   If Gingrich were to leave the Congress, it would be bad for
Cobb, said state Sen. Chuck Clay, a Marietta Republican who
finished third in the party primary for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's awful for us to lose that clout we've had in
Congress for the last two terms,'' said Clay.

CHASE REVIEWS NAZI-ERA ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chase Manhattan Corp. said Friday that it was
investigating allegations that it froze accounts of Jewish
customers in Paris during the Nazi occupation of France before
formal orders to freeze the accounts were issued.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, one of the largest American banks, said it was also
examining whether its Paris office was ``overly cooperative in
providing banking services to Germany during the Occupation'' and
whether assets seized by the Nazis and Vichy government were ever
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said the allegations about its possible involvement in
freezing accounts of its Jewish customers were first made in a
recent program aired by the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the actions described by the BBC actually occurred, that
would be completely antithetical to the values we hold dear,'' said
Walter Shipley, Chase's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, the creation of several mergers over the years, said the
allegations involved a Paris subsidiary of one of Chase's many
predecessor banks, Chase Bank. Chase said that based upon
preliminary investigations, it believed that fewer than 100
accounts were involved, but it said it was ``taking the matter very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said it would consult with members of Jewish organizations
and other experts to identify former customers of the Paris office
of the Chase Bank or their heirs. If Chase discovers that the money
was not returned after the war, it will pay its customers or their
heirs with interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is conducting a survey of American
banks regarding their management of Jewish accounts here and abroad
during World War II.

A RACE TRUE TO ITS NAME: IT'S A CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ In the backstretch barns across the infield
from the twin spires of Churchill Downs, the world's greatest race
horses were stabled Friday on the eve of their all-star showdown in
the $5.1 million Breeders' Cup Classic, the richest thoroughbred
race ever, the best since the cup series was started 14 years ago
and one of the best in the long history of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic will be run Saturday before a throng of perhaps
70,000 spectators in the home of the Kentucky Derby, will be the
seventh and ultimate event of a day with purses totaling $13.2
million and will be the final appearance in the distinguished
careers of at least two of the favorites _ Skip Away, the leading
candidate for Horse of the Year, and Gentlemen, whose owner is
risking $800,000 just to enter him in a race that he is not
considered very likely to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This field is so good,'' said Sonny Hine, who trains Skip
Away, ``that if anybody stumbles, he gets beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The field for the Classic is, in a word, classic. It includes
last year's Kentucky Derby winner (Silver Charm), the winners of
the last two Belmont Stakes (Touch Gold and Victory Gallop), the
best horse in Europe (Ireland's Swain), the winner of the Travers
Stakes (Coronado's Quest), the winner of the Hollywood Gold Cup and
many other stakes (Gentlemen), and the winner of last year's
Classic and the leading contender for Horse of the Year (Skip
Away).
</P>
<P>
   In a sport fighting for survival in a time of changing social
values and tastes, the Breeders' Cup presents racing with its
finest hours, and the Classic remains its main event. And this
year's races should be run with no complications from the weather,
which is expected to be partly cloudy with temperatures in the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get beat, you get beat,'' said Bob Baffert, who trained
the winners of the Kentucky Derby in the last two years. ``And
Silver Charm not only won the Derby last year, but he traveled
halfway round the world and won the Dubai World Cup this year. If
he could win the Breeders' Cup Classic, it would be the ending to a
true fairy tale.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Classic includes speed horses and stalkers and
closers, all of world-class caliber. And for once, its chief
contenders have escaped the injuries and illnesses that usually
decimate fields at the end of the year and that have already
removed several stars from the other Breeders' Cup races in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Classic is going to be as good a race as there ever was,''
said Shug McGaughey, who trains the 3-year-old Coronado's Quest.
``We're hoping that Skip Away and Gentlemen get into a speed duel,
and then we'll try to make one run at them. This is going to be one
great race, and Coronado's Quest is worthy of being in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how great a race is this year's Classic? Longtime racing
analysts seem to agree that it is the best of the Breeders' Cup
series, which was begun in 1984, and one of the best anywhere, any
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about it,'' said Joe Hirsch, executive
columnist for The Daily Racing Form and a student of great race
horses for 50 years. ``There have been other memorable races in
other years, but none can match the depth of quality for this
year's Classic. More important, every horse is coming up to the
race in top form. And at the end of the season, you might expect
them to be going the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many trainers are now building their entire seasons around the
Breeders' Cup instead of making it an afterthought,'' Hirsch added.
``So, every race they run during the year is accountable to the
Breeders' Cup. Every race they run becomes a kind of countdown to
the Breeders' Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch listed some other melodramatic races of the past with
deep fields, notably the 1917 Brooklyn Handicap with three winners
of the Kentucky Derby and three handicap champions. It was won by a
9-year-old horse named Borrow, who beat out his favored stablemate,
Regret, the filly who had won the Kentucky Derby two years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch and many other people in racing have long rated the 1957
Kentucky Derby as the best. Calumet Farm lost its star, Gen. Duke,
but ran Iron Liege against Gallant Man, Round Table and Bold Ruler,
who finished in that order. Later that year, in the Trenton
Handicap, in another historic run, Bold Ruler outran Gallant Man
and Round Table. And in the 1967 Woodward at Belmont Park, in
another meeting of champions, Damascus defeated Dr. Fager and
Buckpasser.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Beyer of The Washington Post, whose name has become
identified with the speed ratings of horses in races, remembered
the 1979 Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park for star quality with
Seattle Slew, Affirmed and Exceller. In this year's Classic, he
said, the depth of quality extends down to Coronado's Quest, who
won the Travers Stakes but still isn't regarded as a top contender
in the Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I can remember a race,'' Beyer said, ``where the
Travers winner was rated the ninth-best horse.''

ARREST OF SUSPECT IN 12-PACK SLAYING LITTLE COMFORT FOR VICTIM'S
HUSBAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- For three years, shopkeeper Kamlesh Prajapati has
anguished over the loss of his wife and the mystery of the men who
killed her over a 12-pack of beer.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, authorities announced a suspect has been charged with
the murder, and detectives said they are on the trail of his
suspected accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   For Prajapati, the news was frustratingly bittersweet, and does
nothing to ease the loss of his wife, their daughter's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I am happy or sad,'' he said during a news
conference announcing the hunt for the second suspect. ``On one
side I'm glad; on one side I'm sad. Why do people have to kill? Why
do they hurt people?''
</P>
<P>
   The Prajapati family was concerned over the Los Angeles Police
Department's commitment to the case at one point but no longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They worked hard. They got one suspect, and the other one is
very near,'' said Brem Prajapati, brother of Kamlesh Prajapati.
``Everybody worked, and finally we are at justice. So we're very
glad.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said they have solved the slaying of Jyotsna
Prajapati because, with the decline in homicides citywide, they
have had more time to focus on older, stalled investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of what detectives are able to do when we
have the time to look at these cases,'' said Capt. Kyle Jackson,
commander of the Van Nuys Operations-Support Division, which
includes detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the Prajapatis is one of toil and determination,
now crossed by tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Jyotsna Prajapati and her husband, from India, had struggled
since 1993 to earn a living from the Top Produce Market, a small
neighborhood market in suburban Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   She was shot in the head in July 1995 after she tried to stop
two gang members from walking out with a 12-pack of beer. Her
husband was running errands at the time, and their daughter,
Atithi, then 2 years old, was sleeping beneath the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Police detectives said they identified Aaron Reynoso as the
suspected gunman a year ago but didn't seek charges until recently
because they lacked enough evidence. Their case gained strength as
more witnesses came forward, aided by a standing $25,000 reward
offered by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office
charged the 19-year-old with murder, robbery, burglary and a
special allegation that he used a handgun to kill Prajapati.
Reynoso, 16 at the time of the killing, has been in custody on an
unrelated weapons offense, Detective Dave Escoto said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also said Fernando Carbajal, 19, is wanted for
questioning as a suspect. Escoto said Carbajal, also 16 at the time
of the slaying, is a member of a separate gang and went inside the
market with Reynoso.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're running partners,'' Escoto said. ``Our information is
they went to do a beer run, to walk in a store, grab beer and run
out without paying. In this case, the victim attempted to stop
them, and Reynoso shot her.''
</P>
<P>
   Carbajal has been linked to the crime for several weeks and is
believed to still be in the Van Nuys area, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Escoto said police want Reynoso tried as an adult even though he
was a juvenile at the time of the murder. He said police would do
the same for Carbajal if he is arrested and charged.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials and Councilman Joel Wachs, who pushed for the
council-issued reward, said Friday that gaining charges against
Reynoso was gratifying and that they are confident of arresting
Carbajal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost feels like a victory party, although it's one we
wish we never had,'' Wachs said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been seven homicides in the Van Nuys Division through
October, compared with 15 during the same period a year ago.
Homicides across the entire Valley Bureau are down to 60 from 71,
and homicides across the city are down to 349 from 493 for the same
period, according to police.

UCLA VOWS TO REGAIN OLD DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. _ The southwest stands of Oregon State's Parker
Stadium tower over the surrounding landscape like a sequoia among
maples. On a clear day, from the upper rows, you can see nearby
Mary's Peak and the soothing green Coast Range mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be clear today, and it will not be warm.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA visits Oregon State this afternoon for the first time since
the 1993 Bruins escaped with their Rose Bowl lives, 20-17. Parker
Stadium is as dreary now as it was then.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 28,000 is expected. It won't be cold so much as
chilly; winter has not yet taken hold. The wind may whip through
the stadium's open corners and over the low-lying northeast stands.
Most likely, it will rain _ and rain. The clouds will be thick as
clam chowder, only grayer, as the Beavers desperately try to keep
their bowl hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to prepare the team mentally for that kind of an
atmosphere,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   It's an odd place for a fresh start, but that's what the Bruins
(7-0, 5-0) are after, isn't it? A few weeks ago, amid the injuries,
the rugged October games and the ascension to No. 1 in the Bowl
Championship Series rankings, they lost their spirit. They became
lethargic, even burdened, for the first time since Toledo took
command in Jan. 1996. A grueling month and lofty ranking had sapped
them dry.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they've dropped to No. 3 in the BCS poll, now that
they're healthier and playing with purpose _ they must impress the
voters and the computers that comprise half of the BCS formula _
will their energy return?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's start something new,'' said quarterback Cade McNown, who
lives in the Portland suburb of West Linn. ``Let's show what kind
of team we are and play a better brand of football. . . .
Sometimes, this team has been more concerned with not losing than
with winning.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown sensed the suffocation earlier than anyone else. Monday
afternoon, he did something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Moments before practice, as players dressed and chatted, McNown
gathered the seniors in a corner of the locker room. His message:
This is the chance of a lifetime _ enjoy it, but don't waste it. It
was up to the seniors, not the coaches, he said, to realign
underclassmen who believed the hype and feared the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   McNown was unusually vocal throughout the week. He screamed,
``Let's go, offense'' during routine drills against the scout team.
He yelled, ``Come on, now,'' when enthusiasm waned and chastised
himself for errant throws. He laughed, too.
</P>
<P>
   He was not alone. Center Shawn Stuart and linebacker Brendon
Ayanbadejo were equally vocal and intense. Workouts were crisper,
more physical, than during Stanford week. Attention to detail was
priority one. It looked, and felt, like USC week at Spaulding
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seniors have taken a leadership role,'' Toledo said.
``They've encouraged guys to pick it up. There's a sense of
urgency. We know we can't slip up.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Oregon State (4-5, 1-5), which must defeat UCLA and
Oregon to become bowl eligible. Under second-year coach Mike Riley,
the Beavers actually believe _ at least, they did. How they respond
to back-to-back one-point losses, to Washington and Cal, will
determine today's events.
</P>
<P>
   If OSU plays as it did against USC and Washington, then UCLA's
challenge is considerable. If the Beavers have lost hope, well,
UCLA could secure victory by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was pretty down,'' Riley said of the post-Cal mood.
``We've done a lot to get to the brink, but we're not over the hump
and those things can wear on you.''
</P>
<P>
   Just ask McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have won games the last couple weeks and came up a
little short,'' he said. ``I know that feeling, and we've run off
17 (wins) in a row'' since close losses to Washington State and
Tennessee last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll take it to us,'' McNown continued. ``But we control
how we react. We can fend them off, or we can take it to them. We
need to go up there with 60 guys and say, `This is our second
season. It starts right now.' ''

BOB TROW, 72, OF `MISTER ROGERS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ill.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Trow, an actor who helped usher two generations of children
through their formative years as a member of the cast of ``Mister
Rogers' Neighborhood,'' died on Monday at his home in New
Alexandria, Pa. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said David Newell, who plays
McFeely on ``Mister Rogers.''
</P>
<P>
   Trow portrayed Robert Troll, Bob Dog and sometimes simply
himself for some 30 years on the program, which is produced at the
Pittsburgh public television station WQED. He had taped appearances
for the program just last week that were to be broadcast in
February as part of a lesson on ``noisy and quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they were creations of a mind fluent in the language of
make-believe, ``the characters he did represented child development
theories,'' said Newell. He gave the example of Robert Troll, a
sort of precursor to the Teletubbies, contemporary public
television characters that are dressed like outer-space toddlers
and designed to appeal to preverbal children. Troll was a character
whose nonsensical language elicited responses in babies just
learning to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was one of the most uniquely whimsical people I've ever
worked with, and such an important part of the spirit of the
neighborhood,'' said Fred Rogers, host of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Trow was ``a classic clown,'' he said. ``The clown has so many
facets to him, and there's always a very tender spot in the true
clown.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the PBS show, Trow got his start in broadcasting
on morning radio shows in Pittsburgh. First on WWSW and then KDKA,
he played comic characters whose role was to harass the host. Among
his most popular were Carmen Monoxide, an incorrigible punster and
a character thought to be very close to its creator's personality,
and Omicron, a bureaucrat from Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Trow also wrote and produced television and radio commercials,
and painted oil portraits of visitors to his home.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Lois; two sons, Eric, of Plum, Pa.,
and Rob, of Chicago, and two grandchildren.

HYDE'S LETTER: BAD TIMING OR GAMBLE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs 17th graf to add comment from Hyde aides; tightening and
polishing throughout.)  
 &HT;    (bl) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ What is Rep. Henry Hyde up to?
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the Illinois Republican who heads the House
Judiciary Committee moved Thursday to wrap up the impeachment
inquiry quickly by naming only one witness, Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hyde fired off a pointed letter asking
President Clinton to say flatly whether he lied under oath,
tampered with witnesses or obstructed justice. If Clinton objects
to any of the 81 findings drawn from Starr's 445-page report, as
surely he will, the investigation could drag into next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's letter was clearly a maneuver to shift the onus to the
president and set him up as uncooperative, said a Republican aide.
``It was for political gain,'' the aide said. ``It's a gamble, a
calculated risk. It makes it look like the White House is
obstructing.''
</P>
<P>
   The combative missive might have made political sense for Hyde
before the midterm elections, when House Republicans expected to
pad their majority in the next Congress by at least 10 to 15 seats.
But after Tuesday's stunning gains for Democrats, and the prospect
of a slimmer Republican majority voting on impeachment next year,
the tactic seemed confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   The disjointed approach stemmed in part from bad timing. Hyde
had intended for weeks to seek confirmation of selected facts in
the Starr report from Clinton to spare the committee the
time-consuming process of deposing witnesses and holding hearings.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the White House is content to watch the apparent
confusion at the committee quietly from the sidelines. Gregory
Craig, the White House's coordinator of impeachment strategy, said
the president's lawyers would respond quickly to the requests for
information.
</P>
<P>
   But Craig and other top White House officials had little else to
say about the matter this week. They have settled on a strategy of
portraying the president as hard at work on substantive issues like
Social Security and health care while professing equanimity about
the impeachment process on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to say about it,'' Clinton said Thursday. ``I
want these hearings to be constitutionally fair and expeditious.
And at the appropriate time , we will say whatever we intend to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, however, some White House officials are now
expressing confidence that the president will emerge from the
impeachment proceedings with a largely symbolic vote of censure _
at the most.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, Hyde's inquiry, led by former Chicago
prosecutor David Schippers, has tried to make the best legal case
it can against Clinton. Investigators have insulated themselves
from the political maelstrom swirling around them.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment is not playing in a courtroom. It is playing in
Congress, where the lawmakers who will ultimately decide Clinton's
fate are sensitive to the shifting political ground in a way that
Hyde's prosecutors are not.
</P>
<P>
   And the conventional wisdom among Democrats and a growing number
of Republicans, who now believe the polls they dismissed before the
elections, is that impeachment is a political loser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outcome is all but certain: this thing ain't going
anywhere,'' said Rep. Mark Sanford, a conservative Republican from
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   So Hyde is in a box. He wants to end the inquiry as soon as
possible. ``If it goes down, it goes down,'' said one of Hyde's
closest aides. ``Henry has no vested interest in any particular
outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde feels deeply bound to follow the constitutional process
to its end, to insure the proceedings have some shred of public
credibility and to satisfy the Republican Party's conservative
base.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has also dismissed the idea of short-circuiting the process
and censuring Clinton, and aides say he intends to bring articles
of impeachment to a vote in the committee and the full House.. But
a group of 10 moderate Democrats and Republicans on the committee
will meet as early as Sunday to discuss alternative punishments.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Starr to testify Nov. 19 is a gamble for both parties. A
Republican aide familiar with the proceedings said the reason for
summoning Starr as a witness, despite the Republican's reluctance
two weeks ago, was twofold. Some members believe that Starr will
help their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hyde feels Starr is a very credible person and much
maligned,'' said another Republican aide. ``He thinks when the
American people see he doesn't have horns and a tail, he'll be
credible. But it's no slam dunk for either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's popularity rating is so low it can only go up, and that
should take some of the heat off Republicans on the committee.
Besides, many Republicans thought there was no way around calling
Starr since he was the one person many Democrats seemed intent on
calling.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are torn over whether to call for additional
witnesses. Rep. Martin Meehan of Massachusetts said it would be
unthinkable to make a judgment without calling major witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But other Democrats, who believe impeachment is dead, are
advising against it. Why aggravate the process? they ask. ``If this
is what gets us to closure, then why intrude?'' a Democratic aide
familiar with the proceedings said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California said she saw business as usual.
Ms. Lofgren is one Democrat who believed that calling Starr was a
waste of time since he has not been a witness to anything. And if
Republicans wind up dragging the whole thing into next year,
arguing that the president was not cooperative, they will be
shooting themselves in the foot again, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elections have not changed the majority's approach at
all,'' Ms. Lofgren said. ``The president said it should be fair,
constitutional and expeditious. Well, all I see is expeditious. I
don't see fair and constitutional. There are a lot of things that
are quick. A lynching is quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Many democrats are convinced that Hyde is trying to find a
graceful exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to figure out how to fold their tent as
quickly as they can without looking like they are folding tent,'' a
Democratic official said.

RUBY THE ELEPHANT DIES AFTER RISKY PROCEDURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 and JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ His socks and athletic shoes stained with blood,
consulting veterinarian Joe Fourner had the sad task Friday of
explaining why a medical team had to put Ruby the elephant to
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad luck,'' the Chicago large-animal vet said soberly, flanked
by Phoenix Zoo officials and Dr. Kathy Orr, the zoo's chief
veterinarian.
</P>
<P>
   In lay terms, the beloved pachyderm who has delighted the Valley
for almost 25 years with her personality and flair for painting,
suffered a ruptured uterus sometime in the past week or two,
sending her full-term male calf tumbling into its mother's
abdominal cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Lodged in the abdomen, the 320-pound calf began to decompose.
Infection set in.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are unsure what caused the event or exactly when the
calf died. Results of lab tests and a necropsy will be available in
about a week.
</P>
<P>
   After attempting a Caesarean section to remove the dead calf
Friday morning, the surgical team decided that Ruby's uterus could
not be repaired and that she was dying of infection.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:50 p.m., Phoenix Zoo executive director Jeff Williamson
gave the go-ahead to euthanize the 9,000-pound animal. Ruby never
woke up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no potential for Ruby to survive,'' Williamson said
at a news conference Friday afternoon. He and surgeons determined
that ``it would not be possible (for Ruby) to recover from the
uterine trauma.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruby's uterus had split in three directions, said Fourner, the
world's leading expert on elephant C-sections who was brought in to
lead the team. Some undetected underlying disease could have caused
the uterine wall to weaken and burst.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo medical staff had no clues that Ruby, 22 months pregnant,
was in trouble. She exhibited few signs of pain. Exotic animals,
Fourner explained, are genetically designed to mask symptoms of
illness that might make them vulnerable to predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked remarkably good considering how sick she was,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But minutes into the surgery, which began about 11:45 a.m.
Friday, Fourner saw and smelled the massive infection, the odor of
which clung to his surgical garb. He despaired of saving the
elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The condition of the uterus destroyed our chances,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following word of Ruby's death, zoo employes, including Ruby's
longtime handlers, were mourning privately and set to undergo grief
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The zoo staff is very saddened by the loss of this animal,''
Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Valley residents took the news of Ruby's death with heavy
hearts.
</P>
<P>
   At Phoenix's Ralph Waldo Emerson Elementary School, students
were enjoying a fall school dance when the student council
announced Ruby's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids all stood really silently. They understood what was
being said,'' said teacher Garthanne De Ocampo. ``For about 100
fifth- and sixth-graders to stand quiet after an hour and a half of
dancing is kind of amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that after a moment of silence, ``One of the kids said,
`And the last song should be dedicated to Ruby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo visitors, some of whom had kept vigil at the elephant
compound early in the morning, also were heartsick.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo volunteer Barbara Walker couldn't believe the news. During
her four years at the zoo, she said, Ruby always had been special
to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now she's gone,'' said Walker, dabbing tears away from the
corners of her eyes with a tissue. ``It's a sad day.''
</P>
<P>
   As the bad news spread across the zoo grounds, others lamented
the loss. Children turned to their parents for answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did the baby die?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How come they couldn't save Ruby?''
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Marissa Earl stared into the elephant pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel really sad, Mommy,'' she confessed. ``Do elephants go
to heaven?''
</P>
<P>
   Visitor Margaret Benzer got to know Ruby during a 17-week high
school internship at the zoo in 1984. Tears streaming down her
face, Benzer added a candle to the table in front of the elephant
pit already overflowing with flowers and get-well cards.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled with a smile a favorite memory of Ruby.
</P>
<P>
   Benzer had wheelbarrow duty one day, shoveling elephant dung in
the hot summer heat. When Benzer finally had finished, Ruby
sauntered over, looked her straight in the eye, and tipped the load
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a real attitude,'' Benzer said laughing. ``She was a
snot.''
</P>
<P>
   In the week before Ruby's operation, zoo medical personnel
apparently had done everything right in preparing her for the risky
surgery. Fourner, who had performed four previous elephant
C-sections, was optimistic that his latest patient had a good
chance to recover.
</P>
<P>
   No Asian elephant previously had survived such an operation. But
the others had been in distress, the surgery done on an emergency
basis. In all cases, infection had been a major factor.
</P>
<P>
   After doctors discovered last weekend that Ruby's water had
broken but that her calf was not moving, they tried unsuccessfully
to induce labor. Ruby was immediately put on antibiotics and forced
to fast. Both measures were designed to give her the best chance
for beating the grim odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the best candidate for a C-section,'' Fourner said.
``She would have had a very good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This would be the first of his gargantuan maternity patients, he
believed, to make it.
</P>
<P>
   But discovery of the rupture came as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to go through this without a successful outcome,''
Fourner said, adding that ``this is the only way we can learn _
through attempts and sometimes failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike human mothers, elephants cannot be examined by X-rays or
ultrasound. Their rugged skin and 6-inch layer of fat are too thick
to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
   No fetal monitor can service an animal so large.
</P>
<P>
   Such technology might have indicated that Ruby's condition was
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson said that Ruby's death was not due to human error,
and that everything possible was done to save her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No stone was left unturned,'' he said. ``If effort could have
saved her, we would have saved her.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fourner and Orr said they gained valuable knowledge from
Ruby's demise. Her pre-operative care was impeccable and sets a
model for future treatment of other elephants.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson does not regret the zoo's decision to breed the
25-year-old Ruby, saying that captive breeding is a vital part of
efforts to conserve the Asian elephant, an animal disappearing in
the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix Zoo will continue to pursue Asian elephant
conservation in cooperation with the Species Survival Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're committed to the conservation of the Asian elephant,''
Williamson said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there will be a successor to Ruby is still unclear.
Indu, an elephant ``nanny'' brought in on loan to assist Ruby in
her first attempt at motherhood, might remain in Phoenix. In
consultation with the SSP, another Asian elephant could be
obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions will be made once the heartache over Ruby's
death has eased. A memorial service is planned, but the time has
not been decided.
</P>
<P>
   The Tulsa Zoo, where Ruby was impregnated two years ago by a
male named Sneezy, was notified of her death.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa zoo keepers had been faxing and phoning Phoenix officials
daily about Ruby's condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elephants are easy to get attached to,'' Tulsa Zoo director
Larry Nunley said. ``She was a good elephant. She got along well
with her male, obviously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our keepers spent a lot of time with her,'' he said. ``There's
been a lot of people walking around with their chins hanging down
the last few days.''
</P>
<P>
   After necropsies on the elephants have been completed, mother
and child will be buried somewhere on zoo land. Williamson said the
locations will not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Ruby had distinguished herself as an animal who
could not only charm zoo visitors with her size and dignity but
with with her artistic talents as well. After handler Tawny Carlson
noticed her making designs in the dirt floor of the compound, Ruby
was given a paint brush and paints.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of lithographs made from her abstract art helped fund the
zoo's operation.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson said he did not know whether more lithographs of her
work will be made.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, zoo staff had been hopeful that the artistic
elephant would be saved.
</P>
<P>
   Park Ranger Deniece Linton guarded the entry to the elephant
night house, where the surgeons operated on Ruby, and prayed for
the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping that she'll make history,'' Linton said. ``We
want her to be the first one to pull through this and be our girl
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those hopes were dashed by 3:45, when employees streamed out of
the zoo's Stonehouse Pavilion where officials had gathered them to
relay the bad news.
</P>
<P>
   Three women wrapped their arms around one another and sobbed for
the death of their girl. &QL;

QUARTILE RANKINGS ARE FUTILE

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A wiseguy once said if boxing promoters wanted
fair fight results, they'd dump the licensed judges and replace
them with a 6-year-old. While the judges confuse themselves with
their point deductions and their punch-counting computers, a
6-year-old would know instinctively who beat up whom.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing never took the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   Football should.
</P>
<P>
   If it wanted to put some common sense to the selection of teams
to play in the first official Division I-A national-title game Jan.
4 in Tempe, Ariz., it would trash the Bowl Championship Series
ranking formula and replace it with a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at least the process might be understandable to
slow-witted adults like me.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there's something overcomplicated about a formula in
which a school goes from No. 1 two weeks ago to No. 3 this week
without losing a game in between, which is what happened to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there's something overcomplicated about a formula that
counts the strength of a school's schedule more heavily than its
won-lost record, and counts a school's victory margins more heavily
than its victories.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, there's something overcomplicated about a formula that
requires coaches, players and fans to wait until Monday to find out
if they did well on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Let's be fair to the creators of the BCS. They were given a
thankless task _ identify the top two teams in a sport where
schools play only 11 regular-season games and the schedules vary
wildly in strength.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is noble: Settle the fight for No. 1 on the field,
instead of in writers' and coaches' polls that sometimes disagree.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time the regular season ends next month, a child
should be able to identify the top two teams in the country, the
ones that should meet in the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   And if the difference between the top two and the next one isn't
clear-cut, then this mathematical junk heap, with its pigskin hash
of polls, computer ratings and ``quartile ranks,'' isn't going to
settle the arguments anyway. If the public can't grasp the process,
it isn't going to believe the results.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the debut of the BCS rankings, made public for
the first time two weeks ago, has changed the way we watch college
football, and not for the better.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of feeling happy, or at least relieved, after UCLA's
fourth-quarter comeback last Saturday, Bruins fans left the Rose
Bowl miserable because they knew a four-point win over lowly
Stanford was going to kill them in the BCS.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of feeling happy, or at least stoic in disappointment,
after Stanford's plucky effort, Cardinal fans left the Rose Bowl
under a hail of ridicule as the experts noted how badly they
!ital!should!off! have lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Margin of victory'' should be left to gamblers. Winning and
losing are what sports should be about.
</P>
<P>
   Our inner 6-year-old says there's a better way. Actually, it's
so simple, it's got no chance of being enacted.
</P>
<P>
   First, consider only the undefeated teams. If there are exactly
two undefeated schools, they go straight to the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, use a short series of tiebreakers if there are more than
two unbeatens or if you have to dip into the pool of once-beatens.
</P>
<P>
   First tiebreaker: Take the school with the most victories over
teams that were ranked in the Associated Press top 10 when they
played.
</P>
<P>
   Second tiebreaker (if needed): Take the school with the most
victories over top-25 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Third tiebreaker (if needed): Take the school whose victims had
the best combined won-lost record.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, then flip a coin.
</P>
<P>
   See, not a ``computer average'' or ``quartile rank'' in the
equation. In fact, not an equation.
</P>
<P>
   Too simple? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   A school that wants to be known as the greatest in the land
should be able to go undefeated. Anyway, that's what it'll be like
if football ever adopts a playoff system _ win or go home.
</P>
<P>
   A school that goes undefeated against relatively weak opponents
should have a chance at the title, assuming it's a year with two or
fewer unbeatens.
</P>
<P>
   A school that has one of the year's best records despite playing
high-ranked teams should be rewarded for its accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   See, our system tries to identify the teams that
!ital!accomplished!off! the most during the regular season, not the
teams that somebody with a computer decided is theoretically
``best.''
</P>
<P>
   So how would it work this year, if the season had ended last
week?
</P>
<P>
   There are seven unbeaten schools: Arkansas, Kansas State, Ohio
State, Tennessee, UCLA, Wisconsin and Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Only Tennessee defeated two top-10s. So Tennessee goes straight
to the title game.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent?
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State and UCLA are inseparable after the first two
tiebreakers, each having defeated one top-10 team and three top-25
teams. UCLA gets the nod because its opponents' combined record
(32-25) is better than Ohio State's (33-32).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it'll probably be different by the time the season's
over.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, not a foolproof system, we'd be the first to admit. But
a lot closer to what football ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   Simple enough for a 6-year-old. And me. &QL;

ARIZONA'S YOUNG TURKS LEAD GINGRICH OVERTHROW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were the true believers in the Contract With
America, Newt Gingrich's shock troops, revolutionaries and
students. Ultimately, they became his executioners.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon and, to a lesser degree, Arizona Reps.
John Shadegg and J.D. Hayworth, on Friday helped push Speaker
Gingrich out of office over dissatisfaction with poor Republican
results during the mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's surprise resignation comes just four years after he
helped elect the three to the committed Class of 1994, bringing
about the first GOP congressional majority in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gingrich's resignation may look like the death of that
1994 Republican revolution, the sophomores say that's not so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the rebirth of the revolution,'' said Shadegg. ``The
truth is that no one has damaged the ability of the Republican
conference to carry forward a conservative agenda . . . than Newt
Gingrich.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Arizonans, it was Salmon who played the largest role
in opposing leadership. Over the last two days he has appeared day
and night on the television and radio circuit, saying he would not
vote for Gingrich for speaker come January.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Salmon claimed to have six like-minded friends among
House Republicans, enough, when combined with the new larger
Democratic minority, to block Gingrich's re-election indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The full House elects the speaker. Democrats picked up five
seats to bring their numbers to 211, and 218 is the simple majority
needed to elect the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday evening, Salmon delighted in his victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``My strategy worked,'' he said, after taking another phone call
informing him that the speaker was going to step down. ``I was the
only one willing to put my neck on the line this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just pleased Newt Gingrich did the right thing for America
and did the right thing for the party,'' Salmon said. Gingrich's
exit ``will go a long way'' toward fixing the problems of the GOP,
Salmon said, most particularly the often-cited ``lack of message''
that led Republican candidates to a lackluster performance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon is no stranger to opposing leadership. He was the first
to call for Gingrich to step aside while he resolved ethics charges
over his leadership of the controversial political action
committee, GOPAC. And Salmon was in the thick of the ``Gang of 11''
who tried to oust the speaker in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg, too, has been a frequent critic of Gingrich, and the
last few days have been no exception. He said he participated in a
series of conference calls among members trying to determine
whether Gingrich should be replaced and, if so, by whom.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.D. Hayworth, a Gingrich loyalist since the two had their
picture taken together on the steps of the Capitol in the halcyon
days of early 1995, said even he urged the speaker on Friday to
step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laid out this scenario to him and suggested it might be time
for a graceful exit,'' Hayworth said. Hayworth was so well liked by
House leaders that he was selected over colleague Shadegg for a
plum assignment on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the changes at the top will mean for other
members of leadership and committee assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., holds one of the top committee
positions in the House as a subcommittee chairman controlling the
budget of Treasury, the Postal Service and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   He said committee assignments could change with the changes in
leaderships, but said he'll just take it as it comes.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he's loyal to Gingrich, Kolbe said he'd come to the
conclusion that a change was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a general fails in war, they expect to be replaced,'' he
said. ``He led us into this fight, this election campaign, and
obviously, he failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, Shadegg and Hayworth all appear on the list of
signatories of the Contract With America, which dubbed itself ``the
bold plan by Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and the House Republicans to
change the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Kolbe, and Bob Stump, who could not be reached Friday
evening, also signed the document. &QL; 
Contributing to this report was Republic staff writer Jeff Barker. &QL;

 &HT;    State rests its case against Scaggs
 &HT;    By Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Amid fireworks Friday, as attorneys battled in
and out of the presence of jurors, the state rested its murder case
against Roger Scaggs.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers who have watched the past two weeks of testimony
said the evidence against Scaggs, a data-processing executive
accused of killing his wife in 1996, is compelling, but may have
gotten lost in a flood of technical explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, their case is very methodical and by the book, but it
hasn't been terribly interesting until recently,'' said Adam
Stoffa, a former military attorney now in private practice in
Austin. ``They haven't told the story until the past couple of
days. They've put the dots out there, but you've got to connect the
dots.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's most crucial evidence _ Roger Scaggs' fingerprints
inside latex gloves discovered in a garbage bag along with weapons
and Peggy Scaggs' jewelry _ will be hard to dispute, said attorney
Alan Bennett, a former Travis County prosecutor who has watched the
trial every day either in court or on television.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's argument that Scaggs showed an abnormal lack of
emotion after finding his wife's body may fall flat if Scaggs'
attorneys show that a cool, businesslike demeanor was normal for
him, even during crises, Bennett said.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the garbage bag full of evidence found in a Dumpster
at Scaggs' company may prove a double-edged sword, Bennett said.
The state has argued Scaggs threw the evidence away there because
he knew the area well; but the defense may say he was far too smart
to dispose of it so close to his office.
</P>
<P>
   The first part of Scaggs's trial has been distinguished by
lengthy private discussions between the attorneys and District
Judge Jon Wisser, after which the jury is often sent out of the
room while testimony is previewed.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was no exception and provided one of the most explosive
disclosures of the trial so far, though the jury wasn't present and
was later instructed to disregard all testimony leading up to it.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Muecke, Penny Scaggs' youngest sister, testified that
Roger Scaggs talked to her about hiring a lawyer after his wife's
death because police were suspicious of him. The jury was sent out
of the room and Muecke continued to answer questions by lead
prosecutor Buddy Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   During one conversation, Muecke testified, ``He said, 'I've been
told that if you're innocent, you just need an attorney that knows
his way around the hill, and if you're guilty, hire Minton.' '' Roy
Minton is Scaggs' lead attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed before the trial started, attorneys on both
sides agreed that conversations between Scaggs and anyone else
about hiring attorneys would be off-limits. One of Scaggs'
attorneys, Charles Burton, asked Muecke whether she had been
instructed by prosecutors to stay away from that topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told to tell the truth,'' she replied. Roger Scaggs
smiled during the exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday afternoon, as the defense put on its DNA expert, a
dispute that has dogged the trial from the beginning boiled over
into open hostility.
</P>
<P>
   Scaggs' attorneys and the state's own witnesses have said a
mixture of DNA was found on the Scaggses' kitchen countertop and
four of Penny Scaggs' fingernails that belongs to someone besides
Roger Scaggs. The defense's DNA expert, Edward Blake, a forensic
serologist from Oakland, Calif., supported that theory Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But in his opening statement two weeks ago, prosecutor Bryan
Case said the state believes the mysterious DNA is actually
contamination from forensic procedures or tools. Scaggs' attorneys
have protested that theory, saying that they had received no notice
of it and that the state hadn't provided proof of it to the
defense, as prosecutors had agreed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, while cross-examining Blake, who wore a tie adorned with
a double-helix pattern of DNA, Case said he wasn't the only one who
thought the DNA might be contaminated. An employee from the
Department of Public Safety, which first tested the material, had
suspected the same thing and sent the samples to another lab for
retesting, Case said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Randy Leavitt stood up, asking Blake whether it
were true that the state had kept that information secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what that's all about,'' Case said, shrugging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about you hiding documents from us,'' Leavitt shot back,
pointing his finger at Case.
</P>
<P>
   After testimony ended for the day, Leavitt accused the state of
prosecutorial misconduct and asked for Judge Wisser to either
dismiss the case, grant a mistrial or exclude all the evidence the
state hadn't provided to the defense ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt also put Case on the witness stand, asking him under
oath whether he had given the defense the two documents that
mentioned the DPS lab's suspicion about contamination. Case said he
thought someone had, but apparently it hadn't been done.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told Leavitt when the trial started that the
information about contamination was in the reports, without
realizing the defense didn't have the relevant documents.
</P>
<P>
   While the attorneys argued, Penny Scaggs' sisters folded their
hands and closed their eyes as if in prayer. When Wisser said he
thought the state had agreed to provide more than the law required,
the women sat back and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Wisser said he would consider the defense's requests over the
weekend and announce his decision Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As the state's final witness Friday, Muecke testified about a
conversation she had with Scaggs on the way to the funeral home to
view his wife's body. He told her that he planned to get remarried
and move away from Austin, Muecke told jurors.
</P>
<P>
   At his wife's funeral, Scaggs wore a red, white and blue leather
jacket decorated with a picture of an eagle in full wingspan,
Muecke testified. She described it as beautiful and obviously
expensive, but inappropriate for such a somber occasion.

Astros unveil '99 schedule
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ticket prices raised for most prime seats
</P>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa and the Chicago Cubs will help the Astros kick off
their final year in the Astrodome with a three-game series to open
the 1999 season. The Milwaukee Brewers also will visit the Dome on
the first homestand of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros released their 1999 schedule Friday, and the two-time
defending National League Central champions announced ticket
increases on most premium seats.
</P>
<P>
   The prices will increase from $23 to $26 in the Star Deck, $18
to $21 for Field Box seats, $15 to $17 in the Mezzanine, $7 to $8
for Upper Box tickets and $5 to $6 in the Upper Reserved areas.
Single-game ticket prices will remain the same for the Club ($18),
Loge ($12), Mezzanine Outfield ($12) and Sky Box ($12) levels.
Pavilion tickets also will remain the same _ $4 for adults and $1
for children under the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we've put a range of options out there to where
there is something for everyone,'' Astros vice president of
marketing Pam Gardner said. ``The main objective is a straddle
between affordable pricing and putting a competitive product on the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros open the season at home April 6, a Tuesday, and their
first road trip is a brief three-game jaunt to San Francisco on
April 13-15. Mark McGwire, who hit a major-league-record 70 home
runs in 1998 and _ along with Sosa _ helped rejuvenate interest in
baseball, will make his first visit to the Astrodome on April 16-18
when the St. Louis Cardinals come to town.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' only other visit is June 29-July 1, and the Cubs
make their final trip to the Astrodome Sept. 10-12. Next season
also will mark the first Astrodome visit by the Detroit Tigers, who
will come to town July 15-17, followed by the Cleveland Indians,
who also will be in Houston for three days.
</P>
<P>
   With interleague play returning for a third season, the Astros
will travel to Minnesota for the first time. They play the Twins at
the Metrodome June 4-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros will close out their 35-year stay at the Dome with a
five-game homestand featuring the Cincinnati Reds (Sept. 28-29) and
Los Angeles Dodgers (Oct. 1-3). After the 1999 season, the Astros
will move to the Ballpark at Union Station _ a 42,000-seat
retractable-roof stadium under construction downtown near the
George R. Brown Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any specific plans to announce right now, but
we're working on a lot of things,'' Gardner said. ``The whole
season will be devoted to Astrodome memories.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros entertained a club-record 2,450,451 fans last season,
with 21 crowds of 40,000 or more and 10 of at least 50,000. They
also set a regular-season record by drawing 52,493 for a game
against McGwire and the Cardinals.

NO LIE: STANFORD IS TOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD _ For once, when a coach says he's worried about
playing a 1-7 team, he's telling the truth. Even USC coach Paul
Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   Despite telling reporters, ``Hey I lie sometimes, I thought I'd
let you guys know that,'' regarding who would start at quarterback
for the Trojans last week, Hackett has to be believed this time.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (1-7, 0-5) may be the worst team in the Pacific-10
Conference by virtue of its record, but few teams are eager to play
the Cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their bowl,'' Hackett said. ``It makes me nervous as
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   What causes Hackett to be concerned is Stanford's last two
weeks: The Cardinal lost 44-38 in overtime at Arizona State, then
probably deserved to beat No. 3-ranked UCLA in a 28-24 loss at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``In watching them, you see a dramatic shift in the energy
level,'' Hackett said. ``The quality of play is dramatically
different. It's a much more confident Stanford team than at any
time during the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett didn't worry this week that his team would become
complacent or lose focus playing the Pac-10's cellar dweller. All
he did was pull out a tape of last week's Cardinal loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they looked at that, it caught everyone's attention,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other motivating factors for the Trojans (6-3, 4-2). A
victory ensures USC will play in a bowl game while a loss means the
Trojans will have to defeat UCLA or Notre Dame to become
bowl-eligible.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a belief among the team that it can still win its
final three games and sneak into something better than the Aloha or
Sun Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big game,'' freshman quarterback Carson Palmer said.
``We know we've got to win. If we lose, it doesn't make the UCLA
game as big a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal seems to be vastly improved from the team that lost
its season opener 35-23 to San Jose State. But even after two
near-victories on the road against high-profile opponents, coach
Tyrone Willingham was still playing his favorite role of
curmudgeon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't turn the corner until you get the most tangible
evidence of that and that is a win,'' Willingham said. ``We've been
nipping at it, we've been very close, but there is no substitute
for it, so I can't say we've turned the corner. Have we improved?
Yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we have continued to improve, and hopefully that will be
the way we finish our year. But most important, we need to get a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   If USC fans became weary of the Trojans' two-quarterback
rotation, they should take a look at Stanford. The Cardinal has
used three quarterbacks the past two games _ starter Todd Husak,
Joe Borchard of Camarillo and Randy Fasani.
</P>
<P>
   Husak is clearly the No. 1 quarterback, especially after he
threw for 419 yards against UCLA and 335 at Arizona State.
Willingham would not say if he would play Husak exclusively or
continue the platoon system against the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the defensive structure of the team we're playing
and see if utilizing our rotation gives us any advantage,''
Willingham said. ``When we believe it does, we try to work our
rotation. When we don't, we let Todd have the majority of it as you
saw this last weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason Stanford has suddenly become formidable.
Wide receiver Troy Walters, a preseason All-American, has returned
after missing part or all of four games with a badly sprained
ankle. Walters returned three games ago and has caught 26 passes
for 482 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walters is an electric player,'' Hackett said. ``He inspires
everybody else. They've had to play without arguably their best
player.''
</P>
<P>
   After withstanding a 68-pass barrage from Washington last week,
the Trojans secondary figures to feel it's in another
passing-league game. USC leads the Pac-10 with 17 interceptions,
and its pass defense is ranked third in the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense will be tested big time,'' Hackett said.

NBA rookies caught in game of hurry-up-and-wait
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JONATHAN FEIGEN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury slammed a hard cross-over dribble to his left
hand and prepared to explode toward the baseline. But Cory Carr
moved hard to his right and cut him off. Marbury stepped back and
flashed another move. Again, Carr was there.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Marbury, the third-season star of the Minnesota
Timberwolves, cut to his right and, falling sideways, jumped for a
3-pointer over Carr that swished, ending the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the game,'' Marbury said to Carr, walking off the court.
``You've got to go to a whole other level.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr smiled and feigned pain, looking toward the rafters of the
Westside Tennis Club gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give him that all day long,'' Carr said, impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury hugged Carr's head. Red defeated Blue.
</P>
<P>
   For rookies like Carr, moments like that are as close to the NBA
as they have been. But Red vs. Blue is close enough to add to the
frustration of remaining so far away from the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Carr was ready to join the NBA more than a year ago. He declared
himself available for the NBA draft and believed his chance at a
dream a few months away. He would have nice paychecks coming in
twice a month, a spot in an exclusive club every night and, it
seemed, enough minutes on the court to be happy with the decision.
</P>
<P>
   But an extra year at Texas Tech would allow him the opportunity
to polish his game and get his degree. The money would come later.
He had waited long enough that another year didn't seem too much to
sacrifice. He withdrew his name from the draft, played another
season, and waited one more year.
</P>
<P>
   But the year has not ended, and the end is not in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Carr is a college graduate, a first-round draft pick of the NBA
champion Chicago Bulls, no less. But he is back at home, living
with his parents.
</P>
<P>
   There is no money, no NBA. Instead of sharing a backcourt _ or
at least a bench _ with Michael Jordan, he shares a place in a
union and a fight with NBA owners during the lockout. While Jordan
and other union leaders and NBA veterans contend their fight is for
young players like Carr, the players to whom they will leave the
league, Carr waits with no income, no bank account and no job.
</P>
<P>
   And for him and rookies like him, there is no power, no choice
but to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, it helps being a rookie,'' Carr said. ``If you're
not used to (income), you can't miss it. For us, it's like college.
But we would like to get started to prove ourselves and show we
belong.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said Rockets first-round pick Michael Dickerson: ``When you
know what you're supposed to be making, it sits on you. I guess
he's right. You can't miss what you never had. But knowing what you
should be putting in your pocket or your bank account and are not,
it's bound to affect you.''
</P>
<P>
   For both sides of the NBA impasse, there is frustration as the
limits of patience are tested. Veterans see their limited time
slipping away. Management watches offseason opportunities to build
put on hold. Fringe players who believed their NBA shot coming are
instead considering overseas or Continental Basketball Association
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   But NBA rookies face their own restlessness, as what was
supposed to be the time of their lives, the days when they finally
make it big, instead consists of pickup basketball and a bedroom
back at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough,'' said Dallas Mavericks draft pick Ansu Sesay from
Mississippi and Willowridge. ``This is the thing we have been
waiting for our whole lives. They really put a hold on it. We don't
talk about it too much. We pretty much have fun playing. But we're
ready to get started. They really need to do whatever it takes to
get started.''
</P>
<P>
   For rookies in waiting like Carr, Sesay, Dickerson or Clippers
first-rounder Brian Skinner from Baylor, European and CBA
opportunities are not the answer, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting to take our shot at the NBA,'' Sesay said, ``not
overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   And though offers to play for pay are coming in, paychecks are
not the point. Though the rookies might not have imagined
themselves living at home or on a friend's sleeper-sofa, there are
also relatively few financial pressures demanding attention while
negotiators in New York test each other's mettle.
</P>
<P>
   So close to their goals and dreams, at least the first-round
rookies insist they don't want to take their talents thousands of
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Older guys that have been in the league and have bills to
pay,'' Sesay said, ``they're the ones that should be worried.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if bills were piling up for players without bank
accounts to serve as a safety net, Dickerson would continue to
dream about playing for the Rockets, not in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Carr found himself claimed by a team that likes his abilities to
find his shot and score off the dribble, and, if Jordan returns,
wouldn't mind if Carr is neither a true point guard or a big off
guard.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, as the second first-round pick of the Clippers, found a
chance to grow with former college competitor Michael Olowokandi,
the first pick of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Sesay waits for a chance on a team in need of help and with no
choice but to grow with its young talent, not to mention is just up
the road from his Missouri City home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we waited so long for,'' Dickerson said. ``The
rookies are anxious to play. There are differences that need to be
settled between the owners and us, the union. But there's nothing
the rookies can do but wait and stay in shape and prepare, so when
it does open, we're ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr has shuttled between games in Chicago and Houston, even
picking up advice from Bulls veterans Scottie Pippen and Randy
Brown. Skinner only recently began playing in Houston, having spent
most of his time since last season working out in Waco. He plans to
play in Los Angeles next week and then come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last six months, basketball has been my life,''
Skinner said. ``There is nothing else to do. No school. Nowhere
else to go. I just work out for four or five hours a day, eat and
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich and his staff work one
story up, Dickerson is not permitted to poke a head through the
door to say even a word, and they cannot come downstairs to watch
him begin taking the next step from college star to NBA
contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rockets were my first choice,'' said Dickerson, who after
completing work at Arizona returned home to Seattle. ``It was like
a dream come true. I heard they would take me, and I just thought,
`Yeah, right.' I thought playing with Hakeem Olajuwon and (Charles)
Barkley would be the best group of veterans you could pick. And I
loved the coaching staff. It's kind of weird they're right here and
we can't even talk. I'm sure they'd want to talk to me. I want to
talk to them. But we don't want the $1 million fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they remain apart, as do the sides in the NBA lockout
game of chicken. But though the rookies have clearly joined one
side of the fight, they cannot help but feel caught in the middle,
and to wonder what could have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to wait and see what happens,'' said Skinner.
``And wait. And wait. And wait.''

 &HT;    Art feud, trial end with a settlement
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A feud between a famous Southwestern artist and
an Austin gallery owner that went public last week in Travis County
court ended abruptly Friday with the announcement of a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the trial was whether Amado Pena, one of the most
prolific and prominent Southwestern artists, had breached a
contract with Olga Pina, who bought his Austin art gallery, El
Taller, in 1991. She claimed he had not supplied her with the
artwork he had promised and had hurt her business by endorsing a
new Austin gallery run by his sister and niece.
</P>
<P>
   For years, rumors have circulated of a dispute between the Pena
family and Pina. While long denied by both sides, the feud was
confirmed with Pina's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   It all ended abruptly Friday. Just minutes before closing
arguments were scheduled to begin, both sides announced a
settlement of the lawsuit. They would not discuss the terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court case for me is over, and I'm going on with my life
and do better things,'' Pina said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena declined to comment through his attorney, Bill Bingham, who
would only say that Pena was happy with the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Pena, who began his career as an art teacher at Anderson High
School in the '70s, achieved star status in the art world in the
early '80s. His works range from $50 poster prints to paintings
worth more than $20,000. He is best known for his use of brilliant
colors and his depiction of Chicano culture and the Southwestern
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   His art has been seen everywhere _ from a special edition
plastic Pepsi cup promoting artistry in 1988 to the most
prestigious galleries in New York to the White House, where he
presented then-President George Bush with an original painting in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Pena sold his Austin gallery to Pina and moved
to Santa Fe, N.M., where he now owns a gallery and a home. His
attorney said Pena, who still owns an apartment in Austin, divides
his time between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit, Pina says Pena promised he would give her his
artworks on consignment. Under the arrangement, she would display
his works at El Taller (pronounced Tie-YAIR), at 8015 Shoal Creek
Blvd., and when they sold, they would each take a percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Pina levels a host of charges against Pena, saying he failed to
provide the amount of quality artwork he had promised and even took
back some of his pieces. She also claims he undermined her gallery
by selling his work at lower prices elsewhere, including his
niece's gallery, Pena Gallery and Studio at Third and Congress
streets, which opened last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Pena, Pena's niece, declined to comment on the case,
saying only that the trial had not hurt business at her gallery.
``I'm happy for him that it's all over with,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, which began Monday, Pena's attorney maintained
that Pina's lawsuit was a feeble attempt to extract money from
Pena, adding that Pina blamed the artist for what was clearly her
poor management of El Taller.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, several witnesses took the stand, including Pena's
sister, Irene Pena, who helped her brother run El Taller before he
sold it.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination by Pina's attorney, Albert Villegas of
Brownsville, Irene Pena said she could not recall the answers to so
many questions that Villegas asked, ``Are you taking any medication
that would affect your memory?''
</P>
<P>
   She tersely replied, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bingham, Pena's attorney, called as an expert witness Sue
DiMaio of Santa Fe, an art appraiser and museum consultant who has
known Pena since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio called Pena ``one of the most productive artists I've
ever known.'' He ``is one of the most well-liked artists I've ever
known,'' she testified. ``He's responsible. He keeps his word. I
can't remember hearing a bad word against him.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Pina moved the gallery from its original location at
1221 W. Sixth St. to Shoal Creek, in what DiMaio called a strip
mall. DiMaio said she had participated in a study that found that
``a strip mall is one of the worst locations for gallery sales.''
</P>
<P>
   With the public bickering largely over Friday, Pina said she was
eager to put the ugliness of the trial behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a very nonpublic owner of this gallery,'' she
said. ``The purpose of this gallery is to provide beauty to the
people who know and love art, and that is what I will focus on.''
