<HEADLINE> Two Sentenced in 'Scream' Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two teen-age cousins who said the slasher  
movie ``Scream'' inspired them to kill one boy's mother in a 
frenzied stabbing attack were sentenced to prison on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Padilla, 17, received life imprisonment without the  
possibility of parole, while 16-year-old Samuel Ramirez received 25 
years to life. Ramirez was not eligible for the same sentence 
because he was only 14 at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The teens were convicted of killing Padilla's mother, Gina  
Castillo, 37, who was stabbed 45 times in 1998. The boys admitted 
they attacked while she was seated at her home computer. Padilla 
stabbed her and Ramirez held her down. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at a preliminary hearing showed the boys were obsessed  
with the movie ``Scream'' and its sequel, ``Scream 2.'' In the 
movies, teens are knifed by killers in Grim Reaper costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys said the slayings depicted were ``cool.'' On the  
way home from one of many viewings, he told a friend: ``It was a 
perfect way to kill somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement read in court Thursday, Padilla described his  
reactions to TV and movie violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first stage you see a guy's head being blown off and you  
feel compassion,'' he said. ``The second stage you see it again, 
you feel compassion, but it's not as strong as the first ... the 
fifth stage, you want to do it but it's just a thought. The last 
stage you do it and you want to do it again.''

<HEADLINE>  Greenspan Watches Out for Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told  
Congress today that 1999 has been an ``exceptional year'' for the 
American economy. But he pledged the central bank will ``act 
promptly and forcefully'' at the first hint of inflation dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Delivering the Fed's midyear report on economic conditions,  
Greenspan defended the decision three weeks ago to nudge a key 
interest rate up by a quarter-point, the first increase in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have refrained from doing so in our judgment would have put  
the U.S. economy at risk,'' Greenspan said in remarks prepared for 
the House Banking Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that unemployment, which has fallen to its lowest level  
in 29 years, and continued strong consumer spending make it 
essential for the Fed to be ``especially alert to inflation 
risks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets reacted negatively to Greenspan's warnings  
about inflation and possible future interest rate increases. In 
afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more 
than 100 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was more hawkish than most market participants expected,''  
said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said, ``If new data suggest it is likely that the pace  
of cost and price increases will be picking up, the Federal Reserve 
will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude 
imbalances from arising that would only require a more disruptive 
adjustment later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A common mistake of Fed policy-makers before Greenspan took over  
in 1987 was to wait too long before starting to raise interest 
rates to slow an overheated economy, forcing higher rates that 
eventually dumped the country into recession. 
</P>
<P>
	But while stressing the Fed was poised to act at the first sign  
that inflation was heating up, Greenspan did not signal in his 
prepared remarks that such a move was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	After increasing the federal funds rate, the interest that banks  
charge each other, to 5 percent on June 30, the Fed announced it 
was adopting a neutral policy stance, indicating a wait-and-see 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	Private economists said they expect the Fed to remain on hold  
through the summer, watching to see if the economy slows on its 
own. If there is no slowing -- or if inflation flares unexpectedly -- 
the Fed will be prepared to move. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who in late 1996 worried about ``irrational  
exuberance'' in the stock market, returned to those concerns in 
today's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the high-flying stock market had been bolstered by a  
healthy upturn in U.S. workers' productivity. But he cautioned 
investors against becoming overly optimistic that the strong gains 
in productivity witnessed in recent years could be sustained in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted,  
perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity 
prices to levels that are unsupportable,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But should the stock market undergo a serious correction,  
Greenspan said, ``It is the job of economic policy-makers to 
mitigate the fallout when it occurs and, hopefully, ease the 
transition to the next expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan devoted an entire section of his testimony to  
``pre-emptive policy-making,'' saying that in order to keep alive 
the 8-year-old economic expansion, already the longest in peacetime 
history, the Fed must be alert to risks that inflation could be 
getting out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	``While product prices have remained remarkably restrained in  
the face of exceptionally strong demand and expanding potential 
supply, it is imperative that we do not become complacent,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who appears before Congress twice a year to provide  
an update on the central bank's views, called the performance so 
far in 1999 ``an exceptional year for the American economy'' with 
almost 1.25 million jobs being created and no pickup yet in 
consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed released a revised economic forecast that tracked  
closely with recent forecasts by the administration and the 
Congressional Budget Office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed predicted the economy, as measured by the gross domestic  
product, will expand this year at an annual rate of around 3.5 
percent to 3.75 percent. That compared to the administration's 
slightly lower forecast of 3.2 percent growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed predicted growth would slow further next year to 2.5  
percent to 3 percent, compared to an administration forecast of 2.1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On inflation, the Fed saw consumer prices rising around 2.25  
percent to 2.5 percent this year and 2 percent to 2.5 percent last, 
up from an increase of 1.6 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> UN Counters US Criticism on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan had a  
message Thursday for U.S. critics who complain that the United 
Nations is moving too slowly in Kosovo: ``We should focus on the 
work at hand rather than finger-pointing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Annan also endorsed comments made Wednesday by his aide, John  
Ruggie, who said the United Nations was moving with unprecedented 
speed and that the NATO-led military force is responsible for 
ensuring public safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going ahead deploying the police and the civilian staff  
as quickly as we can,'' Annan said. ``So I am reasonably satisfied 
with the way things are going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruggie insisted Wednesday that the United Nations was never  
expected to have an international police force on the ground and a 
civilian administration up and running in just six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have been humanly impossible,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and Gen. Henry H. Shelton,  
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, complained to the Senate 
Armed Services Committee on Tuesday that the NATO-led Kosovo Force, 
KFOR, was being called on to fill too many roles -- from policing to 
civil administration and judicial jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to put as much pressure as possible on the U.N. to do  
more to get in there more quickly to get these institutions up and 
running,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruggie said the U.N. Security Council resolution ending the  
Kosovo conflict envisioned that KFOR would be responsible for 
security and administration in Kosovo in the initial postwar 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruggie said the United Nations is doing exactly what the  
Security Council expected when it gave the world body 
responsibility for running the civilian administration and building 
a new government and economy in Kosovo: It is getting ``up and 
running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a superb working relationship with KFOR on the  
ground,'' he said. ``We have had no problems, whatsoever, of any 
magnitude.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Wins Battle Over Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds scored a victory off the field  
in his bid to keep a former wife from getting a share of his 
baseball earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court on Wednesday granted a hearing that  
would give the San Francisco Giants star a chance to prove that the 
prenuptial agreement that Sun Bonds signed a day before their 1988 
marriage is enforceable. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Nachshin, a lawyer for the outfielder, predicted the  
court would find the agreement enforceable. ``This is a total 
vindication for Barry Bonds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paige Wickland, a lawyer for Mrs. Bonds, disagreed. She said the  
Bonds case could establish safeguards for all premarital waivers. 
</P>
<P>
	At stake in the case is half the money and property Bonds  
accumulated during the six-year marriage, which started when he was 
an outfielder with the Pittsburgh Pirates and ended when he was an 
$8 million-a-year star with the Giants.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Pentagon To Be Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Defense Department has verified that 94  
percent of its computer systems are ready for the Year 2000 
computer glitch, Defense Secretary William Cohen said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very confident that the department will be able to carry  
out its missions as we cross over into the new millennium,'' Cohen 
told a news conference on the Pentagon's $3.7 billion Y2K 
preparedness project. He said 100 percent of the department's 
computers will be ready by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he had been ``deeply concerned'' one year ago that  
the Pentagon was not moving fast enough to prepare for Y2K. The 
U.S. military is more dependent on computers than any other 
military in the world. Cohen said 2,107 of its 10,000 computers are 
deemed critical to military missions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe it is not enough for technical teams to simply  
validate the systems,'' Cohen said. ``Rather we are having our 
commanders test their systems in operational settings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adm. Richard W. Mies, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command,  
which is in charge of the nation's nuclear weapons, said at the 
same news conference today ``there is no risk of accidental 
launch'' of U.S. nuclear weapons on Jan. 1. ``Computers by 
themselves cannot launch nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mies said that of 198 computer systems deemed critical to U.S.  
nuclear missions, all but two have been verified as fully ready for 
Y2K.

<HEADLINE> Martinez Workout Goes Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martinez threw for  
about 10 minutes in the outfield before Thursday night's game and 
is making progress towards returning next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctor Arthur Pappas said that Martinez reported a little  
tightness in the back of his right shoulder, but it was more 
important to see how quickly Martinez recovers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's continuing to improve,'' Pappas said. ``We'll see how he  
responds over the next few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez would not comment.  
</P>
<P>
	At this point, there were no plans to put the Red Sox ace on the  
disabled list. He could be placed on the 15-day DL retroactive to 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez had a 15-3 record and a 2.10 ERA in the season's first  
half, earning him the start for the AL in the All-Star game. 
Pitching in front of his home crowd, Martinez struck out the first 
four batters -- five in all -- and was the game's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his next start, he gave up nine runs, seven earned, in 2  
2-3 innings on Sunday -- the worst start of his career. The next day 
the Red Sox announced he would miss a start for the first time in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Pappas said Thursday that the injury was in the back of the  
rotator cuff, but it did not appear to be a significant tear, which 
could be season-ending. Martinez has not had an MRI, which would be 
ordered if a tear was suspected, Pappas said.

<HEADLINE> Tax Poll Results Depend on Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public support for tax cuts depends on how the  
question is asked, according to the latest poll by the Pew Research 
Center for the People &AMP; the Press, released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Support for tax cuts was relatively high when people were not  
given specific spending alternatives. It dropped significantly when 
people were asked whether they preferred tax cuts or spending on 
education, the environment, health care, crime-fighting and 
military defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are the questions Pew asked of a split sample and the  
results. When numbers don't total 100 percent, the remainder didn't 
know or refused to answer. 

</P>
<P>
	ASKED OF ABOUT HALF THE RESPONDENTS (593)   	
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed setting aside approximately  
two-thirds of an expected budget surplus to fix the Social Security 
system. What do you think the leaders in Washington should do with 
the remainder of the surplus? Should the money be used for a tax 
cut, or should it be used to fund new government programs? 
</P>
<P>
	--Should be used for a tax cut, 60 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Should be used to fund new programs, 25 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Should be used for some other purpose, 11 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	ASKED OF THE OTHER HALF (607)   	
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has proposed setting aside approximately  
two-thirds of an expected budget surplus to fix the Social Security 
system. What do you think the leaders in Washington should do with 
the remainder of the surplus? Should the money be used for a tax 
cut, or should it be spent on programs for education, the 
environment, health care, crime-fighting and military defense? 
</P>
<P>
	--Should be used for a tax cut, 22 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Should be spent on programs, 69 percent.  
</P>
<P>
	--Should be used for some other purpose, 6 percent.  

</P>
<P>
	The telephone survey of 1,200 adults was taken July 13-18. The  
error margin for the split samples used in the tax question is plus 
or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Church Becomes Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The church where the memorial Mass for John F.  
Kennedy Jr. and his wife will be celebrated became an instant 
shrine Thursday with a steady stream of visitors and a growing pile 
of notes and bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really the church where Jackie went to pray, to  
attend Mass,'' author Christopher Andersen said of the 126-year-old 
Catholic Church of St. Thomas More. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a place where she found refuge and solace and was able to  
stay out of the public eye,'' said Anderson, the author of the 
biographies, ``Jackie After Jack'' (1998) and ``Jack and Jackie'' 
(1996). ``It's also the place where Caroline christened her 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gothic-style church is on a quiet block of Manhattan's Upper  
East Side, a few blocks from where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis 
lived. She had worshipped at the church with her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's heartbreaking,'' Victoria Ariza-Vogelman, who grew up in  
Colombia, said outside the church. ``As a kid, I would see pictures 
of him -- John-John growing up, going to school. I kept thinking, at 
the last minute, maybe he would wash ashore somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 bouquets had been left outside the front door by noon  
Thursday, along with the front cover of the French children's 
classic, ``The Little Prince,'' several tiny stuffed animals, and 
notes like this one: ``May you be at peace, reunited with your 
family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar shrines have sprung up outside the buildings where JFK  
Jr. lived and worked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mass was to be held at 11 a.m. Friday and President Clinton  
was expected to attend. The service will be a private, memorial 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	To have a funeral Mass in the Catholic Church, the remains of  
the deceased must be present. Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren Bessette, were cremated and their 
ashes cast into sea off Cape Cod on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three died when JFK Jr.'s private plane crashed into the  
ocean en route to a cousin's wedding at the Kennedy homestead in 
Hyannis Port, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate service for Lauren Bessette was scheduled for  
Saturday in Connecticut, where her mother and stepfather live.

	Manhattan has been the site of other prominent Kennedy funerals.  
Mrs. Onassis's funeral was at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 
and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's was held at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 
1968 after he was assassinated. President Kennedy's funeral was 
held at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Readings at Mrs. Onassis's funeral included a Biblical passage  
from Isaiah read by JFK Jr. and a poem, by Edna St. Vincent Millay, 
that ended: ``Let me listen to the wind in the ash. ... It sounds 
like surf on the shore.''

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Prosecutors said Thursday they are appealing  
a judge's order blocking the extradition of a suspected drug 
trafficker to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Amezcua, described by U.S. and Mexican authorities as a  
leader of the biggest methamphetamine trafficking ring in the 
world, won a court injunction against a U.S. extradition order last 
week when a judge ruled that a life prison term he might face in 
the United States was cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Amezcua's brother and alleged accomplice, Jesus, got a similar  
injunction in May. Assistant Attorney General Eduardo Ibarrola said 
he will appeal both injunctions. If those fail, Ibarrola said 
Mexico has the power to try the brothers in Mexico for crimes 
committed in the United States.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Unemployment in Brazil's biggest and  
wealthiest city was close to 20 percent in June with nearly 2 
million people out of a job, according to statistics released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo metropolitan area has 16 million people.  
</P>
<P>
	June's joblessness rate was slightly higher than the 19 percent  
posted in June 1998, but lower than the 20.3 percent registered in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest national unemployment figures were 7.7 percent in  
May, according to the government.

	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- A U.S. citizen convicted of  
kidnapping a Salvadoran woman and holding her for ransom was 
convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Gorins, 24, was also ordered Wednesday to pay $69,000 in  
the kidnapping of Mercedes Nohemi Lara de Valladares in July 1998. 
She was freed Aug. 2 in Guatemala, just over the Salvadoran border, 
after the $20,000 ransom he demanded was paid. Gorins was arrested 
the next day as he tried to leave the country. Two accomplices have 
not been caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities released no information on the hometown of Gorins,  
now a resident of El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim is a distant relative of opposition legislator and  
former leftist guerrilla, Marta Valladares, but the kidnapping was 
not believed to be politically motivated.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Nearly 1,500 workers at Ford Motor  
Co.'s truck plant in Sao Paulo went on strike Thursday after a 
newspaper reported the company would shut down the factory and 
transfer it to the northeastern state of Bahia. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike brought to a complete standstill the daily production  
of 120 trucks in Ipiranga, a working class district of Sao Paulo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford denied it is planning to move the plant to Bahia, but  
acknowledged it was studying the possibility of transferring it to 
another ``less densely populated area'' in Sao Paulo state. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleno Bezerra, secretary-general of the Sao Paulo Metalworkers  
Union, said the strike would continue until Ford officials meet 
with labor leaders and give them ``a written guarantee that the 
plant will remain in Sao Paulo state and that there will no mass 
dismissals.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Police charged a man with  
attempted homicide after he allegedly encouraged his 4-year-old son 
to stab a 3-year-old, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Gomes da Silva, a 44-year-old fisherman, was returning home  
from work Wednesday morning when he saw his son fighting with 
another boy, said Antonio Silvino, chief of the 69th police 
precinct in Mage, across the bay from Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
	Da Silva went into the house, got a kitchen knife and gave it to  
his son, who then stabbed the boy he was fighting with in the 
chest, Silvino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim was hospitalized, Silvino said.

<HEADLINE> EU OKs Stake in Japan Telecom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Commission gave the  
go-ahead Thursday for leading telecommunications companies AT&AMP;T and 
British Telecommunications to take a combined 30 percent stake in 
Japan Telecom Co.. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission, the European Union's executive arm, said that  
``given the relatively modest presence of Japan Telecom in the 
Japanese domestic telecommunications sector, and in the 
international telecommunications services provided from Japan, the 
transaction does not raise any particular competition concerns.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Practical Gun Shooting Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Is it a sport worthy of Olympic status -- or a  
means of skirting gun control? Foes of the gun lobby took aim today 
at the sport of practical shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a game. This is not paintball,'' said Philip  
Alpers, who researched the sport for the Violence Policy Center. 
``There is a very serious political purpose behind this, and that 
is to legitimize the civilian ownership of lethal firearms which 
are normally kept only for battlefields and SWAT teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In practical shooting, participants racing against the clock use  
assault rifles, shotguns and semiautomatic handguns to shoot 
human-shaped targets in simulated scenarios. For instance, the 
shooter may start in the prone position -- as if lying in bed -- and 
then get up to retrieve a handgun from a drawer and use it to shoot 
at targets through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport is practiced in about 70 countries, according to the  
Canada-based International Practical Shooting Confederation, which 
has recently held talks with the International Olympic Committee. 
Greek officials have made practical shooting an exhibition, 
non-medal sport at the 2004 Games in Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates say practical shooting, formerly known as combat  
shooting, is strictly a sport without political connotations. Josh 
Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, 
contends it presents a convenient way to skirt laws that prohibit 
the trade of certain weapons unless they are used for sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugarmann also noted that Andrew Golden, the 11-year-old boy who  
was a participant in the Jonesboro, Ark., school shooting last 
year, had recently taken up practical shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combat shooting doesn't just violate the goals of the Olympic  
charter, it's an effort by the gun industry and the gun lobby to 
entice kids and help create a youth gun culture,'' Sugarmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Hollar, president of the 14,000-member U.S. Practical  
Shooting Association, said his organization has no such agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to understand that we're not a political  
organization; we're a sporting organization,'' Hollar said from 
USPSA headquarters in Sedro Woolley, Wash. ``People are going to 
look at our sport and read into it whatever they want to. We can't 
control that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IPSC president Nick Alexakos, who recently met with an IOC  
representative, played down his sport's chance for Olympic status. 
Although there are other Olympics shooting sports, such as skeet 
shooting and the biathlon, Alexakos said practical shooting is a 
``long shot'' that would take years to make it to the Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Alexakos said, ``we're talking about the same  
dedication and same commitment you find in any Olympic sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't deal with weapons,'' Alexakos said. ``We deal with  
recreational implements. A weapon is more how you use something, 
than what it is. A baseball bat could be used a weapon.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates, already hurting behind  
the plate after losing starting catcher Jason Kendall for the 
season, have placed current starter Keith Osik on the 15-day 
disabled list with a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	Osik was removed from Wednesday's game in the third inning  
against the Chicago Cubs after pulling up lame at third base. 
</P>
<P>
	Pittsburgh recalled Yamid Haad from Double-A Altoona to fill  
Osik's roster spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Tremie, in the lineup for Thursday afternoon's game  
against the Cubs, will assume the regular catching duties for the 
Pirates and manager Gene Lamont said the team may go outside the 
organization for a veteran catcher. 
</P>
<P>
	Osik was hitting .195 with a homer in 82 at-bats.  
</P>
<P>
	Haad, who spent four days with the Pirates after Kendall  
dislocated his right ankle July 4, was hitting .257 in 12 games for 
Altoona.

<HEADLINE> Druckemiller: Sex Was Consensual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Quarterback Jim Druckenmiller told  
police that he and a Virginia Tech student who accused him of rape 
had consensual sex, according to a tape played at his trial today. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Druckenmiller played an audiotape of a  
conversation the athlete had with a police sergeant the day after 
the alleged assault last March. Druckenmiller told the officer that 
the young woman was awake while they had sex and that they 
undressed each other beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, he asked her if everything was OK and she said, ``I'm  
drunk. I know what I'm doing. Everything's fine,'' Druckenmiller 
said on the tape played for the jury in his rape trial. 
</P>
<P>
	He said she started crying when she realized her friends had  
gone home without her. She declined Druckenmiller's offer of a ride 
and called a friend instead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer asked Druckenmiller if he knew why she had started  
to cry and he said, ``Maybe she was regretting what she had done,'' 
according to the tape. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, a 26-year-old reserve quarterback for the San  
Francisco 49ers, faces five years to life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men who know Druckenmiller testified Wednesday they heard  
his accuser say she wanted to have sex with the former Virginia 
Tech star. Druckenmiller visited his alma mater in March, and he, 
the woman and several friends were out drinking at two bars before 
ending up at a Blacksburg house where Druckenmiller was staying. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old accuser, a Tech graduate, testified that she was  
``just talking to him'' and didn't recall kissing him or telling 
him she loved him and wanted to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you remember saying yes when Jim asked you about your  
promise that you had made earlier, if you two could still have 
fun?'' asked defense attorney Deborah Caldwell-Bono. The woman said 
she did not recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman testified that she passed out in a bed at the house  
and awoke to find Druckenmiller on top of her. 
</P>
<P>
	``What was he doing?'' asked assistant prosecutor Peggy Frank.  
</P>
<P>
	``Having sex,'' the woman replied. ``It took me a while to  
realize what was going on. I was disoriented. I had no idea where I 
was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The woman said she got dressed afterward, felt scared and wanted  
to go home. She declined Druckenmiller's offer of a ride and called 
a male friend to pick her up, she said.

<HEADLINE> Weapons Maker Leaves Bush Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Insisting he doesn't want to become an issue  
for ``anti-gun people,'' an assault weapons manufacturer quit as 
presidential hopeful George W. Bush's finance chairman in Maine 
after inquiries were made about his campaign post. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard E. Dyke, a political veteran who has expressed strong  
pro-gun views, said he resigned voluntarily Thursday after some two 
months on the job. Don Evans, the Bush campaign's national 
fund-raising chief, confirmed he accepted the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need anti-gun people making an issue out of it when he  
(Bush) has nothing to do with the business I run,'' Dyke said in an 
interview shortly after he resigned from the Texas governor's 
Republican presidential campaign. ``I just don't want to be any 
baggage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke owns Bushmaster Firearms in Windham, Maine, a company that  
manufactures automatic weapons for government agencies, 
semiautomatics for public use and a rifle widely used in shooting 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	His company was one of nine makers of assault weapons that has  
been sued by a Los Angeles police officer wounded during a 
high-profile gun battle with bank robbers armed with such rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke has said gun makers shouldn't be sued for the violence of  
others and dismissed child safety locks on guns as ``window 
dressing.'' He told the Los Angeles Times in 1997, when asked about 
incidents involving assault weapons: ``I guess I don't see that 
happening enough to feel that it's a legitimate social issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Active in Maine politics for years, Dyke, 65, said he has known  
Bush's father, former President Bush, for many years. He said if 
his business ``disenfranchises me as a citizen to participate in 
the process, that's what it is. I didn't think this country has 
come to that, but I guess it has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation was announced shortly after an Associated Press  
reporter called the campaign to inquire about Dyke's position. Dyke 
said a similar inquiry had been received by the campaign on 
Wednesday, prompting him to rethink his position. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke said he has given Bush $1,000. Campaign spokeswoman Mindy  
Tucker said $45,000 has been raised in Maine, but some of the 
contributions predated the businessman's fund-raising appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	As the front-running GOP presidential candidate, Bush has found  
himself at odds with gun control advocates. The Texas governor 
signed legislation this year barring cities in his state from suing 
gun makers for the costs of violence on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has said he would have voted for legislation defeated by  
the House that would have required a 24-hour background check on 
weapons sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats pushed for a longer waiting period and argued  
that the 24-hour proposal would have actually weakened current law 
by shortening the waiting period for some gun show sales. They 
joined with some Republicans to defeat the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a month that the background of one of  
Bush's supporters has become an issue. Last month, it was revealed 
that a host of a Bush fund-raiser in Florida was a businesswoman, 
Remedios Diaz Oliver, who pleaded guilty in a tax evasion case. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said he wasn't aware that Dyke was a weapons manufacturer  
when he was named chief fund-raiser for Maine. He declined to 
speculate on whether the businessman would have received the 
appointment if his background had been known. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke ``called me and told me he was aware there was some inquiry  
of his ownership and in no way did he want to be a distraction to 
the governor,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke's company's automatic rifles are similar to the military's  
M-16. The firm has advertised for sale civilian guns that the ads 
say were modified to get around ``the infamous'' 1994 ban on some 
types of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, as Congress was considering new gun control  
measures, Dyke was quoted as saying that child safety locks would 
be ``window dressing'' since they would only be sold with the guns, 
not attached to the weapons.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Cut Imperils Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Saying Americans should support lawmakers  
who ``think about the long run,'' President Clinton today promised 
to veto Republican tax cuts if they fail to devote a share of 
federal budget surpluses to bracing Medicare for the coming wave of 
baby-boomer retirees. 
</P>
<P>
	``No serious expert on Medicare believes we can stabilize  
Medicare without an infusion of new revenues,'' Clinton said during 
a public forum at a community college here. He mentioned a 
statement of support from 50 leading economists who advised against 
large tax cuts right now, and said Republican lawmakers should 
address the long-term needs of Americans who will need Medicare, 
rather than the immediate gratification of a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say, `I don't want to think about that. I want to think  
about today.' You have to think about that,'' Clinton said. ``This 
plan being voted on in Washington will not enable us to pay off our 
debt. It will not do anything to add to the life of Social Security 
and Medicare ... and I will veto it if it passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he figures ``it's easier for me'' to advocate spending  
surpluses on Medicare because he does not face re-election, but 
said members of Congress are not likely to suffer politically if 
they reject the GOP tax cut. ``I trust the American people support 
those people in public life who think about the long run, who tell 
them the truth,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton touted a finding that 75 percent of elderly Americans  
lack private-sector coverage for prescription drugs. ``It means we 
need coverage that is simple, voluntary, available to all and 
completely dependable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has proposed new, universal Medicare coverage for  
prescription drugs -- at a 10-year cost of $118 billion to taxpayers 
and a $24-a-month premium charge to beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the new benefit and buttress Medicare against the  
coming wave of baby boom retirements, Clinton wants to use $794 
billion in federal budget surpluses projected over the next 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders also have endorsed the idea of a Medicare  
drug benefit. But they are trying to earmark much of the future 
surplus for a $792 billion tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's Medicare drug plan is unnecessarily generous,  
Republicans argue, saying that about two-thirds of senior citizens 
already have some drug coverage -- mainly through corporate 
retirement packages, privately purchased insurance or HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	In its new study, the administration seeks to show that such  
private coverage is diminishing in value and accessibility as 
insurance prices rise and companies cut retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the 13 million Medicare beneficiaries  
currently going without drug coverage are middle class, with annual 
incomes between $20,000 and $50,000, according to the study based 
on surveys conducted by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those who do have coverage, 17 percent get it through  
government programs such as Medicaid or veterans benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three out of five HMOs that enroll Medicare beneficiaries  
will cap drug payments below $1,000 in 2000 -- an amount exceeded by 
the needs of 38 percent of elderly Americans, the administration 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the cost of adding drug coverage to private insurance  
policies, known as Medigap, that are sold to supplement Medicare, 
increases steeply as a person ages. For retirees living in 
Michigan, the average price more than doubles, from $44 a month at 
age 65 to $93 a month at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration study concludes that the only adequate and  
affordable private drug coverage currently available to the elderly 
comes from corporate retirement benefits enjoyed by about a quarter 
senior citizens. But the number of companies offering such benefits 
fell from 40 percent to 30 percent between 1994 and 1998, the study 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly America needs a prescription-drug plan that is simple,  
universal and voluntary,'' Clinton said. ``Anyone who says we 
don't, I believe, is out of date and out of touch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans support direct Medicare drug subsidies only for  
the poorest beneficiaries. Others could be helped less expensively 
through the private sector, they say. Tax breaks for those who buy 
private Medigap insurance that covers drugs are among options GOP 
leaders are considering.

<HEADLINE> Labonte Ready To Make Run at Pocono </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- If Bobby Labonte is to regain the momentum  
that carried him within striking distance of Winston Cup points 
leader Dale Jarrett, he's in the right place to start. 
</P>
<P>
	That alone demonstrates how far Labonte had come before  
accidents in two of his last three starts cost him nearly 200 
points. Until this year, the 35-year-old Texan would never think of 
Pocono International Raceway as a haven. 
</P>
<P>
	``We used to dread it, but now we're looking forward to it,''  
Labonte said of the triangle on the mountaintop where on Sunday 
he'll ride in the Pennsylvania 500. ``I'm more excited than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte has transformed his program into a major force on  
NASCAR's flat tracks. Five weeks ago he won the Pocono 500, his 
first career victory on a layout banked at less than 18 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a competitive race car all day last time,'' crew chief  
Jimmy Makar said. ``I'd like the same result without the excitement 
of different strategies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Labonte didn't mind, even though a decision to pit for fuel  
and four tires cost him several positions late in the race. He was 
23rd with 40 laps remaining, but outran Jarrett and Jeff Gordon for 
his ninth career victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was Jimmy's call, and it turned out to be the right  
one,'' Labonte said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory put Labonte in second place, just 89 points behind  
Jarrett. Now, following crashes in Sonoma, Calif., and Loudon, 
N.H., Labonte is fourth, 288 points back after 18 of 34 races. 
</P>
<P>
	The race in Sonoma, when Labonte charged from far back before  
crashing in the waning laps, was costly. But Makar emerged knowing 
his driver was now competing with race winner Gordon and the other 
road-course aces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things were starting to play out where it looked like we were  
going to have a shot at it,'' Makar said. 
</P>
<P>
	Labonte knows one bad turn can undo an afternoon of gains,  
something he isn't likely to forget Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the turns are critical at Pocono,'' he said of the  
2 1/2-mile track where each of the three corners presents a unique 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The first is banked at 14 degrees, the second at 8 and the third  
at 6. No one has ever claimed an ability to set up a car to run 
extremely well in all three. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon knows he'll have to be good in all of them if he is to  
defend his race title and get back in the championship picture. 
He's fifth, 389 points back, as he tries for a record-tying third 
straight series championship, but knows he's in a good place to 
begin his improbable run. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've just had an unbelievable amount of success at Pocono,''  
said Gordon, who last July led 164 or 200 laps in the Pennsylvania 
500. ``I always look forward to going to the tracks where I feel 
like we've got a good shot at winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 13 Pocono races, Gordon has three wins, two poles, seven top  
fives and 10 top-10s. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Gordon hasn't conceded the title to Jarrett, he  
realizes there is little he can do but run hard and try to win as 
often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Jarrett and his team continue this season the way that they  
have, nobody will be able to catch them,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	He bumped Jarrett on the final lap two weeks ago to finish  
third, leading to an exchange of words after the Jiffy Lube 300 at 
New Hampshire International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we just got caught up in the heat of the moment, but  
we talked again later before we left the track, and everything is 
fine,'' Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, a two-time Pocono winner, holds a season-best 240-point  
lead over Loudon winner Jeff Burton. He said his spat with Gordon 
will not carry over this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took a lot for him to walk over to someone who is a lot  
bigger than he is,'' said Jarrett, about 6 nches taller and perhaps 
50 pounds heavier than Gordon. ``It's over as far as I'm 
concerned.''

<HEADLINE> American Express Launches Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express has launched its own Internet  
bank, betting that a well-known brand name will persuade consumers 
to give up the security blanket of a local branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership Banking is the latest foray by a major financial  
company in a suddenly crowded market. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the leading U.S. banks have already provided their  
customers with Internet options for some time, supplementing their 
branch services with online access to account information, 
fund-transfer capabilities and electronic bill payment. 
</P>
<P>
	But recently there's been a push toward virtual, branchless  
banking, with the online broker ETrade acquiring Telebanc Financial 
for $1.6 billion and Bank One launching WingspanBank.com. 
</P>
<P>
	As it is, even with the explosive growth of e-commerce and  
online investing, most consumers are still somewhat hesitant about 
conducting financial transactions on the Internet, and even more so 
when it comes to managing their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report in June by Goldman Sachs, only as many as  
4 percent of U.S. households currently use online banking products. 
That number is expected to increase to about 20 percent by 2002, 
the investment firm projected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online banking is still in its infancy,'' said Kenneth  
Clemmer, an industry analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``My intuition is that there is a greater barrier here because  
of people's ingrained behavior,'' he said. ``Many people are used 
to dealing with bank in physical way. Almost all accounts still 
opened face-to-face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Express' new virtual bank, accessible by Internet,  
telephone, and cash machine, will feature the normal array of 
services, including savings, checking and money market accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other virtual banks, including industry leader Net.Bank,  
the new offering from American Express hopes to snare customers 
with compelling interest rates on savings and loans, as well as 
free, unlimited check-writing and electronic bill payment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Membership Banking's biggest advantage on the Internet may  
be an established customer base of 22 million corporate and 
consumer accounts using American Express charge and credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, more than a million of those consumer and corporate  
accounts already visit the company's Web site to manage their card 
accounts and use the company's travel services. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got a good trusted brand, which will make people feel  
better than going with some of the Internet brand banks,'' said 
Clemmer. ``There's a lot of people who won't feel comfortable 
without the stodgy financial brand.'' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
	The 223-208 roll call Thursday by which the House passed a  
Republican-backed 10-year $792 billion tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	A ``yes'' vote is a vote to approve the bill.

<HEADLINE> Heinz Sells Weight Watchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co. will sell its Weight Watchers  
diet classes for $735 million to a European firm, the latest step 
in the company's restructuring of its business. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale to a unit of Artal Luxembourg, S.A., does not include  
Weight Watchers' food business. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz said today that it will use $14 million of the proceeds  
from the sale to retain 6 percent equity interest in the diet class 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weight Watchers is the gold standard in the global weight  
control business, but its services orientation does not fit with 
Heinz' long-term food growth strategy,'' said president and chief 
executive officer William R. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is expected to close in about three months.  
</P>
<P>
	Heinz is in the middle of restructuring its businesses, with  
plans to concentrate on food products, including Heinz ketchup and 
Star-Kist tuna. In addition to today's sale, the company plans to 
cut as many as 4,000 jobs in the next four years and close some 
factories.

<HEADLINE> Brett Takes Broadcasting Hiatus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	George Brett's broadcasting career at Fox has lasted just nine  
games, but he has a pretty good excuse for going into 
semiretirement. 
</P>
<P>
	He's headed to Cooperstown.  
</P>
<P>
	Brett is being inducted in the Baseball Hall of Fame on Sunday,  
and ESPN will televise the ceremony live for the first time in four 
years. With all of the obligations and commitments that come with 
being inducted, Fox and the former Kansas City Royals infielder 
decided it was best he take this season off. 
</P>
<P>
	It was exactly one year ago that Brett began his brief tenure  
with Fox, showing up for his debut in Colorado not knowing a soul 
on Fox's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``He shows up with the Billy Bob Thornton or Austin Powers fake  
teeth,'' said his broadcast partner, Josh Lewin. ``The producers 
were terrified. Within a few weeks, he had us all wearing the 
teeth. He actually took impressions of our teeth and had them 
molded so they wouldn't fall out of our mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luckily for Fox and fans, Brett will be back next year. He calls  
a game with the same type of enthusiasm with which he played, and 
he has the looks to succeed on TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett is the primary reason ESPN chose to televise the event  
live in a 2 1/2 hour show -- the longest broadcast in 15 years -- 
beginning at 1 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's class is quite a group: Brett, Nolan Ryan, Robin  
Yount and Orlando Cepeda. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of the best, if not the best, in my lifetime,'' said  
Hall of Famer Don Sutton, who was inducted last year and is an 
analyst for Braves games on TBS. 
</P>
<P>
	``George Brett epitomizes a Hall of Famer. He exhibited the joy  
of playing the game to a level like Mickey Mantle and Ted 
Williams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brett, Ryan and Yount were voted in on their first year of  
eligibility. Sutton didn't get voted in until his fifth year, and 
he believes the voting procedure should be changed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sutton didn't have an ideal solution.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's somewhat flawed because sometimes it becomes a  
popularity contest,'' Sutton said. ``Some writers haven't earned 
the right to dictate how great a career is. There are guys in there 
with less credentials than Tommy John, Bert Blyleven and Jim 
Kaat.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TOURING:* This is Adrian Karsten's sixth Tour de France, and  
he's finally starting to grasp it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me about five years to really understand all of it,''  
said Karsten, who anchors the race for ESPN on weeknights and ABC 
on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have anything like this in the United States,''  
Karsten said. ``We pay astronomical prices to go to arenas, but 
here the Tour just comes to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karsten said the most difficult task is trying to tailor the  
ESPN telecasts for diehard racing fans and casual viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	If Lance Armstrong still has a sizable lead of about six minutes  
going into Sunday's final stage, he'll be the first American winner 
of the race since Greg LeMond won in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's that far ahead, which he will probably be, that final  
day is a coronation rather than a competition,'' Karsten said. 
``The other racers don't just let him go, but it's a given. It's as 
much tradition as anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CUBAN TRACKING:* TNT reporter Craig Sager never imagined his  
trip to cover the U.S. team in the Olympic qualifying tournament in 
Puerto Rico would be so interesting. 
</P>
<P>
	Sager got the only interview with the four Cuban basketball  
players who defected -- and he spoke to Cuban Basketball Federation 
President Ruperto Herrara, who is the father of one of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``An anonymous woman called me on Tuesday and told me to meet  
them at the third toll booth, and she'll be in a red Mirage car,'' 
Sager said. ``We met at a phone booth, she and her daughter drove 
me down small roads into an apartment complex to a beach town 
called Durado, and I went into a room and they were all sitting 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sager said that he took a videotaped message back to the arena  
to Herrara from his son, who said he was not coerced into 
defecting.

<HEADLINE> Internet Group Defends Itself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A top official with the private organization  
assuming the future management of the Internet is defending the 
group's decisions to skeptical members of Congress who are unhappy 
months into the process. 
</P>
<P>
	In what's become a tumultuous power struggle affecting the  
increasingly critical network, the federal government is in the 
midst of largely handing over management to the California-based 
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	For years, a Virginia-based company, Network Solutions Inc., has  
coordinated the most important functions under a lucrative, 
exclusive contract. It's registered more than 5 million Internet 
addresses ending in the ``com'', ``net'' and ``org'' suffixes. 
</P>
<P>
	The interim chairwoman of ICANN's directors, Esther Dyson,  
planned to testify today at a hearing before the House Commerce 
oversight subcommittee. The panel dubbed the hearing ``Is ICANN out 
of control?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dyson is seeking to assuage lawmakers by promising to defer a  
controversial fund-raising plan to charge companies and consumers 
$1 for each Internet address they register. 
</P>
<P>
	The chairman of the Commerce Committee, Republican Tom Bliley,  
earlier accused the group of ``imposing a tax on the Internet 
behind closed doors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``ICANN must have a stable source of income,'' Dyson said in  
prepared written testimony. ``The United States Government has 
asked ICANN to do an important job, but it has not provided the 
means by which to carry it out, leaving the job of providing funds 
to the Internet community itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dyson also promised that ICANN's August meeting -- but not  
necessarily future meetings afterward -- will be open to the public. 
The group's previous closed-door meetings have also fueled 
criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dyson, in her prepared statement to lawmakers, urged  
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Transitions from monopoly to competition are difficult and  
messy under the best of circumstances,'' she said, warning that 
Network Solutions ``should not be permitted to unilaterally 
determine how this important global resource will be managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chief executive officer for Network Solutions, Jim Rutt,  
complained in his prepared testimony that ICANN was ``off track,'' 
arguing that ``there is no need for a new global government for the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions is based in Virginia, the home state to the  
Commerce Committee's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current plans, Network Solutions utlimately will compete  
with others registering most of the world's Internet addresses -- 
which cost roughly $35 annually to license -- but will continue to 
maintain the network's master list of addresses, called its 
registry. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incumbent continues to thwart the process,'' argued Ken  
Stubbs of the Internet Council of Registrars, a group comprised of 
companies that will compete with Network Solutions. ``... NSI will 
still be the big kid on the block, but it must allow the new kids 
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America Online Inc., which also will compete with Network  
Solutions assigning Internet addresses, is urging Congress to let 
the disparate groups work out their own problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that an untried, yet-to-be determined alternative  
to ICANN's leadership would merely slow down a train that has not 
only left the station, but is nearing its destination,'' said James 
Bramson, an AOL lawyer who also was scheduled to testify today. 
``... Legislative action is presently unneeded.''

<HEADLINE> Saudi Princess Bids for Denver Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway faces some unusual competition in his  
bid to buy Denver's NHL and NBA teams -- a Saudi princess. 
</P>
<P>
	An investment bank is brokering the sale of the Denver Nuggets,  
the Colorado Avalanche and the Pepsi Center. Four formal offers 
were received Wednesday -- one from a group that includes the former 
Broncos quarterback and another from Princess Thara al Saud of 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her bid was formally presented. She complied with the bid  
requirements,'' said Charles Grantham, a former NBA union head and 
the sports business adviser of the princess. ``She's in it to win 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The princess was born in the United States and is the widow of  
Prince Mohammed Abdul Aziz, a nephew of King Fahd who died in a 
plane crash 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Grantham said the princess had met with representatives of  
another recent retiree -- Michael Jordan -- in an attempt to interest 
him in investing in her bid. But he said there had been no response 
from the former Chicago Bulls great. 
</P>
<P>
	David Falk, Jordan's agent, said reports that Jordan might join  
the princess' bid are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is a minority partner in a group led by Denver financier  
Bjorn Erik Borgen. The group also includes former ski mogul George 
Gillett. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good group of people he is dealing with and a great  
business venture,'' said Elway's business manager, Jeff Sperbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other investor groups are bidding for the sports properties  
of Ascent Entertainment Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	A group led by Colorado banker Donald Sturm, whose earlier bid  
for Ascent was rebuffed, and a group led Snapple beverage magnate 
Nelson Peltz would not say Wednesday if they were among the 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent, a publicly held Denver corporation, agreed in March to  
sell the Nuggets, the Avalanche and the Pepsi Center -- which is 
being built for the NBA and NHL teams -- to Bill Laurie and Wal-Mart 
heiress Nancy Walton Laurie for $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But that deal was sidelined after Ascent shareholders filed  
lawsuits asserting the price was below market value and that former 
Ascent chairman Charlie Lyons cut a sweetheart deal for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties to the lawsuits, including the Lauries, agreed to  
set aside the sale and sell the assets at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent is expected to announce the investment group with the  
best bid next week, and that group is to compete with the Lauries 
in a two-party auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The princess and Grantham spoke with Nuggets general manager Dan  
Issel and Avalanche general manager Pierre LaCroix this week. She 
would retain both men to run the teams, and Grantham would become 
chief executive officer of her sports operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerian Butler Smith III, chairman of Ashland Capital Holdings  
in New York and Saud's principal investment manager, said her 
holdings include telecommunications companies, gas stations and an 
Italian women's pro basketball team.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Three years of lost Sundays and life without  
pro football is finally over -- the Cleveland Browns are back in 
pads and back in town. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns opened preseason training camp today for the  
first time since the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of about 35 players -- rookies and a few selected  
veterans -- were ready for their first morning workout under coach 
Chris Palmer. The rest of the team's players will have their first 
formal workout on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven drift picks, receiver Kevin Johnson, linebacker Wali  
Rainer, wide receiver Darrin Chiaverini, defensive lineman Marcus 
Spriggs, linebacker Kendall Ogle, tight end James Dearth and 
running back Madre Hill, reached contract agreements Wednesday. 
Only draft picks Rahim Abdullah, a linebacker, and cornerback 
Daylon McCutcheon, were unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	While the team has had four minicamps, those were padless  
sessions with little contact. But now touch football is over and 
there will be a new sense of urgency on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 90 players who will strap on orange helmets Sunday,  
nearly half will be cut before Cleveland's regular season opener 
game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sept. 12.

<HEADLINE> A Look at Columbia's Astronauts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Air Force Col. Eileen Collins is the first woman to command a  
U.S. space mission. A brief look at Collins and the four other 
astronauts flying with her aboard Columbia: 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Eileen Collins has been shattering records her entire  
flying career. She was the Air Force's second female test pilot and 
NASA's first female space shuttle pilot. Now she's the first female 
shuttle commander. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really want to do a good job, not because I'm a woman, but  
because I'm so dedicated to this mission,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Air Force colonel from Elmira, N.Y., worked her  
way through college. The odd jobs also paid for flying lessons. She 
went on to become a T-38 instructor pilot and a C-141 aircraft 
commander, then taught math at the Air Force Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA chose her as its first female shuttle pilot in 1990. She  
flew in space in 1995 and in 1997, both times as co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	She's married to an airline pilot and has a 3 1/2-year-old  
daughter, Bridget. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Jeffrey Ashby should have made his first space flight two  
years ago, but gave up his seat on the mission to care for his 
dying wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Diana Ashby died of melanoma cancer in 1997 at age 33.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would say very clearly that was the most challenging and  
rewarding event in my life, and STS-93 (this mission) will be the 
second most challenging and rewarding event,'' says the 45-year-old 
Navy captain. 
</P>
<P>
	He took up a T-shirt bearing the logo of the cancer research  
foundation his wife established. 
</P>
<P>
	The former test pilot, who grew up in Evergreen, Colo., flew 33  
combat missions during Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s. 
NASA chose him as an astronaut in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Lt. Col. Catherine Coleman was given the job of  
flipping the switch to release the Chandra X-ray Observatory from 
Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second space shuttle flight for the 38-year-old  
Coleman, who has a Ph.D. in polymer science and engineering. She 
became an astronaut in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	She's married to prominent glass artist Josh Simpson.  
</P>
<P>
	``People give us a hard time because he makes paperweights  
called Planets and I like to go to them,'' she says. ``But in a 
way, if you think about it, somebody who has the imagination to do 
that kind of artwork would also understand why someone else would 
like to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He would ``love to be in my shoes on this mission,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	She was born in Charleston, S.C.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Astronomer Steven Hawley has lots of experience with orbiting  
observatories. He deployed the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 
helped repair it seven years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Now here he is, flying with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a kid, I was interested in science and I thought  
about being an astronaut,'' says Hawley, 47. ``But astronauts were 
all military test plots and I didn't want to be a military test 
pilot. I wanted to be a scientist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's astronaut corps eventually opened its doors to scientists  
and chose Hawley in 1978. Besides flying in space five times, 
Hawley has served as deputy director of flight crew operations. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the flight engineer aboard Columbia, and is from Salina,  
Kan. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	French astronaut Michel Tognini has already flown on Mir. Now  
he's getting a taste of space shuttle flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old colonel in the French Air Force and former  
fighter pilot grew up with planes. His family worked for Air 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the risk is maybe higher than being a fighter pilot,''  
he says of space flight. But the odds improve, he notes, with every 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tognini was selected as an astronaut by the French Space Agency  
in 1985. Seven years later, he was launched aboard a Russian Soyuz 
rocket and spent two weeks conducting experiments aboard the Mir 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
	He is married to a Russian he met while training in Moscow and  
has four children, aged 6 to 24.

<HEADLINE> Police: Teens Forced into Overdose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Three teen-agers were in critical condition  
after a woman confined to a wheelchair forced them at knifepoint to 
swallow handfuls of her prescription drugs, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Felicia Chapman, 24, was charged with distribution of controlled  
substances, reckless endangerment and attempted murder, said 
Detective Tom Walsh. She was being held Thursday pending 
arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The sheriff's office did not identify the teens, ages 14 to 16.  
</P>
<P>
	Walsh said Ms. Chapman's home had become a hangout place for  
neighborhood teen-agers since she moved in July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to the house, about 17 miles northeast of  
Baltimore, early Thursday by two teens who said Ms. Chapman told 
them to carry an unconscious boy to a trash bin. Instead, the 
teen-agers carried him to a field and ran away, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputies found two other unconscious teen-agers in the house, as  
well as significant quantities of prescription drugs such as 
morphine and muscle relaxants with Ms. Chapman's name on the label, 
Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two teen-agers who called the sheriff's office said Ms.  
Chapman threatened them with a knife, saying ``her boy'' would kill 
them if they didn't take the pills, Walsh said. The teen-agers, who 
had ingested some of the drugs, refused to say whom Ms. Chapman was 
referring to. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear why Ms. Chapman was confined to a wheelchair.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Sign No. 1 Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Two days before the start of training camp, the  
Denver Broncos reached agreement with first-round draft choice Al 
Wilson on a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacker's agent, William ``Tank'' Black, told The  
Associated Press on Wednesday that the five-year deal was for 
``more than $5 million,'' including a $1.7 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working on the contract for a while, but we really  
had no problems with it,'' Black said. ``Denver is a first-class 
organization. We're pleased to get it done before training camp. 
We've represented over 100 players and haven't had a player miss 
camp since 1988.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post reported today that Wilson's contract is for  
$5.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time defending Super Bowl champion Broncos open camp on  
Friday, when players report to Greeley, Colo. The first workouts 
are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos still have two remaining unsigned draft choices,  
third-rounder Travis McGriff and fifth-rounder David Bowens. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, a team captain, helped lead Tennessee to a 13-0 record  
and the national championship last season. He recorded 77 tackles, 
54 of them solo, with four sacks and six tackles for losses. He 
forced five fumbles, recovered two, and deflected three passes, 
intercepting another. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11 1/2, 239-pound Wilson, called a relentless competitor  
by scouts, started at outside linebacker his sophomore and junior 
seasons before moving to middle linebacker as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the 31st and last choice in the first round.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is one of four former Volunteers on the Broncos' roster,  
joining Trey Teague, Marcus Nash and Tori Noel.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Liggett Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Tobacco maker Liggett Group Inc. has lost a  
bid to head off future lawsuits by sick smokers by creating a fund 
that would pay $1 million annually for claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Mobile County Circuit Judge Robert Kendall on Thursday refused  
to OK the agreement, reached with attorneys representing smokers 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall pointed to a Supreme Court decision that set aside a  
$1.5 billion settlement involving Fibreboard Corp. and 
asbestos-related claims. That ruling set strict standards for 
settlements that apply to all potential plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Liggett, which provided key evidence in the  
national tobacco settlement, had told the judge that bankruptcy 
loomed if the settlement were denied. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after the ruling, spokesman Paul Caminiti said the  
company was reviewing its options but ``absolutely not considering 
bankruptcy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett, the smallest of the five major tobacco firms with about  
2 percent of the business, disclosed key documents on the 
addictiveness of nicotine and gave unprecedented cooperation in 
tobacco litigation that led to the nationwide settlement with state 
attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, Liggett would have paid an amount  
equal to 7.5 percent of its sales in each of the next 25 years into 
a fund that would be earmarked for victims who have smoked its 
cigarettes, such as L&AMP;M, Lark and Chesterfield. The fund would be 
guaranteed payments of $1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also would have limited the amount Liggett would  
have paid to people claiming harm from its cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Blue Cross, union health funds and others involved  
in tobacco litigation opposed the settlement, saying the company 
was in fine financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
	After state attorneys general sued cigarette makers to recover  
the costs of treating sick smokers, Liggett broke with the industry 
by settling with several states and disclosing key documents on the 
addictiveness of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Liggett's parent company sold its L&AMP;M, Lark and  
Chesterfield brands to Philip Morris for $300 million. That leaves 
the company with Eve as its only remaining premium brand of 
cigarettes.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Flooding Displaces 1,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAVERLY, Iowa (AP) -- About 1,500 people remained out of their  
homes Thursday as the surging waters of the Cedar River flooded 65 
city blocks of this northeast Iowa town. 
</P>
<P>
	Waverly was cut in two as the river crested in the morning at  
just over 21 feet -- 2 feet higher than the previous record set in 
1993. As many as 650 homes and a dozen downtown businesses were 
affected. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've lived here since 1954 and this is about the fourth time  
it's been flooded. This is the worst it's ever been, though,'' said 
Liz McKenzie, moments after wading through knee-deep water to 
retrieve some ice cream from her kitchen freezer. 
</P>
<P>
	Her white, two-story house was surrounded by dirty, brown river  
water that had washed over and through the sandbags stacked around 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Electricity in Waverly, a town of 8,500, was shut off and  
residents were told to lock their doors when they were evacuated 
Wednesday night. City engineer Mike Cherry said about 200,000 
sandbags had been placed around town and at the city's water and 
sewage plant facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The water is not expected to recede until at least the weekend.  
Cedar Falls, Waterloo and other cities downriver were expected to 
take the worst of the floods Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Iowa was also under a heat advisory through Friday, with  
heat indices -- taking into account both heat and humidity -- 
reaching up to 110 degrees.

<HEADLINE> Iowa Residents Battle Floodwaters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENE, Iowa (AP) -- The crowd of sweaty volunteers stopped  
filling sandbags and gathered at the town's tiny fire station for 
an announcement from a deputy fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``The light at the end of the tunnel has just broke open and it  
appears we're going to be OK,'' Mitch Nordmeyer said Wednesday in 
this north-central Iowa community of 1,100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the town's homes were spared from the raging Winnebago  
River by the sandbagging effort, but about a dozen businesses were 
flooded. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 miles away along the Cedar River, about 100 homes in  
Charles City were damaged and dozens more had flooded basements 
after up to 8 inches of rain brought record flooding. 
</P>
<P>
	The river crested Wednesday at 23 feet, more than a foot higher  
than the record floods of 1993, Fire Chief Roy Schwickerath said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we had sandbagged got washed out from two different  
directions,'' said Charles City Mayor James Erb. 
</P>
<P>
	In some instances, the makeshift berms trapped the rain.  
</P>
<P>
	``The sandbags were so beautifully done that when it rained the  
water came off our roof and backed up into our house. It was like a 
pool,'' said Margaret Carroll, who has lived near the river since 
1960. 
</P>
<P>
	More flooding was expected downstream at Cedar Falls and  
Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Ebling, 44, of Greene was covered in sweat after five hours  
of sandbagging in 95-degree, humid conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked why he was helping, he managed to blurt out, ``I went  
to school here,'' as he tried to catch his breath.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Stock Down on Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com's stock was down 15 1/16, or 12  
percent, at 110 3/8 in mid-morning after the giant Internet 
retailer reported that its losses widened in the second quarter as 
it increased its spending to expand its online businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	While Amazon.com reported a steep loss in the quarter, its sales  
grew by 171 percent from a year ago and the company's customer base 
rose by 2.3 million to 10.7 million, three times larger than what 
it was in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its earnings report, which was released after the close  
of markets Wednesday, Amazon.com also announced that its board had 
approved a 2-for-1 stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company's stock was down $13.31 1/4 at $112.12 1/2  
in early trading today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Amazon.com lost $138 million, or 86 cents a share,  
in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $22.6 million 
or 15 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding $55.2 million of merger, acquisition,  
investment-related costs and stock-based compensation charges, the 
loss was $82.8 million or $0.51 per share. That matched the 
earnings' estimates of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter grew to $314.4 million, up from $116  
million a year earlier. Since the start of its fiscal year, sales 
are $608 million -- just $2 million short of what its total sales 
were for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	While Amazon.com has yet to turn a profit in its four years in  
business, the company hasn't stopped spending money to make itself 
into a more diversified online retailer and expand its customer 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 14 months, the company has gone from being  
exclusively an online bookseller into an Internet shopping hub 
offering music, videos, auctions and electronic greeting cards. 
Just last week, Amazon.com added toys and electronics to its site. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also has also invested millions of dollars in recent  
months in online pharmacy drugstore.com, Internet pet shop 
Pets.com, cybersupermarket HomeGrocer.com and online sporting goods 
store Gear.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that 70 percent of its orders in the second  
quarter came from repeat customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com said it will continue to expand its distribution  
systems and product offerings. In addition, the company plans to 
add more personnel. More than 4,000 people now work for the 
4-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
	The online retailer also said it expects to invest more heavily  
in its operations this year than it has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1999, Amazon.com had a loss of  
$199.7 million or $1.26 a share. That compares with a loss of $32.9 
million or 23 cents a share on net sales of $203.3 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding merger and acquisition, investment and stock-based  
compensation costs, Amazon.com lost $119.1 million, or 75 cents a 
share, in the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock split will occur on Sept. 1 for shareholders of record  
on Aug. 12. The last stock split was 3-for-1 in January.

<HEADLINE> Debt Trigger Might Shape Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An unusual trigger, based on whether interest  
on the national debt rises or falls, would determine whether 
Americans get an income tax cut beginning in 2002 under the tax 
bill passed Thursday by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	In an effort to appease debt-hawk Republican moderates, GOP  
leaders picked up on a proposal by Rep. Nick Smith, R-Mich., to 
condition the gradual 10 percent cut in income tax rates on whether 
the annual interest expense on the debt is going down. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea drew an endorsement Thursday from Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who told a House committee that ``a 
trigger is a very useful device'' in deciding how to use projected 
surplus money. 
</P>
<P>
	The national debt is the government's $5.6 trillion IOU,  
accumulated through two centuries of borrowing. It includes money 
the government owes itself when it borrows from the Social Security 
account for other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the national debt, about $3.7 trillion, is held by  
the public -- banks, businesses, pension funds and people -- in the 
form of Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the House bill, the 10 percent income tax cut would occur  
in annual increments until fully in effect in 2009. Beginning in 
2002, whether taxpayers get those installments would depend on 
whether the interest expense on the debt had dropped by July 31 the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of this approach say it would put political pressure  
on Congress to choose between paying down the debt or additional 
government spending, because tax cuts are difficult to rescind. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are saying is that you don't sacrifice debt reduction  
for tax relief,'' said Rep. Charles Bass, R-N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there are few parallels to such a trigger in the tax  
code, the Internal Revenue Service does adjust the tax rates each 
year in October based on consumer price index changes as of Aug. 
31. 
</P>
<P>
	One twist is that because the trigger is based on interest  
expenses on the debt, changes in interest rates would have some 
affect. That means the Federal Reserve's actions to control 
inflation might help determine if people get their tax cut.

<HEADLINE> Crowds Swell To Remember Kennedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The pile of flowers, notes and candles left  
outside John F. Kennedy Jr.'s apartment grew so large that some 
bouquets were removed and given to charities and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	A seemingly endless stream of mourners, however, are bringing  
more tokens of remembrance to the building in the trendy downtown 
Manhattan neighborhood of Tribeca. Many described Kennedy as one of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was alive, doing OUR stuff -- roller-blading, going to a  
Yankee game,'' said Mike Caffey, 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people have left flowers, prayer cards, candles,  
notes, poems, balloons and newspaper clippings at the site since 
Saturday. Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn, and her sister, Lauren 
Bessette, died Friday in a plane crash off the Massachusetts coast. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate shrine of cards and flowers grew outside the  
Manhattan office building where Kennedy's magazine, George, is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinah Lopera of Phoenix said she and her family flew to New York  
just to keep a vigil. She left a note at the apartment, saying: 
``God bless you. We've always been with you and your family, and we 
will always be with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other notes included these messages: ``Love always from Israel''  
and ``Descansen en paz'' -- Spanish for ``rest in peace.'' A Thai 
restaurant where Kennedy liked to get takeout sent a tall wreath 
with a menu attached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish flag was taped to the building, along with the Irish  
Echo newspaper's front-page headline: ``Good night, sweet prince.'' 
The city's Irish community planned a public memorial tonight at a 
Manhattan church. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanny Salvador left a tiny wooden airplane, a card with the  
names of every Latin American country printed on it and this 
message: ``A prayer for John, from all Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were so nice to all of us,'' she said. ``President  
Kennedy helped the poor people and the developing countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Russell, 35, a black woman from Washington, D.C.,  
visited the shrine with four cousins. ``His family did so much for 
African-Americans -- it's the Kennedy name,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Disney Earnings Better Than Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co.'s earnings rose 1  
percent in the third quarter as weaker sales of merchandise and 
high programming costs cut into gains in home video and theme park 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney earned $418 million in the three months ended June 30  
compared to $415 million in the same period a year ago. Per-share 
earnings were unchanged at 20 cents, meeting the average forecast 
of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings exclude costs associated with Disney's November  
1998 acquisition of a 43 percent interest in Infoseek Corp. 
Counting Infoseek, earnings fell to $367 million, or 18 cents per 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 5 percent to $5.52 billion from $5.25 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	``While were are not satisfied with our current operating  
trends, we firmly believe in the long-term strength and growth 
potential of the company's brands and franchises,'' Michael Eisner, 
Disney's chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney shares fell 18 3/4 cents Tuesday to close at $27 on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's third-quarter performance was hurt by a drop in sales  
of merchandise at stores in the United States and Japan, higher 
programming costs for its ABC television network and lower 
advertising revenues at network-owned television stations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no quick fix,'' said Jessica Reif Cohen, an analyst  
with Merrill Lynch. ``They are focusing their energy on fixing the 
stores, but it could take several quarters. Those things don't turn 
around that quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She cut her forecast for Disney earnings per share in fiscal  
2000 from 80 cents to 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	The company benefitted from the strong theatrical release of the  
animated feature ``Tarzan,'' and from stronger home video sales 
boosted by the video release of ``A Bug's Life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Theme park revenues rose 14 percent to $1.7 billion thanks to  
higher guest spending and attendance at Walt Disney World in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	The lackluster earnings came during a quarter in which Eisner  
and other top executives were distracted by a bitter legal fight 
with former Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg. Katzenberg 
claimed in a lawsuit that Disney owned him as much as $580 million 
as a bonus for projects he worked on before leaving Disney in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial ended with a privately negotiated settlement that  
could give Katzenberg well over $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In his statement, Eisner noted that Disney is in the process of  
cutting costs and has announced streamling of its television, home 
video and merchandizing businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taking some costs out of the business is something that needs  
to be done. Basically, we think Disney has some great assets. We 
just think it will take a little time for them to get back on 
track,'' said Linda Bannister, an analyst with Edward Jones. ``It 
could take longer than we thought. We thought that at this point, 
we would start to see some resumption in earnings growth, but that 
in fact is not going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bannister said she expects earnings to improve in 2000, but  
noted that analysts' estimates for 1999 have been revised downward 
several times. ``As we get closer to 2000, we'll have a better 
gauge on what's going to happen,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of its fiscal year, Disney earned  
$1.22 billion, or 59 cents per share, compared to $1.55 billion, or 
76 cents per share during the first three quarters of 1998. 
Excluding the Infoseek deal, which included a gain in the first 
quarter, earnings for the nine months fell 26 percent.

<HEADLINE> Girl Released After Brain Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A teen-ager who had half of her brain removed  
to stem the spread of a deadly neurological disease was released 
from Johns Hopkins Children's Center on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber Ramirez was transferred to Mount Washington Pediatrics  
Hospital in Baltimore where she will begin physical and speech 
therapy to recover some of the functions she lost when surgeons 
removed the left half of her brain on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Amber can stand with assistance and walk with a brace on her  
right leg. She's not yet talking, but is expected to do so soon, 
her surgeon, Dr. Benjamin Carson, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal for Amber is to have her be able to walk  
independently and be able to speak normally,'' Carson said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15-year-old girl underwent a nine-hour operation to remove  
the side of her brain being ravaged by Rasmussen's syndrome, which 
eats away at brain tissue, causing severe seizures. 
</P>
<P>
	She will be able to return to her home in Lincoln, Neb., in two  
or three weeks where she will continue rehabilitation on an 
outpatient basis, Carson said.

<HEADLINE> House Approves Defense Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a $266 billion defense  
budget Thursday without money to buy the next generation of stealth 
fighter jets that the Air Force considers critical to future U.S. 
air superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., led a parade of House members in support  
of full funding for the radar-evading F-22 but never called for a 
vote to restore $1.8 billion deleted by House appropriators. 
</P>
<P>
	Removing the money because of concern over rising F-22 costs  
gives the House leverage in its negotiations with the Senate over 
the final defense budget. Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday he would seek a 
compromise on F-22 funding to continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the Appropriations  
subcommittee that first cut the F-22 money, promised carefully to 
consider the funding in conference with the Senate, where the F-22 
has strong support. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, we will do everything that is necessary  
to make certain there is no nation that will threaten us in 
tactical air (capability) in the future,'' Lewis promised. 
</P>
<P>
	With little debate on major provisions of the defense bill, the  
House voted 379-45 to approve it. Rep. Sue Myrick, R-N.C., called 
it ``a bill that will allow us to rest a little easier at night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would give 1.4 million active duty personnel a 4.8  
percent pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
	It also adds $592 million for recruiting and for programs aimed  
at keeping personnel in the military. All of the services have been 
falling short of recruiting goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Money from the F-22 would be diverted to other programs,  
including buying more F-15 and F-16 fighters and KC-130J air tanker 
planes that were not in the Clinton administration's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the cut in F-22 funding sends a message to the  
military. The bill retains $1.2 billion for research and 
development connected with the F-22. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Air Force has such tremendous needs in so many other areas  
-- air tankers, airlift transports, aerial reconnaissance -- that we 
believe it is imperative for the Air Force to reassess its 
priorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the only amendment approved on the House floor, high caliber  
ammunition used by the military would be banned from sale to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, offered by Rep. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill, came in  
response to a General Accounting Office report last month that some 
100,000 rounds designed for long-range military sniper weapons -- 
able to pierce armored limousines or bulletproof glass -- wound up 
in civilian hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon contracts with a West Virginia company to dispose  
of surplus and obsolete ammunition, and Talon Manufacturing 
dismantled 98 percent of the rounds for scrap. But it also 
refurbished the remaining 2 percent and offered them for sale, 
including to foreign military and civilian buyers, the report said. 
The report acknowledged that no laws were being violated by the 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force says any pause in planned F-22 production --  
building of the first six production-line planes was to begin next 
year -- would kill a $200 million-plus aircraft crucial to its 
long-term defense strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	An Appropriations Committee report accompanying the bill says  
the military appears unable to control the F-22's rising costs and 
can maintain a 5-1 advanced fighter advantage through 2010 without 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen promised Thursday to work with  
Capitol Hill on complaints of Pentagon misspending in the same 
report. ``We're bound to have some deficiencies,'' he acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	The report accuses the Defense Department of spending money on  
canceled programs and illegally redirecting other funds. Cohen said 
its conclusions are misleading.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Ump: No Choice But To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- One of major league baseball's most  
experienced umpires says league officials gave he and colleagues no 
choice but to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Kaiser, 53, said the commissioner's office was considering  
getting rid of 20 umpires after this season. The 23-year American 
League veteran told his hometown newspaper that the league had no 
valid reason to let umpires go. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many jobs can you get fired (from) without a valid  
reason?'' Kaiser said in today's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 
``We were good enough to get up here and we aren't any worse now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By resigning, the umpires would be eligible for more than $15  
million in severance pay. As one of the 10 most senior umpires, 
Kaiser said he would get around $400,000. If fired, an umpire gets 
no severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the circumstances, what would you or anyone else do?''  
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Major League Baseball has given the umpires until Friday to  
rescind their resignations or face the prospect of losing their 
jobs permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know much of the public and media think we're the bad  
guys,'' Kaiser told the newspaper. ``So why can't the good guys 
(Major League Baseball) deal with us fairly? 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us want a work stoppage,'' he added. ``We love the  
game. But we have to protect our livelihood and provide for our 
families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-three of the 66 unionized major league umpires quit last  
week, effective Sept. 2, but five are known to have changed their 
minds. As many as 10 more may be withdrawing their resignations, 
baseball officials said, but umpires said baseball may be 
exaggerating the number to sway wavering umps.

	Storms Delay Columbia Launch  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The launch of space shuttle Columbia  
with Eileen Collins, the first woman to lead a U.S. space flight, 
was scrapped for a second time this week. Thunderstorms prevented 
today's early morning blast off. NASA said it will try again early 
Friday. If Columbia isn't off the ground by then, the mission will 
have to be delayed until mid-August. The first launch attempt, on 
Tuesday, ended seven seconds before liftoff when a dangerous 
hydrogen buildup was detected in the engine compartment. It turned 
out to be a false alarm.

	AQUINNAH, Mass. (AP) -- The bodies of John F. Kennedy Jr., his  
wife and sister-in-law were found in the wreckage of Kennedy's 
plane Wednesday, and his family prepared to return him to the sea 
for burial. The victims' families endured a painful, five-day vigil 
before the three bodies were finally brought to the shore of Cape 
Cod and taken to the medical examiner's office for autopsies. A 
Navy destroyer, the USS Briscoe, was headed to Cape Cod for 
Kennedy's burial at sea at 9 a.m. Thursday, sources said. Kennedy 
flew the plane with his wife, Carolyn, and her sister Lauren 
Bessette, when it crashed Friday night.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers want more farmers to protect  
themselves from bad weather and drops in commodity prices by 
purchasing federally subsidized crop insurance. The House 
Agriculture risk management subcommittee on Wednesday approved 
legislation that would substantially lower the premiums, doubling 
the cost of the insurance program to taxpayers to about $3 billion 
a year. Many farmers have traditionally declined to buy crop 
insurance because they felt the premiums were too high.

<HEADLINE> No McNown as Bears Arrive at Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- It's time for training camp for the  
Chicago Bears and that means one thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-round draft pick is a no-show.  
</P>
<P>
	While the rest of the Bears settled in to their dormitory rooms  
Thursday at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville -- center Olin 
Kreutz brought a television and most of his teammates were toting 
their own pillows -- quarterback Cade McNown was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly a great start for the Dick Jauron era, especially  
after the Bears waived veteran quarterback Erik Kramer two days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'd like to get him signed and get him here  
tomorrow,'' the first-year coach said. ``He needs the work. He 
needs to see all the things that can happen, and he needs to see it 
on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big-time draft picks who show up late for camp are a little too  
familiar for the Bears. Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam missed 
the first two weeks of camp in 1995 and barely knew the playbook by 
the time the season started. He ended up rushing for 1,074 yards, 
but also fumbled nine times. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Enis, picked fifth overall last year, missed almost all  
of training camp in an acrimonious holdout. He had a lot of work to 
make up by the time he finally arrived, and not just on the field. 
Holdouts don't usually go over well when the rest of the team is 
running around in heavy pads in hot, sticky weather a couple of 
hours from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cade is going to make his bed. He's going to make his bed nice  
and soft, or he's going to make it hard,'' Enis said. ``But he's 
going to have to lay on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made my bed hard, and I had to lay on it,'' he said. ``Cade  
holds his destiny in his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown won't officially be a holdout until the first practice  
Friday morning, but the fact he hasn't signed yet makes the timing 
of Kramer's release all the more baffling. Picked 12th overall in 
this year's draft, it's no secret McNown is Chicago's future. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if McNown is ready to start by the time the season  
begins, he still needs a solid backup. The Bears should know that 
better than any team. When Kramer got hurt last year -- he missed 
the last eight games with shoulder and neck injuries -- there was no 
one who could adequately replace him. Rick Mirer was long gone, cut 
before training camp ended, Steve Stenstrom was ineffective and 
Moses Moreno was just a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened? The Bears lost seven of their last eight games,  
finished 4-12 for a second straight season and Dave Wannstedt was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears have three other quarterbacks on their roster --  
Moreno, Shane Matthews and Jim Miller -- but they have a whopping 
two NFL starts between them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any reason to pursue the Erik Kramer  
thing any further,'' Jauron said. ``We told him as early as we made 
the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears can't just sit around and wait for McNown to show up,  
so the other three quarterbacks will get plenty of work. Other than 
that, camp will proceed as planned, Jauron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-a-days start Friday morning, and Jauron planned to meet with  
the team Thursday night. McNown's absence wasn't going to be part 
of the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to make it sound like I've been around a long  
time,'' he said. ``But I have been in the NFL for 20 years and I've 
seen a lot of situations. It'll work out. I believe it will work 
out.''

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Spending Report Misleading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional report accusing the Pentagon  
of spendings millions of dollars on military projects never 
approved by Congress gives a misleading impression, Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the House Appropriations Committee cites several  
examples in which the Pentagon failed to notify Congress about the 
redirecting of appropriated funds to projects not approved by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the panel's defense  
subcommittee, was quoted by The New York Times in today's editions 
as saying the Pentagon is guilty of defying the will of Congress. 
The report did not say exactly how much money was allegedly 
misspent, but it included as an example an Air Force attempt to buy 
an $800 million military communications satellite without lawful 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``What do we have to do to make them understand what we mean  
when we say no?'' Lewis is quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the report, Cohen told reporters at the Pentagon  
that it overstated the problem. He said the report ``comes as 
somewhat of a surprise to all of us in the Pentagon,'' considering 
that of the more than 5,000 military projects managed by the 
Pentagon, only six are cited as being problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is quite a significant statement in itself, that about  
99.9 percent of the time we seem to be doing things right,'' Cohen 
said. ``If there are any deficiencies or allegations of failure to 
comply with the law we will work with the committee to satisfy them 
as to the proper result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``We're bound to have some deficiencies,'' given the  
enormous number of military programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who spent 24 years in Congress as a Maine Republican,  
said that in some cases the language in laws worked out between 
conflicting House and Senate versions sometimes is ``left 
ambiguous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So some of this may be attributed to ambiguity in terms of  
what the direction is between the two houses and the ultimate 
resolution of the different interpretations of what the 
requirements are for the Pentagon,'' he said.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Catcher Todd Hundley dropped the appeal of  
his three-game suspension and began serving the penalty Thursday in

<HEADLINE> `Ragtime' Star Returns to Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Ragtime'' star Alton Fitzgerald White received  
an ovation from the Broadway audience and other members of the 
cast, five days after the black actor was mistakenly arrested on 
drug charges and strip-searched by police. 
</P>
<P>
	White, who was arrested last week in the vestibule of his  
apartment building in Manhattan, returned to his role as Coalhouse 
Walker for the musical's Wednesday matinee. 
</P>
<P>
	At the curtain call, the cast joined the audience in applauding  
White, whose character's life on stage is changed when he is 
harassed by white firemen because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
	Though police called the arrest a case of mistaken identity and  
have apologized to him, White said he was arrested because he is 
black. The incident came amid heightened concern over the practice 
of racial profiling, in which police allegedly stop people solely 
because of their race. 
</P>
<P>
	White said he was on his way to the bank when he spotted several  
police officers in front of his building, where Duke Ellington also 
had lived. 
</P>
<P>
	He opened the door for the officers, who said they were looking  
for four men in white T-shirts. Police have said they found a 
kilogram of cocaine in the lobby and arrested White, who was 
wearing a white T-shirt, along with five other men. 
</P>
<P>
	``The neighbors were vouching for me,'' White said. They told  
the police, he said, ``He's starring on Broadway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was taken to a stationhouse and missed a performance. He said  
he was held even after police realized he was not involved in the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	He compared his experience to that of his character in the  
musical, based on the novel by E.L. Doctorow, which takes place in 
1906. In ``Ragtime,'' after Coalhouse is humiliated and the woman 
he loves is killed, he becomes a revolutionary and a bomber. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he said he was still angry about his arrest, White  
said: ``I can let my anger fester and make me feel worse, or change 
it into confidence and fearlessness.''

<HEADLINE> Politics of Policy in 2000 Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush and Bill Bradley may be feeling  
the heat generated by the politics of policy. After being needled 
by rivals for avoiding tough stands, the two presidential 
candidates are delving into details. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush unveiled an $8 billion plan Thursday to get religious  
organizations involved in delivering government social service. He 
also released a list of his top 75 policy positions, amid taunts 
from President Clinton to ``tell us where you stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it amusing that the president seems to be taking time  
to talk about me,'' the Texas governor said in a telephone 
interview between campaign stops in Indiana. ``He must be worried 
that I'm going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After ducking questions and relying on vague generalities for  
the first half of the year, Bush has been fleshing out his position 
on many issues. He hopes to undercut rivals in both parties who say 
he is all style -- no substance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a former Democratic senator from New Jersey, came under  
pressure as Vice President Al Gore delivered a series of policy 
speeches on education, crime, charities, and cancer research. Gore 
hopes to distinguish himself from Bush and Bradley, his only rival 
for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In his second major address of the campaign, Bradley called for  
stronger campaign finance laws Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I thought about this campaign was, you take the first  
half of the year to introduce yourself to America, let them know 
what you believe. But in the second half of the year you become 
more specific,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential candidates pour out reams of position papers and  
hours of issue-laden speeches to trump each other in the policy 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain of Arizona broke out of the GOP presidential  
pack with fast and forceful comments on the Kosovo crisis. He 
broadened his agenda in May with proposals on Social Security, 
education and tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
	He is returning this summer to a signature issue, campaign  
finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, a Cabinet member for two Republican presidents,  
called herself a ``courageous conservative'' for criticizing the 
gun lobby. The rhetoric drew attention to her campaign when it 
appeared to be sagging. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessman Steve Forbes has made attacking Bush a centerpiece  
of his campaign. A top adviser, Bill Dal Col, said the governor 
``gave us a snippet of policy (Thursday) but is still evading the 
question of what he will do with the tax code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative activist Gary Bauer has no fewer than 20 issue  
papers on his Internet site on topics ranging from gambling to 
assisted suicide. ``Politics, if it's worth anything, has to be 
about ideas,'' Bauer said in a telephone interview from his 
campaign bus in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``Politics shouldn't be about how pretty somebody is or how much  
money they have in their bank account or who their father is,'' 
Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He is talking, of course, about Bush.  
</P>
<P>
	Even Bush backers concede the low-on-substance charge had merit  
this spring, when the governor was holed up in Austin, Texas. But 
he has slowly tackled tough issues, even if his prescriptions are 
sometimes fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't impose anti-abortion ``litmus tests'' on judges or a  
running mate. He backs GOP congressional plans for Social Security. 
He says China should get in the world Trade Organization. He would 
spend at least as much on sexual abstinence programs as 
teen-contraception initiatives. He supports the right to carry a 
concealed weapons (at least in Texas.) 
</P>
<P>
	And the faith-based organizations initiative he unveiled  
Thursday contained more details than Gore's speech on the same 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm taking a lot of stands,'' Bush said. ``I'm used to the  
process of people criticizing others. What I intend to do is wage a 
campaign talking about what I'm for, what's in my heart. The 
politics of talking about the other person is not my style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His list of 75 ``specific policy positions'' includes some  
statements that are vague or hardly controversial. His rivals are 
pressing for more specifics, hoping Bush runs into trouble either 
by ducking issues or taking tough stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Coelho, who is running Gore's campaign, questioned where  
Bush stands on Social Security, taxes and health care issues facing 
the GOP Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Begala, a former Clinton aide and fellow Texan, asked if  
Bush would abolish the Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Bush told AP.  
</P>
<P>
	Would he help raise the minimum wage?  
</P>
<P>
	``Tell Begala,'' Bush said with a laugh, ``to keep his powder  
dry.''

<HEADLINE> Senate: Tobacco Suit Can Move Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate on Thursday scuttled an effort to  
prevent the Justice Department from suing the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	After the states won billions of dollars through similar tobacco  
suits, President Clinton announced in his State of the Union speech 
that Justice would explore a lawsuit of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers are now at work exploring legal strategy for  
recovering billions of dollars spent by Medicare and other federal 
health programs to treat sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	But last month, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., quietly slipped a  
provision into a bill funding the Commerce, Justice and State 
departments that would have barred Justice from spending any money 
on such a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats balked, and Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., introduced an  
amendment Thursday removing the offending language. 
</P>
<P>
	``To allow the tobacco industry to escape responsibility ...  
would be totally irresponsible, a surrender of our fiduciary 
responsibility to the taxpayer,'' Graham argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham withdrew his amendment after Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and  
Gregg introduced language into the Senate record nullifying the 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing in the bill or the report language prohibits the  
department from using generally appropriated funds ... to pursue 
this litigation,'' Gregg said in a statement submitted for the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats felt confident they had the votes to pass the Graham  
amendment and had hoped to stage a public defeat of the tobacco 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to make certain that the tobacco companies know that  
they have lost and the American taxpayers have won. We are not 
going to accept any half-hearted compromise,'' said Sen. Richard 
Durbin, D-Ill., a vocal opponent of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Durbin and Graham recalled the Senate's success in preventing  
the federal government from taking a share of the money states won 
in their tobacco settlements. At the time, several people said that 
the federal government should file a suit of its own if it wants a 
piece of tobacco money. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Gregg did not return repeated calls Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	The dispute moved the Senate back into the tobacco wars of last  
year, at least for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never stops,'' said Bruce Reed, Clinton's chief domestic  
policy adviser, who welcomed Thursday's action. ``It's hard to 
believe that Congress would side with the tobacco companies over 
the taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce joined the tobacco industry in  
lobbying to keep the ban in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Department of Justice sues tobacco, then there's no  
business that's really safe from revenue-raising lawsuits,'' said 
the chamber's Jim Wootton. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Democrats prevailed, the Senate bill does not give  
Justice an extra $20 million requested by the president to work on 
the lawsuit. Justice officials decline to say whether they'll be 
able to move forward without the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't do `what ifs,''' Attorney General Janet Reno said. ``I  
think we can work with Congress to make sure that we can still 
proceed.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Keeps Tour de France Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BORDEAUX, France (AP) -- Many come to the Bordeaux wine country  
to unwind, explore and enjoy the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
	Lance Armstrong has such a commanding lead in the Tour de France  
that he probably could have spent the 17th stage doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
	After the exhausting mountain climbs in the Pyrenees, Thursday's  
flat, 120-mile ride past pine forests and vineyards near Bordeaux 
looked positively relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong stayed safely in the pack, finishing 51st, but losing  
none of his lead of 6 minutes, 15 seconds. Now, the 27-year-old 
Texan who has overcome testicular cancer is only three days from 
probable victory in Paris on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	He faces a flat stage today and a time trial -- his specialty --  
on Saturday. Then comes the final ride up the Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the path of the race, the link between Lance Armstrong and  
Neil Armstrong did not go unnoticed. ``Go Lance -- Reach the Moon!'' 
read a banner along the route, accompanied by an American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgium's Tom Steels won in a sprint for his third stage victory  
of the tour. It would have been his fourth if not for a 
disqualification in another stage for rough tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie McEwen of Australia was second and Erik Zabel of Germany  
third. Stuart O'Grady of Australia was in position to contest the 
final sprint, but fell close to the finish. He was badly bruised, 
but completed the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Tonkov, a Russian in 11th place overall, quit the race  
because of the death of his father. Tonkov, the leader of Italy's 
Mapei team, is a former Tour of Italy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	A labor dispute Friday greeted the riders just 3 miles after the  
start. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclists were blocked by firemen protesting working  
conditions. ``Angry Firemen!'' said a banner. The race had to begin 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a number of riders found themselves wiping their eyes  
when a spectator threw an unidentified substance onto the road that 
some said might have been pepper. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-man group broke out after about 28 miles and opened a  
lead of 7:55 before the pack started picking up speed and reeling 
them in. The group included two national champions, Germany's Udo 
Bolts and Australia's Henk Vogels. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 9 miles left, the pack was grouped again, and the  
sprinters jockeyed for position. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a day after lashing out at the French media for what  
he called ``vulture journalism,'' was quiet Thursday, declining to 
speak at the postrace news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, he smiled when reminded by a TV interviewer of  
the link with Neil Armstrong -- but otherwise expressed only anger 
and frustration with the continued drug accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want me to crack on the bike -- and I'm not going to,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For two days, the French newspaper Le Monde reported that traces  
of a corticosteroid were detected in his urine. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs that  
are not listed as steroids. They are banned unless prescribed by 
doctors for a variety of conditions, including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body announced Wednesday the only drug  
Armstrong had been taking was an authorized skin cream for saddle 
sores. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a story about doping, it's a story about skin  
cream,'' Armstrong said.

<HEADLINE> Exec Defends New Fox Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Fox programming chief Doug Herzog knows  
the network's racy new sitcom ``Action,'' a spoof of Hollywood, 
will offend some viewers. He's even advising some people to change 
the channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watch somebody else's network for that hour,'' Herzog said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he said Fox is unapologetic about its decision to break the  
rules. Herzog is well-versed in the art; he moved to Fox from 
Comedy Central, home of the outrageous ``South Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Action,'' which stars Jay Mohr as an unscrupulous movie  
producer, features bleeped obscenities and ribald jokes about O.J. 
Simpson, sex and even a gag about an employee urinating in the Cobb 
salad of his boss. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``definitely pushing the line a little bit,'' Herzog told  
the Television Critics Association summer gathering on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Action,'' a half-hour sitcom, debuts Sept. 16.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox also said it will air a two-hour special Aug. 3 on the  
upcoming ``Woodstock '99'' concert marking the 30th anniversary of 
the original festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The network also said that Johnathon Schaech (``That Thing You  
Do'') will be joining the cast of the new series ``Time of Your 
Life,'' a drama debuting in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The television critics meeting, with CBS, NBC, ABC and PBS set  
for next week, continues through Aug. 1.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Passes Out Gifts to Hubby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For Bob Dole's 76th birthday on Thursday, his  
wife offered a table loaded with presents: a bagel toaster for 
Beulah, a blouse for Lottie, a gift certificate for Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bob is the love of my life, the guy who's my staunchest  
supporter for 25 years, my best friend,'' Elizabeth Dole said as 
she threw him a ``reverse birthday party'' where all the gifts were 
for needy residents of Sarah's Circle, a downtown Washington senior 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from playing Santa, Mrs. Dole also played hostess, serving  
plates of fried chicken and mashed potatoes -- Bob Dole's all-time 
favorite -- and iced tea to her elderly admirers. Young campaign 
aides sweating in their dark suits and neckties chased behind and 
kept the plates coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadie Ford, 77 and a Democrat planning to vote for Mrs. Dole,  
guessed that she couldn't afford to reciprocate with a suitable 
gift for the Republican presidential candidate. ``She's got money, 
so she wouldn't want junk,'' Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
	But if she could, Ford said she would give Mrs. Dole, who  
celebrates her own birthday (her 63rd) next week, a house -- the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dole, who lost his own bid for the presidency, told a  
reporter at the party that he's not worried that Texas Gov. George 
W. Bush has established himself as the Republican front-runner by 
amassing $37 million in campaign funds this year to Mrs. Dole's 
$3.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's doing as well as everybody but one,'' Bob Dole said.  
</P>
<P>
	He also discounted the importance of next month's Iowa straw  
poll, considered by some politicos to be the race's first test of 
the candidates' organizational strength. 
</P>
<P>
	``The press makes it important,'' Bob Dole said. ``Straw poll.  
What's that mean? What does that tell anybody?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lottie Roberts, 94, was grateful to Mrs. Dole for seeking the  
White House, regardless of how she's faring in the race so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's proving we're just as capable of doing the job as men --  
that we can be housewives, mothers, even presidents.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Railway Killer Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Accused serial killer Angel Maturino Resendiz was  
indicted on a capital murder charge Thursday for the slaying of a 
doctor, one of nine people he is suspected of killing. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they have not made the final determination  
whether to seek the death penalty. Arraignment was set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz, 39, is already charged in four slayings in  
Illinois, Texas and Kentucky. Police say evidence links him to five 
other Texas killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's indictment stems from the December beating and  
stabbing death of Dr. Claudia Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Devon Anderson said Maturino  
Resendiz would undergo a psychiatric evaluation to determine 
whether he was competent to stand trial. His defense attorneys did 
not return telephone messages Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had charged Maturino Resendiz with burglarizing the  
Benton home but waited until he was in custody and able to provide 
DNA samples before pursuing a murder charge. He remains held 
without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they found one of Maturino Resendiz's  
fingerprints in the doctor's Jeep, and jewelry associated with her 
was also recovered from his Mexico home.

<HEADLINE>  Crowds Swell To Remember Kennedy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The pile of flowers, notes and candles left  
outside John F. Kennedy Jr.'s apartment grew so large that some 
bouquets were removed and given to charities and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	A seemingly endless stream of mourners, however, are bringing  
more tokens of remembrance to the building in the trendy downtown 
Manhattan neighborhood of Tribeca. Many described Kennedy as one of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was alive, doing OUR stuff -- roller-blading, going to a  
Yankee game,'' said Mike Caffey, 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people have left flowers, prayer cards, candles,  
notes, poems, balloons and newspaper clippings at the site since 
Saturday. Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn, and her sister, Lauren 
Bessette, died Friday in a plane crash off the Massachusetts coast. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate shrine of cards and flowers grew outside the  
Manhattan office building where Kennedy's magazine, George, is 
located. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinah Lopera of Phoenix said she and her family flew to New York  
just to keep a vigil. She left a note at the apartment, saying: 
``God bless you. We've always been with you and your family, and we 
will always be with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other notes included these messages: ``Love always from Israel''  
and ``Descansen en paz'' -- Spanish for ``rest in peace.'' A Thai 
restaurant where Kennedy liked to get takeout sent a tall wreath 
with a menu attached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Irish flag was taped to the building, along with the Irish  
Echo newspaper's front-page headline: ``Good night, sweet prince.'' 
The city's Irish community planned a public memorial tonight at a 
Manhattan church. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanny Salvador left a tiny wooden airplane, a card with the  
names of every Latin American country printed on it and this 
message: ``A prayer for John, from all Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They were so nice to all of us,'' she said. ``President  
Kennedy helped the poor people and the developing countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Russell, 35, a black woman from Washington, D.C.,  
visited the shrine with four cousins. ``His family did so much for 
African-Americans -- it's the Kennedy name,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Royals' Kevin Appier Is Angry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kevin Appier is angry. He's angry at the  
way he's pitching and angry at the way Herk Robinson is running the 
Kansas City Royals. 
</P>
<P>
	All that dissatisfaction came bubbling over Wednesday after he  
lost to Detroit 10-5 and saw his record dip to 8-9 while his ERA 
climbed to 5.00. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what their plan is,'' said Appier, who underwent  
shoulder surgery during spring training in 1998 and has not 
rebounded to the form that made him the ace of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, who will make more than $5.5 million next season in the  
option year of his contract, has been on the trading block all this 
year. But the Royals have been unable to make a deal, mostly 
because of his ineffectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier said he questioned whether the Royals are sincere about  
their program of rebuilding with young players. He has said he 
would like to remain with the team, but wants to pitch for a 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to have a great chance to do it,'' he said after the  
game in Detroit. ``But if ownership and (the) general manager, if 
that's not their goal, then hopefully they'll get rid of me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appier was asked if he believed management's goal was to fashion  
a playoff contender with younger players.

	``To keep and sign them? That remains to be seen,'' he said.  
``If we're going to be a much-improved team, then I'd like to be 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if they're going to continue with the same ... they've  
been doing for the last seven years, then get rid of me. That is, 
if somebody wants me. It's not like I've been a stellar thing. it's 
not like I've been Superman the way I've pitched.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were several scouts from other major league teams watching  
Appier against the Tigers. But, given his lack of consistency, the 
Royals may not be able to make a deal until nearer the July 31 
trading deadline when contending clubs feel more pressure to obtain 
pitching help. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson said he understood Appier's frustration.  
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't concern me other than I'm sure he was frustrated and  
sometimes when you're that frustrated you're better off not saying 
anything,'' Robinson said. ``But we have established a direction 
for the club and we intend to follow that direction, with or 
without Kevin Appier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals have the option to renew Appier's contract next year.  
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility of trading Kevin still does exist,'' Robinson  
said.

<HEADLINE> Raytheon Earnings Rise 9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- Defense contractor Raytheon Co. today  
reported a 9 percent gain in second-quarter earnings, citing new 
contracts and continued savings from a restructuring program. 
</P>
<P>
	The company met Wall Street's expectations by earning $294  
million, or 86 cents per share, up from $270 million or 79 cents 
per share in the same quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues for the quarter ending July 4 rose from $5.1  
billion to $5.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first two quarters of the year, total revenues were  
$10.1 billion, while earnings were $482 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the continuing restructuring of its Raytheon  
Systems defense electronics division saved $94 million during this 
quarter. The division has eliminated 11,300 jobs since January last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The electronics division secured several large contracts during  
the second quarter, including a $1.3 billion contract to build an 
airborne radar system for the British Ministry of Defense 
</P>
<P>
	That contract came in addition to other new contracts totaling  
$6.1 billion for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Raytheon has three major lines of businesses: defense  
electronics, engineering construction and general aviation. The 
company reported sales were up in all three divisions.

<HEADLINE> Voices on a Campaign Theme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Associated Press asked people to take a stab at defining  
compassionate conservatism, Texas Gov. George Bush's theme in his 
race for the Republican presidential nomination. A sampling of 
responses: 
</P>
<P>
	--''I think it means that Republicans are trying to show they  
have strength, but recognize people's needs.'' Michael Bierman, 57, 
Concord, N.H., artist. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Ever since I was young, there's always been the stereotype  
that Republicans are the people who have all the money, want all 
the money and don't want any for the smaller people. The first 
thing that comes to mind is compassion for the people, and he's 
known for taking away a lot of things.'' Percy Carter, 28, a 
Democrat and men's tailor in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	--''He has a compassion for taxpayers' rights.'' Steven Bolos,  
21, Dallas eyeglass salesman. 
</P>
<P>
	--''Probably a conservative trying to say that they're caring and  
kind. I don't know exactly what it is, so I don't know if I can 
vote for it.'' Communications student Erin Gardner, 19, of Bow, 
N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	--''He's trying to reach out, to include everybody,'' Vernon  
Hall, 45, a Democrat and Washington computer consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I thought in general, conservatives were compassionate.''  
Mike Linstrom, 39, a Republican and network administrator in

	--''Is that an oxymoron? I don't even get that.'' Derek Knight,  
41, Washington bicycle courier.

<P>
	--''Someone who is caring and understanding towards others,''  
Noruato Gutierrez, 53, butcher at Grand Central Market in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I have no idea what it means. I've never heard it before. But  
if I had to guess, I would say it was refraining from hurting the

	Kennedy Family Carries Ashes to Sea  
</P>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- In a farewell at sea, a Navy destroyer  
carried family members today to a ceremony to release the ashes of 
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law at a site not far 
from where they died. A group of about 15 family members carried 
the cremated remains of Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and 
Lauren Bessette onto the USS Briscoe. The Briscoe spent about half 
an hour nearly motionless off the Vineyard's southwest coast. 
Mourners could be seen moving down to the stern, where a flag was 
lowered to half-mast as the group was seated. After a short time, 
during which at least two people appeared to rise and speak, 
passengers returned to the upper deck and the flag was taken down.

	House Rejects Democrats' Tax Cut  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans held ranks today against a  
Democratic challenge that would have sharply scaled back their 
10-year, $792 billion package they say rewards Americans in the new 
age of budget surpluses. The Democratic substitute, defeated 
258-173, would have provided about $250 billion in tax cuts through 
marriage-penalty relief, tax breaks for education and health care 
and the permanent extension of a research and development tax 
credit sought by high-tech industries. The vote represented a 
critical test of support for the GOP plan, which had been in doubt 
Wednesday. President Clinton, who has also endorsed a cut of about 
$250 billion, repeated that the GOP plan was far too large and he 
would veto it.

	AIDS Overtakes War As African Killer

	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- AIDS killed 1.4 million people in eastern  
and southern Africa last year, overtaking armed conflicts as the 
No. 1 killer in the region, the U.N. Children's Fund said today. 
The epidemic, which has hit this portion of the African continent 
harder than anywhere else in the world, has left 6 million children 
orphaned in eastern and southern Africa, amounting to 70 percent of 
the world's AIDS orphans, said UNICEF Deputy Executive Director 
Stephen Lewis. Worldwide, some 16,000 people daily are infected by 
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and there are 8.2 million AIDS

only one flat stage left tomorrow and then a time trial -- his 
specialty -- on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Heinz To Sell Diet Classes for $735M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- H.J. Heinz Co., in the middle of a major  
restructuring plan to improve profitability by focusing on key food 
products, plans to sell its Weight Watchers diet classroom business 
for $735 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically the buyer of the diet classes -- Artal Luxembourg SA,  
a European firm which does business through The Invus Group of New 
York -- has made big investments in Keebler cookies and Sunshine 
biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Artal and Invus appear to be branching out on both  
ends of the sweets spectrum, Heinz is conspicuously cutting back, 
continuing a $2.5 billion restructuring plan that could see it lay 
off some 4,000 workers and close up to 20 factories over the next 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to play to your confidences and your strengths,''  
said Ted Smyth, a spokesman for the Pittsburgh-based food giant. 
``The Weight Watchers classroom business is a service business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Heinz is making a clear distinction between that and  
manufacturing food. 
</P>
<P>
	Its deal to sell the renowned diet classroom business -- active  
in some 30 countries -- doesn't include the food packaged under the 
same name. The company is keeping all the frozen meals, desserts 
and breakfast items that will still be sold under the Weight 
Watchers Smart Ones moniker. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Jakubik, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read in New  
York, said Invus' expertise in marketing, applied to the diet 
classroom business, can only help Heinz' Weight Watchers food 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good deal. Weight Watchers has historically been a  
cloud hovering over Heinz,'' said Jakubik. ``It was always a thorn 
in investors' sides, and the price paid was a good value for 
Heinz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Heinz had turned around its diet classroom business  
in recent years, president and chief executive officer William R. 
Johnson stuck with previously announced plans to sell it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Weight Watchers is the gold standard in the global weight  
control business, but its services orientation does not fit with 
Heinz' long-term food growth strategy,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	That strategy consists of focusing on the products that made  
Heinz famous -- ketchup, Star Kist tuna, Ore-Ida frozen potatoes -- 
and acquisitions such as the recent purchase of ABC Indonesia, a 
leading maker of soy sauce and ketchup in the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
	The Weight Watchers classes represented just a small fraction of  
Heinz' $9.3 billion in overall annual sales, bringing in about $400 
million a year, Smyth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heinz isn't abandoning it entirely, however. The company said it  
plans to take a portion of the proceeds once the sale of the 
classroom business is completed in about three months and buy back 
a 6 percent stake. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale is expected to dilute earnings by about 7 cents per  
share over the next year, but Jakubik said it shows Heinz is 
serious about restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are definitely going in the right direction,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Heinz fell 87 1/2 cents to $49 in trading on the New York  
Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> DC School Board President Ousted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The District of Columbia school board voted  
6-5 today to remove board member Wilma Harvey as president 
following allegations she abused her authority. But Harvey, who 
remains a board member, vowed to fight for the presidency in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to continue to serve the children of this city, and  
I'm going to continue to work on this board,'' Harvey said later. 
Asked if the matter would go to court, Harvey answered, ``Yes it 
will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers said the board lacked the authority to remove the  
president, who was elected by district voters. With 14 years on the 
job, Harvey has been on the board longer than any other current 
member. But in recent weeks, she has been at the center of 
controversy over charges she abused her power. 
</P>
<P>
	Board member Westy Byrd accused Harvey of hiring a car and  
driver without permission, and approving a raise for an employee 
that was thousands of dollars more than the board allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Another board member, Robert Childs, accused Harvey of operating  
``in a vacuum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harvey's supporters on the board rallied around her. Board  
member William Lockridge warned it was a ``destructive'' and 
``selfish'' move to oust her. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board had its own authority diminished to that of an  
advisory board in 1996 and is slated to regain power next year from 
the city's financial control board.

<HEADLINE> Knight Ridder Quarterly Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Newspaper publisher Knight Ridder  
reported a 14 percent rise in quarterly earnings today, crediting 
advertising growth and lower newsprint costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings per share were 83 cents, up from 73 cents reported in  
second-quarter 1998 by Knight Ridder, which publishes The Miami 
Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted 82 cents a share.  
Knight Ridder's stock rose 1 percent on the news in early trading, 
to $55. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income rose 29 percent to $86.6 million in the quarter ended  
June 27, up from $66.9 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues were $809.6 million, up from $779.2 million a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	These results exclude profits from Knight Ridder's sale of its  
minority investment in Zip2 Corp. and in AT&AMP;T stock that the 
company received in return for divesting its cable partnership with 
Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	It also doesn't include $2.4 million in severance costs, $11.6  
million in corporate relocation costs and $3.1 million in final 
settlements on 1997 newspaper sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very good quarter, with both revenue growth and cost  
trends working in our favor. Most encouragingly, San Jose had its 
best quarter for ad revenue growth in a year and a half,'' Chairman 
and CEO Tony Ridder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder credited its 3.9 percent overall increase in ad  
revenue to ``unusually robust'' general advertising and surging 
classified sales with the help of cross-newspaper and 
cross-publisher buys through Newspapers First and Newspaper 
National Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross Jones, Knight Ridder's chief financial officer, attributed  
a 24 percent overall increase in general advertising to dramatic 
growth in national auto, telecom, Internet and travel advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating costs rose just 0.3 percent -- mostly because the price  
per ton of newsprint dropped 9.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead, we foresee an excellent 1999 for Knight Ridder,  
with perhaps even more strength in the second half than some had 
thought,'' Jones said, predicting continued cost controls and low 
newsprint prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder is the nation's second-largest newspaper  
publisher, with 31 daily newspapers, a readership of 9.2 million 
daily and 13.1 million Sunday, and 45 associated Web sites under 
the name Real Cities. Knight Ridder also has investments in two 
newsprint mills.

<HEADLINE> Bush Plans New Fight on Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush, issuing a call to arms for America's ``armies of 
compassion,'' is unveiling plans that would enlist charities, 
community groups and religious organizations to help government 
deliver social services. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor promises that, if elected, he would dedicate  
$8 billion during his first year in the White House for tax credits 
and grants as part of what he calls ``a bold new approach'' to 
governing. The money would be used to encourage Americans to give 
more to charity and increase the role of faith-based organizations 
in the fight to reduce poverty, welfare rolls, criminal activity 
and other social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every instance where my administration sees a  
responsibility to help people, we will look first to faith-based 
organizations, charities and community groups that have shown their 
ability to save and change lives,'' he said in a draft of a speech 
he was delivering today at a Methodist church in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will rally the armies of compassion in our communities to  
fight a very different war against poverty and hopelessness -- a 
daily battle waged house to house and heart by heart,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To increase charitable giving, Bush wants to allow taxpayers who  
do not itemize deductions to be able to deduct their donations to 
charity. He says 70 percent of taxpayers cannot claim charitable 
donations currently. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will give the people who don't itemize the same incentives  
as people who do -- rewarding and encouraging giving by everyone in 
our society, not just the wealthy,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal would encourage states to give tax credits to  
people who donate to charities that address poverty and other 
specific social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	To help government solve society's toughest problems, Bush is  
proposing several items to get faith-based organizations, community 
groups and charities involved. The cornerstone initiative would 
offer grants to groups, including ministries, that offer services 
to children whose parents are in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said the prison population is exploding as tough crime laws  
are enforced. The crackdown is good, he said, but it has left 1.2 
million children with one or more parents in prison. ``They should 
not be punished for the sins of their fathers,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also promises to change laws that hinder the abilities of  
non-government groups to provide social services. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakdown of the costs of individual initiatives was not  
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, an extension of programs he embraced in Texas,  
are offered by Bush as an example of his political philosophy that 
seeks to promote conservative principles without hurting the poor 
or alienating moderate voters. Democratic and Republican rivals 
have scoffed at this ``compassionate conservative'' brand of 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who is seeking the Democratic  
nomination, treaded on the traditionally Republican territory in 
May when he said America must ``dare to embrace'' religious 
programs and called for a ``new partnership'' between church and 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	While breaking new ground for a Democratic candidate, Gore's  
broadly worded May address lacked many of the specifics outlined by 
Bush today. It is not lost on Bush's political advisers that Gore 
supporters, including President Clinton, have accused Bush of 
avoiding detailed policies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bush campaign released a list of 75 ``specific policy  
positions'' of the Texas governor in reaction to Clinton's 
suggestion Thursday that Bush was not being detailed enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is amazing that President Clinton continues to engage in  
what he himself admitted was `not quite presidential' by talking 
about a candidate who hasn't even received the Republican 
nomination yet,'' spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The list includes Bush's plans to cut the marginal tax rate (he  
doesn't say how much he would cut it), ban unregulated ``soft 
money'' contributions from labor unions and corporations and his 
opposition to government mandated registration of guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Bush and Gore campaigns hope to avoid conflict with  
civil libertarians on issues involving the separation of church and 
state. Gore said the new partnership he seeks between the 
government and churches should be ``carefully tailored.'' Bush 
advisers say federal money would pay for services delivered by 
faith-based groups, not for the religious teachings espoused by the 
groups.

<HEADLINE> Bush Unveils Social Services Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate George W.  
Bush called Thursday for a partnership between government and the 
``armies of compassion'' that would provide federal grants and tax 
credits designed to help churches and charitable organizations 
fight the nation's social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor called his proposal ``the next bold step in  
welfare reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Government cannot be replaced by charities. I know that, you  
know that. But it can welcome them as partners, not resent them as 
rivals,'' the Texas governor told about 500 people at a 
non-denominational church. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should promote these private and faith-based efforts  
because they work. But we should also promote them because their 
challenges are often greater than their resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush promised that, if elected, he would dedicate $8 billion  
during his first year in the White House for tax credits and grants 
that would be used to encourage Americans to give more to charity 
and increase the role of faith-based organizations in the fight to 
reduce poverty, welfare rolls, crime and other social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pledged to establish an ``Office of Faith-Based Action''  
to serve as a clearinghouse for information on effective religious 
organizations and assist them in their dealings with the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every instance where my administration sees a  
responsibility to help people, we will look first to faith-based 
organizations, charities and community groups that have shown their 
ability to save and change lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans historically have championed the role of faith-based  
organizations and American volunteerism in meeting the social needs 
of the disadvantaged. Ronald Reagan pointedly urged this strategy 
at a time when his administration was under harsh criticism for 
sharp cuts in social spending. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also has advocated a greater role for these  
organizations. To make welfare reform work, he urged each of the 
135,000 churches, synagogues and mosques that have more than 200 
members to hire one person coming off welfare 
</P>
<P>
	Numerous charitable groups have complained that their resources  
are stretched thin. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, Vice President Al Gore called for a ``new partnership''  
between church and state. But his proposal lacked many of the 
specifics outlined by Bush on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Coelho, general chairman of the Gore campaign, said in a  
statement, ``We're glad to see George Bush following Al Gore's lead 
to work with faith-based organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, one of Bush's GOP presidential rivals, said  
Americans will give more to charities when their taxes are cut. 
``As president, I will pass a big tax cut for working Americans. 
That's the real difference between Governor Bush and me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush made his remarks at a celebration of the Front Porch  
Alliance, an initiative launched by Indianapolis Mayor Stephen 
Goldsmith to strengthen ties between city government, churches and 
neighborhood organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	He later attended a private fund-raising luncheon that was  
expected to add $600,000 to the more than $37 million he already 
has amassed in his drive to capture the GOP presidential 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	To increase charitable giving, Bush wants to allow taxpayers who  
do not itemize deductions to be able to deduct their donations to 
charity. He said 70 percent of taxpayers cannot claim charitable 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will give the people who don't itemize the same treatment  
and incentives as people who do -- rewarding and encouraging giving 
by everyone in our society, not just the wealthy,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another proposal would encourage states to give tax credits to  
people who donate to charities that address poverty and other 
specific social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	To help government solve society's toughest problems, he would  
offer grants to groups, including ministries, that offer services 
to children whose parents are in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said the prison population is exploding as tough crime laws  
are enforced. The crackdown is good, he said, but it has left 1.2 
million children with one or more parents in prison. ``They should 
not be punished for the sins of their fathers,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also promises to change laws that hinder the abilities of  
non-government groups to provide social services. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals, an extension of programs he embraced in Texas,  
are offered by Bush as an example of his political philosophy that 
seeks to promote conservative principles without hurting the poor 
or alienating moderate voters. Democratic and Republican rivals 
have scoffed at this ``compassionate conservative'' brand of 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Bush and Gore campaigns hope to avoid conflict with  
civil libertarians on issues involving the separation of church and 
state. Gore said the new partnership he seeks between the 
government and churches should be ``carefully tailored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said Thursday that federal money would pay for services  
delivered by faith-based groups, not for the religious teachings 
espoused by the groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am told by legal experts that my program will pass  
constitutional muster,'' he told reporters after his speech. ``The 
question is, `Does it work?' That's what we ought to ask as a 
society.''

<HEADLINE>  Kennedy Ashes To Be Released at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- In a farewell at sea, a Navy destroyer  
carried family members today to a ceremony to release the ashes of 
John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law at a site not far 
from where they died. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of about 15 family members carried the cremated remains  
of Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette onto the 
USS Briscoe. Their ashes were to be committed to the sea off 
Martha's Vineyard about three miles from where the bodies were 
recovered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' families had endured a five-day vigil before the  
bodies were brought to Cape Cod on Wednesday night for autopsies. 
The medical examiner determined all three died instantly of 
multiple traumatic injuries resulting from the plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Briscoe spent about half an hour nearly motionless off the  
Vineyard's southwest coast. Mourners could be seen moving down to 
the stern, where a flag was lowered to half-mast as the group was 
seated, flanked by sailors in dress whites. 
</P>
<P>
	After a short time, during which at least two people appeared to  
rise and speak, passengers returned to the upper deck and the flag 
was taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	The ship turned around and headed back to the Woods Hole port on  
Cape Cod, but the families did not immediately disembark. It was 
not known whether the ashes had been released; media boats were 
kept more than a mile from the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	On the road leading into the port this afternoon, 400 to 500  
people gathered in an apparent show of sympathy. ``Our prayers are 
with you,'' one sign said. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 9 a.m. today, family members dressed in dark clothing had  
boarded the Coast Guard cutter Sanibel, which took them to the 
Briscoe, in Woods Hole. The mourners included Kennedy's sister, 
Caroline Kennedy; his uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy; and cousins 
Maria Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, 
</P>
<P>
	The Bessette sisters' relatives also were attending, including  
their mother, Ann Freeman, stepfather, Dr. Richard Freeman, and Ms. 
Bessette's twin sister, Lisa Ann Bessette, a family source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three folded American flags and three wreaths with red, yellow  
and white flowers had been placed on the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen approved a request by the  
senator and the Bessette and Freeman families for Navy assistance 
for the ceremony, the Pentagon said this morning. Two Navy 
chaplains and a civilian priest -- all Roman Catholics -- were to 
officiate at the ceremony, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy divers recovered the three bodies in murky waters off  
Martha's Vineyard, 116 feet below the surface and 7 1/2 miles from 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we were able to bring closure to two families and that I  
think we realize is very important,'' said Coast Guard Rear Adm. 
Richard M. Larrabee, who added the bodies were raised ``in a way 
that respected the situation they were in. It was something we were 
very sensitive to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's debris reflected the speed at which it struck the  
water, with pieces spread more than 40 yards from the main crash 
site, Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with visibility of 5 to 8 feet, divers encountered  
twisted wreckage, with wires and seats askew, ``the kind of thing 
you can imagine that would be the result of a high-impact contact 
with the water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep TV cameras away, flights were banned within five miles  
of the recovery effort led by the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship. 
Sen. Kennedy and his sons, Patrick and Edward Jr., were aboard the 
Grasp when the bodies were recovered and accompanied the remains to 
Woods Hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cape Cod Times reported today the Kennedy family had asked  
that no photographs be taken during Kennedy's autopsy because they 
could end up in tabloids or on the Internet. Such photographs are 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Cape &AMP; Islands First Assistant District Attorney Michael O'Keefe  
would not deny the published report or say whether the alleged 
request was honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wishes of the family were appropriately expressed,'' he  
said. ``Where it was possible, they were followed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, was piloting his single-engine Piper Saratoga from  
New Jersey on Friday night when it dropped from radar 16 1/2 miles 
from Martha's Vineyard Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and his 33-year-old wife had planned to drop Ms.  
Bessette, 34, off at Martha's Vineyard and then fly to Hyannis Port 
for the wedding of his cousin, Rory. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight data showed the plane dropped precipitously after Kennedy  
took a right turn away from the Vineyard, and aviation experts said 
he may have been disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage, including a section of fuselage with the  
instrument panel, will be taken to the Coast Guard Air Station on 
Cape Cod for examination. It will be six to nine months before the 
accident's cause is determined, said James Hall, chairman of the 
National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the Bessette sisters issued a statement thanking  
everyone who assisted in the exhaustive search. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our children are with us in spirit each and  
every moment, and that is what helps sustain us,'' the Freemans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A private Mass for Kennedy and his wife was scheduled for Friday  
morning at the Church of St. Thomas More, a Roman Catholic church 
in New York once attended by his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis. President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton were expected 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House news conference, Clinton defended his decision  
to pour so many federal resources into the search for the plane. 
The Briscoe had been conducting training near Virginia when it was 
sent to Massachusetts to pick up family members for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at  
fault, I am,'' said Clinton, who based his decision on the 
Kennedys' role ``in our national lives, and because of the enormous 
losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only service for Kennedy's sister-in-law is  
planned for Saturday night at Christ Church, an Episcopal church in 
Greenwich, Conn. New York's Irish community also planned a public 
ceremony tonight at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in downtown 
Manhattan, and the Pentagon planned an observance Friday aboard the 
aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, the son of the 35th president, was being returned to  
waters where he enjoyed sailing, sea kayaking and even searching 
for a sunken pirate ship. His spirit of adventure led him to pursue 
a pilot's license, which he received last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Gay Head Beach, overlooking the spot where the wreckage was  
found, residents erected a 4-foot high cross made of beach 
driftwood and lashed together with wild island grape vines. The 
names John-John, Carolyn and Lauren were etched into each arm of 
the cross. 
</P>
<P>
	West Tisbury resident Heather Rynd, who helped make the cross,  
said the monument was a symbol of loss and love for the Kennedy 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``JFK Jr. stands for something I carry in my heart politically,  
emotionally and spiritually,'' she said. ``I feel now that the 
spirit of him -- and the three of them -- will be here forever.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defects Before Games Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The Pan American Games could have as  
much action off the field as on it, if the days before they start 
are any indication. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days before the games officially begin, a Cuban shooter  
defected and several top American and Canadian athletes dropped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Well before today's opening events in canoe and kayak, Cuban  
pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes walked into a Royal Canadian 
Mountain Police station on Tuesday and asked to remain in Canada. 
Just last week, five members of the Cuban basketball delegation, 
including four players, defected during the Tournament of the 
Americas in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavier security was expected for the Cubans for this event, but  
Reyes apparently had no trouble walking away from the Southport 
athletes village outside of Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview before Reyes' defection, Brian Koshul, press  
secretary for the Pan American Games Society Inc., said games 
officials would not actively assist athletes wishing to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not take them for a coke, they do not hide them in the  
trunk of a car, they do not hide them in the attic,'' he said. 
``Our only contact with applicants for refugee status is (to say) 
`Mr. police officer, this person wants to speak with you.' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vasquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said he was unaware of any defections. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's top two finishers at these games will qualify for the  
2000 Olympics. While Cuba is expected to grab one of the berths 
with ease, Canada and the United States likely will be main 
contenders for the other spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's team was hurt by the last-minute dropouts of Double-A  
Birmingham pitchers Aaron Myette and Julien Tucker. Canada manager 
Ernie Whitt didn't find out until Tuesday that Myette, likely to be 
his top starter, and Tucker would not participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Both players apparently were pressured by their parent team, the  
Chicago White Sox, to stay with Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not supposed to work that way,'' Whitt said. ``The  
organizations are supposed to approve it and they're supposed to 
go. That's the way it was supposed to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pitcher Chris Mears and outfielder Greg Morrison will replace  
Myette and Tucker on the roster. The United States also is using 
minor leaguers. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans who walked away from the games, which officially open  
Friday night, were pole vaulter Jeff Hartwig, 1991 Pan Am 200-meter 
winner Kevin Little, hurdler Sandra Glover, distance runner Libbie 
Hickman and long jumpers Erick Walder and Roland McGhee. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the American team features 13 men and five women who have  
participated in the Olympics. Many of the top track and field 
athletes currently are competing in lucrative European meets. 
</P>
<P>
	In today's kayaking, two-time Olympian Alexandra Harbold was in  
the sprints. Peter Newman, the first American to win three kayaking 
medals in a single Pan Am Games (1995 in Mar del Plata), also is 
entered in the sprints.

<HEADLINE> Dorm Fire is Legal Rollercoaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY, Ky. (AP) -- No one would blame Fred McGrath if he were to  
complete his degree at somewhere other than Murray State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath and six friends were charged in October with setting a  
dormitory fire Sept. 18 that killed a student and injured a dozen 
others. McGrath himself was charged with murder and arson and faced 
the possibility of the death penalty for what prosecutors said was 
a prank by rugby club members that got out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Two and a half months later, nearly all the charges were  
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	And on June 11, someone else altogether, Jerry Wayne Walker, a  
23-year-old dorm resident and part-time youth minister, was charged 
with the crime. He could be executed if found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonwealth's Attorney Mike Ward would not specify why he  
dropped the charges. He said only that someone ``did some things 
that put a monkey wrench in our case'' -- a reference, perhaps, to 
Walker, who police say left an anonymous note saying someone other 
than the seven had set the fire. Walker denies it. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the seven complain that their reputations have been  
damaged and that a cloud of suspicion still hangs over them. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath, a 24-year-old native of Granbury, Texas, who now lives  
in Murray, said the prosecutor never apologized to him or his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I was brought up and the way my parents raised me was  
always `innocent until proven guilty,' which obviously wasn't the 
case with me and my six other friends that were indicted with me,'' 
McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath, who had dropped out before the fire, said he plans to  
return this fall and complete his undergraduate degree in business 
administration. He said he has some unfinished business at Murray 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of strong ties here, a lot of good friends,''  
he said recently. ``I started college here and I'd like to finish 
college here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father, also named Fred, said the experience has drained the  
entire family emotionally and financially. He and his son have 
discussed the possibility of legal action. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very difficult to put it behind you when you see your son  
incarcerated and you visit him in jail,'' the elder McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that throughout the ordeal, his son got the full support  
of his family and friends, including those at Murray State. But the 
case continues to cause problems for the younger McGrath, six 
months after the charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``He applied for a job as a stock clerk at a national chain of  
mass merchandisers and they wouldn't hire him because he had been 
arrested. This was for a minimum-wage job,'' his father said. ``He 
had trouble getting a job at a gas station punching buttons on a 
cash register.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor did not return calls for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	The seven defendants included five men who belonged to Murray  
State's rugby club. The players and two women were at a party the 
night of the fire, hazing a freshman member of the club by making 
prank calls to his room. They said that is all that happened. 
</P>
<P>
	But the prosecutor alleged someone took the prank further by  
pouring gasoline on the carpet in the hallway and starting a fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Minger, 19, of Niceville, Fla., died in his dorm room of  
smoke inhalation. Another student was severely burned. The fire 
spread fear at the pastoral campus in western Kentucky. Dozens of 
students moved out of the school's nine dormitories and the 
university tightened security. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath speculated that the prosecutor charged him and the  
others because of mounting public pressure to solve the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's trial has been set for October. He is free on $100,000  
bail. In an interview, he said he, too, has been wrongly accused. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's fourth-floor room was near where authorities believe  
the fire was set, and he was among the injured. 
</P>
<P>
	A convenience-store surveillance camera captured Walker buying a  
dollar's worth of gasoline on the night of the blaze. But he said 
that he pumped the fuel directly into his car, not into a 
container, and that his tight budget often led him to buy small 
amounts of gas. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker had no connection to the rugby club. He was a member of  
the student Racer Patrol, a campus security group that escorts 
women to their vehicles and makes sure buildings are locked. 
</P>
<P>
	McGrath and three more of the original seven are still charged  
with falsely reporting a fire, for telephone calls made the night 
of the blaze. Defense lawyers have said the prank calls were a 
coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the seven, Jeremy Baker, 23, of Morganfield, is also  
returning to classes this fall. He is studying exercise science and 
hopes to become a college trainer. Does he feel vindicated after 
Walker's arrest? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' Baker said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lana Phelps, one of the two women charged, was a criminal  
justice major at Murray State but left school after her arrest and 
joined the Navy after the charges were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was something to do to get away from here, kind of let this  
cool off and get away from everybody,'' Ms. Phelps, 21, said from 
her home in Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	But she injured her back in boot camp and left the Navy after 6 1/2  
weeks. Now, she said, ``I really don't know what I'm doing or where 
I'm going.''

<HEADLINE> Trainer Pat Byrne Suing Stronach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Top thoroughbred trainer Pat Byrne, who  
gave up his public stable to train exclusively for Frank Stronach, 
has filed a lawsuit charging Stronach with fraud and breach of 
contract 
</P>
<P>
	The suit, filed last week in Fayette Circuit Court, seeks up to  
$384,000 in damages from Stronach, a Canadian industrialist who 
last year bought Santa Anita racetrack in Arcadia, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, Byrne gave up a stable that included 1997 Horse  
of the Year Favorite Trick and champion 2-year-old filly Countess 
Diana to become a private trainer for Stronach. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Byrne's lawsuit, over the next 15 months, Stronach  
repeatedly failed to live up to terms of the contract by sending 
many of his top horses to another trainer in New York and by 
failing to give Byrne a promised chance to select which 2-year-olds 
he wanted to train. 
</P>
<P>
	By November, when Byrne trained Stronach's Awesome Again to a  
victory in the Breeder's Cup Classic, the suit alleges that the 
trainer had only 15 horses in his stable, down from a high of 35. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit charges that Stronach put off informing Byrne that he  
wanted to terminate their contract until January to avoid paying a 
$300,000 termination fee. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Stronach then proposed a new contract  
under which Byrne would train 12-15 of his horses and would be 
allowed to reopen a public stable. Byrne agreed to the deal, but 
Stronach allegedly never sent him any horses. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit seeks payment of the $300,000 termination fee for the  
first contract, and $84,000 Byrne says he is owed for his training 
services between January and April.

<HEADLINE> House Passes $792B Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sounding themes of smaller government and  
lower taxes, Republicans won narrow House passage Thursday of a 
$792 billion, 10-year tax cut that would be the largest since 
President Reagan's in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Brushing aside a veto threat from President Clinton, the GOP-led  
House passed the bill on a 223-208 vote, with four Republicans 
breaking ranks and six Democrats joining them in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	Triumphant Republicans said passage of the centerpiece of their  
congressional agenda sends a clear message to voters about GOP 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our mission in this city to ship power, money and  
influence back to the people,'' said Budget Committee Chairman John 
Kasich, R-Ohio. ``The more money we have in our pockets, the more 
power we have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation goes to the Senate, where a much different GOP  
tax cut that also totals $792 billion over 10 years is pending. 
Action on that bill is expected as early as next week. Both sides 
hope to work out a compromise version in August. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, in an interview after the vote,  
expressed a willingness to be flexible on the ultimate size of any 
tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got room to work with the president. If we're going to  
get something signed, we're going to have to sit down and work 
something out,'' Hastert said. ``If the president wants to do 
anything at all, as part of his legacy, he needs to start getting 
serious about sitting down to talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would gradually cut income tax rates 10 percent  
across the board, phase down and repeal estate taxes and the 
alternative minimum tax, reduce capital gains taxes, ease the 
``marriage penalty'' affecting many two-income couples and give 
numerous tax breaks for education, health care and businesses large 
and small. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would use up most of the projected $2.9 trillion budget  
surplus over the next 10 years that is not set aside for Social 
Security. Republicans insisted the surplus will be large enough to 
accommodate a refund to taxpayers and guarantee Social Security and 
Medicare for the baby boomers -- but should not usher in a new era 
of big government spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this money is left in Washington, the politicians will  
spend every dime of it on more government programs,'' said Rep. 
Bill Archer, R-Texas, the Ways and Means Committee chairman and 
primary sponsor of the tax cut. ``Let's start today and give it 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came less than 24 hours after Speaker Dennis Hastert,  
R-Ill., and fellow GOP leaders successfully quelled a revolt by a 
dozen Republican moderates. Most of them came aboard when language 
was included that the gradual 10 percent income tax cut will take 
effect only if interest on the national debt drops each year from 
2002 to 2009. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a pretty big victory for our party and for the  
speaker,'' said Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., one of the moderates. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Republicans who voted no are all moderates: Reps. Greg  
Ganske of Iowa, Constance Morella of Maryland, Jack Quinn of New 
York and Mike Castle of Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	In Lansing, Mich., Clinton pledged to veto the bill if it ever  
reaches his desk. ``This plan being voted on in Washington will not 
enable us to pay off our debt. It will not do anything to add to 
the life of Social Security and Medicare,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democrats characterized the tax cut as a political  
document intended mainly to energize Republican voters as the two 
parties prepare to battle for House control in the 2000 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a Christmas tree. It's decorated with every cut that you  
can get for your Republican supporters,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, 
D-N.Y. ``Your bill is what we call in Harlem a trip to nowhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also contended the tax cut primarily benefits the  
wealthy and would jeopardize Social Security because it would 
balloon to $3 trillion in cost in the decade beginning in 2010. 
They say it depends on uncertain surplus projections and would 
drain away money for critical government programs such as defense, 
education and environmental protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is a backloaded, budget-busting, billionaire  
bonanza,'' said Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Although about half the total tax benefits would go to taxpayers  
with incomes over $300,000, Republicans pointed out that the 
richest 2 percent of taxpayers also contribute 40 percent of income 
taxes that flow into the government. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't pay more than we need,'' said Majority Leader  
Dick Armey, R-Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats offered a modest $250 billion tax cut focused on the  
marriage penalty and permanent extension of the research and 
development tax credit sought by high-tech business, but it was 
defeated, 258-173. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has indicated he would sign a tax cut of up to $300  
billion if its benefits are targeted at the middle class and the 
other priorities are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, whether any of the surplus is used to cut taxes  
depends on negotiations later this year between Clinton and the 
Republicans. They are to discuss how to fix Social Security and 
Medicare and whether to lift restrictive government spending caps 
that helped produce the balanced budget but are now seen by many as 
not sustainable. 
</P>
<P>
	In that light, the two $792 billion tax bills moving through  
Congress amount to an opening marker by the GOP in this larger 
debate. Lawmakers from both parties have introduced potential 
compromises that would cut taxes by about $500 billion over 10 
years, but neither side is inclined to embrace a deal yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our movement forward,'' Hastert told reporters.  
</P>
<P>
 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 2488.

<HEADLINE> Doctors: House Bill Bad for Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors' groups warn that things like domestic  
violence, psychiatric treatment, alcoholism and adultery could be 
disclosed under a new bill that would allow financial services 
companies to merge and share data. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the American Medical Association and the American  
Psychiatric Association told a House subcommittee Wednesday that 
the legislation, recently passed by the House, would violate a 
principle that patients must consent to the disclosure of medical 
records. 
</P>
<P>
	Disclosure of personal medical data ``can jeopardize our  
careers, our friendships and even our marriages,'' Dr. Richard 
Harding, vice president of the psychiatrists' association, said in 
prepared testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the financial services bill ``will overturn the  
principle of patient consent for disclosure of medical records.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The medical data provisions, part of the broad financial  
services bill that passed the House July 1 in a 343-86 vote, were 
added after the House Banking Committee had approved the 
legislation, which would lift Depression-era legal barriers and 
allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who heads the panel's financial  
institutions subcommittee, decided to go ahead with the previously 
scheduled hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharing customer data can open lucrative new marketing  
possibilities -- one of the main reasons banks, brokerages and 
insurers want to combine. The financial services industries support 
the legislation, saying it adequately protects consumers' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Protecting privacy is good business,'' said Dan Zielinski, a  
spokesman for the American Insurance Association. He said the 
industry has ``a stellar record of protecting confidential data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the legislation fear, for example, that medical  
records of an insurer showing a customer has cancer or AIDS could 
be used by an affiliated bank to deny a loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bill is ``inadequate to protect patients' sensitive  
medical information,'' testified Dr. Donald J. Palmisano, a member 
of the American Medical Association's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's medical data section prohibits insurance companies  
from sharing personal medical records with other types of 
companies, including financial firms with which they are 
affiliated, unless customers give their express written consent. 
</P>
<P>
	There are exceptions, however, such as provisions that would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Allow health insurance companies to share medical data with  
life insurers when people apply for life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Let financial companies share a consumer's medical data for  
research projects. Because the legislation does not define such 
research projects, Palmisano said, companies could assume they 
include marketing evaluations or consumer profiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmisano and Harding said their groups want Congress  
specifically to prohibit disclosure of medical data without 
consumers' consent and to cut the exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	A top Clinton administration official also said the medical data  
provisions were too weak. 
</P>
<P>
	``No consumer expects that in consenting to a physical  
examination for an insurance policy, he or she is endangering an 
ability to obtain credit or employment,'' Treasury Undersecretary 
Gary Gensler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration, however, supports the financial services  
legislation in principle. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the Senate passed a substantially different version that  
does not include most of the financial and medical privacy 
provisions. The Senate is considering separate legislation covering 
health and medical privacy.

<HEADLINE> Pan Am Games Honor Torchbearers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It was supposed to be their moment of  
glory, an unprecedented honor for 10 native Canadian athletes, 
commonly known as Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	Young and fast, the runners carried the torch to the 1967 Pan  
American Games in Winnipeg, covering 500 miles in a five-day relay 
that honored the spirit of competition and showed pride in their 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	David Courchene Jr., then 17, earned the honor of taking it the  
final few yards. 
</P>
<P>
	He approached the stadium entrance, torch high, the crowd  
roaring before him. He crossed the threshold, and, before he could 
grasp what was happening, the flame was snatched from his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Confused, he and the other runners eventually huddled on the  
edge of the field. Another runner stepped up to the cauldron. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were left at the gate of the stadium,'' he recalled  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officially, they were told only an athlete could light the  
cauldron, and a local running hero, Lee Southern, was given the 
honor. The explanation only irritated the relay group more; they 
considered themselves athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern would establish and help fund athletics programs for  
Canadian aboriginals in the western province of British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Courchene and six others who took part in that relay run more  
than three decades ago have returned to Winnipeg to take part 
Friday in the opening ceremony of the 13th Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, they are honored guests.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're doing this, at last, to let them complete their  
journey,'' said Brian Koshul, the press secretary for the Pan 
American Games Society Inc. ``We're giving them the recognition we 
feel they missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The late '60s were a tumultuous time for the aboriginal people  
in Canada. The government was floating a proposal to retract the 
few rights they had, sparking an era of political activism and 
cultural renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time the games opened, the aboriginal people were not  
even allowed to vote. Most needed a pass for permission to leave 
the reserve. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 runners, who attended government-run boarding schools,  
were thrilled to take part in a relay to bring the torch to 
Winnipeg, the center of the Canadian heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	Picked on the basis of academic and athletic prowess, the  
athletes, then between the ages of 16 and 20, each ran about 10 
miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
	The relay began in St. Paul, Minn. -- no one is quite sure why --  
and crisscrossed a mostly flat course north across the hot windy 
prairie. The runners barely missed a tornado once and never skipped 
a chance to soak hot, sweaty feet in a motel swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
	For a group of young men who rarely left the reserve, the  
exhilarating freedom of a week of travel was matched only by their 
startling homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
	They thought they were prepared, having attended rehearsals for  
the moment in which Courchene would lead the others into Winnipeg's 
stadium, while his fellow runners trailed with the Olympic and Pan 
American flags. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wished we could have lit the cauldron ourselves,'' he said.  
``I really believed we were carrying the spirit of our people. The 
fire is so sacred to our people -- and it has always been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their story had been largely forgotten until Pan Am Games  
official Jeff Ross stumbled across their story. He tracked them 
down and worked to give them the recognition they were denied 30 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it had to be their time,'' Ross said. ``The day after  
the opening ceremony, they can put this memory to rest. It's 
finally done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The athletes, now paunchy chain smokers in their late 40s and  
early 50s, don't look prepared to take on many marathons these 
days. But they offered no bitterness. Instead they seemed thrilled 
-- again -- to take part in games that once left them standing at the 
gates. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see this as an opportunity for resolution,'' Courchene  
said. ``It is the power of the fire.''

<HEADLINE> New Trial in Young Mother's Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A man sentenced to death -- mainly because  
of the testimony of his former wife -- for abducting and murdering a 
young mother received another chance to prove his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	A new trial for John Huggins, 36, was ordered Wednesday after a  
judge decided that prosecutors withheld evidence from a defense 
attorney that raised questions about the credibility of Angel 
Huggins. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Huggins' testimony was crucial to prosecutors winning  
Huggins' first-degree murder conviction in the slaying of 
30-year-old Carla Larson. She was abducted in 1997 from a 
supermarket parking lot while on her lunch break. Her nude body was 
found two days later. 
</P>
<P>
	The killing was the second nightmare for the victim's family.  
Mrs. Larson's sister-in-law, Sonja Larson, was one of five college 
students murdered by serial killer Danny Rolling in Gainesville in 
1990. Rolling is on death row for the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	In Huggins' case, the withheld evidence was a taped interview of  
Preston Ausley, whose statements contradict those of the 
prosecutors' most important witness, Huggins' former wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that Mrs. Huggins' credibility with the jury was  
crucial to the state's case,'' Chief Judge Belvin Perry wrote in 
his order for a new trial. ``Mr. Ausley's statement, if disclosed, 
may have been used by defendant to impeach Ms. Huggins. ... It may 
have affected her credibility in the minds of the jurors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randy Means, a spokesman for the Orange-Osceola State Attorney's  
Office, said prosecutors have not decided whether to appeal the 
judge's order or prepare for another trial of Huggins. 
</P>
<P>
	Huggins is already serving a life term for bank robbery on an  
unrelated conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	A Jacksonville jury convicted Huggins in February of abducting  
and murdering Mrs. Larson in June 1997 after she was kidnapped from 
a supermarket parking lot near Walt Disney World. Her body was 
found two days later.

<HEADLINE> House Boosts Defense, Cuts F-22 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After approving $266 billion in defense  
spending, the House is leaving the fate of the Pentagon's top 
priority F-22 stealth jet fighter to negotiations with the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense bill includes a 4.8 percent military pay raise and  
$592 million to improve military life and step up lagging 
recruitment. It provides $15.5 billion more than last year's 
defense budget and tops President Clinton's request by $2.8 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., the Appropriations defense  
subcommittee chairman, who managed debate on the House floor, 
called it the first significant increase in a defense budget since 
the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tactic that gives House members leverage with senators in  
final defense budget talks, the House on Thursday approved the bill 
minus $3 billion the Pentagon wants for buying its first six 
production-line F-22s. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision not to restore $1.8 billion that Lewis' panel had  
deleted from F-22 procurement came with a parade of members lauding 
the $200 million-plus radar-evading aircraft as essential to future 
U.S. air superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	But no member called for a vote to restore funding, and the bill  
passed 379-45. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading a one-sided F-22 debate that obscured appropriators'  
concerns with its rising costs, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., held up a 
Pentagon ad declaring the F-22 the ``keystone for air dominance for 
the 21st century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several members, including Barr, have a stake in the F-22, with  
contractors and thousands of jobs spread across several states. The 
lead developer is Lockheed Martin, which oversees final assembly at 
its plant in Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	An Appropriations Committee report accompanying the bill says  
the military appears unable to control the F-22's cost and could 
maintain a 5-1 advanced fighter advantage through 2010 without it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force says two F-22s built for testing are performing  
like no other aircraft on Earth, and any pause in procurement will 
escalate costs beyond legal limits and kill the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed Services  
Committee, said he would seek a compromise on F-22 funding to 
continue the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, chairman of the subcommittee that cut the F-22 money,  
said he would carefully consider the funding in conference with the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of the day, we will do everything that is necessary  
to make certain there is no nation that will threaten us in 
tactical air (capability) in the future,'' Lewis promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Money from the F-22 would be diverted to other programs under  
the House legislation, including purchase of more F-15 and F-16 
fighters and KC-130J air tanker planes that were not in the Clinton 
administration's proposed budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's 4.8 percent pay increase for 1.4 million active  
military personnel tops the president's request of 4.4 percent. The 
bill also includes $300 million in bonuses for pilots, aimed at 
alleviating an Air Force shortage. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest procurement items are $2.7 billion for 36 F-18  
fighters, $856 million for 11 V-22 tilt rotor aircraft, $752 
million for the Navy's carrier replacement program and $749 million 
for a new attack submarine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis said the cut in F-22 funding sends a message to the  
military. The bill would retain $1.2 billion for research and 
development connected with the F-22 program, which seeks to build 
339 of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Air Force has such tremendous needs in so many other areas  
-- air tankers, airlift transports, aerial reconnaissance -- that we 
believe it is imperative for the Air Force to reassess its 
priorities,'' Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the only amendment approved on the House floor, high-caliber  
ammunition used by the military would be banned from sale to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, offered by Rep. Rod Blagojevich, D-Ill., came in  
response to a General Accounting Office report last month that some 
100,000 rounds designed for long-range military sniper weapons -- 
able to pierce armored limousines or bulletproof glass -- wound up 
in civilian hands.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's critically acclaimed  
series about a mobster in suburbia, captured a leading 16 Emmy 
nominations today and became the first cable program to be 
recognized in the best dramatic series category. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making strong showings with 13 nominations apiece were  
Fox's off-kilter comedy ``Ally McBeal,'' the ABC legal drama ``The 
Practice'' and the CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO also fielded only the second cable comedy series to earn a  
nomination, the risque program ``Sex and the City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the most nominated network, with 82 bids, was NBC, with HBO  
second with 74. ABC received 58 nominations, CBS had 46 and Fox 
received 33. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were announced by Camryn Manheim, who was nominated  
as best dramatic supporting actress for ``The Practice'' and by 
David Hyde Pierce, also a nominee for supporting comedy actor for 
``Frasier.'' The pair were winners in those categories last year.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert Posts Earnings Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MORRIS PLAINS, N.J. (AP) -- Warner-Lambert's second-quarter  
profits soared 36 percent due to accelerating sales of its top 
selling drug, the blockbuster cholesterol pill Lipitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert, which also makes such well known consumer  
products as Trident gum and Listerine mouthwash, earned $446.9 
million, or 51 cents per share in the second quarter, up from 
$329.1 million or 37 cents per share a year ago. Results matched 
Wall Street's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter rose 17 percent to $3.15 billion from  
$2.68 billion 
</P>
<P>
	Lipitor, the nation's top selling cholesterol drug and one of  
the top selling drugs worldwide, had sales of $886 million in the 
quarter, a 66 percent jump from a year ago. Lipitor, introduced in 
late 1997, has taken market share away from all its rivals, most 
notably, Merck's Zocor and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Pravachol. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert's pharmaceutical sales overall rose 26 percent to  
$1.9 billion, including foreign drug sales jumping 32 percent to 
$623 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of its the company's Neurontin anticonvulsant medicine  
rose 69 percent to $206 million, and sales of its AIDS drug 
Viracept rose 18 percent to $149 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer health care product sales rose 8 percent $731 million.  
Best sellers included Listerine, Sudafed and Zantac heartburn 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	In the company's confections segment, sales rose 3 percent to  
$483 million, but would have been up 9 percent if not for poor 
foreign exchange rates. Top products for the segment included 
Trident and Dentyne gums. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1999, profit rose 33 percent to  
$828.9 million, or 94 cents per share, from $622 million, or 71 
cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 23 percent for the six 
month period to $6.16 billion from $5.01 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Warner-Lambert on Thursday fell $2.25 to $67.56 1/4 on  
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Wash. Pediatrician Censured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- A state panel has censured a veteran  
pediatrician who had been accused of blocking an infant's breathing 
after he declared the baby brain dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Medical Quality Assurance Commission said Dr. Eugene  
Turner was incompetent and unprofessional in dealing with the 
3-day-old boy. But the board said it was an isolated incident in a 
39-year career and that he should not have his license revoked. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner has said efforts to revive Conor McInnerney were futile  
even before the child, who stopped breathing at home, was rushed to 
a Port Angeles hospital last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner first pronounced the infant dead around 10 p.m. on Jan.  
12, 1998. He was later called back to the hospital when staff 
noticed the baby gasping, but he told a nurse not to call the 
McInnerneys, saying it would be too much for them to endure their 
child dying twice, hospital reports say. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner again tried to resuscitate the infant but eventually  
decided the efforts were futile. He has said he pinched the baby's 
nose and covered the mouth with his hand, blocking the baby's 
airway until there was no detectable breathing or heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor will be allowed to resume his full practice. He has  
been under a restriction that required him to get a second opinion 
in life or death medical decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider this an almost total victory,'' Turner said after  
Wednesday's decision. ``We are so very, very happy, so relieved 
that this is over. Now I want to be able to melt into the 
woodwork.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew Knopp, the Seattle lawyer representing the infant's  
family, said the commission underscored that ``it is improper for a 
doctor to hasten any patient's death, let alone an innocent baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After attempting for several hours to resuscitate that baby,  
``he wanted to ease the pain and agony for everyone and chose to do 
what he did,'' said commission director Bonnie King. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a criminal charge of second-degree murder against  
Turner was dropped for lack of evidence. The baby's parents are 
considering suing the doctor.

<HEADLINE> TV Covers Burial Respectfully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The cameras that dogged John F. Kennedy Jr.  
during his lifetime were kept away from his final rites Thursday, 
leaving the TV networks with little more to show than a Navy 
destroyer sitting offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	News media boats were kept more than a mile awayy from the USS  
Briscoe, from which the ashes of Kennedy, his wife Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette were dropped into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The event took hours, and from time to time, off-camera  
correspondents confessed to not knowing what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we watch from a distance, we really don't know much about  
the details and in some way, that's quite appropriate, because 
that's the way the Kennedy family would like it,'' MSNBC anchorman 
John Seigenthaler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 9 a.m., family members dressed in dark clothing boarded  
the Coast Guard cutter Sanibel, which took them to the Briscoe, in 
Woods Hole. The mourners included Kennedy's sister, Caroline 
Kennedy; his uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy; and cousins Maria 
Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, 
</P>
<P>
	From the Woods Hole port, MSNBC's Dan Abrams spoke of the  
gathered onlookers. 
</P>
<P>
	They were ``watching, but without really being able to see  
almost anything with the naked eye,'' Abrams reported. ``And yet 
there was the sense that people wanted to feel like they were part 
of this funeral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC, CBS and NBC each aired about an hour of live coverage  
Thursday morning. CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC stayed with the 
story throughout. It was about seven hours before the family 
returned to shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Three miles from the vessel, CNN's Frank Buckley reported from a  
tugboat while the picture bobbed and rocked. 
</P>
<P>
	The quick recovery of the bodies and restrictions placed on  
aircraft at Martha's Vineyard rendered moot a question that had 
been discussed in several TV newsrooms: whether to air pictures of 
the bodies if anyone got them. Network officials had said they 
would be respectful and tasteful. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite extensive time devoted to the story in the past week,  
and a surge in viewership, TV has scrambled to find something to 
show. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for Kennedy's plane and its passengers, reported  
missing on Saturday morning, led to lengthy shots of boats and 
aircraft. Meanwhile, the families remained secluded as the hours 
and days passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the on-site coverage found correspondents and cameras  
clustered outside the Kennedy estate in Hyannis Port, a fact which 
CBS' Anthony Mason felt obliged to acknowledge last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the noise you hear in the background,'' he explained to  
viewers, ``is the hordes of journalists who are flocked there at 
the edge of the Kennedy compound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From the same spot Thursday afternoon, CNN's Martin Savidge  
mused on the significance of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	It started out gloomy, he said. ``And then, as the service  
progressed, the day seemed to brighten. And in a lot of ways, you 
could probably get the sense that that is how the Kennedy family is 
beginning to feel.''

<HEADLINE> Colts' Top Draft Picks Unsigned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- The Indianapolis Colts opened preseason  
training camp Thursday with their top two draft picks unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no news on negotiations for running back Edgerrin  
James, the team's top pick, and linebacker Mike Peterson, selected 
in the second round with the 36th pick overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd like everybody to be here, and I'm not trying to say  
that it doesn't matter. But, I'm not upset because I didn't expect 
them here,'' coach Jim Mora said. ``They'll get here eventually, 
until then we'll coach the guys that we've got. ... I can't worry 
about who is not here, and I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback Peyton Manning was understanding of the absence of  
James, who earlier had promised that he would be signed in time for 
the start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want Edgerrin to be here as soon as possible. He is a young  
player, just like I was last year. The more training camp time you 
can have, the better you are going to be for the rest of the 
season,'' said Manning, who went on to set rookie passing records 
despite the five days of camp he missed last year. ``Having been 
there last year, I know what he's going through. I know he wants to 
be here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows that because of how hard he worked in the  
months of May and June. Hopefully, his agent will be able to get it 
done as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Colts did make some progress on the signing front, however,  
inking four other draft picks: defensive back Paul Miranda, 
defensive end Brad Scioli, punter Hunter Smith and linebacker Corey 
Terry. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the team announced that exclusive rights free agent  
Mike Vanderjagt, who made 27-of-31 field goals and all 23 of his 
extra point kicks in his NFL debut last year, had signed a new 
contract.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon Condors Get Brazen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The California condors that have been  
reintroduced to the wild are getting a little too friendly at the 
Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of soaring high above the limestone cliffs, many are  
swooping down into parking lots and fishing camps in search of 
handouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unnerving to have this happen,'' said Michael Wallace, a  
specialist at the Zoological Society of San Diego who led the 
multi-agency recovery effort to bring California condors to Arizona 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep man and condor apart, authorities plan to close outlook  
points and trails whenever the birds come into view. People will be 
asked to stay at least 300 feet away. Wildlife specialists will try 
to train condors to fear humans by screaming and flapping their 
arms when the birds get too close. 
</P>
<P>
	And in backwoods areas, ``we will encourage campers to make a  
run at the condors'' to scare them off, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	The baldheaded, dull-gray condor is North America's largest  
bird. With wingspans of 9 feet, they can ride thermal updrafts for 
hours, reach speeds of 55 mph and altitudes of 15,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past century, poisoning by ranchers and encroaching  
urbanization brought them to brink of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, six condors were brought to the Vermilion  
Cliffs near the Grand Canyon. Now, about 15 reintroduced condors 
live in the area, roaming freely from Zion National Park in Utah to 
the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	But these condors are adolescents and naturally curious. They  
are mixing with humans because there are no adults to show them how 
to behave. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't really know what they're doing,'' Wallace said.  
``They have to gradually learn how to become condors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although good for bird watchers, visits from the endangered  
birds have been disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a man shot and killed a 4-year-old female condor that  
had gotten too close to his campsite. A second condor was returned 
to captivity in April after it kept approaching river rafters and 
waddled onto an airstrip near the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take time before condors learn to avoid people, Wallace  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember that these birds evolved at an arm's  
length from saber-toothed cats,'' he said. ``They don't scare away 
easily.''

<HEADLINE> Faulk a No-Show at Rams' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACOMB, Ill. (AP) -- Running back Marshall Faulk, still waiting  
for a new contract from his new team, was a no-show Thursday as St. 
Louis Rams players assembled for training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dick Vermeil didn't seem surprised when Faulk missed the  
first team meeting Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``About yesterday afternoon, I started figuring he probably  
wouldn't be here,'' Vermeil said. ``Hey, I don't worry about him 
until he gets here, that's always been my approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk, the NFL's best all-purpose back last year with 1,316  
yards and 86 receptions, has two years to go on the deal he signed 
out of college that pays him $2.2 million a year. Agent Rocky 
Arceneaux and the Rams have discussed a long-term contract that 
would pay him $5 million a year but have been hung up on the amount 
of money in the signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Arceneaux wants more money up front than the $8 million bonus  
the Rams have offered because NFL contracts aren't guaranteed. 
Vermeil said he hadn't discussed the situation Thursday with Jay 
Zygmunt, a team vice president who negotiates contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The backfield scenario is a familiar one for guard Adam  
Timmerman, a free agent pickup from the Green Bay Packers who 
recalled Dorsey Levins' holdout last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody knows it's business when it comes down to  
contract time,'' Timmerman said. ``It's nice, though, to have your 
team intact when you come into camp. I think that's important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other players appeared unconcerned.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'll see him when I see him,'' defensive tackle D'Marco Farr  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Faulk arrives, Greg Hill is the No. 1 running back. Hill,  
who ran for 240 yards in two games before a season-ending broken 
leg last year, didn't believe this gave him an early shot to 
impress the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about anything when Marshall ain't here,''  
Hill said. ``Marshall's got to worry about what I'm doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulk and linebacker Leonard Little, whose flight out of  
Knoxville, Tenn., was canceled due to weather problems, were the 
only players not in camp early Thursday night. Little, suspended by 
the NFL for the first eight games of the regular season after 
pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter in a fatal auto 
accident, was expected to arrive later Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Elway-Less Broncos To Begin Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREELEY, Colo. (AP) -- There's a new face in the secondary, cover  
specialist Dale Carter, and for the first time in 10 years there's 
no Steve Atwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Tackle Matt Lepsis steps up to a starting role in the offensive  
line because of the departure of Harry Swayne, and there could be a 
three-way battle for the strong safety spot. The third and fourth 
wide receiver positions could be wide open. 
</P>
<P>
	And oh, did we mention that quarterback John Elway is gone after  
16 brilliant seasons? 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Broncos will have a decidedly different look when  
they begin pursuit of an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl 
title. Players report to training camp Friday, with the first 
workouts set for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway, who threw for 51,475 yards and 300 touchdowns while  
becoming the winningest quarterback in NFL history with 148 
victories, officially retired on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Replacing the future Hall of Famer, whose 47 game-saving drives  
are the most in NFL history, is journeyman Bubby Brister. 
Second-year pro Brian Griese is the backup, and veteran Chris 
Miller, out of football since 1995 because of a series of 
concussions, is No. 3. That order could change, but for now that's 
the way coach Mike Shanahan wants it. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them understand there's a pecking order that you start  
out with,'' Shanahan said. ``All three of our quarterbacks want to 
be the guy, and that's the situation you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his two seasons in Denver, Brister has mastered the Broncos'  
sophisticated offensive scheme, and last year he led Denver to a 
4-0 record in games he started in place of the injured Elway. His 
biggest obstacle, he knows, will be withstanding the inevitable 
comparisons to Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weeks that we're not successful are going to be tough,''  
Brister said. ``I'm going to hear, `Well, if John would have been 
there, we probably would have won.' 
</P>
<P>
	``You think somebody's supposed to take over for John Elway and  
it's going to be easy? It's going to be tough, but I accept the 
challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quarterback notwithstanding, the Broncos might actually be a  
stronger team in 1999. NFL MVP Terrell Davis, coming off a 
2,008-yard rushing season, appears geared for a repeat performance, 
the offensive line remains one of the league's best, the receiver 
corps is competent and the defense, bolstered by Carter, should be 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part, it should be a happy camp. Linebacker Bill  
Romanowski and center Tom Nalen received five-year contract 
extensions this week, and defensive tackle Keith Traylor had his 
contract restructured with incentives to boost his pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The schedule, however, is brutal, and it starts with a 15-hour  
flight to Australia for a preseason game against San Diego on Aug. 
7. The Broncos open the regular season with a Monday night game 
against Miami on Sept. 13 at Mile High Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Long Love of Ocean for Kennedy Clan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- John F. Kennedy Jr. will spend eternity where  
generations of his family have sought escape, solace and recreation 
-- at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all came from the sea,'' his father, the 35th president, a  
Navy veteran and an avid sailor, said in 1962. ``We are tied to the 
ocean. And when we go back to the sea -- whether it is to sail or to 
watch it -- we are going back from whence we came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the ashes of JFK Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette were dropped into the 
sea off Martha's Vineyard, near the spot where they were killed 
when Kennedy's plane crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That the sea would factor in so largely in his death is rather  
ironic,'' said Wendy Northcross, vice chair of the John F. Kennedy 
Hyannis Museum. ``And his remains will ultimately stay with the 
sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being lost at sea five days, the three bodies were  
recovered by Navy divers Wednesday from the twisted wreckage 116 
feet underwater. The site is in view of the beachside estate 
Kennedy and his sister, Caroline, inherited from their mother, 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, was piloting the plane to Martha's Vineyard on  
Friday to drop off Lauren Bessette and then head to a family 
wedding at the Kennedy compound at Hyannis Port. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy compound was the family's retreat from the glare of  
public attentino. The Kennedys could escape out back, onto Hyannis 
Harbor, where the wind could carry them away from the cares they 
left on land. 
</P>
<P>
	Sailing was a passionate rite of summer at Hyannis Port when  
John F. Kennedy was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They learned to compete on the sea,'' said Evan Thomas,  
assistant managing editor at Newsweek. ``And all those sailboat 
races was one of the arenas where they learned to live life and 
fight hard. When war came, they chose to fight on the sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In smooth times and rough, the family has taken to the sea.  
</P>
<P>
	Even as they awaited word on the search effort for JFK Jr.,  
family members, including his aunt Ethel Kennedy, took to the water 
in boats. 
</P>
<P>
	As a toddler, JFK Jr. was photographed in a beached dingy with  
his father. As a teen, he sailed off Hawaii with a cousin. As a 
man, he and his sister cruised aboard the aircraft carrier named 
for their father. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he remains in the American memory as the brave little  
soldier who saluted his father's casket on his third birthday, Nov. 
25, 1963, Kennedy never served in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a poignancy when you think of the images of his  
father's funeral,'' Thomas said. ``To see JFK Jr. carried to sea in 
that destroyer does echo his father's funeral. You think of hearing 
the Navy Hymn played over and over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The young Kennedy was at ease behind the controls of a motorboat  
and was frequently seen windsurfing off Martha's Vineyard or 
paddling a sea kayak near the compound. Pictures of him emerging 
from the waters off Hyannis Port in his swim trunks were published 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt he shared his family's romance with the  
sea, perhaps as a link to the father he hardly knew. 
</P>
<P>
	Few were as passionate about the sea as the 35th president, who  
sailed throughout his life and became a hero for rescuing crew 
members of the sunken patrol-torpedo boat, PT-109, he commanded in 
the Pacific during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	At the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston, where  
visitors streamed in to sign the condolence book this week, the 
late president's sailboat, Victura, sits outside near Dorchester 
Bay, and his words about the sea are inscribed on the wall.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Proposes Campaign Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley  
on Thursday cast Vice President Al Gore and Texas governor George 
W. Bush as hypocrites who criticize unregulated contributions to 
political parties even as they plot how to use them. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who himself has raised millions under the current  
campaign finance framework, also proposed rewriting the rules to 
reduce the role of money and to make it easier to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	If he is the Democratic nominee for president, Bradley said, he  
will run without soft money if the Republican candidate agrees to 
do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``Big money gets in the way'' of democracy, the former  
three-term senator from New Jersey told a luncheon audience at the 
National Press Club. ``It's like a great stone wall that comes 
between the people and their representatives, a great wall that 
prevents one from hearing the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said Gore and Bush ``have both said they support  
changing the soft money system. However, both reportedly have 
directed their top fundraisers to begin raising soft money for the 
general election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Soft money'' refers to unregulated party contributions.  
Republican hopeful John McCain, the Arizona senator pushing 
legislation to ban soft money, has also promised not to use soft 
money if he is his party's presidential nominee next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by an audience member whether he would accept an  
invitation to be Gore's vice presidential running mate, Bradley 
answered with two syllables: ``Uh, no.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's comments about money in politics come as his own  
success at fundraising is boosting his underdog campaign. Recent 
campaign filings showed Bradley has raised $11 million this year, 
compared to Gore's $18 million. Bradley was scheduled to attend a 
fundraiser in Washington just hours after his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson called  
Bradley a ``newfound reformist'' who, as a senator, ``always milked 
the system for all he could get.'' And Bush spokeswoman Mindy 
Tucker said the Texas governor does support banning soft money 
contributions from corporations and labor unions. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Coelho, chairman of the Gore campaign, said Bradley ``would  
leave every Democratic candidate, from school board to U.S. 
senator, to fend for themselves while George W. Bush and the 
Republican money machine try to buy the election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Money in politics has been an interest of Bradley's since high  
school, when he wrote a paper on the fundraising prowess of William 
McKinley in the presidential campaign of 1896. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has expressed regret over his own fundraising success  
while seeking reelection in 1990. He was nearly upset by his 
little-known and under-funded Republican opponent, Christie 
Whitman, now the New Jersey governor, who mocked him relentlessly 
for raising nearly $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my 1990 campaign, money proved to be my Achilles' heel,''  
Bradley would later write. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Bradley proposed reforming campaign finance without  
instituting public funding. He said Senate campaigns should be 
funded largely through tax return check-offs of up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	But after three years of consideration, Bradley now says public  
funding is the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
	For congressional primaries, Bradley proposes doubling the  
government's current 1-to-1 match of small individual contributions 
that are $250 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	General elections under Bradley's plan would be wholly financed  
by public money -- so long as candidates limit their spending to an 
amount based on local population and media costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser said public funding of  
congressional campaigns would cost less than $1 billion each 
election. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley would exempt from individual contribution limits --  
currently $1,000 -- personal, grassroots expenditures like printing 
up bumper stickers or fliers. He also called for free television 
time for candidates 60 days before an election. To increase public 
participation in elections, Bradley proposed allowing people to 
show up, register and vote. 
</P>
<P>
	He endorsed vote-by-mail programs, such as Oregon's, and  
suggested legislation requiring employers to give employees at 
least two hours off to vote. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, Bradley said it is ``reasonable'' for Congress  
to consider tax cuts at a time of budget surplus, but said his 
first choice for using surplus funds would be child poverty 
programs and health care for the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley praised Clinton on the issue of race, saying the  
president ``has moved our collective humanity an inch or so forward 
on that issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the uproar over foreign money in the 1996  
presidential race, and of Chinese espionage at U.S. nuclear labs, 
only exacerbated this country's poor record on ``skin color and eye 
shape.''

<HEADLINE> 30-yr Fixed-Rate Mortgage Rates Off / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages edged down to 7.52 percent this week, marking 
the third straight weekly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was down from 7.58 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates, however, had been creeping up for the past two  
months. So far this year, they have hit a low of 6.74 percent set 
at the end of January to a high of 7.71 percent set at the 
beginning of this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amid signs of a small slowdown in the economy, mortgage rates  
seem to be stabilizing around 7.5 percent,'' said Robert Van Order, 
chief economist for Freddie Mac. ``However, after Federal Reserve 
Chairman Greenspan spoke this morning ... long rates began to rise 
so we will probably see rates a little higher next week,'' he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	In congressional testimony Thursday, Greenspan said the Fed  
would be ``especially alert to inflation risks,'' raising the 
specter of additional interest rate increases if the economy shows 
signs of overheating. On the comments, yields on long-term Treasury 
bonds rose in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing, also  
declined in the latest Freddie Mac survey, dropping to an average 
7.16 percent this week from 7.19 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.97 percent this week, the same as the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Wright Put On DL With Sore Shoulder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jaret Wright was placed on the 15-day disabled  
list Thursday, four days after a strained right shoulder forced him 
to leave his last start. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring 10 of the last 11 hitters he faced against  
Houston on Sunday, the right-hander left complaining of stiffness 
between his right shoulder blade and spine after five innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll miss two starts,'' manager Mike Hargrove said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove said that Tom Candiotti would take Wright's spot in the  
rotation and start Friday night in New York against the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The 23-year-old joins catcher Sandy Alomar, third baseman Travis  
Fryman, outfielder Wil Cordero and pitchers Tom Martin and Steve 
Karsay on the team's disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll come through this fine,'' Wright said. ``Other than that,  
I don't want to talk about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Chris Haney was purchased from Triple-A Buffalo to  
replace Wright on the active roster. To make room for Haney on the 
40-man roster, left-hander Mike Matthews was designated for 
assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright is 7-6 with a 5.88 ERA in 19 games.

<HEADLINE> Chairman Opposes IMF Gold Sale Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a blow to debt relief for the world's  
poorest countries, the House Banking Committee chairman said 
Thursday it is unlikely his panel will approve selling some of the 
International Monetary Fund's gold reserves to finance the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said that in early September he would  
propose an alternative to the plan to sell 10 million ounces of IMF 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Treasury official, acknowledging the mounting  
opposition in Congress, said the administration is considering 
other ideas, but ``at this point ... it is the only viable option 
that has broad international support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in a telephone  
interview, said the administration wants to work closely with 
lawmakers to gain broad support. 
</P>
<P>
	Any alternative, the official said, could not upset the world  
gold market and would have to win acceptable by the IMF's 182 
member nations. It also would need to ``mobilize adequate 
financing'' for a new debt initiative program the United States and 
six other wealthy nations announced last month. 
</P>
<P>
	One option said to be under consideration would mean selling  
part of the IMF gold to central banks instead of on the open 
market, which could drive gold price even lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach said before the committee hearing that it was ``highly  
unlikely'' the committee would endorse the administration's 
proposal that would permit the IMF to sell 10 percent of its gold 
reserves to finance debt relief for the world's poorest countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Debt relief is a societal -- indeed moral imperative -- but care  
must be taken not to jeopardize the mining industry that provides 
many of the most stable jobs in the developing world, '' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leach gave no details on his proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, the leaders of the other major economic  
powers and Michel Camdessus, the IMF's managing director, want the 
IMF gold sales to fund the $2.7 billion cost of helping cut debt 
burdens among developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the U.S. representative on the IMF board can vote in  
favor of the gold sales plan, Congress must give its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF board plans to hold a vote on the gold sales proposal in  
late September, but the tight congressional timetable in the weeks 
ahead might make that difficult.

<HEADLINE> Akers Chooses Camp Over Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- Deciding whether to hobnob with President  
Clinton or coach the next generation of soccer players was not a 
hard choice for World Cup soccer champion Michele Akers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old eschewed the post-victory celebrations of the  
U.S. women's championship team, including a trip to the White 
House, to work in a summer soccer camp. On Thursday, about 400 
young soccer players showed their appreciation with wild cheers. 
</P>
<P>
	She was emotional and surprised by the large and eager crowd.  
</P>
<P>
	``I expected maybe three people,'' she said later.  
</P>
<P>
	The Washington state native said the past year has been an  
emotional roller coaster of victories and losses and battling her 
personal challenges, including the chronic fatigue syndrome that 
leaves her feeling like she has the flu every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough year and a tough career,'' she told the  
crowd. ``I've been on the U.S. team 14 years and not all of it has 
been easy. I've been beat up a bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Akers credited her strong Christian faith, her family, coaches  
and fans for sustaining her.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Expects Union Endoresement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Patrick J. Buchanan's presidential campaign is  
expected to pick up the endorsement of a labor union in West 
Virginia that has taken heart in his protective stand on trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Independent Steelworkers Union, a group of 4,100 Weirton  
Steel Corp. workers not affiliated with the AFL-CIO or the United 
Steelworkers of America, planned a ``major announcement'' Monday 
when the GOP candidate visits Weirton. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, neither Buchanan's spokesman nor ISU spokesman  
David Gossett would say specifically that an endorsement was in the 
offing. But Gossett said the executive committee of the union, 
which never before has endorsed a presidential candidate, had taken 
action on an endorsement and would announce its decision Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The steel industry has been hard hit by a surge in low-priced  
imports from Japan and other countries, and Buchanan has been an 
outspoken critic of free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been supportive of him because of his position on  
that,'' Gossett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration trade policy has caused Vice President Al  
Gore's presidential campaign some headaches as he tries to court 
the endorsement of labor, a close ally of the Democrats. Bill 
Bradley, Gore's only challenger for his party's nomination, has 
been courting union support. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of unions have a lot of questions they want to ask Mr.  
Gore and Mr. Bradley as well,'' said Bill Klinefelter, the United 
Steelworkers of America's political director. ``I don't think we've 
gotten the necessary details and commitments out of anybody.''

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Weapons Computers Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly all U.S. defense computers linked to  
nuclear weapons have been verified through testing as ready for the 
Year 2000 computer glitch, senior Pentagon officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no risk of accidental launch'' or of losing the  
ability to fire U.S. weapons if necessary, Adm. Richard Mies, 
commander of U.S. Strategic Command, told a news conference. His 
command at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., is in charge of all U.S. 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperation with Russia on Y2K issues has suffered as a result  
of Moscow's anger about the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Mies and 
other Pentagon officials said, but efforts are under way to restore 
a dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	Mies said there is no reason to believe nuclear powers Britain,  
Russia and China are failing to fix their computer systems; he did 
not comment directly on the other known nuclear powers -- France, 
India and Pakistan. Mies also cautioned that he is not certain 
about the vulnerability of defense computers used by nuclear powers 
other than Russia and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly I have concerns, but to some degree we've tried to  
reassure ourselves and we've tried to gain assurances from those 
countries that they are addressing the Y2K problem, and so to a 
certain degree our confidence is limited by the amount of 
assurances we have gotten,'' Mies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen, appearing with Mies at the  
Pentagon, said he is not worried that Russia will allow the Y2K 
problem to jeopardize command or control of its nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russians, I assume, will do whatever is necessary to  
protect their self interest,'' Cohen said. ``It is not in Russia's 
interest to have any kind of failure that would create a 
catastrophe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for China, which has only a handful of long-range nuclear  
weapons, Cohen said ``we assume they are also proceeding with as 
much alacrity as possible to deal'' with potential computer 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Mies said there is very little concern about Britain's  
preparations, in part because the British Navy uses the same 
Trident nuclear missile system as the U.S. Navy uses. 
</P>
<P>
	At home, Mies said, there is no basis to fear a Y2K glitch would  
affect control of U.S. nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Procedures for launching our nation's nuclear weapons involve  
multiple levels of safeguards such as code verifications and human 
interactions to verify and authenticate an order from the 
president,'' Mies said. ``Computers by themselves cannot launch 
nuclear weapons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, Mies said fears that a Y2K computer bug will shut  
down the U.S. nuclear arsenal are unfounded, based on extensive 
tests that included simulations of launches of every type of 
nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he had been ``deeply concerned'' a year ago that the  
Defense Department was moving too slowly to prepare for Y2K. Since 
then, he said, the department has gone all out to test and validate 
its computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am reassured and confident that we will defeat the Y2K  
attack when it comes on Jan. 1, 2000,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. nuclear weapons include bombs carried by Air Force planes,  
strategic missiles carried aboard Navy submarines and 
intercontinental ballistic missiles in underground silos at Air 
Force bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 2,107 computers systems deemed critical to the Defense  
Department's missions, 92 percent have been fully verified as ready 
for Y2K, Cohen said, and there will be 100 percent compliance by 
Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, of the 198 computers considered critical to nuclear  
missions, all but two have been fully verified, Mies said. Those 
two are scheduled to be ready by October, he said. One is a new 
``bomber planning'' system, and the other is a command center 
console at Strategic Command headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon has invited Moscow to send representatives to the  
new Y2K Center for Strategic Stability, in Colorado Springs, Colo., 
but the Russians have not responded, Cohen aides said. The facility 
is meant to avoid any misunderstandings about missile launches on 
Dec. 31 or thereafter as a result of computer glitches, by sharing 
U.S. missile launch warning data with the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said he had hoped to meet with his Russian counterpart,  
Igor Sergeyev, in Moscow in early August to discuss Y2K and other 
issues, but the session was postponed by the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Y2K problem, some older computers were designed to  
recognize dates in a two-digit format, such as ``99'' for 1999. 
There is concern computers not updated may malfunction on New 
Year's Eve, when 1999 turns to 2000 -- which some computers may 
misconstrue as 1900 instead of the start of the new century.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Hires Replacement Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball, not waiting for its squabbling umpires  
to resign, hired 10 minor league umps Thursday to take their place 
later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Making their first response to the mass resignations,  
commissioner Bud Selig and his top officials hired the Triple-A 
replacements, who had been working as vacation fill-ins. They were 
notified they were being added to major league staffs on a 
permanent basis starting Sept. 1 - the day before the resignations 
were to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The bickering umpires have split into two camps - those for and  
against union head Richie Phillips. The faction backing him is 
mostly in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are having a hard time deciding whether to follow Phillips.  
For example, American League ump Greg Kosc resigned, withdrew it, 
then quit again. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 33 of the 36 NL plan to quit, according to a count by  
The Associated Press, but only about half of the AL's 32 umpires 
plan to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires on each side have been pressuring their wavering  
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of this is all posturing, negotiating tactics,'' said AL  
ump Tim McClelland, who hasn't quit yet but says he intends to. 
``You have to take it with a grain of salt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's decision to hire new umpires wasn't expected so soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of their strategy, but I don't know what their  
strategy is yet,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 51 major league umpires held a conference call  
Thursday morning to discuss their position, NL umpire Bruce 
Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a lot more solidarity than there was two or  
three days ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were some umpires who felt Phillips had to go.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am adamantly opposed to this kind of leadership,'' said the  
AL's Dave Phillips, who is no relation to the union head. ``There 
are times when you pull out your gun, your mortar and go 
winner-take-all. But communication and negotiation are the most 
important ingredients we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips said he has been opposed by an AL faction that  
existed since before the 1995 lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not like me personally, do not like my style and  
believe I'm too confrontational a lawyer,'' he said. ``The media is 
providing them with a forum. Fifty-five guys say Richie Phillips is 
the greatest thing that ever happened to officiating in any sport 
and has won battle after battle after battle for us since 1978.''

<HEADLINE> Armstrong: Press Victimized Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAU, France (AP) -- With his name cleared by cycling authorities,  
Lance Armstrong says he was the victim of a French media campaign 
to unsettle him during his bid to win the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Texan said the unfounded drug abuse claims for  
the last week marred his performance during two days of climbing in 
the Pyrenees Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want me to crack on the bike -- and I'm not going to,'' he  
said defiantly on Wednesday after emerging from the last day of 
climbs in the Pyrenees with a commanding lead of 6 minutes, 15 
seconds. ``It's vulture journalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making a startling comeback from testicular cancer,  
is now just four days from what appears to be a probable triumph in 
cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	He looks stronger than ever. With the climbing done, he now  
faces two flat stages, a time trial -- where he excels -- and the 
arrival in Paris on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	For two days, the French newspaper Le Monde has reported traces  
of a corticosteroid were detected in his urine, and that of other 
riders as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs that  
are not classed as steroids. They are banned unless prescribed by 
doctors for conditions such as asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body confirmed Wednesday the only drug  
Armstrong has been taking is an authorized skin cream for saddle 
sores. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said he has been ``persecuted,'' and that drug  
accusations that he believes will inevitably be leveled at leaders 
at the Tour de France in the future ``is bad for cycling and for 
the Tour de France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his closest competitors, Alex Zulle, doubts he is strong  
enough to catch Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great cyclist, one who is driven by huge motivation and  
determination,'' said the Swiss, who is third in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	The French media began sniping at Armstrong a week ago after he  
powered to victory in the Alps, intimating only banned drugs can 
explain his dramatic success. 
</P>
<P>
	After being diagnosed in October 1996, he had surgery to remove  
his right testicle and brain lesions, then underwent three months 
of chemotherapy. He was out for the 1997 season and only began his 
comeback last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong described the accusations as the latest example of  
people not believing in him. First, he said, few gave him a chance 
of beating cancer. Then teams were reluctant to employ him because 
of his medical history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a story of not being given chances,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He looked composed throughout the race Wednesday, never letting  
his closest rivals, Fernando Escartin and Zulle, out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
	The three sat on each other's wheels right to the end: Zulle  
came in 10th, Armstrong 11th and Escartin 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's stage was won by Spain's David Etxebarria -- his second  
stage victory this year. In second place was Carlos Contreras of 
Colombia, and Alberto Elli of Italy was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong finished only 21 seconds behind.  
</P>
<P>
	The 16th stage was a 120-mile ride from Lannemezan, a small town  
in the Pyrenees foothills to Pau, once the home of French King 
Henri IV. 
</P>
<P>
	The climbs were higher than Tuesday, the second of three  
reaching a height of 6,980 feet. The riders scaled peaks swathed in 
thick fog, unable to see anything at altitude except pine trees at 
the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Only at the summit of the Col de Mente mountain pass did they  
glimpse blue sky after rising above the clouds to a jagged mountain 
plateau where goats grazed. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's race is a relatively flat 125-mile stage between Mourenx  
and Bordeaux.

<HEADLINE> Cruise Line Paying $18M Dumping Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. says its days of  
polluting the seas are over. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry's second-largest company has agreed to pay a record  
$18 million criminal fine and plead guilty to 21 felony counts for 
dumping oil and hazardous chemicals in U.S. water and lying about 
it to the Coast Guard, Attorney General Janet Reno said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it is strictly monitoring its ships'  
environmental procedures and rigging them with cleaner equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	A five-year investigation showed Royal Caribbean vessels used  
``secret bypass pipes'' to dump waste oil and hazardous materials 
overboard, often at night, Reno said. Ship personnel also falsified 
log books that employees called by a Norwegian term meaning ``fairy 
tale book,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials said Royal Carribean engaged in the  
dumping to save the cost of properly disposing of its waste while 
promoting itself as environmentally friendly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Royal Caribbean polluted the very environment on which its  
business relies,'' Reno said at a news conference in Washington. 
``They dumped everywhere; at sea, in port, at sensitive 
environmental areas ... they didn't care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sanction, the highest of its kind, brings to $27 million the  
amount of government fines paid by Royal Caribbean since last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Company president Jack Williams said the leisure line is  
``profoundly sorry that a group of our employees knowingly violated 
environmental laws and our own company policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the government probe began, Royal Caribbean has manned  
each of its 16 vessels with an environmental officer to monitor 
treatment of bilge water and other procedures, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	A management team has been created to monitor shipboard  
environmental procedures, new engines and water treatment equipment 
are being installed and more frequent ship audits will be held, 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Williams said, the company has spent up to $90,000  
per ship to install new oily water treatment systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a better company because of this investigation,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royal Caribbean probe began in October 1994 when Coast Guard  
officials noticed an oil slick behind the ship Sovereign of the 
Seas as it approached San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	From the time Coast Guard officials first boarded the ship to a  
second boarding four days later, a bypass pipe inside the ship was 
dismantled and removed, said Steve Solow, chief of the Justice 
Department's environmental crimes section. 
</P>
<P>
	Solow said hazardous chemicals dumped by the ships came from dry  
cleaning, photographic developing and print shops. 
</P>
<P>
	Six other cruise lines have pleaded guilty to illegal waste  
dumping since 1993, and paid fines ranging up to $1 million.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Stock Down on Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Amazon.com's stock plunged almost 13 percent  
today after the giant Internet retailer reported that its losses 
widened in the second quarter as it increased its spending to 
expand its online businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	While Amazon.com reported a steep loss in the quarter, its sales  
grew by 171 percent from a year ago and the company's customer base 
rose by 2.3 million to 10.7 million, three times larger than what 
it was in June 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its earnings report, which was released after the close  
of markets Wednesday, Amazon.com also announced that its board had 
approved a 2-for-1 stock split. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle-based company's stock was down $16.06 1/4 at $109.37 1/2  
in afternoon trading today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Seattle-based Amazon.com lost $138 million, or 86 cents a share,  
in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $22.6 million 
or 15 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding $55.2 million of merger, acquisition,  
investment-related costs and stock-based compensation charges, the 
loss was $82.8 million or $0.51 per share. That matched the 
earnings' estimates of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for the quarter grew to $314.4 million, up from $116  
million a year earlier. Since the start of its fiscal year, sales 
are $608 million -- just $2 million short of what its total sales 
were for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	While Amazon.com has yet to turn a profit in its four years in  
business, the company hasn't stopped spending money to make itself 
into a more diversified online retailer and expand its customer 
base. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 14 months, the company has gone from being  
exclusively an online bookseller into an Internet shopping hub 
offering music, videos, auctions and electronic greeting cards. 
Just last week, Amazon.com added toys and electronics to its site. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com also has also invested millions of dollars in recent  
months in online pharmacy drugstore.com, Internet pet shop 
Pets.com, cybersupermarket HomeGrocer.com and online sporting goods 
store Gear.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that 70 percent of its orders in the second  
quarter came from repeat customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com said it will continue to expand its distribution  
systems and product offerings. In addition, the company plans to 
add more personnel. More than 4,000 people now work for the 
4-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
	The online retailer also said it expects to invest more heavily  
in its operations this year than it has in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1999, Amazon.com had a loss of  
$199.7 million or $1.26 a share. That compares with a loss of $32.9 
million or 23 cents a share on net sales of $203.3 million a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding merger and acquisition, investment and stock-based  
compensation costs, Amazon.com lost $119.1 million, or 75 cents a 
share, in the first half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock split will occur on Sept. 1 for shareholders of record  
on Aug. 12. The last stock split was 3-for-1 in January.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Close Mixed / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures finished mixed Thursday  
on the Chicago Board of Trade as more moderate weather was expected 
in Midwest growing states. 
</P>
<P>
        After an early spike in futures prices prompted by higher-than-normal  
temperatures in key growing states, including Illinois and Iowa, corn 
futures closed up only slightly amid news that the Midwest heat wave 
is not likely to last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
        The National Weather Service was predicting continued hot weather,  
but private forecasting services showed moderating temperatures, likely 
to cause less harm to crops. 
</P>
<P>
        Soybeans closed lower as traders awaited more extensive Midwest  
forecasts for the next week. Soybeans are hardier than corn and can 
tolerate heat longer. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat got an early boost after weekly export sales exceeded  
expectations, but heavy commercial selling countered the early gains. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery rose 1/2 cent to $2.70 a bushel;  
December corn rose 1/4 cent to $2.15 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1 1/2 cents to $1.16 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents 
to $4.56 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
        Beef and pork futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
        August live cattle rose 1 cent to 65.22 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose 1.28 cents to 77.35 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
rose 2 cents to 46.87 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose 3 cents 
to 40.60 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Starr To Address Conservative Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who  
has been widely criticized for his ties to Republican causes, is 
the planned keynote speaker before a conservative group this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A Democratic candidate for senator has denounced Starr's  
scheduled appearance before the Center of the American Experiment, 
an organization that bills itself as Minnesota's conservative think 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Fund-raiser sponsorships for the event are being sold for up to  
$5,000, and individual seats are priced at $75. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lillehaug, a former U.S. attorney, said Starr's  
participation in the fund-raiser ``looks wrong, smells wrong and is 
wrong.'' Starr has investigated President Clinton's administration 
for more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lillehaug wrote to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno asking her  
to look into Starr's planned appearance in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, Lillehaug said his beef is not with the group  
itself and acknowledged that he has attended a few of the 
organization's events in the past. But he believes that Starr 
should steer away from addressing a group with such a clear 
ideological thrust. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heaven knows he's received enough warnings ... that he should  
maintain an appearance of being impartial,'' Lillehaug said. ``He's 
just not listening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office defended the appearance.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a respectable group that has hosted such luminaries as  
Colin Powell and Margaret Thatcher. Judge Starr looks forward to 
returning to Minnesota where he has many close friends,'' said Ed 
Page, deputy independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitch Pearlstein, president of the Center of the American  
Experiment, called Lillehaug's complaint ``sleaze-bucket 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no apology to make whatsoever that we hold events to  
make money,'' Pearlstein said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Markets Fall; Tokyo Plunges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stocks closed mostly lower Thursday  
following on concern about Wall Street and a sharp plunge in Tokyo, 
the region's largest market. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged 527.18  
points, or 2.89 percent, to 17,730.34. On Wednesday, the average 
fell 1.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors sold heavily on concerns that a weaker dollar  
may hurt Japanese exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taipei, the continuing spat with mainland China and the  
volatile U.S. and Japanese stock markets sent the Weighted Price 
Index of the Taiwan Stock Exchange down 107.98 points, or 1.4 
percent, at 7,678.67. 
</P>
<P>
	The index shed almost 13 percent over the previous week  
following mainland China's fiery response to Taiwanese President 
Lee Teng-hui's assertion earlier this month that Taiwan must deal 
with China ``on a state-to-state basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beijing's reported military maneuvers off China's eastern coast  
sent fears through Taipei's markets, and the Taiwanese government 
had to intervene and buy shares to prop up prices. 
</P>
<P>
	That and widespread concern Wall Street's high-flying prices may  
finally be due for a sharp decline also sent stocks lower in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index slipped 0.4 percent,  
or 50.6 points, to close at 13,369.06. On Wednesday, the index fell 
1.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Increasing fears of a possible correction in the U.S. markets  
further dampened market sentiment on Thursday, said Patrick Yiu, an 
analyst at Kingsway SW Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Industrial Average in New York on Wednesday rose  
only 6.65 points after Tuesday's fall of 191.55 points. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings in Tokyo, the U.S. dollar lost ground amid  
speculation that its slide below 120.00 yen suggested a stronger 
yen was acceptable to Japanese financial authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. dollar bought 118.44 yen in late-afternoon trading,  
down 0.56 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New 
York level of 118.10 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Japanese leaders have said they believe excessive yen  
appreciation undercut a budding economic recovery in 1993, making a 
significant rise in their currency unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares fell 1.9 percent in line with declines in other  
regional markets. The SET index fell 9.64 points to 487.22. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares fell on continued concerns over domestic  
political uncertainty. The JSX Composite Index fell 1.548 points, 
of 0.1 percent, at 642.655 points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares fell as institutional investors anticipated  
further losses. The Kuala Lumpur Composite Index fell 6.88 points, 
or 0.82 percent, to close at 829.77. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares fell in the absence of fresh buying incentives.  
The PSE Index fell 30.83 points, or 1.2 percent, at 2,488.62. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Shares rebounded 1.2 percent on a more optimistic outlook  
over Daewoo Group's reform plan and the stability of the Chinese 
yuan. The Kospi rose 11.55 points at 976.66. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares fell over uncertainty in Tokyo and Wall  
Street. The STI fell 29.45 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,067.89. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares fell as investors waited for positive signs in  
the U.S. markets. The All Ordinaries Index of share prices fell 
25.1 points, or 0.8 percent, at 3,086.3. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares fell on a sharp decline in Telecom Corp. of

<HEADLINE> Fans Arrive for Woodstock '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- The biggest music event of the summer started  
Thursday -- a day before the first performance -- as tens of 
thousands of music fans began arriving for Woodstock '99. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers expect more than 200,000 people when the 30th  
anniversary show officially kicks off Friday at noon with James 
Brown as the opening act. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic had already begun to build around the two main gates  
leading onto the former Griffiss Air Force Base when organizers 
agreed to let concert-goers in at 9 a.m., three hours earlier than 
planned, to set up their tents. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the acts on tap during the three-day festival: Sugar Ray,  
Sheryl Crow, Live, Willie Nelson, Bush, Jewel, Alanis Morissette, 
Insane Clown Posse, Metallica, Dave Matthews Band, Rage Against the 
Machine and Ice Cube. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not here to hear anyone special. We're here to listen to  
it all,'' said Jamie Jancosek, 23. ``Except country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it's the best place to be,'' added travel partner  
Kurt Miller, 20. ``Everything is here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although it is the 30th anniversary of the original festival,  
held on Max Yasgur's farm, Woodstock '99 is no throwback party. 
</P>
<P>
	Salespeople are hawking credit cards, and a tractor-trailer is  
serving as a video arcade. An extreme sports park and a hangar 
converted into a movie theater offer other diversions.

<HEADLINE> More Umpires Change 'Out' Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With commissioner Bud Selig set to accept their  
resignations, more major league umpires changed their minds about 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Union head Richie Phillips is facing renewed pressure from some  
umpires to step down, although he still has the support from the 
majority of his membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig hasn't set any deadlines for umpires to withdraw their  
resignations, which take effect Sept. 2. But baseball officials 
have said Selig is prepared to move on and hire new umps, several 
management officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though their Triple-A counterparts are ready to step in, it  
was too early to say how many would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Five AL umpires reversed themselves earlier this week and as  
many as 8-10 more umpires might be withdrawing their resignations, 
two baseball officials said. But umpires said baseball might be 
exaggerating the number to sway wavering umps. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NL umpires have changed their minds about resigning, said  
NL umpire Bruce Froemming, a union board member. Wally Bell's 
reversal was received by the National League on Wednesday and 
rookie umpire Jeff Nelson told the league his will be arriving 
shortly, one baseball official said. 
</P>
<P>
	A top minor league official said Triple-A umpires decided they  
would work major league games if they are called up. However, they 
are being pressured not to work, according to Pat O'Conner, a vice 
president of the governing body of the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to get them to change their minds,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and union president Jerry Crawford said they had no  
knowledge of any pressure attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was reacting to ``recent bashing by the media, jeering  
from irate fans, continued stonewalling from management and the 
union's own internal turmoil,'' Crawford issued a four-word 
statement: ``What else is new?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had turmoil,'' Crawford said later in San  
Francisco. ``We've always had fans against us. We've always had 
baseball management against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two top baseball officials, speaking on the condition they not  
be identified, said baseball was told more withdrawals of 
resignations were on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-three of the 66 unionized major league umpires quit last  
week, and Phillips said additional resignations will be submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Froemming, a union board member, said Phillips had become the  
issue for some umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become personal,'' Froemming said. ``We're not  
divided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several AL umpires who voted in March against giving Phillips a  
new contract have renewed calls to replace him, but the majority 
still backs him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That group was there long before March,'' Phillips said.  
``That group existed for at least five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has attempted to organize minor league umpires and has  
held a series of telephone conference calls, with another scheduled 
for today. While there had been a threat of a walkout in the minors 
today, no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll give the National Association ample time to  
prepare,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, the National Association of Professional Baseball  
Leagues, the minor leagues' governing body, has instructed its 
teams to have alternate umpires at games. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league umpires, bound by a no-strike clause, decided on  
the resignations because they fear owners will lock them out after 
their labor contract expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bud said it's sad,'' Froemming said. ``What's sad is that  
baseball doesn't have enough respect to address a situation that 
they know was coming. ... It looks like they want a war, for 
whatever reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and Froemming disputed the claim that Triple-A umps had  
voted to work major league games if asked to. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a very confusing vote,'' Phillips said, adding that  
a new ballot was under way.

	DALLAS (AP) -- The NFL has not determined the length of Leon  
Lett's latest suspension for violating the league's substance-abuse 
policy, a league official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett was indefinitely suspended last month after another  
transgression landed him in the third stage of the league's drug 
and alcohol program. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike his previous suspension, which automatically meant an  
entire season on the sidelines, the length of this suspension is 
ultimately up to NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News, citing several sources involved in the  
process, reported Thursday that Tagliabue has told associates he is 
considering a four-game suspension. 
</P>
<P>
	League spokesman Greg Aiello refused Thursday to confirm or deny  
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've said what we have to say,'' Aiello said. ``The  
commissioner has not addressed the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cowboys owner Jerry Jones told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram he  
expects a decision from Tagliabue this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm totally in the dark -- totally -- as to what (Tagliabue) may  
or may not do,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett's agent, Jim Steiner, did not return calls from The  
Associated Press Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The best indication that Lett will be suspended four games is a  
precedent set in the case of former Cowboy Clayton Holmes, who was 
ordered to sit out four games when he found himself in the same 
stage of the substance-abuse program. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett's speedy return is critical for the Cowboys. The 6-foot-6,  
300-pounder, in his eighth year from Emporia State, is among the 
NFL's best defensive linemen. Last year, he had 51 tackles, four 
sacks and 20 quarterback pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The current suspension is Lett's third in four years. He was  
suspended for four games in 1995 after testing positive for 
marijuana. Lett missed the last three games of 1996 and the first 
13 games of 1997 after testing positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	Lett has been tested for drugs up to 10 times a month for the  
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys start training camp in Wichita Falls on Monday.

<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Aches and pains may prevent Minnesota  
Gov. Jesse Ventura from joining other Reform Party members at their 
national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura -- the only Reform Party member to hold statewide office  
-- was supposed to speak at the convention in Dearborn, Mich., 
tonight. However, Ventura has complained this week of pains in his 
back and legs.

<HEADLINE> Senate Seeks New Nuclear Labs Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and the  
Republican-controlled Congress are moving toward agreement on a 
legislative response to alleged espionage at the U.S. nuclear 
weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson responded favorably to a  
near-unanimous Senate vote Wednesday that would create a new agency 
responsible for nuclear weapons development and security at the 
vast U.S. nuclear weapons lab complexes. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency would largely bypass the Energy Department  
bureaucracy, but with the help of amendments offered by Democrats, 
Richardson would retain control over the policy and operations of 
the newly dubbed Agency for Nuclear Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 96-1 on an amendment to a bill reauthorizing  
government intelligence programs. The intelligence legislation then 
passed on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson called the legislation ``a good start'' that was  
improved by the Democratic amendments ensuring Cabinet-level 
control over the new agency. The initial Republican proposal, 
Richardson said, would have repeated past mistakes by creating ``a 
firewall between the defense labs and the (Energy) Department's 
counterintelligence and security professionals whose sole mission 
is the protection of our nation's secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House held out the possibility of a veto if the  
final measure takes too much power away from the energy secretary, 
who would be ultimately responsible for the newly created agency. 
The House has not yet considered the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure stems from widespread concern over alleged espionage  
at U.S. nuclear weapons labs, which fall under the Energy 
Department's jurisdiction. The FBI has been investigating several 
cases dating back to the 1980s. In one case, a Taiwanese-American 
scientist who was assigned to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico is suspected of helping China gain classified information on 
at least one, and possibly several, U.S. nuclear weapons designs. 
No charges have been filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of the reforms necessary to begin  
cleaning up this espionage mess and to begin seeing to it that it 
doesn't happen again,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., one of the 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional committees, along with a Clinton  
administration-sponsored commission study, have concluded that 
blurry lines of authority between the labs and the department 
allowed widely known security concerns to be ignored for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got a structure that addresses accountability in  
the weapons labs,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, another 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said, ``there were people who didn't  
know who was responsible'' for security ``or so many people 
responsible that no one was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said in a statement that it wanted to examine  
the final version of the bill before supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If language is adopted that would undermine Secretary  
Richardson's ability to effectively manage the department, 
including efforts to reorganize the department's handling of 
counterintelligence and broader security matters, the secretary of 
energy would recommend that the president veto the bill,'' the 
White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some House members have said they would favor even stronger  
legislation, establishing an agency with greater independence, 
similar to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	And House committee leaders with jurisdiction over intelligence,  
military and scientific matters have said they want the bill to be 
freestanding, not part of broader legislation addressing other 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., won changes that would give Richardson  
and his successors greater authority over the new agency, which 
would be charged with research and development of nuclear weapons 
as well as counterintelligence and security at the weapons labs. 
Levin said the changes, which paved the way for the near-unanimous 
vote, would improve the chances that a bill ultimately will be sent 
to the president and signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., voted against the bill because he  
believed it would give DOE and the newly created agency the 
authority to reopen reactors at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in 
Washington state without any environmental oversight.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Working Poor Want Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Most of the nation's working poor are eager  
to learn new job skills, but are hampered by a lack of access to 
education and the Internet, according to a new study released 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 500 people across the nation with family incomes no  
more than twice the poverty level also found that the working poor 
are more willing to work long hours and sleep less to get ahead 
than the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are people that have the same work ethic, if not more  
so, than the rest of the American population,'' said Carl Van Horn, 
director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development 
at Rutgers University. ``There are other reasons why they're not 
succeeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study recommended more access to job training, child care  
and public transportation, as well as an increase in the 
$5.15-an-hour minimum wage, to bring people back from the edge of 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	One in five Americans is considered among the working poor, with  
incomes that don't rise above double the poverty level, according 
to government figures. The federal poverty level is $16,450 for a 
family of four. Eighty of the 500 people surveyed for Thursday's 
poll were unemployed at the time, but belonged to working poor 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by the Heldrich Center and the University of  
Connecticut's Center for Research and Analysis defined the typical 
working poor American as a single white woman, aged 30-49, with a 
40-hour-a-week job, an annual income of less than $25,000 and at 
least one child under the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
	About seven in 10 of those surveyed are paid by the hour, and  
more than six in 10 have either no paid vacation or a week or less 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-two percent of those surveyed said they needed more  
education to get the job they want, but only 18 percent had 
received financial support from an employer for education or job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 36 percent of the nonpoor population said their  
employers had helped pay for their education, the study said, 
relying on two earlier polls of 2,000 working adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 9 percent of the respondents had a college education, while  
19 percent had not graduated high school, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-nine percent of the respondents said they have access to  
the Internet, and less than half have access to a computer at work 
or home. Seventy-six percent of the working public have access to 
the Internet and more than 70 percent have computers at work and at 
home, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn said the poor are hurt by not having computer access in  
an economy that is increasingly driven by technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that 24 percent of the working poor would be  
willing to work longer hours, twice as much as the rest of the 
population, and 33 percent aren't concerned about getting enough 
sleep, again twice as much as the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Acs, a researcher on poverty at the Urban Institute, said  
his data supported many of the poll's findings. But he said the 
statistic on work hours is not surprising, because low-wage workers 
generally work far less than the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by telephone between May 22 and June 15, has  
a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Three Tie for First-Round Lead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COAL VALLEY, Ill. (AP) -- Kenny Perry, runnerup to Mark Brooks in  
the 1996 PGA Championship, shot a 6-under-par 64 Thursday for a 
share of the first-round lead of the John Deer Classic with Robert 
Damron and Joe Ogilvie. 
</P>
<P>
	David Peoples, Mac O'Grady, Katsumasa Miyamoto, Brett Quigley  
and Briny Baird shot 65s over the 6,762-yard Oakwood Country Club 
course. Ten players, headed by tour veteran Scott Verplank and 1997 
champion David Toms, were at 66, and 16 players were grouped at 67, 
including three-time champion D.A. Weibring (1979, 1991 and 1995) 
and two-time champ David Frost (1992-93). 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Steve Jones, Jeff Sluman and Fuzzy Zoeller  
were among those at 68. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love it here,'' said Perry, whose round included five  
birdies and an eagle at the par-5 10th hole, where hit a 2-iron to 
within 12 feet and knocked in the putt. ``I don't know what it is. 
I'm just very comfortable on this golf course, and I had a lot of 
good feelings coming into this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of Perry's birdies came on par-4 holes. He birdied the  
third, seventh and ninth holes on the front nine and the 13th and 
15th holes on the back. His lone bogey came at No. 15 when he 
missed a 3-footer for par. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry has 13 consecutive rounds under 70 in this tournament and  
has four consecutive top-10 finishes. He placed second in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Damron, 114th on the money list with $225,075, started on the  
back nine and went out in 33, with birdies at Nos. 10, 15 and 18, 
offset by a bogey at No. 12 where he missed the green and failed to 
get up and down. 
</P>
<P>
	Damron, who found out last week he has mononucleosis, was  
4-under on his incoming nine with birdies at Nos. 1, 5, 8 and 9. 
He's playing with a new set of irons acquired during the Western 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the beginning of the year, my iron play has been  
terrible, and I've not been giving myself any chances for birdie,'' 
said Damron, in his third full season on the tour. ``And since the 
summer started, I was starting to swing better and hit better, but 
I was fighting -- my energy was so bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogilvie, a rookie on the tour who is 144th on the money list  
with $144,576, had seven birdies and one bogey on the. He started 
on the front nine and birdied the first two holes before a bogey at 
the par-4 third hole when he missed the green, chipped to 15 feet 
and missed the putt. He birdied Nos. 6 and 9 to go out in 32, then 
birdied Nos. 13, 16 and 17 on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tend to play well in hot weather,'' said Ogilvie, who was  
among the early starters and finished before the temperature 
completed its climb into the mid to upper 90s. ``I don't know why 
that is, but I like hot weather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only 51 of the 156 players failed to match par.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Set To Play Puerto Rico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The United States will have its  
basketball reputation at stake. Puerto Rico will have absolutely 
nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Tipoff is at 8 p.m. EDT, and the arena will be a madhouse.  
</P>
<P>
	The two top teams in the Tournament of the Americas play each  
other tonight in a game that will be meaningless in the standings, 
but oh so important in the bigger scheme of things -- especially to 
the Puerto Ricans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to play as hard as any team that has played the  
United States so far,'' Puerto Rico's Carmelo Travieso said. ``In 
Puerto Rico, we defend what we've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Puerto Ricans clinched a spot in the semifinals against an  
opponent other than the Americans with an 80-75 victory over Canada 
on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. team, meanwhile, had its lowest point total of the  
Dream Team era in a physical, 83-61 victory over Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night's game will wrap up the second round, and neither  
team will have anything to play for except its national pride. And 
don't underestimate what national pride means to Puerto Ricans, 
whose commonwealth relationship with the United States is the 
source of heated debate among the island's population of 3.8 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've started talking stuff already, saying we can't run on  
their court,'' Hardaway said. ``That's what they said. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As players, you look forward to playing on the road,'' Tom  
Gugliotta said. ``And this will definitely be a road game. The fans 
have been loud at their games, and I can just imagine when they're 
rooting for their home team against the United States. You can 
multiply that enthusiasm by 100.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans made only two baskets in the final 5 1/2 minutes  
against Venezuela, eclipsing the previous Dream Team low of 87 
points against Angola in the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the fourth time in seven games in this Olympic qualifying  
tournament that the United States failed to reach 100, something 
that happened only once in the first 22 Dream Team games in 1992, 
1994 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The four Dream Teams have a combined record of 37-0.  
</P>
<P>
	In the best game of the night, a turnover by Steve Nash on the  
game's final possession allowed Puerto Rico to defeat Canada by the 
margin it needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a complicated tiebreaking formula, Puerto Rico needed to  
win by at least four points to avoid playing the United States in 
the semifinals -- and everyone in the raucous Roberto Clemente 
Coliseo knew it as Nash brought the ball upcourt with 18 seconds 
left and Canada trailing by five. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash drove to his right and threw a crosscourt pass that was  
picked off. Sherman Hamilton of Canada stole the ball back and got 
off a 3-pointer at the buzzer, but it missed. 
</P>
<P>
	The result set up a likely semifinal rematch between Puerto Rico  
and Canada on Saturday. The United States will likely play 
Argentina in the other semifinal. The gold medal game is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to face the United States two times,'' Puerto Rico  
coach Julio Toro said. ``The game on Sunday, we deserve that 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, playing their seventh game in seven nights,  
clearly looked tired as they played at half speed against 
overmatched Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Payton scored 18 points, including 12 of the United States'  
first 29, and Tim Hardaway shook off the crowd's catcalls and 
scored 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was booed after he clotheslined Venezuela's Yumerving  
Mijares early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody had to go out there and set that little guy  
straight,'' Hardaway said. ``He was going under folks, pushing guys 
down, getting all physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``He undercut Jason Kidd, undercut Gary a couple of times like  
he had something to prove. I just wanted to show him `Don't come 
out here and try to play physical because something might happen to 
you.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The most important games will come Saturday, when two Olympic  
berths are at stake. The Puerto Rico-Canada matchup will be the 
most closely contested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it'll be tough for both teams. I know it will be tough  
for them to beat us twice,'' said Nash, who plays for the NBA's 
Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Ortiz, a 35-year-old playing his final international  
tournament, scored the final seven points for Puerto Rico on a 
3-pointer with 1:38 left for a 76-75 lead, a jump hook with 53 
seconds left for a 78-75 lead, and a layup through three defenders 
with 18 seconds left for the crucial five-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
	After a timeout, Canada had one last chance to get a basket that  
would force Puerto Rico into a likely semifinal matchup with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want to turn it over, so I threw a nice crosscourt  
pass,'' Ortiz said, shaking his head at his mistake. ``I went to 
throw it back to our big guy, but he went to the basket when I 
thought he was going to pop out. It went right by him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games, Brazil defeated Uruguay 100-74 and Argentina  
beat the Dominican Republic 85-71.

<HEADLINE> NASA Looks for Ice on the Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- By sending a spacecraft smashing into the  
moon, NASA researchers hope to find evidence of lunar ice. But two 
scientists predict the collision will uncover only a concrete-like 
layer of dry soil. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA researchers plan to smack the Lunar Prospector craft into a  
crater on the moon's South Pole on July 31, the final day of the 
lunar orbiter's $63 million, 18-month-long mission to study the 
moon at close range. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts believe water ice may be locked in the frigid soil of  
the deep, constantly shaded crater and that roiling energy of the 
satellite's 3,800 mph impact will free a cloud of water vapor. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for water may be a key to further lunar exploration.  
Water can be chemically reduced to hydrogen and oxygen, which can 
be used as a rocket fuel. Also, the oxygen could be used as a 
breathable gas. The presence of water would reduce the need for 
fuel and oxygen resupply from Earth of a lunar base. 
</P>
<P>
	But Von R. Eshleman and George A. Parks, researchers at Stanford  
University, say in a letter to the journal Science that Lunar 
Prospector is more apt to collide with a concrete-like mineral 
inside the crater than ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe that crater is paved like a roadway, but we  
do believe the soil may be chemically very much like concrete,'' 
Eshleman said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is water on the moon, Eshleman said, it is probably in  
the form of hydrous, or water-containing, mineral crystals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrous minerals do contain H2O, but it is so tightly bound  
chemically to the crystals that it would take temperatures up to 
1,500 degrees to break those bonds and extract useful water, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eshleman agrees with National Aeronautics and Space  
Administration scientists that if there is any water on the moon -- 
a highly uncertain possibility -- it probably is in the soils in 
deeply shaded craters at the lunar poles. But once the water got 
trapped there, he said, the water very likely combined with the dry 
lunar soil to form the crystal minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldstein, a University of Texas researcher who first  
suggested smashing the moon with the Lunar Prospector, conceded 
that some lunar water may be chemically locked in minerals, but he 
thinks there also might be ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the chances of there being free water there is about  
10 percent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said the energy released by the Lunar Prospector's  
crash into the moon will vaporize ice, but not separate water from 
the minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a half cubic meter of soil, the crash will raise the  
temperature by about 400 degrees Kelvin (about 720 degrees F),'' 
said Goldstein, far less than the 1,500 degrees F needed to extract 
the water from a concrete-like crystal. 
</P>
<P>
	This means that if any water is detected from the collision, it  
probably came from ice, not from hydrous minerals, said Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998, and has spent 18  
months orbiting the moon. It used instruments to map the lunar 
surface, plot the moon's geology and search for water. 
</P>
<P>
	Data from the spacecraft suggested the presence of hydrogen, a  
key component of water, but could not detect water itself. Radar 
signals from an earlier spacecraft, called Clementine, suggested 
that water ice might be present at the cold lunar poles. And still 
another study, using Earth-bound instruments, detected a group of 
craters at the lunar poles that are constantly shaded from the sun, 
the sites thought the most likely to contain ice. 
</P>
<P>
	The craft will smash into one such shaded crater at about 5:52  
a.m. EDT on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We selected that day because the funding for Lunar Prospector  
runs out on Aug. 1,'' said Goldstein, a member of the spacecraft 
science team. ``We thought this would be a good way to end the 
mission and still get some science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers will order Lunar Prospector to fire its braking  
rockets, Goldstein said, and if all goes well the craft will 
approach the surface at a shallow angle and smash into the inner 
wall of a 2 1/2-mile deep crater. 
</P>
<P>
	The impact could produce a vapor with as much as 40 pounds of  
water -- about five gallons. A cloud of vapor should become visible 
to powerful telescopes within four seconds after the collision. 
Sunlight is expected to break the water vapor into hydrogen and 
hydroxyl. Telescopes on Earth and in space that can detect 
ultraviolet radiation will be able to tell if the plume contains 
hydroxyl, a key marker for water.

	For amateurs, said Goldstein, there probably won't be much to  
see.

	Greenspan Watches Out for Inflation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American economy is enjoying an  
``exceptional year,'' Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said 
Thursday. But he warned that inflation dangers could be lurking and 
he expressed new worries about the high-flying stock market. 
Delivering the Fed's midyear report to Congress on the state of the 
economy, Greenspan defended the central bank's recent interest rate 
increase -- the first in two years -- and pledged to move ``promptly 
and forcefully'' to raise rates again should inflation pressures 
intensify. Wall Street fell on Greenspan's remarks, with bond 
prices and stock prices both lower.

	Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose  
for the second week in a row last week to the highest level in more 
than a month. The Labor Department said today that 313,000 people 
filed new claims in the week ending July 17 -- up by 4,000 from the 
previous week. It was the second consecutive increase in weekly 
jobless claims after two back-to-back declines, and left the claims 
at their highest point since June 5 when there were 326,000. The 
four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out 
week-to-week volatility, also was up, to 305,500. That was the 
highest level since June 26 when it was at 307,250.

	Compaq Promotes CEO Michael Capellas  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reaching inside its own ranks for a new leader,  
Compaq Computer Corp. named chief operating officer Michael D. 
Capellas as chief executive on Thursday in a bid to revive its 
flagging computer sales and profits. Capellas, 44, succeeds Eckhard 
Pfeiffer, who was forced out in April after Compaq's first-quarter 
profit came in at less than half of analysts' expectations. The 
company has been under enormous pressure from Wall Street to 
quickly fill a yawning management gap, aggravated by the departure 
of another half-dozen top managers in Pfeiffer's wake. Compaq is 
expected to report a second-quarter loss of about $250 million next 
week. Compaq stock was down 1 1/16 at 24 15/16 today.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com's second-quarter losses were  
smaller than expected and its sales more than tripled from a year 
ago, but the online retailer's business still lags significantly 
behind rival Amazon.com. The New York-based company reported today 
that it lost $21.95 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a 
loss of $23.74 million, or 21 cents a share, a year ago. Sales were 
$39.07 million, up from $11.38 million in the same quarter of 1998. 
The company's results topped analysts' expectations. 
Barnesandnoble.com stock was down 5/16 at 18 11/16.

	Mattel Earnings Rise 81 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s second-quarter operating  
earnings rose 81 percent from a year ago, boosted by strong sales 
of its Fisher-Price line of pre-school toys and software sold by 
its Mattel Media division. The nation's biggest toymaker -- which is 
best known for its Barbie and Hot Wheels toys -- reported Thursday 
that its operating earnings rose to $62.5 million, or 15 cents a 
share, for the quarter ended June 30, compared with $34.6 million, 
or 8 cents a share, a year ago. Mattel's results matched analysts' 
expectations. Its stock was unchanged at 23 7/8.

	Xerox Profits Rise 13 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. today said its profits from  
continuing operations climbed 13 percent in the second quarter, 
citing higher revenues and cost-savings from a restructuring 
program. Net income was $448 million, or 62 cents per share, 
compared with $395 million, or 58 cents per share in the same 
period a year ago, before a restructuring charge of $1.11 billion 
in the second quarter of 1998. Including the restructuring charge, 
the company reported a loss of $712 million, or $1.10 per share, in 
the 1998 quarter. The earnings matched Wall Street expectations.

<P>
	Sprint Profits Up 7 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp. reported a 7 percent  
increase in its second-quarter earnings, a result of growth in its 
core long-distance and local telephone business and reduced costs 
per customer in its wireless group. Sprint's FON group, consisting 
of the core businesses and certain other ventures, made a profit of 
$386 million, or 44 cents per share, the company said today. Those 
results compared to $364 million, or 41 cents per share, in the 
same quarter a year earlier.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp., the world's largest fast-food

sales overseas and heavy promotional activity domestically. For the 
three months that ended June 30, the Oak Brook, Ill.-based company 
reported that net income rose to $518 million, or 37 cents a share, 
from $357.2 million, or 25 cents a share, in the comparable period 
a year earlier. The results matched Wall Street expectations.

<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- In its first quarter as an  
independent company, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. beat Wall 
Street analysts' predictions despite a 35 percent drop in ongoing 
net income. Reynolds' second-quarter results were driven down by 
the cost of a corporate spin-off, the national tobacco settlement 
and declining sales caused by higher prices for cigarettes 
including Camel, Winston, Salem and Doral. Reynolds, the holding 
company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., was separated from RJR 
Nabisco Holdings Inc. on June 15. Income excluding one-time items 
came to $98 million, or 90 cents per share, compared to $150 
million, or $1.30 per share, a year ago. Wall Street analysts had 
predicted earnings of 79 cents per share.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports declined 13 percent in June, the  
Commerce Department said today. Commerce Secretary William Daley 
said the U.S. has turned back last year's surge of steel imports by 
the United States. The June decrease followed a 30 percent increase 
in May. Daley also said the administration will continue to monitor 
the situation closely to ensure that the success to date is not 
eroded. The issue has been a thorny one for President Clinton and 
gives Vice President Al Gore potential headaches as he courts 
organized labor for next year's presidential race.

newspaper's editors said yesterday that Chris Nolan, whose ``Talk 
is Cheap'' column focused on Silicon Valley, had overstepped 
ethical boundaries. Mercury News executive editor David Yarnold 
said Ms. Nolan had ``at a minimum, created the appearance of a 
conflict of interest for herself and the Mercury News and she 
failed to exercise a reasonable level of professional 
responsibility.''

<HEADLINE> Saudi Princess Bids for Denver Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A Saudi Arabian princess, a Wal-Mart heiress and  
John Elway are battling for ownership of the Denver Nuggets, the 
Colorado Avalanche and the city's future sports arena. 
</P>
<P>
	The colorful cast of characters, and possibly other investors,  
have submitted bids to acquire the teams and the arena from Ascent 
Entertainment Group Inc. The deadline for bids is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment groups headed by Colorado banker Donald Sturm, whose  
earlier bid for Ascent was rebuffed, and Snapple beverage magnate 
Nelson Peltz wouldn't say whether they were among the bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Thara Al Saud, the widow of Prince Mohammed Abdul Aziz,  
a nephew of King Fahd who died in a plane crash 23 years ago, spoke 
with Nuggets general manager Dan Issel and Avalanche general 
manager Pierre LaCroix this week. 
</P>
<P>
	She submitted a bid for Ascent's sports assets to investment  
bankers on Wednesday, according to Valerian Butler Smith III, 
chairman of Ashland Capital Holdings in New York and the princess' 
principal investment manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``The princess is very serious about this acquisition and her  
financial resources are available for a full and serious 
commitment,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Al Saud had met with representatives of another recent  
retiree -- former Chicago Bulls basketball star Michael Jordan -- in 
an attempt to interest him in investing in her bid, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But she is not relying on any outside investors for this  
process,'' Smith said. ``Obviously Mr. Jordan represents positive 
factors beyond money in a project such as this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Falk, Jordan's agent, said reports that Jordan might join  
the princess' bid are ``factually incorrect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denver financier Lars Erik Borgen and Colorado ski mogul George  
Gillett are teaming with Elway, the retired Denver Broncos 
quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group is putting together an offer to make a bid for  
Ascent,'' Jeff Sperbeck, Elway's business manager, said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway was part of an investment group that lost out in bidding  
for the teams and the arena earlier this year to Bill Laurie and 
his wife, Nancy, an heiress to the Wal-Mart fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lauries agreed to pay $400 million, but Ascent canceled the  
deal and set up the auction after shareholders filed lawsuits 
contending the teams and the arena were worth more. 
</P>
<P>
	The company plans to sell the assets in an open auction next  
Wednesday, selecting the highest bid from among those submitted by 
Friday's deadline to compete against the Lauries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Lauries' position remains unchanged. They are focused on  
seeing the process through to the final outcome and they expect to 
prevail,'' Pete Webb, a spokesman for the Lauries, said.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Angers AOL With Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s new instant messaging software  
released Thursday kicked off a skirmish between two of the 
Internet's most powerful companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN Messenger Service will work through the  
Microsoft Network site, allowing message exchanges with the 40 
million users of MSN Hotmail. 
</P>
<P>
	Messengers allow Internet users to instantly exchange messages  
with others on the Web, without having to go through e-mail. While 
common enough on the Web, few messenger programs are compatible 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
	However, one key element of Microsoft's new service is that it  
allows people to send messages to users of America Online Inc.'s 
popular AOL Instant Messenger system, a feature that won kudos from 
analysts but cries of anger from AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have all these walled-off communities today where AOL  
users can talk to AOL users, Yahoo! users to Yahoo! users, but 
nobody has really bridged the gap,'' said Rob Bennett of 
Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce Group. 
</P>
<P>
	But an AOL spokeswoman argued that MSN Messenger wasn't really  
compatible with AOL Instant Messenger, or AIM, because it requires 
that a user have both programs. 
</P>
<P>
	AIM users won't be notified when MSN Messenger users go online --  
as they are in the AOL system -- nor will they be able to save 
Messenger users to their ``buddy'' lists, unless they sign up for 
MSN Messenger, pointed out spokeswoman Ann Brackbill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dulles, Va.-based company is also upset that Microsoft  
requires AOL users to enter their AIM password in order to allow 
MSN Messenger to communicate with AIM users, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises significant and serious privacy and security  
issues,'' Brackbill said. ``Its unauthorized access to the AOL 
namespace is akin to hacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's announcement Thursday was seen by analysts as a key  
step in the ever-escalating battle among Internet companies to 
obtain Web traffic to help them sell advertisments. 
</P>
<P>
	By designing its messaging service to work with AOL's system,  
Microsoft Network will position itself to draw more users to its 
Web site and keep them there longer, said Emily Meehan, an analyst 
with The Yankee Group research firm, based in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Sanford, MSN lead product manager, said Messenger was  
just one of the services MSN wanted to offer its users and wasn't 
directed towards competing with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that overall we have been competing with AOL in terms  
of the online space and online services and portals. But this is 
part of our online communication strategy for MSN,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just part of our continuing efforts to provide  
consumers with a place they can go to get information no matter 
where they are.''

<HEADLINE> Resolution on Camden Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Camden agreed to withdraw its bankruptcy  
petition and accept tighter state control over its spending 
Thursday, ending the fiscal crisis in New Jersey's poorest city. 
</P>
<P>
	After intense negotiations, Mayor Milton Milan signed an  
agreement that will give the state greater financial oversight over 
his desperate, crime-ridden city of 87,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor had refused to sign the agreement until it was changed  
to stipulate that the financial oversight board would be reviewed 
annually. Milan said the prior agreement would have been binding 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	With the agreement, Camden will receive $62.5 million in  
desperately needed state aid, said Stephen Sasala, deputy 
commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs and 
chairman of the oversight board. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city of Camden is no longer insolvent. You have all  
winners,'' Milan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Milan said the city will withdraw the bankruptcy petition he  
filed on Monday seeking protection from the city's creditors, as 
well as a petition for a complete state takeover of Camden's 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Camden sought bankruptcy protection after the state withheld an  
installment of state aid. The state said it was reluctant to give 
Camden the money unless the state were given tighter control over 
its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	The state set up the financial oversight board a year ago to  
help manage Camden's finances after an audit found that the city 
misspent millions through mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Camden's attempt to declare bankruptcy was a rare move by a  
municipality. Only 18 U.S. communities have taken that step since 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
	State officials, including Gov. Christie Whitman, had opposed  
Camden's efforts to declare bankruptcy and seek a state takeover. 
The state contended that Camden failed to seek the necessary state 
approval before seeking Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The state each year provides about 50 percent of the $100  
million budget for Camden, the fifth-poorest city in the country.

<HEADLINE> Shirt May Track At-Risk Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Running to the park or the grocery store with  
7-week-old Matthew Condon takes a lot of work: His parents also lug 
along a heavy monitor wired to Matthew's tiny chest to sound the 
alarm if he suddenly stops breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	That high-pitched alarm can be lifesaving for babies like  
Matthew, who has a condition that causes apnea -- brief stops in 
breathing -- in small infants. The monitors also are widely used for 
babies deemed at risk of SIDS, the mysterious sudden infant death 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	But they're not the easiest solution. They're heavy, the sticky  
electrodes irritate babies' tender skin, and the wires frighten 
parents and can loosen to sound false alarms. A million false 
alarms, one doctor says in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	So Georgia researchers are developing an easier  
heartbeat-and-breathing monitor for babies at risk of sudden death: 
A high-tech T-shirt with electronic sensors sewn into the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthew, who lives in Alpharetta, Ga., tried on a prototype, and  
the shirt hugged his chest snugly enough that the sensors were in 
just the right spot to monitor his heart. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a twist on a shirt developed by Georgia Tech engineers for  
the military to beam back to doctors the condition of soldiers 
wounded on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	For Dr. Gary Freed, who is awaiting permission to begin testing  
the shirts on babies at Emory University this fall, converting the 
technology for civilian use is timely because more and more infants 
need at-home monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of that has to do with the managed care and insurance,''  
says Freed, whose Emory center cares for 900 babies on monitors. 
Premature or underweight babies, considered high risk, ``normally 
would have been left in the hospital for a longer period, but 
instead they're putting them out sooner with the monitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All parents now are told to put babies to sleep on their backs,  
not on their stomachs -- a proven way to reduce the risk of SIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Putting high-risk babies on a cardiorespiratory monitor is a  
little controversial. Some critics say a baby predestined for SIDS 
cannot be revived even if the monitor blares a warning, and that 
there's not enough risk to justify monitoring preemies who appear 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	But many doctors say monitoring high-risk infants is important.  
At the least, it records heart rates that might help diagnose 
certain treatable illnesses, and can reassure parents who had 
another infant die. 
</P>
<P>
	For apnea, monitors can be lifesaving. Dr. Joe Hageman of  
Northwestern University's Evanston Hospital recalls a baby 
suspected to have outgrown his apnea after no attacks for five 
weeks. Then his monitor detected three attacks in a row. Doctors 
revived him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes you crazy because you can't predict'' which baby is  
really at risk until a monitor blares, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	With today's monitors, a Velcro-snapped belt holds rubber  
electrodes on the infant's chest. Wires connect the electrodes to a 
cable that plugs into the monitor itself, the size of a small VCR. 
</P>
<P>
	If those connections slip -- babies do wiggle and parents don't  
always hook electrodes firmly because they irritate babies' skin -- 
the monitor emits a loud and frightening false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	And as older babies roll over and scoot around, some parents  
fear they'll get tangled in the wires and strangle, so they abandon 
the monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The military isn't yet pursuing the shirt, so Georgia Tech lead  
engineer Sundaresan Jayaraman is converting it to civilian uses -- 
and the baby-sized SIDS shirts are poised to be the first studied 
medically. 
</P>
<P>
	The first prototypes will eliminate putting electrodes on  
babies' skin. Wires still will lead to the monitor, but from the 
bottom of the shirt, not near the baby's neck. If those prove to 
record heartbeat as well as old-fashioned electrodes, the next step 
is a simple wireless shirt with a beeper-sized monitor clipped to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	But the shirt can be customized to various needs, says  
Jayaraman, who is seeking manufacturers. He's getting interest from 
firefighters in a shirt to detect hazardous gases and wonders if 
heart attack survivors could one day benefit from wearing a 
heart-monitor shirt home from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	At an estimated $25 to $35 a shirt, he calls it a good buy.

<HEADLINE> Delay in Baptist Church Gay Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Four California congregations that were expelled  
from the 1.5 million-member American Baptist Churches USA over 
their liberal stand on homosexuality have gained a reprieve after 
other church members protested. 
</P>
<P>
	The pastor of one of the congregations, the Rev. Esther Hargis  
of Berkeley, Calif., said she was officially notified Friday that 
several regional subunits had filed formal protests over the 
expulsion, which came last month at a meeting in Des Moines of the 
denomination's General Board. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the expulsion violated longstanding commitment to  
pluralism, adding, ``you don't throw churches out on theological 
grounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Susan B. W. Johnson of Chicago's Hyde Park Union  
Church, who organized the protests, said the filings freeze the 
expulsions of all four expelled congregations: in Berkeley, 
Oakland, San Jose and San Leandro. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests set in motion a process of ``adjudication'' that  
has rarely if ever been used in such disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the General Board is the denomination's highest  
policy-making body, the decision by a committee of executives on 
the denominational staff, or by arbitrators they appoint, will be 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Daniel Weiss, chief executive at American Baptist  
headquarters in Valley Forge, Pa., was unavailable for comment 
Wednesday. A denominational spokesman said no official information 
on the situation would be released until next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The four congregations, as well as the Hyde Park Union Church,  
are among 29 in the denomination that belong to the Association of 
Welcoming and Affirming Baptists, a caucus that encourages full 
participation by gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this vocal liberal wing, American Baptist Churches  
generally are moderate to conservative. The separate and much 
larger Southern Baptist Convention is a vigorous supporter of the 
Christian tradition against same-sex behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The regional subunits that lodged the protest, Ms. Johnson said,  
were in Massachusetts; Connecticut; Philadelphia; Rochester, N.Y.; 
and Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Liggett Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- A judge on Thursday refused to approve a  
settlement that tobacco maker Liggett Group Inc. had contended it 
needed to avoid bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett, which provided key evidence in the national tobacco  
settlement, had sought to head off future lawsuits by smokers by 
creating a fund that would pay $1 million annually for claims. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mobile County Circuit Judge Robert Kendall refused to OK the  
agreement, reached with attorneys representing smokers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, Kendall pointed to a U.S. Supreme Court decision  
that set aside a $1.5 billion settlement involving Fibreboard Corp. 
and asbestos-related claims. That ruling set strict standards 
before courts can approve settlements that apply on a mandatory 
basis to all potential plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett, the smallest of the five major tobacco firms with about  
2 percent of the business, argued that bankruptcy threatened if the 
court denied the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company disclosed key documents on the addictiveness of  
nicotine and gave unprecedented cooperation in tobacco litigation 
that led to the nationwide settlement with state attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett's attorneys pointed to that cooperation in seeking final  
approval of the proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no question that this cooperation, historic and  
prospective, has been and will be of great value to tobacco 
claimants,'' Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Liggett ``cannot apply its claimed credit for  
cooperation against the requirement for exhaustion'' of a limited 
fund that the company wanted to pay smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Kasowitcz, Liggett's attorney in New York, did not  
immediately return a phone message seeking comment. Company 
spokesman Paul Caminiti said Liggett officials were reviewing their 
options, but added the company ``is absolutely not considering 
bankruptcy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge heard testimony last month on the fairness of the  
proposed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, Liggett would pay an amount equal  
to 7.5 percent of its sales in each of the next 25 years into a 
fund that would be earmarked for compensating victims who have 
smoked its cigarettes, such as L&AMP;M, Lark and Chesterfield. The fund 
would be guaranteed payments of $1 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal also would have limited the amount Liggett Group  
would have paid to people claiming harm from its cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Blue Cross, union health funds and others involved  
in tobacco litigation opposed the settlement. They noted that 
Liggett was debt-free after selling three of its brands for $300 
million and paying off obligations related to those brands. They 
said it also has basked in a stock market rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Liggett can do this, Philip Morris can do it,'' said New  
Orleans attorney Robert Urann, representing unions in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	David Bagwell, attorney for Blue Cross, which is representing 44  
separate Blue Cross insurance plans from around the country, said 
Kendall's ``written opinion was lean and spare and straight to the 
point. It said class-action rules were not designed for these 
massive nationwide involuntary class settlements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liggett first proposed the class-action settlement in Mobile two  
years ago, but the case was transferred to West Virginia, where it 
was rejected by a federal judge. Plaintiffs' lawyers came back to 
state court in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, the company agreed to sell its L&AMP;M, Lark and  
Chesterfield brands to Philip Morris for $300 million. The sale was 
completed about in late May. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves the company with Eve, its only remaining premium  
brand, and other discount brands including Pyramid.

<P>
	CORONA DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Linguist Richard Barrutia, a  
principal creator and adviser for bilingual education in the 
California school system, died July 6. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught Spanish and Portuguese at the University of  
California, Irvine, where he was a founding professor in 1965, for 
30 years and set up and directed the master's degree program in 
bilingual education. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrutia directed the university's study abroad program for two  
years in Mexico City and for another two years in Madrid. While in 
Spain, he was knighted Caballero de la Orden del Merito Civil by 
King Juan Carlos for service to scholarship in Hispanic letters.

<P>
	PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) -- Peter A. Bordes, the founder and chairman  
of Greater Media Inc., died of cancer on Monday. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
	Bordes and Yale classmate Joseph Rosenmiller started the company  
in 1956 with the purchase of a small radio station in Southbridge, 
Mass. The East Brunswick-based Greater Media now owns five FM 
stations in Boston, four FM stations in Philadelphia, three FM 
stations in Detroit and WCTC-AM and WMGQ-FM in the New Brunswick 
area. It also owns six community newspapers serving 175,000 people 
in central New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The company owned a 173,000-subscriber cable system in Worcester  
and Springfield, Mass., and a 78,000-subscriber system in 
Philadelphia until last month, when it sold its Massachusetts 
system to Charter Communications and its Philadelphia system to 
Comcast Corp. 
</P>

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Sir Hugh Fish, a British environmental engineer  
who led efforts in the 1970s to clean the River Thames, died May 
26. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	By the mid-1960s, eels were the only fish that could withstand  
the pollution in river running through the British capital. Fish 
joined the Thames River Authority in 1969, as chief purification 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was promoted to director of scientific services in 1974,  
cooperation between the agency and industry had improved the 
river's quality so that 80 varieties of fish thrived in the Thames. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, 5,000 salmon fry were released in the Thames in hopes  
that some would return as adults to reproduce. Finally, a 6-pound 
salmon was caught in 1985, one year after Fish stepped down as the 
agency's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, Fish was recognized as an expert in water management.  
He served on numerous boards and advised both China and Poland on 
water management.

mogul Julio Gallo, died Wednesday after a brief illness. She was 
86. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gallo was born in Manteca and came to Modesto at age 7. In  
1976, the Gallos purchased the McHenry Mansion and presented it to 
the city of Modesto for historic preservation.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ludwik Gross, who influenced cancer research by  
showing that viruses could cause cancer in animals, died Monday of 
stomach cancer. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Gross' work won him an Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation prize  
in 1974. The Lasker jury said his findings opened the field of 
tumor virology in mammals and laid the groundwork for later 
discoveries of cancer-inducing viruses in other species. 
</P>
<P>
	After immigrating to the United States from Poland in 1940,  
Gross worked at Jewish Hospital and Christ Hospital in Cincinnati. 
After serving in World War II, Gross became chief of cancer 
research at the Bronx V.A. Hospital in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	A medical journalist, Gross was a member of the National Academy  
of Sciences and wrote ``Oncogenic Viruses,'' a textbook that became 
a standard in the field. His last article appeared in 1998 in the 
publication Proceedings.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Arthur Katz, who created the Corgi toy cars  
beloved by a generation of collectors, died June 26. He was 91. 
</P>
<P>
	Katz is best known for improving upon the typical die-cast metal  
toy cars by adding details, gadgets and gimmicks that thrilled 
children and adults -- who now pay hundreds of dollars for mint 
condition Corgi cars from the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his mother's cousin, Philip Ullman, founded their  
company, Mettoy Ltd., in 1933, with its first factory in 
Northampton, central England. It later expanded to Swansea, Wales. 
</P>
<P>
	When Katz began his famous car line in 1956, he named it Corgi  
in honor of the British royal family's favorite breed of dog, and 
as a nod to the company's connection to Wales, where the dog is 
bred. 
</P>
<P>
	Corgi's most successful model was a miniature replica of the  
Aston Martin DB5 sports car driven by James Bond in the 1964 film 
``Goldfinger'' -- complete with rotating license plates, hub caps 
with tire slashers, machine gun turrets that pop out from behind 
the headlights and an ejection seat.

eye-patched Man in the Hathaway Shirt and created the distinguished 
Commander Whitehead to pitch ``Schweppervescent'' mixers, died 
Wednesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogilvy was 37 years old when he started his agency, which later  
was known as Ogilvy &AMP; Mather. Success was swift. Over the years, 
his clients included General Foods, Lever Brothers, Shell, Sears, 
and American Express. 
</P>
<P>
	While his advertising ideas have become American icons, Ogilvy's  
greatest legacy was an approach to his business that regarded the 
consumer as an intelligent buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	He set out his principles in memos for his staff, and in three  
books: ``Confessions of an Advertising Man,'' a bestseller in 1963; 
``Blood, Brain &AMP; Beer,'' a 1978 memoir, and ``Ogilvy on 
Advertising,'' five years later.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Trudi Schoop, regarded as the female Charlie  
Chaplin for her comic dance performances and a pioneer in using 
dance to treat mental illness, died July 14. She was 95. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoop was born in Zurich, Switzerland, and was a self-taught  
dancer and mimic. She first came to the United States in 1934 and 
continued to perform throughout Canada and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	After disbanding her troupe in 1947, Schoop began focusing on  
using dance as therapy for schizophrenic patients. 
</P>
<P>
	After University of California, Los Angeles neuropsychiatric  
experts reviewed her theories, they recommended Schoop as a 
therapist at Camarillo State Mental Hospital. She went on to teach 
her methods throughout the United States and Europe.

<HEADLINE> Gateway Profit Rises 47 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Gateway Inc. on Thursday reported a 47 percent  
increase in second quarter earnings on strong growth in the 
domestic consumer and business units despite fierce competition and 
price cuts in the personal computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Gateway posted a net income of $89.2 million, or 56 cents per  
share, on sales of $1.9 billion for the three months ending June 
30, compared to net income of $60.7 million, or 38 cents a share, 
on sales of $1.6 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected earnings of  
55 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	P. Ted Waitt, Gateway's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,  
attributed the strong showing to robust consumer demand and the 
company's diversification. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to focus like a laser on executing our strategy of  
moving beyond the box, and it paid off with a record quarter in 
what's typically the industry's slowest period,'' Waitt said. 
``Non-PC income is now well over 10 percent, which is where we said 
we'd be by year-end. Clearly, we're well ahead of our plan to 
generate a richer, more diverse revenue stream, while our core 
systems business has never been healthier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Subscribers to Gateway.net, the company's Internet service  
provider, doubled to more than 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego-based Gateway shipped more than 1 million units in the  
second quarter, up 36 percent from a year earlier. Unit sales in 
the United States increased 36 percent while revenues rose 18 
percent -- a sign of the increased price competition in the market. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, Gateway's earnings were up  
38 percent to $1.89 million, or $1.18 per share, from $1.37 
million, or 86 cents a share, for the first half of 1998. Sales for 
the first six months of 1999 were $4 billion, compared with $3.3 
billion a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Smith's Agent Wonders About Bengals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Akili Smith's agent is wondering why the  
Cincinnati Bengals seem resigned to having the quarterback miss the 
start of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Bengals general manager Mike Brown said Thursday that he doesn't  
think the team will reach a contract agreement with its No. 1 draft 
pick before camp opens on July 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, the third overall pick, has been working with Bengals  
coaches to learn the offense. The team expects him to be a backup 
to Jeff Blake this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the sides are talking, they remain at odds over how  
Smith's contract should be structured. The Bengals want an 
incentive-based deal like the one running back Ricky Williams 
accepted from New Orleans. Smith is looking for something more 
along the lines of what quarterback Tim Couch, the top pick in the 
draft, got from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would tell you it's unlikely Akili will sign before we  
depart to camp,'' Brown said during the team's annual preseason 
luncheon. ``We would like to have him there. It's going depend 
probably on how some other deals (for other first-round picks) are 
done. I don't have a feeling that we're going to be in the 
forefront this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's agent, Leigh Steinberg, was surprised by Brown's  
comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is extremely puzzling for a team executive to unilaterally  
declare the negotiating process over 10 days before training 
camp,'' Steinberg said. ``I continue to be optimistic that we can 
work out an acceptable contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They're still in disagreement over what shape it will take.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams, chosen right after Smith, agreed to an incentive-laden  
contract worth between $11.1 million and $68.4 million, depending 
upon how he performs. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg got Brown to accept ``voidable years'' in contracts  
for first-round picks Dan Wilkinson in 1994 and Ki-Jana Carter in 
1995. He's looking for something closer to the structure of Couch's 
deal, which has a voidable buyback -- a chance to keep the length of 
contract intact by paying another bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown noted that only six of the 31 first-round picks were  
signed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is something that's been with the NFL for many, many  
years, as long as we've had this system,'' Brown said. ``Fewer than 
half of the first-round picks have signed by the start of training 
camp, so this doesn't surprise me. It's really little different 
than what it's been in previous years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg pointed out that it took only 11 days to get a deal  
for Wilkinson in 1994 and Carter reported two days into training 
camp in 1995. He thought Brown was being overly pessimistic about 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising because our recent negotiating history with  
the Bengals has been very positive,'' Steinberg said.

<HEADLINE> NASA To Try Columbia Launch Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the third time this week, Eileen  
Collins slid into the commander's seat of Columbia late Thursday 
for liftoff on the first U.S. space flight to be led by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure was on: If the space shuttle didn't lift off early  
Friday, it would be grounded for a month at a cost of millions of 
dollars. The telescope-delivery mission already is almost one year 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either three strikes and you're out, or the third time's  
the charm,'' said NASA spokesman George Diller. 
</P>
<P>
	As Collins, an Air Force colonel, departed for the launch pad, a  
female space worker waved a sign that read: ``Eileen, Just Do 
It!!!'' In her other hand was the sign: ``Don't Come Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a superstitious jab at Steven Hawley, who's endured 13 launch  
delays in his astronaut career, several workers held sheets of 
white paper in front of their faces as disguises. And once again 
Hawley pulled a brown paper bag over his head before boarding 
Columbia late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms took NASA by surprise early Thursday and prevented  
Columbia from blasting off with Collins, the first woman to lead a 
mission in 38 years of U.S. human space flight, and the $1.5 
billion Chandra Observatory, the world's most powerful X-ray 
telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a hydrogen leak scare in the final seconds of the  
countdown scuttled everything. It turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea went away  
disappointed both times. They did not return for Friday's try. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists, some of whom have worked on the Chandra project for  
two decades, were growing more anxious. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``when you've waited 20 years to get the X-ray telescope on  
orbit, one additional day is not something to get particularly 
concerned about,'' said Earle Huckins, NASA's deputy associate 
administrator for space science. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-foot telescope, once released from Columbia, will spend  
at least five years searching for black holes and peering at 
galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. Astronomers hope to learn 
more about the mysterious dark matter that is believed to fill the 
universe, and better determine the distance to celestial objects. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan called for the five astronauts to eject Chandra from  
the shuttle cargo bay seven hours after liftoff. At 50,000 pounds, 
including a rocket motor and support gear, it is the heaviest 
payload ever carried by a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	To improve the odds of sending Columbia up Friday, NASA extended  
the launch window from 46 minutes to nearly two hours after new 
calculations showed that the telescope has more battery power than 
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was NASA's last chance to launch Columbia until mid- to  
late August because of the impending shutdown of Air Force launch 
facilities for more than three weeks of improvements.

<HEADLINE> Natural Gas Up on Expected Demand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Natural gas futures rose to a three-week high Thursday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange as hot temperatures in the Midwest and 
Northeast were expected to pump up energy demand. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, lean hogs and pork bellies closed strong while  
grain and soybean futures were mixed following a rally earlier in 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures prices advanced more than 6 percent as  
several Midwestern states issued heat advisories, with air 
conditioners and fans working overtime. Electric utilities often 
fire up their natural gas units in times of peak demand. 
</P>
<P>
	August natural gas rose 1.42 cents to $2.395 for each 1,000  
cubic feet, its highest level since June 30, when it traded at 
$2.420. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil futures also staged a moderate recovery Thursday as  
Venezuela's energy and mines minister announced that OPEC and 
non-OPEC oil producers were at between 93 percent and 95 percent 
compliance with their accord to reduce oil supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigerian officials also backed away from a statement earlier  
this week that the country planned to increase its oil output by 
215,000 barrels a day. A Nigeria National Petroleum Corp. official 
said the report was not true. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Evans, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group in New  
York, said the OPEC ``public relations campaign,'' along with 
technical factors, helped drive the increases in crude oil and 
energy products. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're crossing their hearts and hoping to die in regards to  
the agreed-to production cuts,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude for September delivery rose 29 cents to $19.94 a barrel;  
August heating oil rose 1.06 cents to 50.27 cents a gallon; August 
unleaded gasoline rose .62 cent to 60.23 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork products saw gains on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as  
producers anticipated lower slaughter rates, cutting supply to 
consumers. Producers typically move fewer hogs during hot weather. 
</P>
<P>
	August lean hogs rose 2 cents to 46.87 cents a pound, while  
August pork bellies increased by the limit of 3 cents for the 
second day in a row, rising to 40.60 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean and grain futures were mixed on the Chicago Board of  
Trade after seeing a sharp increase earlier in the week as 
temperatures in Midwestern growing states climbed into the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures closed slightly higher as traders waited to see  
whether the Midwestern heat wave would continue, possibly causing 
more damage to crops. The National Weather Service predicted 
continued heat, but private forecasters showed more moderating 
temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans closed lower amid the wait for more extensive Midwest  
forecasts. Soybeans are hardier than corn and can tolerate heat 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat got an early boost after weekly export sales exceeded  
expectations, but heavy commercial selling countered the early 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
	December wheat rose 1/2 cent to $2.70 a bushel; December corn rose  
1/4 cent to $2.15 1/4 a bushel; December oats fell 1 1/2 cents to $1.16 3/4 a 
bushel; November soybeans fell 2 1/4 cents to $4.56 1/4 a bushel.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Charley Pride has reason to be proud -- he has  
his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	The country star, who was the first black to join the Grand Ole

<HEADLINE> Russian Calls for Mir To Come Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- In the latest sign that Russia will carry through  
with plans to abandon the Mir space station, the country's top 
space official said the orbiter should be scrapped before a serious 
accident occurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yuri Koptev, the general director of the Russian Space Agency,  
said Russia should bring down the Mir next year as planned while 
the station's reputation remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better to bring the station down to the bed of the  
Pacific Ocean with honor rather than prolong its service life until 
serious troubles occur that will mar the history of this unique 
example of Russian space engineering,'' Koptev said Wednesday, 
according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Russian roulette in outer space is inadmissible.''  
</P>
<P>
	The 13-year-old Mir has suffered several near disasters,  
including a fire and a collision in 1997, but has been largely 
trouble-free since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Koptev said Russia has overshot its budget several times paying  
for the Mir and must dedicate its limited resources to the 
16-nation international space station now that the Mir has 
completed all its planned tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials are reluctant to part with the Mir, the last  
remaining symbol of Russian space glory, and have said it could 
stay in orbit for several more years if money can be found to pay 
its annual $250 million operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has said it will discard the station next year  
unless the money can be raised from nongovernment sources. Several 
attempts by Russian space agencies to find the funds have failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The current three-man crew on the Mir is scheduled to return to  
earth in August, and no replacement team will be sent unless 
funding can be found. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the Mir is unmanned, Russian space officials plan to  
gradually bring down the station's orbit over a course of several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	They will eventually direct it toward a remote part of the  
Pacific Ocean, though most of the station should burn up on 
re-entry into the earth's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA wants Russia to get rid of the Mir so it can focus on its  
part of the international space station. Russia's failure to build 
a key segment has contributed to delays that have the station 
running almost two years behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Koptev said the other 15 countries participating in the new  
space station told him the project could be threatened if Russia 
doesn't meet its commitments. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments by several officials in recent weeks have indicated the  
government is growing resigned to the station's likely demise. 
Deputy Prime Minister Ilya Klebanov said Wednesday Russia can't 
afford the Mir and should abandon it.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Lower; Dow Down 33.56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan shook  
financial markets Thursday, fretting over lofty stock prices and 
promising to ``act promptly and forcefully'' at the first hint of 
inflation dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a volatile session on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average fell 33.56 to close at 10,969.22. 
</P>
<P>
	The index plunged as Greenspan began his remarks, and trading  
remained turbulent as Wall Street debated the impact of his 
testimony. At one point, the Dow dipped more than 100 points from 
Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index was dragged lower by steep losses in  
technology stocks, closing down 77.33 at 2,684.44. The Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index fell 18.32 to 1,360.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Fed raised interest rates last month in a bid to stave  
off inflation, stocks have rallied to new records, helped along by 
strong corporate earnings. Recent economic barometers have shown 
virtually no signs of inflation, lulling many analysts into the 
belief that Greenspan would not offer any hints of further rate 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan told the House banking committee that while 1999  
has been an exceptional year for the American economy, the Fed 
remains poised to fight any inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony ``left little doubt that he is nervous  
about inflation risks in the United States,'' said Michael Moran, 
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York. 
Still, Moran expects the Fed will leave rates unchanged when its 
Open Market Committee meets Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more threatening to markets, Greenspan said he remains  
worried about the high valuations of U.S. stocks in light of the 
continued growth of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted,  
perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity 
prices to levels that are unsupportable,'' Greenspan said. He added 
that remarkable increases in workers' productivity have fostered 
growth in the economy and in the markets, and those increases may 
be too difficult to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Dwyer, chief equity strategist at Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co.,  
said Greenspan's cautious tone was not entirely unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
	``After just one rate increase, it would be wrong to assume that  
everything is right with the U.S. economy,'' he said. ``Greenspan 
made it clear that the Fed will take its time to evaluate all the 
data.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices plummeted, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury  
bond climbing to 5.96 percent from 5.9 percent late Wednesday. That 
further pressured stocks, particularly the highly priced technology 
shares that could suffer most in higher interest-rate environments. 
</P>
<P>
	Hewlett Packard, which fell 7 5/16 to 105 1/4, suffered the  
steepest decline among Dow component stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony drew Wall Street's focus away from the  
continuing stream of corporate earnings. The robust earnings season 
continued, but investors held to their pattern of selling stocks 
once their strong earnings are on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online fell 4 9/16 to 110 1/2 after reporting late  
Wednesday that its earnings nearly tripled in its fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com plunged 18 1/4 to 107 3/16 after surprising Wall Street  
with the prospect of steeper losses in future quarters. The online 
retailer Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss that matched 
analysts' estimates, and said it will spend heavily to expand its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology companies are also suffering a round of  
profit-taking after leading the market to its new record highs 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tech stocks were overbought, overvalued and  
overextended,'' Dwyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 12-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. Composite volume totaled 934.93 
million shares, compared with 947.00 million in the previous 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 5.70 to 641.78, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 7.00 to 799.81. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 3.14 to 451.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.89 percent as the  
dollar continued its decline against the yen. A weaker dollar could 
hurt Japanese exporters, threatening their profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In Europe, Germany's DAX index fell 1.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE  
100 was down 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Long Love of Ocean for Kennedy Clan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- John F. Kennedy Jr. will spend eternity where  
generations of his family have sought escape, solace and recreation 
-- at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all came from the sea,'' his father, the 35th president, a  
Navy veteran and an avid sailor, said in 1962. ``We are tied to the 
ocean. And when we go back to the sea -- whether it is to sail or to 
watch it -- we are going back from whence we came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the ashes of JFK Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy, and sister-in-law Lauren Bessette were dropped into the 
sea off Martha's Vineyard, near the spot where they were killed 
when Kennedy's plane crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``That the sea would factor in so largely in his death is rather  
ironic,'' said Wendy Northcross, vice chair of the John F. Kennedy 
Hyannis Museum. ``And his remains will ultimately stay with the 
sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being lost at sea five days, the three bodies were  
recovered by Navy divers Wednesday from the twisted wreckage 116 
feet underwater. The site is in view of the beachside estate 
Kennedy and his sister, Caroline, inherited from their mother, 
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, was piloting the plane to Martha's Vineyard on  
Friday to drop off Lauren Bessette and then head to a family 
wedding at the Kennedy compound at Hyannis Port. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy compound was the family's retreat from the glare of  
public attention. The Kennedys could escape out back, onto Hyannis 
Harbor, where the wind could carry them away from the cares they 
left on land. 
</P>
<P>
	Sailing was a passionate rite of summer at Hyannis Port when  
John F. Kennedy was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They learned to compete on the sea,'' said Evan Thomas,  
assistant managing editor at Newsweek. ``And all those sailboat 
races was one of the arenas where they learned to live life and 
fight hard. When war came, they chose to fight on the sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In smooth times and rough, the family has taken to the sea.  
</P>
<P>
	Even as they awaited word on the search effort for JFK Jr.,  
family members, including his aunt Ethel Kennedy, took to the water 
in boats. 
</P>
<P>
	As a toddler, JFK Jr. was photographed in a beached dingy with  
his father. As a teen, he sailed off Hawaii with a cousin. As a 
man, he and his sister cruised aboard the aircraft carrier named 
for their father. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he remains in the American memory as the brave little  
soldier who saluted his father's casket on his third birthday, Nov. 
25, 1963, Kennedy never served in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a poignancy when you think of the images of his  
father's funeral,'' Thomas said. ``To see JFK Jr. carried to sea in 
that destroyer does echo his father's funeral. You think of hearing 
the Navy Hymn played over and over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The young Kennedy was at ease behind the controls of a motorboat  
and was frequently seen windsurfing off Martha's Vineyard or 
paddling a sea kayak near the compound. Pictures of him emerging 
from the waters off Hyannis Port in his swim trunks were published 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little doubt he shared his family's romance with the  
sea, perhaps as a link to the father he hardly knew. 
</P>
<P>
	Few were as passionate about the sea as the 35th president, who  
sailed throughout his life and became a hero for rescuing crew 
members of the sunken patrol-torpedo boat, PT-109, he commanded in 
the Pacific during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	At the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum in Boston, where  
visitors streamed in to sign the condolence book this week, the 
late president's sailboat, Victura, sits outside near Dorchester 
Bay, and his words about the sea are inscribed on the wall.

<HEADLINE> Poll: No Single Issue Dominates 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No single issue dominates the presidential  
race as the economy did eight years ago, but health care reform, 
Social Security and Medicare are leading the way this year, says a 
new poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll released Thursday by the Pew Research Center for the  
People &AMP; the Press indicated those three issues had a slight edge 
over education, tax-cutting, balancing the budget, crime and gun 
control. In 1991, more than four of 10 voters surveyed named the 
economy as the top issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton focused on the economy heavily in his drive to  
defeat President Bush in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	But the political landscape is not so clear-cut this time.  
Health care reform was favored by 18 percent, Social Security by 14 
percent and Medicare by 11 percent. Democrats usually have an 
advantage on these issues in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the good news for Democrats, but the bad news is that  
none of these issues are so overriding that they will dominate the 
election like the economy did in 1992,'' said Andrew Kohut, 
director of the Pew Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The overall picture hasn't changed much in polling on the  
presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Gov. George W. Bush has a large lead (60 percent) with  
Republican voters over former Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole 
(13 percent), former Vice President Dan Quayle (9 percent) and the 
other candidates. Vice President Al Gore retained a 65 percent to 
29 percent lead over former Sen. Bill Bradley with the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush led Gore 53 percent to 42 percent in a head-to-head  
matchup, similar to his lead in other recent polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,200 adults was taken July 13-18 and had  
an error margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points, larger for 
subgroups.

<HEADLINE> Report: Urban Issues Affect Suburbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Social and health concerns once centered in  
America's cities are surfacing in suburbia, according to a report 
that says the lines between urban and suburban areas is blurring. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities and their outskirts are reporting similar rates of  
violent crime, the National Public Health and Hospital Institute 
said in the report released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Outlying areas also are experiencing a rise in teen-age  
pregnancy and the numbers of dangerously small newborns, and are 
beginning to confront the problems of providing health care to the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
	``The findings raise questions about the wisdom of policy  
initiatives that are based on outdated assumptions -- that cities 
are dangerous enclaves with intractable social problems while 
suburbs are America's Pleasantvilles,'' Dennis Andrulis, the author 
of the report, said referring to ``Pleasantville,'' a movie partly 
set in the idealized life of postwar suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
	The report compiles information on poverty, crime, disease and  
health care in the nation's 100 largest cities, their counties and 
their larger metropolitan areas for the years 1980 to 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the findings in the report:  
</P>
<P>
	--Cities in the Northeast had lower increases in low-birth weight  
infants than surrounding suburbs between 1985 and 1995 -- 11 percent 
and 13 percent, respectively. Births to teen-age mothers in these 
cities decreased more than 7 percent while their suburbs 
experienced almost a 3 percent increase during the same 10-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	--Blacks, Hispanics and foreign-born populations increasingly are  
settling in the suburbs. Forty-six urban counties and only 10 
cities had an increase in black residents between 1980 and 1990. In 
the counties surrounding the 25 largest cities, the Hispanic 
population rose an average of 46 percent in the 10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	--From 1990 to 1996, one-third of the largest cities led their  
counties in violent crime rate declines. Cities with the highest 
crime rates in the 1980s showed the greatest reduction in crime 
rates through 1996. The 25 largest cities collectively experienced 
an 11 percent decline between 1990 and 1996 while the rate in 
surrounding cities increased 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The number of suburban or county public hospitals, which  
traditionally have provided the most health care to the poor, 
declined 43 percent between 1990 and 1996.

<HEADLINE> Veteran Ump: No Choice But To Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- One of major league baseball's most  
experienced umpires says league officials gave he and colleagues no 
choice but to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Kaiser, 53, said the commissioner's office was considering  
getting rid of 20 umpires after this season. The 23-year American 
League veteran told his hometown newspaper that the league had no 
valid reason to let umpires go. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many jobs can you get fired (from) without a valid  
reason?'' Kaiser said in today's Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. 
``We were good enough to get up here and we aren't any worse now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By resigning, the umpires would be eligible for more than $15  
million in severance pay. As one of the 10 most senior umpires, 
Kaiser said he would get around $400,000. If fired, an umpire gets 
no severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the circumstances, what would you or anyone else do?''  
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Major League Baseball has given the umpires until Friday to  
rescind their resignations or face the prospect of losing their 
jobs permanently. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know much of the public and media think we're the bad  
guys,'' Kaiser told the newspaper. ``So why can't the good guys 
(Major League Baseball) deal with us fairly? 
</P>
<P>
	``None of us want a work stoppage,'' he added. ``We love the  
game. But we have to protect our livelihood and provide for our 
families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-three of the 66 unionized major league umpires quit last  
week, effective Sept. 2, but five are known to have changed their 
minds. As many as 10 more may be withdrawing their resignations, 
baseball officials said, but umpires said baseball may be 
exaggerating the number to sway wavering umps.

<HEADLINE> American Express Launches Online </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- American Express has launched its own Internet  
bank, betting that a well-known brand name will persuade consumers 
to give up the security blanket of a local branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership Banking is the latest foray by a major financial  
company in a suddenly crowded market. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the leading U.S. banks have already provided their  
customers with Internet options for some time, supplementing their 
branch services with online access to account information, 
fund-transfer capabilities and electronic bill payment. 
</P>
<P>
	But recently there's been a push toward virtual, branchless  
banking, with the online broker ETrade acquiring Telebanc Financial 
for $1.6 billion and Bank One launching WingspanBank.com. 
</P>
<P>
	As it is, even with the explosive growth of e-commerce and  
online investing, most consumers are still somewhat hesitant about 
conducting financial transactions on the Internet, and even more so 
when it comes to managing their finances. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a report in June by Goldman Sachs, only as many as  
4 percent of U.S. households currently use online banking products. 
That number is expected to increase to about 20 percent by 2002, 
the investment firm projected. 
</P>
<P>
	``Online banking is still in its infancy,'' said Kenneth  
Clemmer, an industry analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``My intuition is that there is a greater barrier here because  
of people's ingrained behavior,'' he said. ``Many people are used 
to dealing with bank in physical way. Almost all accounts still 
opened face-to-face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Express' new virtual bank, accessible by Internet,  
telephone, and cash machine, will feature the normal array of 
services, including savings, checking and money market accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other virtual banks, including industry leader Net.Bank,  
the new offering from American Express hopes to snare customers 
with compelling interest rates on savings and loans, as well as 
free, unlimited check-writing and electronic bill payment.

<HEADLINE> Embassy Bombing Mistakes Detailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA had accurate maps and some agency  
employees knew the correct location of the Chinese embassy in 
Belgrade mistakenly bombed by NATO in May, CIA Director George 
Tenet said today. But the agency did not rely on those sources 
before recommending the allies attack a supposed military target 
that was in fact the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding new detail to a mistake that shook Sino-American  
relations, the nation's spy chief and the Pentagon's No. 2 official 
told a House committee about the errors that led a B-2 bomber to 
attack the embassy compound around midnight May 7. The attack came 
during NATO's 78-days of airstrikes to force Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic to halt his campaign against ethnic Albanians in 
the province of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``War is about violence, it's about destruction and  
unfortunately it's also about accidents,'' Deputy Defense Secretary 
John Hamre told the House Intelligence Committee. Both Hamre and 
Tenet accepted responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a major error,'' Tenet said. ``The ultimate  
responsibility for the role of intelligence in this tragedy is 
mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attack killed three Chinese journalists who were working out  
of the embassy. China initially rebuffed U.S. explanations and 
apologies, saying that U.S. weapons technology ruled out the 
possibility of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the committee, said the  
intelligence community had to face key questions as it examines its 
errors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is it true that 'smart bombs' without good intelligence to  
guide them are actually 'dumb bombs?''' Goss said. Given that the 
U.S. military relies increasingly on precision-weapons, ``what 
additional intelligence requirements does this reliance on such 
weapons generate?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new details disclosed in Thursday's hearing, Hamre and  
Tenet told the committee: 
</P>
<P>
	--The Yugoslav Federal Directorate for Supply and Procurement was  
the only target selected by the CIA for NATO bombing. The Pentagon 
and NATO did virtually all the strike planning. An error in 
pinpointing the coordinates of the directorate was the principle 
cause of the mistaken bombing. The directorate headquarters turned 
out to be about 330 yards from the Chinese embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	--The CIA was pressed into service selecting a target because the  
Pentagon urgently demanded more targets as the air campaign dragged 
on longer than NATO and the Clinton administration had anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	--Maps initially consulted by target planners showed the Chinese  
embassy in a prior location across town. After the bombing, when 
the CIA realized its mistake, the agency found maps in its files 
that showed the embassy in its new location, after a 1996 move. One 
map was published by a Belgrade bank; the other was a standard 
commercial map that only showed the approximate area of the 
embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	--The CIA had access to employees and colleagues -- including the  
former station chief in Belgrade and the U.S. military attache to 
Yugoslavia -- who knew the embassy's location. But they were not 
consulted by target planners or by officials drawing up lists of 
sites to be avoided, such as hospitals, schools and diplomatic 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of 9,300 strike sorties directed at 900 targets and  
involving more than 24,000 bombs, there were only 30 instances in 
which NATO planes ``caused damage we did not intend,'' Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 10 instances, the correct targets were struck but there were  
unintended civilian casualties; three were caused by human error, 
as when a pilot became disoriented and bombed a hospital more than 
a mile from the intended target; the remaining instances involved 
either mechanical or human error. 
</P>
<P>
	The mistaken bombing of the Chinese embassy marked the only case  
in which the error was made by people selecting the target, Hamre 
said.

<HEADLINE> Xerox Profits Rise 13 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Xerox Corp. today said its profits from  
continuing operations climbed 13 percent in the second quarter, 
citing higher revenues and cost-savings from a restructuring 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income was $448 million, or 62 cents per share, compared  
with $395 million, or 58 cents per share in the same period a year 
ago, before a restructuring charge of $1.11 billion in the second 
quarter of 1998. Including the restructuring charge, the company 
reported a loss of $712 million, or $1.10 per share, in the 1998 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings matched expectations of 62 cents per share from  
Wall Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues increased 3 percent to $4.86 billion, up from $4.74  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its results were helped by a rebound in revenue  
growth in the United States and Europe, productivity and expense 
controls, and savings from its restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Xerox announced in April 1998 that it would eliminate 9,000  
jobs, or about 10 percent of its worldwide work force, to save 
approximately $1 billion a year. About 1,800 jobs were eliminated 
in the second quarter. In total, 8,200 jobs have been cut since the 
restructuring began 15 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Digital product revenues increased 26 percent in the quarter and  
represented more than half of total company revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Black-and-white light-lens copier revenues declined 20 percent  
in the quarter as a result of weakness in Brazil, continued pricing 
pressures and customer transition to digital copiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues from the company's document outsourcing business grew  
34 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our global growth opportunities are substantial and we are  
aggressively marketing our broad and technologically innovative 
line of products, services and industry solutions,'' Xerox 
President and Chief Executive Officer Rick Thoman said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, income from continuing  
operations increased 13 percent to $791 million, or $1.09 per 
share, before the $1.11 billion restructuring charge in the second 
quarter of 1998. Including the charge, the company reported a loss 
of $600 million, or 95 cents per share, in the first six months of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the first six percent increased 1 percent to $9.16  
billion, compared with $9.05 billion a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: Inflation May Be Lurking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using tough language that jolted Wall Street,  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pledged Thursday to move 
``promptly and forcefully'' to counter inflation if the need 
arises. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's blunt talk, which also included new expressions of  
concern about the high-flying stock market, was seen as an 
unmistakable warning that future Fed rate increases were on the 
way. One analyst called it a ``stern lecture'' to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices, which had been hitting new highs on the belief  
that the Fed would be slow to boost interest rates further, 
initially plunged by more than 100 points on Greenspan's comments. 
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 33.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell sharply as well with the big drop in demand  
pushing the yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond up to 5.97 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While declaring that the U.S. economy so far is enjoying an  
``exceptional year,'' Greenspan left no doubt that the central bank 
was ready to follow up last month's quarter-point increase in 
interest rates, the first in two years, with further increases 
should the need arise. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments, which came as he delivered the Fed's  
midyear economic report to Congress, were a lot tougher than 
investors had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I viewed Mr. Greenspan's testimony as a stern lecture to the  
stock market,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo 
in Minneapolis. ``He gave the market a cold shower to try to cool 
it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed on June 30 nudged up to 5 percent its target for the  
federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, 
triggering an immediate quarter-point increase in banks' prime 
lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and small 
business loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street rallied after that rate hike because the Fed  
immediately announced it was moving its policy directive -- an 
indication of future moves -- from one leaning toward tightening 
back to neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Greenspan's comments Thursday were a strong  
indication the policy directive will now be switched back at the 
August meeting to one leaning toward higher rates. And many 
analysts said they were looking for the Fed to follow with one or 
two more rate hikes, beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted a number of concerns about inflation coming from  
tight labor markets. He also cautioned that investors had become 
too confident that recent strong gains in productivity would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	If productivity does not continue rising at its recent pace and  
if red-hot consumer demand does not moderate, he said, then ``the 
economy could overheat. That would engender inflationary pressures 
and put the sustainability of this unprecedented period of 
remarkable growth in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of this threat, Greenspan said, ``the Federal Reserve  
will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude 
imbalances from arising that would only require more disruptive 
adjustments later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Greenspan became chairman in 1987, a common mistake at  
the Fed had been waiting too long to battle rising inflation, 
requiring even steeper hikes in interest rates and eventually 
pushing the country into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who first worried about ``irrational exuberance'' in  
the stock market in December 1996, re-emphasized those concerns 
Thursday. He said that recent record highs in stock prices could be 
indicating the presence of an ``asset bubble,'' meaning when prices 
burst and fall back to more realistic levels, investors could face 
painful losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the job of economic policy-makers to mitigate the  
fallout ... and hopefully ease the transition to the next 
expansion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems Greenspan wasn't happy with the financial markets'  
favorable response to his shift to a neutral policy stance in 
June,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; 
Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said 1999 thus far has been ``an exceptional year for  
the American economy'' with almost 1.25 million jobs being created 
and no pickup yet in consumer prices, he said. But he devoted the 
bulk of his testimony to stressing the need for ``pre-emptive 
policy-making,'' saying this was critical to keeping the 8-year-old 
economic expansion, already the longest in peacetime history, 
steaming ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed released a revised economic forecast predicting a slight  
slowdown in economic growth for the rest of this year and a bigger 
slowing in 2000 with a modest pickup in inflation. That tracked 
closely with recent forecasts by the administration and the 
Congressional Budget Office.

<HEADLINE> Ten Texans Indicted for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAREDO, Texas (AP) -- Two investigators, a police officer and  
relatives of Webb County's top prosecutor are among 10 people 
indicted on charges of taking money to fix criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Indictments unsealed Thursday claimed the 10 men used the office  
of District Attorney Joe Rubio to extort money from defendants in 
return for having criminal charges dismissed or reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the defendants were in federal custody Thursday. They  
face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubio, the district attorney for both Webb and Zapata counties,  
was not indicted. But his father, 70-year-old Jose Marcelino Rubio 
Sr., his brother, Carlos Manuel Rubio and a cousin, Jose Warren 
Rubio, were indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rubio patriarch was indicted for conspiracy and nine  
violations of the Hobbs Act, which prohibits interfering with 
commerce by robbery, extortion or threats of physical violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubio's 40-year-old brother and 32-year-old cousin were both  
charged with one count of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Also indicted were a bail bondsman, an assistant Webb County  
district attorney, a police officer and an investigator for the

<HEADLINE> Druckenmiller Acquitted of Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Jim  
Druckenmiller was acquitted Thursday of raping a 22-year-old woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence just wasn't there,'' said Keith McCarter, foreman  
of the nine-man, three-woman jury that deliberated about an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	As the verdict was read, Druckenmiller breathed a sigh of relief  
and winked at a supporter sitting in the courtroom. He hugged his 
lawyers and his parents, who were present throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm relieved, and it's time to play football,'' Druckenmiller  
said outside the Montgomery County courthouse where the four-day 
trial was held. ``I learned a tough lesson and a valuable lesson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Druckenmiller, the player's mother, said, ``It was very hard  
sitting through all of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the truth would come out, and it did,'' said James  
Druckenmiller, the quarterback's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller's accuser, through two of her sorority sisters,  
said she would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman contended she was raped after a night of drinking when  
she was too drunk to resist. Druckenmiller was visiting his alma 
mater and staying at a Blacksburg house where the alleged assault 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Druckenmiller took advantage of a drunken girl. He took  
her clothes off. She was fuzzy, she didn't know what was going on 
around her when she awakened,'' assistant prosecutor Skip Schwab 
said in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense contended the sex was consensual.  
</P>
<P>
	``She has a selective memory to recall what she wants to  
remember, and black out what she doesn't want to remember,'' 
defense lawyer Bev Davis told the jury. ``She was kissing him, 
telling him he was hot, and that she wanted to have sex with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, 26, could have faced five years to life in prison  
if convicted. He did not testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller, his accuser and several friends went out partying  
at two bars before going to the house. Three men who know 
Druckenmiller testified Wednesday they heard his accuser say she 
wanted to have sex with him. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman testified that she didn't recall kissing Druckenmiller  
or telling him she loved him and wanted to have sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, the defense played a tape recording of  
Druckenmiller's conversation with a police sergeant the day after 
the alleged attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller told the officer the woman was awake while they  
had sex and that they undressed each other beforehand. She 
testified that she passed out and woke up to find Druckenmiller on 
top of her. 
</P>
<P>
	On the recording made by the officer, Druckenmiller said he  
asked the woman after having sex if everything was OK and she said, 
``I'm drunk. I know what I'm doing. Everything's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said she started crying when she realized her friends had  
gone home without her. She declined Druckenmiller's offer of a ride 
and called a friend instead, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officer asked Druckenmiller if he knew why she had started  
to cry and he said, ``Maybe she was regretting what she had done,'' 
according to the tape.

<HEADLINE> Broncos Sign No. 1 Draft Pick </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Two days before the start of training camp, the  
Denver Broncos reached agreement with first-round draft choice Al 
Wilson on a multiyear contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The linebacker's agent, William ``Tank'' Black, told The  
Associated Press on Wednesday that the five-year deal was for 
``more than $5 million,'' including a $1.7 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been working on the contract for a while, but we really  
had no problems with it,'' Black said. ``Denver is a first-class 
organization. We're pleased to get it done before training camp. 
We've represented over 100 players and haven't had a player miss 
camp since 1988.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Denver Post reported today that Wilson's contract is for  
$5.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time defending Super Bowl champion Broncos open camp on  
Friday, when players report to Greeley, Colo. The first workouts 
are Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos still have two remaining unsigned draft choices,  
third-rounder Travis McGriff and fifth-rounder David Bowens. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, a team captain, helped lead Tennessee to a 13-0 record  
and the national championship last season. He recorded 77 tackles, 
54 of them solo, with four sacks and six tackles for losses. He 
forced five fumbles, recovered two, and deflected three passes, 
intercepting another. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-11 1/2, 239-pound Wilson, called a relentless competitor  
by scouts, started at outside linebacker his sophomore and junior 
seasons before moving to middle linebacker as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the 31st and last choice in the first round.  
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is one of four former Volunteers on the Broncos' roster,  
joining Trey Teague, Marcus Nash and Tori Noel.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Says Cut Imperils Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- President Clinton said today he would veto  
the large tax cut touted by Republicans. He urged Americans to tell 
lawmakers they'll ``settle for a smaller one'' so that more federal 
dollars can go toward the long-term survival of Medicare and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	During a forum at a community college, where he heard horror  
stories from elderly Americans and health care professionals about 
prescription drug costs, Clinton said GOP tax cut proponents are 
wrong in arguing that devoting money to Medicare and other programs 
is like throwing it away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who are for giving the surplus back to you in a tax  
cut say, 'It's your money, don't let them spend it on their 
friends,''' Clinton said. ``Well, we're spending it on Medicare, 
Social Security, and education and defense. That's us. That's all 
of us. That's not our friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that the people tell the Congress: ``Yes, you would  
like to have a tax cut, but you'll settle for a smaller one rather 
than a bigger one, if the money goes to save Medicare, and Social 
Security, and keep up our investment in the education of our 
children, and pay the debt off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No serious expert on Medicare believes we can stabilize  
Medicare without an infusion of new revenues,'' Clinton said, 
citing a statement from 50 economists who advised against large tax 
cuts and said federal surpluses would be better used to shore up 
Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``This plan being voted on in Washington will not enable us to  
pay off our debt. It will not do anything to add to the life of 
Social Security and Medicare,'' Clinton said. ``And I will veto it 
if it passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president listened as Dr. Krishna Sawhney, a general  
vascular surgeon, spoke of a patient who recently died because he 
could not afford the drugs prescribed for various ailments, 
including diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt awful that I, as a physician, felt so weak that I could  
not do more for this patient,'' Sawhney said. ``The list is very 
long of these patients who are out there suffering because they 
cannot afford these medications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton promoted an administration study that found that 75  
percent of elderly Americans lack private-sector coverage for 
prescription drugs. ``It means we need coverage that is simple, 
voluntary, available to all and completely dependable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president has proposed new, universal Medicare coverage for  
prescription drugs -- at a 10-year cost of $118 billion to taxpayers 
and a $24-a-month premium charge to beneficiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	To pay for the new benefit and buttress Medicare against the  
coming wave of baby boom retirements, Clinton wants to use $794 
billion in federal budget surpluses projected over the next 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders also have endorsed the idea of a Medicare  
drug benefit. But they are trying to earmark much of the future 
surplus for a $792 billion tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argue that Clinton's Medicare drug plan is  
unnecessarily generous and say about two-thirds of senior citizens 
already have some drug coverage -- mainly through corporate 
retirement packages, privately purchased insurance or HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	In its new study, the administration seeks to show that such  
private coverage is diminishing in value and accessibility as 
insurance prices rise and companies cut retirement benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	About one-third of the 13 million Medicare beneficiaries  
currently going without drug coverage are middle class, with annual 
incomes between $20,000 and $50,000, according to the study based 
on surveys conducted by Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Of those who do have coverage, 17 percent get it through  
government programs such as Medicaid or veterans benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly three out of five HMOs that enroll Medicare beneficiaries  
will cap drug payments below $1,000 in 2000 -- an amount exceeded by 
the needs of 38 percent of elderly Americans, the administration 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the cost of adding drug coverage to private insurance  
policies -- known as Medigap -- that are sold to supplement Medicare, 
increases steeply as a person ages. For retirees living in 
Michigan, the average price more than doubles, from $44 a month at 
age 65 to $93 a month at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans support direct Medicare drug subsidies only for  
the poorest beneficiaries. Others could be helped less expensively 
through the private sector, they say. Tax breaks for those who buy 
private Medigap insurance that covers drugs are among options GOP 
leaders are considering.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Says Cut Imperils Medicare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- President Clinton said today he would veto  
the large tax cut touted by Republicans. He urged Americans to tell 
lawmakers they'll ``settle for a smaller one'' so that more federal 
dollars can go toward the long-term survival of Medicare and other 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	During a forum at a community college, where he heard horror  
stories from elderly Americans and health care professionals about 
prescription drug costs, Clinton said GOP tax cut proponents are 
wrong in arguing that devoting money to Medicare and other programs 
is like throwing it away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who are for giving the surplus back to you in a tax  
cut say, 'It's your money, don't let them spend it on their 
friends,''' Clinton said. ``Well, we're spending it on Medicare, 
Social Security, and education and defense. That's us. That's all 
of us. That's not our friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that the people tell the Congress: ``Yes, you would  
like to have a tax cut, but you'll settle for a smaller one rather 
than a bigger one, if the money goes to save Medicare, and Social 
Security, and keep up our investment in the education of our 
children, and pay the debt off.''

<HEADLINE> Hammer Thrower Needs the Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- An athlete of Lance Deal's stature  
doesn't often compete in the Pan American Games. Deal is competing 
because he has to. 
</P>
<P>
	He needs the competition. It will be his final meet before next  
month's World Track and Field Championships at Seville, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	He needs it for world ranking purposes, because there are so few  
meaningful meets for hammer throwers. 
</P>
<P>
	He needs it to enhance his marketability, because his financial  
status depends on his performances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to be successful when it counts,'' said Deal, the 1995  
Pan American Games gold medalist. ``I don't need a lot of meets, 
but I need enough of them to pay my bills, get a good ranking, 
compete with the other guys in the world and be compared to them, 
as an equal or better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a challenge logistically. It's easier to throw 80 meters  
(262 feet, 5 inches) than to find meets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deal, the 1996 Olympic silver medalist, has not competed since  
winning his seventh national outdoor title last month in his 
hometown of Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	After the world championships, he will compete in two meets in  
Switzerland and one in Germany, ending his season prematurely on 
Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's it,'' said Deal, ranked No. 1 in the United States six  
of the past seven years, missing only in 1997 when he did not 
compete because of a bulging disc in his back. He was No. 1 in the 
world in 1996. Deal also missed the second half of the 1998 season 
with a broken bone in his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need more competition for throwers, especially hammer  
throwers. There are some little meets that Europeans can go to, but 
for me to fly to Italy for a little meet, I can't do it 
economically or physically. As a husband and a father, I can't 
afford to go to those meets and pay the rent over there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deal, 37, said he couldn't continue his career as a hammer  
thrower if not for his wife, Nancy, a physical therapist who owns 
her own business. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a viable income,'' said Deal, who has a 6-year-old  
daughter, Sarah. 
</P>
<P>
	``For every track and field athlete it's a struggle. I have no  
contract, I have no guarantees, I have no security. If I get hurt, 
I get zero. If I throw consistently, I make a good living. There 
have been a couple of years where I made more than I ever thought 
I'd make throwing. Then, I pull a disc in my back and make nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great if I can win the world championships and bring home  
$50,000. But if I trip and fall and break my wrist the day before, 
then nothing. If you look at it that way, it's a tough way to make 
a living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deal believes the sport hurts itself by limiting meets, such as  
the IAAF Grand Prix and Golden League series, to certain events, 
and paying some individuals exorbitant appearance fees. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, the throwing, jumping and distance events are eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
	``When you're talking about track and field, that means  
throwing, running and jumping,'' Deal said. ``They should not 
sacrifice any events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deal's suggestion for condensing meets into a shorter time  
frame, if that's what spectators prefer, is reducing the number of 
throws and jumps. That would make the competition more intense and 
pressure-packed, and increase fan interest. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the financial remunerations, Deal said the money ``is a  
little top-ended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the money is dispersed doesn't do the sport any  
good,'' he said. ``Youngsters say they won't go into it. They say, 
`If I goof up, I get nothing.' They can say, `If I sign with an NFL 
team and get hurt, I can still get $1 million.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Deal is not dissatisfied, though. Hammer throwing, despite its  
low rating on track and field's totem pole, has brought him some 
national and international notoriety. He empathizes with people in 
other professions. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people who go to a glue factory, work nearly all day  
and make less than I do,'' he said. ``And it's sad that I make more 
than my dad did when he was teaching for about 20 years. It's 
lopsided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deal adds to his income from track and field by manufacturing  
throwing wires and hammer cages. He also gets bonuses from Nike for 
breaking his American record of 270-9 and ``for being the 14th-best 
thrower in the history of the event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to make track and field more viable in the coming  
century.''

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000 / Jobless Claims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits rose for the second week in a row last week 
to its highest level in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that 313,000 Americans filed new  
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 17 -- up by 
4,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second consecutive increase in weekly jobless claims  
after two back-to-back declines and left the claims at their 
highest point since June 5 when they were at 326,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smooths out  
week-to-week volatility, also was up, to 305,500. That was the 
highest level since June 26 when it was at 307,250. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's increase was a little higher than many economists  
had been expecting, but still kept claims at a level indicating 
that the nation's job market remains exceptionally healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	For the month of June, the nation's unemployment rate crept up  
to 4.3 percent, still near a 29-year low. Even with the increase in 
the jobless rate the nation's businesses added a sizeable 268,000 
new jobs to their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that for the week ending July  
10, 40 states and territories reported increases in jobless claims, 
while 11 had decreases. The state data lag a week behind the 
national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase in applications for jobless  
benefits was Michigan, up 19,355, an increase officials blamed on 
layoffs in the automobile industry as companies prepare for new 
models. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with large increases were: New York, up 8,756;  
Indiana, up 8,072; Kentucky, up 5,933; and North Carolina, up 
3,746. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest decrease was California, down, 6,093,  
a decrease officials attributed to fewer layoffs in the service 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with big decreases were: Missouri, down 2,941;  
Massachusetts, down 2,655; New Jersey, down 2,630; and Maine, down 
896.

<HEADLINE> FBI Turns Over Lindbergh Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has transferred 28,500 pages of  
documents from the bureau's investigation of the 1932 kidnapping of 
aviator Charles Lindbergh's infant son to the National Archives. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents include case files compiled at FBI headquarters  
during the investigation as well as the subsequent arrest, trial 
and execution of Bruno Hauptmann for the crime, the FBI said 
Thursday. The material also contains citizen inquiries, various 
theories about the case received after Hauptmann's execution and 
the government's responses to these inquiries and theories. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> 49ers Confirm NFL Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- The NFL is looking into a possible  
salary-cap violation by the San Francisco 49ers, the team confirmed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the 49ers said the NFL was looking into the case  
of a player contract during the time when Carmen Policy was the 
team's president and Dwight Clark was general manager. Both have 
since gone to Cleveland to work for the expansion Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 49ers didn't specify the case, CNN-Sports Illustrated  
said it was the 1997 contract of tight end Brent Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	CNN-SI reported that the probe is centered on more than just the  
Jones contract, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Walsh, the 49ers general manager, said in the statement  
that the organization is cooperating with the NFL in the case. He 
declined further comment.

<HEADLINE> More Umps Switch Quitting Decisions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With commissioner Bud Selig set to accept their  
resignations, more major league umpires changed their minds about 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig hasn't set any deadlines for umpires to withdraw their  
resignations, which are effective Sept. 2. But baseball officials 
have said Selig is prepared to move on and hire new umps, several 
management officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though their Triple-A counterparts are ready to step in, it  
was too early to say how many would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Five AL umpires who reversed themselves earlier this week and as  
many as 8-10 more umpires might be withdrawing their resignations, 
two baseball officials said. But umpires said baseball might be 
exaggerating the number to sway wavering umps. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NL umpires have changed their minds about resigning, said  
NL umpire Bruce Froemming, a union board member. Wally Bell's 
reversal was received by the National League on Wednesday and 
rookie umpire Jeff Nelson told the league his will be arriving 
shortly, one baseball official said. 
</P>
<P>
	A top minor league official said Triple-A umpires decided they  
would work major league games if they are called up. However, they 
are being pressured not to work, according to Pat O'Conner, a vice 
president of the governing body of the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to get them to change their minds,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union head Richie Phillips and union president Jerry Crawford  
said they had no knowledge of any pressure attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was reacting to ``recent bashing by the media, jeering  
from irate fans, continued stonewalling from management and the 
union's own internal turmoil,'' Crawford issued a four-word 
statement: ``What else is new?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had turmoil,'' Crawford said later in San  
Francisco. ``We've always had fans against us. We've always had 
baseball management against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two top baseball officials, speaking on the condition they not  
be identified, said baseball was told more withdrawals of 
resignations were on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-three of the 66 unionized major league umpires quit last  
week, and Phillips said additional resignations will be submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Froemming, a union board member, said Phillips had become the  
issue for some umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become personal,'' Froemming said. ``We're not  
divided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several AL umpires who voted in March against giving Phillips a  
new contract have renewed calls to replace him, but the majority 
still backs him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That group was there long before March,'' Phillips said.  
``That group existed for at least five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has attempted to organize minor league umpires and has  
held a series of telephone conference calls, with another scheduled 
for today. While there had been a threat of a walkout in the minors 
today, no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll give the National Association ample time to  
prepare,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, the National Association of Professional Baseball  
Leagues, the minor leagues' governing body, has instructed its 
teams to have alternate umpires at games. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league umpires, bound by a no-strike clause, decided on  
the resignations because they fear owners will lock them out after 
their labor contract expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bud said it's sad,'' Froemming said. ``What's sad is that  
baseball doesn't have enough respect to address a situation that 
they know was coming. ... It looks like they want a war, for 
whatever reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and Froemming disputed the claim that Triple-A umps had  
voted to work major league games if asked to. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a very confusing vote,'' Phillips said, adding that  
a new ballot was under way.

<HEADLINE> Jet Carrying 108 Turns Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- A jet carrying 108 people turned  
around shortly after takeoff Thursday when a malfunctioning air 
conditioner sent smoke into the cockpit -- the second time in a 
month that an MD-80 twin-engine jet had the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines Flight 1588 was heading from Bakersfield to  
the Dallas-Fort Worth airport when an ``electrical smell'' and 
smoke were reported in the cockpit, said Federal Aviation 
Administration spokesman Mitch Barker. 
</P>
<P>
	Bakersfield Mayor Bob Price was on the plane and said there was  
no panic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people didn't even realize we were turning back,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray Bishop, director of Meadows Field Airport, said the plane's  
air conditioning system is driven by the engines, and when a seal 
failed less than a minute after takeoff, smoke and fumes leaked 
into the cockpit. The crew shut down the system and turned the 
plane around. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, an American Airlines Boeing 727 carrying 147 people  
from Miami aborted a flight to Santa Domingo after frightened 
passengers smelled smoke coming from the air vents.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Happy But Haunted by Demons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Hall of Fame inductee Lawrence  
Taylor is as happy as he has been in years and at peace with 
himself, yet says he still has to fight a daily battle with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demons come up every day,'' Taylor, 40, said Thursday  
during a news conference to discuss his induction into the Canton, 
Ohio, shrine on Aug. 7. ``You do the best you can with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person who says they have it under control and he knows  
exactly what is going to happen, really doesn't know what the hell 
he is talking about,'' the former New York Giants linebacker said. 
``I have it under control today and, hopefully, I'll have it under 
control tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's off-the-field problems, which included two drug-related  
arrests after his retirement in 1993, were his biggest obstacle to 
being voted into the Hall of Fame in January. Several didn't vote 
for the man considered the prototype for the modern linebacker 
because of it. Taylor later criticized them, calling them ``old 
phonies'' not fit to judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview at Giants Stadium on Thursday, Taylor said he  
has mellowed since the vote and is becoming excited as his 
induction gets closer. 
</P>
<P>
	After saying he didn't want to pressure former coach Bill  
Parcells to attend, Taylor later said the current New York Jets 
coach should be there. Parcells would have to skip a day of 
training camp to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor admitted that he has been afraid to call Parcells because  
he had promised his former coach he would be the one presenting him 
at the induction. 
</P>
<P>
	That honor has gone to Taylor's teen-age son, T.J., who asked  
for the job. Taylor gave it to him so he would not have to choose 
between Parcells and Giants owner Wellington Mara, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging interview, Taylor said he realized he was the  
best player in the league in 1982, his second in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be cocky but I felt I was a man playing with  
boys,'' Taylor said. ``I really did, because the things I felt I 
could do naturally, people were in awe of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina product said he never worked out in the  
offseason, but that he compensated by being in great shape during 
the season and understanding opposing offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even today, nobody could play an offensive scheme that I could  
not defend,'' said Taylor, who admitted he at times drew defensive 
plays on the field on the spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 13 seasons with the Giants, Taylor had 132 1/2 sacks, 1,088  
tackles, 33 forced fumbles, 10 fumble recoveries and nine 
interceptions. The 10-time Pro Bowl selection led New York to two 
Super Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``A coach used to say there were four or five times in a game  
where you have situations that dictate the momentum or outcome of 
the game,'' Taylor said. ``You have to be able to recognize those 
situations and make a play during them. That's what I did and 
that's why I was considered a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said his proudest moments with the Giants were the Super  
Bowl titles. He said the first over Denver in January 1987 was fun 
and the defeat of Buffalo in January 1991 more precious because the 
team was not expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we were supposed to be there,'' Taylor said.  
``We weren't actually the best team in the league but we played the 
best as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who is in bankruptcy court, doesn't miss playing  
football except for the big checks. The only time he gets excited 
is during the playoffs when he dreams of making big plays and 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected in his first year of eligibility, Taylor will be  
inducted with running back Eric Dickerson, tight end Ozzie Newsome 
and guards Tom Mack and Billy Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor plans to show his game face.  
</P>
<P>
	``You got a better chance of hitting the lottery than seeing me  
cry,'' Taylor said. ``I'll tell you now, if I cry you can come up 
and spank me.''

<HEADLINE> PBS Will Fight For Federal Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Under fire on Capitol Hill for sharing its donor  
lists with the Democrats, PBS is determined to fight for its 
federal funding, even if it represents only 14 percent of its 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The Public Broadcasting Service argues that the subsidy is more  
important than the small percentage might suggest, since it 
triggers other donations and its elimination would represent a 
major philosophical shift. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not worth going it alone, even if it avoids nasty political  
scrapes, said Ervin Duggan, PBS president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you talk about privatizing public broadcasting, you're  
really using a euphemism for commercializing public broadcasting,'' 
he said, ``and the entire mission of the institution changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week it was disclosed that at least two dozen public  
television stations exchanged membership lists with political 
groups. Some Republican lawmakers responded by renewing calls to 
strip public broadcasting of its $250 million government subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS's portion of that money accounts for 14 percent of its  
operating revenue. When the system began 30 years ago, Congress 
kicked in more than half of the funds, one expert said. It was down 
to one-fifth by 1980 and the percentage has dropped steadily since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, member  
television and radio stations also get a portion of the federal 
pie. The money represents anywhere from 10 percent to nearly 40 
percent of the TV stations' budgets, with the money more important 
for smaller stations that serve rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS's share of $37 million is ``absolutely essential seed  
money,'' spokesman Thomas Epstein said. The federal funds trigger 
matching state grants for educational programming and encourage 
private investment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some PBS programming, such as the investigative series  
``Frontline'' and American drama, wouldn't attract enough private 
funding to stay on the air, the executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS attracted $186 million in corporate underwriting in 1998, up  
$44 million from the previous year. Its largest source of funding 
remains donations by viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Public broadcasting's aggressiveness in seeking other funding  
sources has led some critics to suggest the system's mission has 
already changed. Certainly it has led to touchy moments: ``Sesame 
Street'' was criticized by Ralph Nader for broadcasting a 15-second 
message from an indoor playground manufacturer that had kicked in 
$1 million toward producing the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greater the commercial pressure, the greater the need to  
tailor programming to corporate underwriting,'' said James 
Ledbetter, author of ``Made Possible By...,'' a book about public 
broadcasting. ``There are a lot of people who would argue that they 
are there already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been more than a decade since PBS produced a program geared  
to blacks, arguably the type of community underserved by commercial 
broadcasters that the public system was invented for, Ledbetter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, PBS produces a nightly business roundup -- even  
though several cable channels do the same thing -- because that's 
attractive to corporate sponsors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Public TV is best looked upon as a kind of niche market within  
commercial broadcasting, rather than an alternative to it,'' 
Ledbetter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duggan said he is ``aware of no evidence that we have pulled our  
punches or succumbed to the needs'' of sponsors. Public 
broadcasting's diversity of funding sources ensures its 
independence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Forbes, a PBS spokesman, called Ledbetter ``off the  
mark,'' saying the system ``has a very strong track record of 
providing programming by and for African-Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season alone, he said, PBS aired the late Henry Hampton's  
final work, ``I'll Make Me a World,'' and ``Africans in America,'' 
a Peabody winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Public broadcasters are protective of public funding because of  
the looming expenses related to the transformation to a digital 
marketplace. It will require the formation of new channels and 
major equipment purchases, costing an estimated $1.7 billion, 
Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	PBS and Ledbetter agree that public broadcasting would be better  
served by a funding mechanism that insulates it from recurring 
political battles, either a trust fund or a dedicated revenue 
stream. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a lot of ways, there is now more than ever a need for a  
truly public broadcasting system,'' Ledbetter said. ``I think the 
issue of providing a true lens on American society is always a 
vital idea and something that cable networks and commercial 
broadcasting does very incompletely.''

<HEADLINE> Borgnine Booms His Lines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Mich. (AP) -- Ernest Borgnine doesn't need many takes  
to get a scene right. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspender-clad, gap-toothed actor boomed out his ``Lost  
Treasure of Sawtooth Island'' lines from aboard a small tugboat on 
Betsie Bay, playing the gruff granddad to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	Rich Brauer, a local producer, hatched the story about a boy and  
grandfather searching for sunken treasure. With the exception of 
Borgnine and the film's Los Angeles-based executive producer, cast 
members are mostly from Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 82-year-old Borgnine said he's seen little of the Michigan  
scenery, but he ``might even consider buying some property here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though (Brauer) took me all over hell's half-acre before  
we got to Frankfort, I love it,'' Borgnine said Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> National League Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Even a matchup with the worst team in baseball couldn't help the  
Atlanta Braves end their longest losing streak in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Springer pitched a seven-hitter to outduel Greg Maddux  
and help the Florida Marlins beat Atlanta 2-0 Wednesday night, 
sending the Braves to their fifth consecutive defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The skid is the Braves' longest since they dropped six straight  
Sept. 8-14, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Something like this is not going to happen that often,''  
Maddux said. ``I think we'll come to the park a little hungrier 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves will need to, with the second-place Mets closing fast  
in the NL East. New York beat Montreal 7-3 to move within two games 
of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've still got a ways to go,'' said Mets starter Rick Reed,  
who hit an RBI double and won his fifth straight decision. ``We've 
got a lot of baseball to play. I don't think that starts until 
September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other NL games, it was Chicago 2, Pittsburgh 1; Cincinnati 1,  
St. Louis 0; Philadelphia 7, Milwaukee 0; Arizona 7, Houston 4; 
Colorado 5, Los Angeles 4; and San Francisco 10, San Diego 2. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami, Maddux (10-6), who had won four consecutive decisions,  
lost despite pitching his first complete game of the year. He gave 
up nine hits, walked one and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice for us to win any time,'' Marlins manager John Boles  
said. ``But it makes you feel especially good because the Braves 
are the class of the National League and have been for some time, 
and Maddux is a future Hall of Famer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Preston Wilson did most of Florida's damage. He scored one run,  
drove in the other and went 2-for-4, extending his hitting streak 
to 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
	At Montreal, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura hit back-to-back  
homers in the first inning off Dan Smith (1-5) to lead the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rickey Henderson scored New York's sixth run on Edgardo  
Alfonzo's RBI double in the seventh for Henderson's 2,063rd career 
run, passing Willie Mays for fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'm just blessed,'' Henderson said. ``You get excited  
if you go out and win the ballgame. I'm just happy to be in that 
class and to get that opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rondell White and Vladimir Guerrero hit consecutive homers for  
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Cubs 2, Pirates 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Pinch-hitter Jeff Blauser tied the score with a leadoff homer in  
the bottom of the ninth, and Henry Rodriguez singled home the 
winning run off Jason Christiansen (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Aguilera (4-3) gave up one hit in one inning for the  
victory. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Reds 1, Cardinals 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Cincinnati, Ron Villone allowed one hit in eight-plus innings  
and Pokey Reese hit the first homer by a right-hander off Jose 
Jimenez (5-10). 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds improved to 19-8 in their last 27 games with their  
ninth shutout, the most in the majors. Villone (5-3) gave up a 
leadoff double to J.D. Drew in the first, then allowed only four 
more runners before needing relief help from Scott Williamson in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Phillies 7, Brewers 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Milwaukee, Robert Person pitched 7 2-3 shutout innings to  
dominate the Brewers for the second time in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Person (4-2) allowed seven hits and struck out five. The former  
Toronto closer also beat Milwaukee 1-0 on July 6 and has won four 
of his last five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Jordan had four hits, including an RBI double in the  
seventh, and Doug Glanville had three hits and an RBI. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Diamondbacks 7, Astros 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Tony Womack hit an inside-the-park grand slam off Billy Wagner  
in the eighth inning to lift Arizona to victory at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks loaded the bases in the eighth off Jay Powell  
(4-2) with two walks and a hit batter before Womack homered on an 
0-2 pitch from Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Chouinard (3-1) pitched the eighth for the win and Matt  
Mantei got three outs for his third save since being traded to 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Giants 10, Padres 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At San Francisco, Ellis Burks hit his 10th career grand slam and  
added an RBI single as the Giants broke a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Burks, who had an RBI single in the first off Sterling Hitchcock  
(9-7), has eight homers in 16 games since coming off the disabled 
list June 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Ortiz (12-6) allowed two runs, four hits and six walks in 6  
1-3 innings to win for the fourth time in five starts. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Rockies 5, Dodgers 4    	
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Abbott homered off Ismael Valdes (8-8) to break an  
eighth-inning tie as Colorado won at Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Pedro Astacio (10-8) allowed four runs and eight hits in eight  
innings, improving to 3-1 against his former team. Dave Veres 
pitched a perfect ninth for his 16th save.

<HEADLINE> Gates Open Early for Woodstock '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- Music lovers headed to Woodstock '99 got an  
early gift today: the gates to the music festival were opened three 
hours early. 
</P>
<P>
	Traffic had begun to build around the two main gates leading  
onto the former Griffiss Air Force base, site of the three-day 
festival, when state police persuaded concert promoters to open the 
gates at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of the festival, Sal Alberico offered another gift: a  
concert in front of City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like this kind of music,'' Gail Smith said as Alberico and  
his seven-piece band played a soothing version of ``Somewhere Over 
the Rainbow'' just before nightfall Wednesday. ``It's more my 
speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little more mellow than Woodstock,'' the 69-year-old  
Alberico said after he finished playing. ``But I think it's great, 
fantastic, that Woodstock is here. Nothing much that great happens 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There will be few mellow moments in this economically-struggling  
city come Friday, when the three-day rock festival starts at the 
former Griffiss Air Force Base. In addition to loud rock of acts 
like Bush and Insane Clown Posse, visitors and residents alike will 
be jarred by the huge crowds and the skyrocketing prices at local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters said Wednesday that they had sold more than 170,000  
tickets, but anyone hoping to find a hotel room at this late date 
is out of luck. Every room in a 12- to 15-county radius was booked, 
thanks to the concert and the induction ceremonies Sunday at the 
Baseball Hall of Fame in nearby Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who did have accommodations are paying dearly. At the Paul  
Revere Motor Lodge, rooms that normally cost $70 per night were 
fetching $275, manager Juergen Ritz said. And there was a waiting 
list of around 180. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the same downtown at the Quality Inn. ``It's more than  
sold-out,'' said general manager Larry Daniello, who had a waiting 
list with 400 names. 
</P>
<P>
	Even concert performers Ice Cube, Alanis Morissette and Sugar  
Ray were turned away because they called too late, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody is looking to cash in on the music festival. Rome  
restaurateur Jay Huggins said he plans to close his popular eating 
place, Teddy's Restaurant, for four days to avoid all the hassles 
he figures Woodstock will present. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for the community, but a big pain,'' said Huggins,  
who has 50 employees. ``I have a lot of single mothers working 
here. Each one stands to lose $150 to $200 (in tips).''

<HEADLINE> New Vision, Slogan for Microsoft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Since the days when Microsoft Corp. founders Bill  
Gates and Paul Allen were mere millionaires, the company's vision 
has been ``a computer on every desk and in every home.'' Now, says 
Steve Ballmer, wrapping up his first year as Microsoft's president, 
it's time for a change. 
</P>
<P>
	At Microsoft's annual financial analysts' meeting Thursday,  
Ballmer said the old slogan, useful in the days when a personal 
computer was an oddity, had lost its relevance in the era of the 
Internet and of countless new electronic devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Ballmer said, the new vision is: ``Empower people  
through great software anytime, any place and on any device.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that sounds vague, Ballmer said, it's because it reflects the  
broad number of arenas in which Microsoft must compete: software 
systems for the largest corporations; applications for small 
business; a vast array of new desktop, handheld, TV- and cell 
phone-linked computing devices, consumer software; and the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The environment is more competitive today ... than I've ever  
felt in my 19 years at Microsoft,'' Ballmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Gates said the idea was to convey that computing  
in the ``PC-plus'' era involves not just a single device but 
everything from cellular phones to laptops to massive corporate 
servers. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the bottom line remained the same: The goal, Gates  
stressed, is to have all those devices running Microsoft software. 
</P>
<P>
	He demonstrated a number of new-generation gadgets running  
Windows, including a tablet-shaped computer that recognizes 
handwriting, cell phones that can receive Internet data, and 
hand-held computers that offer rich graphics, music capability and 
Internet browsing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer said 81 percent of Microsoft's revenue now comes from  
selling to businesses, with large corporations accounting for 43 
percent of its $19.75 billion in revenues in fiscal 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Microsoft hopes to build its consumer share and has  
reorganized that segment in the past year, the consumer audience 
``is absolutely the smallest percentage of our business,'' Ballmer 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	On other topics, Ballmer said Microsoft considers the Linux  
operating system to be ``serious, if albeit a little crazy'' 
competition to Windows. Linux marks the first time since IBM's OS-2 
operating system of the early 1990s ``that we have had a serious 
competitor on the Intel platform,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, which makes the computer chips upon which Windows runs,  
earlier this year invested in a company that makes computers that 
run on Linux. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also demonstrated the latest test version of Windows  
2000, the long-delayed successor to the Windows NT operating system 
for high-powered computers and corporate systems. Microsoft says 
the new software will be more versatile, reliable and easier to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
	A beta version of Windows 2000 shipped on July 1, but Ballmer  
and other Microsoft executives declined to say when the finished 
version might be ready. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, said  
Microsoft's victory earlier this week in an antitrust lawsuit filed 
by the small Connecticut software company Bristol Technology shows 
that Microsoft deals with its partners fairly and ethically. He 
said Microsoft expects to likewise prevail in the antitrust suit 
filed against it by the Department of Justice and 19 states.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Still Full of Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He talks of a time when he'll no longer hold  
the Oval Office, and there's a hint of nostalgia when he ticks off 
his accomplishments. But President Clinton insists there's much yet 
to do before he leaves office and he's eager to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel myself winding down, I feel myself keying up,''  
he said. ``I want to do more. I want to try to make sure that I 
give the American people as much as I can every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At his second news conference in as many months, Clinton on  
Wednesday juggled questions on a half-dozen foreign policy hot 
spots and rebuked Republicans for a ``risky'' $792 billion tax-cut 
plan that he said would deprive education, Medicare, Social 
Security and national defense programs. 
</P>
<P>
	He referred to the economic success the country has enjoyed  
during his 6 1/2 years in office and the efforts of his administration 
to forge peace in the Middle East and Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	And over the course of the 70-minute session, the topic turned  
more than once to not just his post-White House plans but also to 
two campaigns that could overshadow his last year in office: Vice 
President Al Gore's bid for the presidency and first lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's planned run for the Senate in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he would do whatever he could to support Gore and  
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mind hard work and I don't mind long hours,'' he said.  
``I've got plenty of energy and I'll do whatever I'm asked to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But even though he isn't shy about talking about a time when  
he'll no longer be president, he seems to have few ideas about 
where he'll direct his energies beyond his plans to build a 
presidential library. Would he, for example, run for another 
office? 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have any idea,'' he said. ``I was a very happy person  
before I became president. I never had any trouble finding 
something interesting to do that I believed in. ... And I'm, 
frankly, kind of excited about it. I mean, it's a new challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential news conferences, which were few and far between  
when Monica Lewinsky was the topic on most reporters' minds last 
year, are becoming more frequent again. Clinton is only to happy to 
talk policy from the podium, aides say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Will I miss a lot of things about this job? Yes. I'll even  
miss all of you, believe it or not,'' Clinton told the journalists 
who gathered in the East Room. ``But I'm just grateful that I've 
had the chance to serve and that the results have been good for our 
people and for our country and, I think, the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On other topics, Clinton said he would refuse to sign ``the  
wrong kind'' of GOP tax cut and said Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan has done ``a terrific job,'' although he said it was too 
soon to say whether he would reappoint Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to renew his criticism of Texas Gov. George W. Bush,  
the GOP presidential front-runner, for espousing ``compassionate 
conservatism.'' But Clinton challenged: ``Use whatever slogans you 
want but tell us where you stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president urged China and Taiwan to keep talking to resolve  
their increasingly tense relations, and he declined to recognize 
Taiwan's assertion that it is a separate state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one-China policy is right. The cross-strait dialogue is  
right,'' he said. ``The peaceful approach is right, and neither 
side in my judgment should depart from any of those elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, Clinton spoke with Palestinian leader Yasser  
Arafat about the just-concluded visit to Washington of Israeli 
Prime Minister Ehud Barak. He assured Arafat that Barak was 
``completely committed to resolve all the issues'' in the peace 
process ``in an expeditious manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also said he was encouraged by Syrian President  
Hafez Assad's statements that he was open to negotiations with 
Israel to work toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to Iran, Clinton said he was reluctant to talk about  
pro-democracy demonstrations, fearing that expressions of support 
would undercut the forces of openness and reform. He said people 
everywhere want to be able to pursue their religious convictions 
and freedom and still be deeply loyal to their country. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he was ``very disappointed'' by the breakdown of  
the peace process in Northern Ireland. He said neither side wanted 
to abandon the Good Friday agreement that created the groundwork 
for peace. ``My instinct is that we will get this worked out.''

<HEADLINE>  IRA Issues Warning Over Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Despite a new refusal by the  
Irish Republican Army to surrender any weapons, the American 
architect of last year's peace accord said today that he believes 
the agreement will be successfully implemented. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am convinced the political leaders and the overwhelming  
majority of the people of Northern Ireland want peace, political 
stability and reconciliation,'' former Sen. George Mitchell told 
reporters, a day after meeting with the province's key parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell returned to this British province Wednesday to help try  
to rescue the agreement reached on Good Friday last year calling 
for a government with power sharing between Protestants and 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Northern Ireland's key players -- Ulster Unionist chief  
David Trimble, head of the biggest Protestant party, and Gerry 
Adams, president of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party -- planned to 
meet individually today in London with British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair. 
</P>
<P>
	Implemention of the accord is stalled over the outlawed IRA's  
refusal to yield its weapons, and the Ulster Unionists' refusal to 
sit in a Cabinet with Sinn Fein while the IRA remains armed. 
</P>
<P>
	Northern Ireland's four biggest parties should have formed the  
Cabinet by last November. The accord also envisages total 
disarmament of the IRA and pro-British Protestant paramilitary 
groups by May. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell hopes to break the deadlock with what he calls a  
``review'' of the accord Sept. 6 -- but not a renegotiation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I make no bones about the fact that I would have preferred not  
to come back,'' he said. ``I am not surprised, but I am 
disappointed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dealing a fresh blow to chances of progress, the IRA in its  
statement late Wednesday said the prospects of implementing the 
Good Friday agreement have ``substantially diminished in recent 
months,'' blaming the British government for the decline. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who demand the decommissioning of IRA weapons lend  
themselves, in the current political context, inadvertently or 
otherwise, to the failed agenda which seeks the defeat of the 
IRA,'' said the statement, issued in Dublin, the capital of the 
Irish Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA stopped short of a specific threat to resume violence,  
but noted that, in February 1996, it responded to pressure to 
disarm by breaking a 17-month cease-fire with a massive bombing in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam characterized the  
IRA statement as ``unhelpful,'' and the main Catholic party, the 
Social Democratic and Labor Party, dismissed it as a repetition of 
``worn-out dogma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell refused to comment on it directly, saying only that  
violence or threats of violence solve nothing.

<HEADLINE> Wallace Says Gordon Is Road Hog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- When Rusty Wallace moved over to give Jeff  
Gordon some racing room early this season, he thought it might 
bring to an end to some bad blood on the track between the NASCAR 
superstars. 
</P>
<P>
	But after contact between them -- their third high-visibility  
altercation in as many seasons -- sent Wallace spinning into the 
wall two weeks ago in Loudon, N.H., he wonders if Gordon is getting 
the message. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't gotten an apology,'' he said, but vows not to permit  
their latest tangle to influence him Sunday in the Pennsylvania 
500. ``I can't do anything to retaliate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon got into Wallace two seasons ago, tapping him on the  
final turn and passing him to win in Bristol, Tenn. Last year, 
Wallace tried to carry Gordon high at Richmond, Va., but Gordon 
wound up in the wall after contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``If somebody wanted to, they might say `Now they're even,' ''  
Wallace said of the Richmond race. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Daytona 500, Wallace saw an accident waiting to happen  
and moved over to allow Gordon to leave the apron. What followed 
was a risky but decisive pass that could easily have been a 
chain-reaction crash had Wallace not permitted Gordon to climb onto 
the banking at Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were 40 guys behind me I had to think about,'' Wallace  
said. ``That won him the race, but thinking back on it now, I don't 
know if I would have given him as much room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon wanted a lot of it in Loudon, leading to the crash that  
sent Wallace home early and to a final-lap tangle and nasty 
postrace exchange with Winston Cup points leader Dale Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to turn this into a war, it's on,'' the normally  
mild-mannered Jarrett told Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't like the way I made the pass,'' Gordon said. ``But I  
didn't like the way he ran down low on me, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The criticism from both Jarrett and Wallace was that Gordon put  
them in peril by racing on the apron. 
</P>
<P>
	``After Kenny Schrader blew his engine, they had oil dry all  
over the track and you couldn't run high,'' Wallace said. ``But 
Gordon decides to go down there and race on the apron, just like he 
did at Daytona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, who smoothed over his differences with Jarrett shortly  
after the Jiffy Lube 300, does not accept the blame for his contact 
with Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We went down into three and he just came right down on me,''  
Gordon said of Wallace. ``I didn't want to hit him because it tore 
my car up some also, but there wasn't much I could do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon isn't likely to apologize to Wallace, whom he said last  
year apologized to everyone but him for the Richmond incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Wallace says they talk to one another about things other  
than racing. And like Jarrett, Wallace says there can be no 
carryover. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something happened at Pocono, and he got hurt it would be  
my fault,'' Wallace said. ``That used to happen in the old days of 
Winston Cup, but not now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace, the 1989 series champion, knows about frustration, and  
believes Gordon might be just suffering from a little of it as his 
chances for a third straight title slip away with each race. 
Gordon, who won the Pennsylvania 500 by leading 164 of 200 laps 
last year, is fifth in the standings, 389 points behind Jarrett. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's had a lot of problems this year, but we all drive hard in  
the quest to win,'' Wallace said. ``It just wasn't a very good deal 
at Loudon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon claims he is as relaxed under the circumstances as  
possible and will accept his fate if he can't win. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Jarrett and his team continue this season the way that they  
have, nobody will be able to catch them,'' Gordon said.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong: Press Victimized Him </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAU, France (AP) -- With his name cleared by cycling authorities,  
Lance Armstrong says he was the victim of a French media campaign 
to unsettle him during his bid to win the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-year-old Texan said the unfounded drug abuse claims for  
the last week marred his performance during two days of climbing in 
the Pyrenees Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want me to crack on the bike -- and I'm not going to,'' he  
said defiantly on Wednesday after emerging from the last day of 
climbs in the Pyrenees with a commanding lead of 6 minutes, 15 
seconds. ``It's vulture journalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, making a startling comeback from testicular cancer,  
is now just four days from what appears to be a probable triumph in 
cycling's showcase race. 
</P>
<P>
	He looks stronger than ever. With the climbing done, he now  
faces two flat stages, a time trial -- where he excels -- and the 
arrival in Paris on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	For two days, the French newspaper Le Monde has reported traces  
of a corticosteroid were detected in his urine, and that of other 
riders as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs that  
are not classed as steroids. They are banned unless prescribed by 
doctors for conditions such as asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body confirmed Wednesday the only drug  
Armstrong has been taking is an authorized skin cream for saddle 
sores. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said he has been ``persecuted,'' and that drug  
accusations that he believes will inevitably be leveled at leaders 
at the Tour de France in the future ``is bad for cycling and for 
the Tour de France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his closest competitors, Alex Zulle, doubts he is strong  
enough to catch Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great cyclist, one who is driven by huge motivation and  
determination,'' said the Swiss, who is third in the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	The French media began sniping at Armstrong a week ago after he  
powered to victory in the Alps, intimating only banned drugs can 
explain his dramatic success. 
</P>
<P>
	After being diagnosed in October 1996, he had surgery to remove  
his right testicle and brain lesions, then underwent three months 
of chemotherapy. He was out for the 1997 season and only began his 
comeback last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong described the accusations as the latest example of  
people not believing in him. First, he said, few gave him a chance 
of beating cancer. Then teams were reluctant to employ him because 
of his medical history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a story of not being given chances,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	He looked composed throughout the race Wednesday, never letting  
his closest rivals, Fernando Escartin and Zulle, out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
	The three sat on each other's wheels right to the end: Zulle  
came in 10th, Armstrong 11th and Escartin 12th. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's stage was won by Spain's David Etxebarria -- his second  
stage victory this year. In second place was Carlos Contreras of 
Colombia, and Alberto Elli of Italy was third. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong finished only 21 seconds behind.  
</P>
<P>
	The 16th stage was a 120-mile ride from Lannemezan, a small town  
in the Pyrenees foothills to Pau, once the home of French King 
Henri IV. 
</P>
<P>
	The climbs were higher than Tuesday, the second of three  
reaching a height of 6,980 feet. The riders scaled peaks swathed in 
thick fog, unable to see anything at altitude except pine trees at 
the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Only at the summit of the Col de Mente mountain pass did they  
glimpse blue sky after rising above the clouds to a jagged mountain 
plateau where goats grazed. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's race is a relatively flat 125-mile stage between Mourenx  
and Bordeaux.

<HEADLINE> Dow Chemical Earnings Down 3.5 Pct. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Mich. (AP) -- Dow Chemical Co.'s second-quarter earnings  
fell 3.5 percent because of lower prices for its products, but cost 
cuts and higher profit margins helped lessen the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest chemical company said it earned $410  
million, or $1.83 per share, down from $425 million, or $1.86 per 
share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Chemical's results beat the $1.67 per share expected by Wall  
Street analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported sales of $4.6 billion, down 5 percent from  
$4.9 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Chemical prices have been depressed by a drop in demand for raw  
materials in struggling overseas economies. But Dow said in spite 
of the lower prices, its businesses are more profitable because of 
cost-cutting. It has also been focusing on products with higher 
profit margins. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating profits were up in four of Dow Chemical's divisions --  
performance plastics, performance chemicals, agricultural products 
and chemicals. The company's Plastics division had lower profits 
despite a 13 percent increase in volume. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, Dow earned $739 million, or $3.30 per  
share, down from $846 million, or $3.70 per share, in the same 
period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales totaled $9.04 billion, down from $9.69 billion.

<HEADLINE> GOP Moderates Whipped on Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The appeals were polite but unrelenting:  
Congressman, your vote for our tax cut proposal is important to the 
Republican Party. It's crucial to the credibility of the GOP 
leadership. People will think we can't lead if it fails. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, GOP leaders asked this question of the band of  
moderates that stood in the way of an across-the-board tax cut: 
What would it take to win your vote? 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and his lieutenants  
enlisted team loyalty, guilt and outright begging in what 
participants described as a relentless series of meetings with a 
group of GOP moderates who held the power Wednesday to sink one of 
the party's top legislative priorities -- and Hastert's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been pleas to me,'' said Rep. Connie Morella,  
R-Md., one of the group who refused throughout the day to support 
the leaders' 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. ``But look,'' she 
added, thrusting out her wrists, ``My arms are untwisted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the GOP leadership searched for support, a compromise emerged  
that would make income tax cuts conditional on year-to-year 
progress in reducing the nation's debt. The plan was designed to 
attract support from rebellious GOP moderates, and was to be voted 
on today. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple arithmetic toughens the Republican drive for virtually  
any controversial proposal in the House, but the leaders' tax cut 
proposal was a cornerstone of the GOP agenda and a self-proclaimed 
test of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinging to the 222-211-seat majority it nearly lost in the  
impeachment-tinged November elections, GOP leaders struggled to 
secure the 218 votes needed to pass the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	But the leadership's whip operation is as formidable as the  
arithmetic, lawmakers say. Senior Republicans powered it up 
Wednesday and unleashed it on about a half-dozen moderates who 
stood in the way of a proposal many in the party say was key to 
retaining control of the House next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, a parade of moderate lawmakers flowed in and  
out of Hastert's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said how important it is for our party, how important it  
is for the leadership,'' said Rep. Mike Castle, former governor of 
Delaware who as of late afternoon still refused to capitulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They asked, 'What will it take?''' recounted Rep. Fred Upton,  
R-Mich., a one-time protege of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
who in 1993 resigned from the whip organization in part over its 
confrontational style. Like Castle, he was sticking with his 'no' 
vote because tax cuts, he said, likely would make debt reduction 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois, who refused to sign the GOP's  
Contract With American manifesto but has evolved into a 
widely-respected conciliator, late Tuesday ignored a summons to the 
speaker's suite for a chat about tax cuts. ``I had other plans,'' 
he explained with a shrug at midday Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But an hour later, he was spotted rushing from Hastert's office  
around the corner to the Ways and Means Committee, where the 
chairman, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, had summoned the moderates for 
what one participant called a ``seminar'' on how the bill repays 
the federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They finally found me,'' Lahood said. But asked whether the  
leaders would change his mind, he only smiled, turned the knob and 
entered Archer's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Promotes CEO Michael Capellas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reaching inside its own ranks for a new leader,  
Compaq Computer Corp. named chief operating officer Michael D. 
Capellas as chief executive on Thursday in a bid to revive its 
flagging computer sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas, 44, succeeds Eckhard Pfeiffer, who was forced out in  
April after Compaq's first-quarter profit came in at less than half 
of analysts' expectations. The company has been under enormous 
pressure from Wall Street to quickly fill a yawning management gap, 
aggravated by the departure of another half-dozen top managers in 
Pfeiffer's wake. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief executive, who takes office immediately, faces a  
challenge in reviving Houston-based Compaq, which has been hit hard 
by slow computer sales and shrinking profits. 
</P>
<P>
	After pioneering the market for inexpensive personal computers  
in the early 1990s, Compaq's profits have plunged amid escalating 
price wars. Compaq also has choked on other manufacturers it 
acquired, and stumbled while trying to emulate the more efficient 
sales model of arch rival Dell Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring opens the door for the replacement of other key  
executive positions, including the chief financial officer and the 
top human-resources post.

<HEADLINE> Mattel Earnings Rise 81 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Mattel Inc.'s second-quarter operating  
earnings rose 81 percent from a year ago, boosted by strong sales 
of its Fisher-Price line of pre-school toys and software sold by 
its Mattel Media division. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest toymaker -- which is best known for its  
Barbie and Hot Wheels toys -- reported Thursday that its operating 
earnings rose to $62.5 million, or 15 cents a share, for the 
quarter ended June 30, compared with $34.6 million, or 8 cents a 
share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel's results matched Wall Street analysts' expectations. Its  
stock was unchanged at $23.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 operating earnings did not include a $345 million  
charge to cover costs associated with the company's reorganization 
effort to revive its slumping sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year, Mattel has been forced to rethink its business  
after important retail customers like Toys R Us drastically cut 
back their orders and asked for delivery of inventory closer to the 
time they wanted to put the toys on store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel has also been aggressively pursuing opportunities outside  
traditional toys, like CD-ROMs and high-tech gadgets -- which 
children today seem more interested in playing with than dolls and 
action figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The large second-quarter charge also covered Mattel's purchase  
of The Learning Company, a software manufacturer, and expenses from 
the recall last October of 10 million Fisher-Price Power Wheels 
ride-on toys that posed a serious fire risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the charge, Mattel reported a second-quarter loss of  
$204.3 million, or 50 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose slightly in the quarter to $1.04 billion, up from  
$1.03 billion from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues outside the United States dropped 9 percent, largely  
because of weaker European sales. That was offset by a 5 percent 
increase in U.S. revenues, driven partly by healthy sales of its 
Fisher-Price, American Girl and Mattel Media lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales from the Learning Company also helped boost Mattel's  
software business. The Learning Company acquisition was completed 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said that it expects its business to get a boost in  
the second half of the year from merchandise related to the 
animated movie ``Toy Story 2,'' for which the company has licensing 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Mattel said that the number of jobs it planned to  
eliminate as part of its restructuring had risen to about 4,000, up 
from 3,000 that it had initially planned to cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts, a combination of layoffs and reductions through  
attrition, should be completed by year's end, said Mattel spokesman 
Glenn Bozarth. The bulk of the reductions are factory jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattel said its reorganization should save $50 million this year  
and $400 million in the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of 1999, operating earnings was $70.5  
million, or 17 cents a share, more than double last year's $30.1 
million, or 7 cents per share. Sales for the 1999 six months were 
equal with last year at $1.92 billion.

<HEADLINE> De Niro Visits Army Ranger School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT BENNING, Ga. (AP) -- Robert De Niro caused a stir when he  
showed up for the latest U.S. Army Ranger School graduation at Fort 
Benning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Academy Award winner was escorted on the post Wednesday by  
Capt. Todd Bearden, the son of one of De Niro's friends. 
</P>
<P>
	De Niro, 55, watched wrestling competitions and talked with  
soldiers and their families at a barbecue in the hangar at Lawson 
Army Airfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Solis, a sergeant who told the actor about a soldier's  
typical combat environment, said that while he visited with De 
Niro, a Ranger approached the actor and said, ``You are my hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Solis, De Niro replied: ``You've got that all  
wrong. You are my hero.''

<HEADLINE> Pan American Games Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Could there be anything harder than a  
triathlon, the grueling event that tests an athlete's skills as a 
swimmer, cyclist and runner for 32 miles? 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Smyers, America's best in that competition, would say yes.  
</P>
<P>
	Smyers, who'll defend her Pan American Games title on Saturday,  
spent 48 hours in labor before giving birth to her daughter last 
year. Now that was hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a small percentage of people in the world can do the  
Ironman,'' Smyers said of the ultimate triathlon competition. 
``Fifty percent of the people can do labor, and let me tell you, 
labor is harder. You don't have a choice when you go into labor. 
You can't drop out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smyers doesn't drop out in triathlons, either, and was the top  
U.S. women's qualifier for the Pan Ams despite two serious setbacks 
in the last two years -- injuries that broke her body but not her 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, for reasons she still can't fathom, Smyers decided to  
change a storm window the day before she was to fly to Monte Carlo 
for the World Cup. The glass shattered and a shard fell onto her 
leg, severing a hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	The leg was placed in a cast from hip to ankle and Smyers'  
season was over. That's when she and husband Michael King decided 
to start a family. Smyers gave birth to her daughter, Jenna, on May 
1, 1998, by C-section. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the worst part of all,'' she said, able to laugh  
about it now. ``If you're going to have a C-section, you want it 
after one hour, not 48.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three months later, misfortune struck again.  
</P>
<P>
	Smyers was training on her bike with a friend and they were  
making such good time, they decided to add another 10 to 15 minutes 
through the woods around Walden Pond, not far from Smyers' home in 
Lincoln, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	They were speeding downhill at 30 mph when a semi-trailer truck  
approached from behind, sideswiped Smyers and sent her tumbling off 
her bike. She broke six ribs, suffered a separated shoulder and a 
bruised lung. It was bad, but Smyers realizes now it could have 
been worse. Much worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had fallen under the truck's wheels, it wouldn't have  
been pretty,'' she said. ``It makes you realize how thin a line you 
tread sometimes, especially now that I've got a daughter who 
depends on me. Before, I was just risking my own life. Now, I'm 
risking someone's mommy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smyers found her injuries harder to cope with emotionally than  
physically. She was still nursing and wasn't able to pick up her 
daughter. When Jenna needed to be burped, Michael had to do it. 
When he couldn't come right away, Jenna would start to cry and give 
Smyers a look that said, ``Mommy, why don't you pick me up?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really rough,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the injuries have long since healed, the mental scars  
remain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still get a knot in my stomach when I hear a truck,'' she  
said. ``I don't know when that will go away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	King, who used to train with Smyers, marvels at how his wife has  
come back. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good athletes are like that. Any professional athlete who gets  
injured, 99 percent of them try to come back,'' he said. ``They 
feel they were going well, they want to get back to that level and 
they are more determined than ever to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's something innate,'' he said. ``I never had it.  
She beat me on that one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At 37, Smyers will be the oldest U.S. athlete in the Pan Am  
triathlon, which starts with a .9 mile swim, continues with a 
24.8-mile bike race and finishes with a 6.2-mile run. 
</P>
<P>
	And with the triathlon becoming an Olympic sport in Sydney next  
year, Smyers has no reason to slow down -- not that she was thinking 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm careful about taking time off every year so I can  
rejuvenate,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pan Am Games began Thursday with canoe-kayak races and the  
United States snagged two medals: a gold in the men's kayak 1,000 
and a bronze in the women's kayak 500. The men beat Cuba by nearly 
three seconds after false-starting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The false start increased the tension,'' said Justin Piasecki,  
``but we were able to get off strong and settle into the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's schedule was much busier, with competition in  
canoe-kayak, soccer, water polo and volleyball. The American men 
met Cuba and the women faced Costa Rica in soccer. In volleyball, 
the U.S. women took on favored Cuba, and in water polo, it was the 
American women against Puerto Rico and the men vs. Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	The official ceremonies are tonight at Winnipeg Stadium, where  
the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and Royal Winnipeg Ballet will be 
featured in a celebration of the city as the ``Heart of the 
Continent.''

<HEADLINE> TotalFina Seeks Amicable Solution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The board of French oil company TotalFina says it  
is ``open to discussions'' with Elf Aquitaine to try to work out an 
amicable solution to their bitter takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	However, TotalFina reiterated that it believes its $42.81  
billion takeover bid for Elf made on July 5 ``represents the best 
option for bringing the two oil groups together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The offer late Wednesday to seek a friendly solution came two  
days after Elf announced plans to launch its own $50.97 billion bid 
to acquire TotalFina. It was the first time that the so-called 
Pac-Man defense, in which a target company tries to swallow its 
attacker, was used in France. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the TotalFina and Elf proposals would create the world's  
fourth-largest oils group. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the first secretary of the Socialist Party of Prime  
Minister Lionel Jospin suggested the government act as 
``arbitrator'' in the takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	The TotalFina board acknowledged the similarity of the two  
companies' plans for the combined group's exploration-production 
and refining-marketing operations. However, it said TotalFina would 
prefer to keep the petrochemicals business integrated with the 
refining operations in view of the extensive synergy between the 
two. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf, in its bid, proposed to spin off the chemicals business  
into a separate company. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf's offer ``isn't attractive because it represents a discount  
to TotalFina's share price, based on the share prices preceding 
TotalFina's offer,'' the TotalFina board said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in an interview with French financial daily Les Echos  
published Thursday, TotalFina chief executive Thierry Desmarest 
said he was hoping for a ``rapid ... friendly'' solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the affair should be completely settled sometime in  
September,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Desmarest said he hadn't spoken to Elf Chairman Philippe Jaffre  
since alerting him to TotalFina's unsolicited bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that under French stock market regulations, TotalFina  
cannot now withdraw its offer for Elf. Elf's offer, however, has 
still to obtain regulatory approval.

<HEADLINE> Barnesandnoble.com Sales Triple </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com's second-quarter losses were  
smaller than expected and its sales more than tripled from a year 
ago, but the online retailer's business still lags significantly 
behind rival Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-based company reported Thursday it lost $21.95  
million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of $23.74 
million, or 21 cents a share, a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales were $39.07 million, up from $11.38 million in the same  
quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations  
of a loss of 24 cents a share. Its stock closed Thursday at 
$18.68 3/4, down 31 1/4 cents or 1.6 percent, on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnesandnoble.com's customer base rose by more than 506,000 to  
2.2 million at the end of the quarter. More than 60 percent of its 
orders in the second quarter came from repeat customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had its initial public stock offering on May 25,  
raising more than $486 million. Since its IPO, barnesandnoble.com 
has taken a number of steps to expand its business. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, the company has redesigned its Web site and added  
music to its product offerings earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite barnesandnoble.com's efforts, the company remains much  
smaller than Amazon.com. Sales at Amazon.com grew to $314.4 million 
in the second quarter -- up 171 percent from a year ago -- and its 
customer base surged to 10.7 million, up 2.3 million in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, the company reported losses of  
$42.17 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with $33.23 million, 
or 29 cents a share, a year ago. Sales were $71.38 million, up from 
$20.39 million.

<HEADLINE> Indictment Sought Against Resendiz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The first step in pursuing a potential  
death-penalty case against the Mexican drifter suspected in a 
series of slayings along the nation's railways has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors in Texas were to present evidence to a grand jury  
today as they seek a capital murder indictment against Angel 
Maturino Resendiz. A conviction on such a charge can lead to a 
death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz, 39, is already charged in four slayings, in  
Illinois, Texas and Kentucky. Police say evidence links him to five 
other Texas killings, including the December beating and stabbing 
death of Dr. Claudia Benton at her Houston-area home. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have already charged Maturino Resendiz with  
burglarizing Dr. Benton's home, but waited to pursue a murder 
charge until he was in custody and able to provide DNA samples. He 
remains held without bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they found one of Maturino Resendiz's  
fingerprints in Dr. Benton's stolen Jeep, and jewelry associated 
with her was also recovered from his Mexico home. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say similar evidence links Maturino Resendiz to the  
June death of Houston schoolteacher Noemi Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in three rural Texas counties where Maturino  
Resendiz is a murder suspect say they will let the Benton case 
proceed before moving forward. Prosecutors in Lexington, Ky., say 
they want to try him for the 1997 slaying of 21-year-old University 
of Kentucky student Christopher Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to slam the courthouse door on anybody,'' said  
Kentucky prosecutor Ray Larson. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, prosecutors in Jackson County, Ill., say they will also  
seek to prosecute Maturino Resendiz for the June deaths of George 
Morber, 79, and his 51-year-old daughter, Carolyn Frederick.

<HEADLINE> NASA's 1st Female Commander Soars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Columbia blasted off  
early Friday with the world's most powerful X-ray telescope and 
Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a U.S. space flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Just nine seconds into the flight, however, the tension  
skyrocketed when Collins called down that she appeared to have a 
fuel cell problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roger, roll, Columbia, we're looking at it,'' Mission Control  
replied. ``We're evaluating the fuel cell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few seconds later, NASA assured Collins and her crew that the  
problem appeared to be a momentary short with a sensor in an 
electrical system. That, in turn, caused a loss of controller power 
to one of the engines, which was not a performance issue, explained 
Mission Control's Kyle Herring. 
</P>
<P>
	The short also briefly affected one of the fuel cells on board,  
but engineers knew almost instantly that all systems were normal, 
Herring said. Once safely in orbit, the five astronauts quickly 
checked the circuit breakers on board, and everything appeared to 
be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Mission Control said engineers would continue to monitor the  
issue, but were confident all equipment on board was working well. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a nerve-racking debut for America's first female shuttle  
commander. Her launch had been delayed three days by faulty 
hydrogen measurements, then lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	Well-wishers cheered Collins on as she made her way to the  
launch pad late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eileen, Just Do It!!!'' read a sign waved by a female space  
worker as Collins headed to the pad. In her other hand was the 
sign: ``Don't Come Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia rose from its seaside pad in a brilliant flash of light  
at 12:31 a.m., a little late because of last-minute trouble with a 
communication link. A half-moon gleamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be back in zero-g again,'' Collins radioed once  
in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea, present for the  
first two attempts, did not return to cheer on the 42-year-old Air 
Force colonel riding in Columbia's front left seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure was on. If the space shuttle didn't lift off on try  
No. 3, it would have been grounded for a month at a cost of 
millions of dollars. The telescope-delivery mission already is 
almost one year late. 
</P>
<P>
	In a superstitious jab at Steven Hawley, who's endured 13 launch  
delays in his astronaut career, several workers held sheets of 
white paper in front of their faces as disguises. And once again 
Hawley pulled a brown paper bag over his head before boarding 
Columbia late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms took NASA by surprise early Thursday and prevented  
Columbia from blasting off with Collins, the first woman to lead a 
mission in 38 years of U.S. human space flight, and the $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray Observatory. On Tuesday, a hydrogen leak 
scare in the final seconds of the countdown scuttled everything. It 
turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists, some of whom have worked on the Chandra project for  
two decades, were growing more anxious with each passing day. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``when you've waited 20 years to get the X-ray telescope on  
orbit, one additional day is not something to get particularly 
concerned about,'' said Earle Huckins, NASA's deputy associate 
administrator for space science. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-foot telescope, once released from Columbia, will spend  
at least five years searching for black holes and peering at 
galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. Astronomers hope to learn 
more about the mysterious dark matter that is believed to fill the 
universe, and better determine the distance to celestial objects. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan called for the five astronauts to eject Chandra from  
the shuttle cargo bay seven hours after liftoff. At 50,000 pounds, 
including a rocket motor and support gear, it is the heaviest 
payload ever carried by a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	To improve the odds of sending Columbia up Friday, NASA extended  
the launch window from 46 minutes to nearly two hours after new 
calculations showed that the telescope has more battery power than 
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, NASA did not need the extra time.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday was NASA's last chance to launch Columbia until mid- to  
late August because of the impending shutdown of Air Force launch 
facilities for more than three weeks of improvements.

<HEADLINE> Some Stars Vets Won't Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Free-agent veterans Pat Verbeek and Craig  
Ludwig apparently won't return to help the Dallas Stars defend the 
Stanley Cup next season. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Gainey says the pair have been told they are  
not in the Stars' plan for next season and to seek offers from 
other teams. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is part of a retooling geared toward making the Stars  
roster younger. Seven members of the Stanley Cup champions won't be 
returning next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a perfect world, it would be nice to keep everyone  
together, but things move forward,'' Gainey told the Fort Worth 
Star-Telegram on Wednesday. ``We have younger players who are ready 
to step in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas traded last week for 26-year-old defenseman Jamie Pushor  
to replace the 38-year-old Ludwig. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeek, 35, had been bumped off the Stars' second line by Jamie  
Langenbrunner and, at $3.2 million last season, was too expensive 
to play on the third or fourth line. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars also have found a fourth-line winger in Blake Sloan,  
24, who will make $350,000 next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Verbeek has 478 career goals but was held last season to 17  
goals and a career-low 34 points in below-average ice time. He is 
reported to be talking with several teams, including the New York 
Rangers, Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers and the expansion 
Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ludwig, who played in 160 of the Stars last 164 games, said he  
is talking with three or four teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kind of had an idea it would end up this way, but I would  
have liked to stay,'' he said. ``It was a great ride, I'll tell you 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars also have told free agents Dave Reid, Tony Hrkac and  
Brent Severyn to seek offers elsewhere. Other members of the 
championship team who won't return are goalie Roman Turek, who was 
traded to St. Louis, and Doug Lidster, who retired.

<HEADLINE> San Joaquin Growers Replacing Fujis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Fuji apples in the lower Central Valley  
are falling victim to an adage popular in more glamorous reaches of 
California: Looks are everything. 
</P>
<P>
	Realizing that redder is better for apple lovers, especially  
when it comes to this particular variety, growers are giving up on 
the Fujis they still believe taste as good or better than those 
grown in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just aren't profitable,'' said John Warmerdam of  
Warmerdam Packing, which has pulled 49 of the 50 acres it was 
farming in 1997. ``We couldn't compete against the color of the 
Washington apples.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2,000 acres of not-red-enough or just-too-yellow  
Fuji apples have been lost over the past two years in the San 
Joaquin Valley, replaced with other apple varieties or other crops 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Early forecasts for this year's harvest is 1.4 million boxes,  
down from last year's yield of 2.2 million boxes. Washington, a 
ruler in the apple market, could ship close to 8 million boxes of 
Fujis. 
</P>
<P>
	The denseness of the Fuji apple, one of more than a half-dozen  
California varieties, allows it to maintain a distinct crispness on 
the outside while staying sweet and juicy inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people bite into it, it's got a snap they like. It's got  
good flavor. It eats like candy,'' said Kenton Kidd, president of 
the California Apple Commission. ``But you have to look at all the 
factors, and color is certainly a factor in the sales.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Andris, a University of California pomologist and farm  
advisor for Fresno County, said it's important to point out that 
the redness of a Fuji is strictly cosmetic and has nothing to do 
with the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
	``But the world market and American consumers like red color,''  
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The redness of a Fuji apple can be enhanced by cool temperatures  
like those in the Northwest. Conversely, the color can be washed 
out by blistering temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
	``So in the San Joaquin Valley, where it is so hot during the  
day and where we have warm summer nights, it's extremely difficult 
to get red color,'' Andris said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers have tried with little success to manipulate the color  
by light activation, using special reflective material on orchard 
floors to trigger the chemical reaction that would deepen the red 
pigment. 
</P>
<P>
	Others experimented with leaving apples on the tree longer, but  
the fruit -- which was too mature -- became prone to cracking once it 
was stored. 
</P>
<P>
	So, at Warmerdam Packing and other apple farms, growers have  
either regrafted Fuji roots with other varieties like Granny 
Smiths, Galas or Pink Ladies, or replanted entirely different 
crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The Apple Commission is in the midst of a survey to get an  
official count of how much Fuji acreage has been lost or converted, 
Kidd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he knows of no new major plantings, Fujis are still  
deemed profitable in the upper portions of the San Joaquin Valley, 
where nighttime breezes help deepen their redness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's fair to say that most of the Fujis that were  
going to be removed have been removed at this point,'' Andris said. 
``There continue to be growers, particularly in areas where 
climates are cool, and they still make money.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Recalls Tour With JFK Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says it was ``the right  
thing'' to authorize an extensive ocean search for John F. Kennedy 
Jr.'s crashed airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	He said initial rescue and recovery efforts ``were consistent  
with what would have been done in any other case'' and that Coast 
Guard officials told him they could locate the plane and its 
passengers if given more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at  
fault, I am,'' Clinton said. ``It was because I thought it was the 
right thing to do under the circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he based his decision to authorize extraordinary  
government efforts to recover the private plane on the Kennedy 
family's role ``in our national lives, and because of the enormous 
losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the White House said Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton would attend the Friday memorial services in New 
York for Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. She and 
her sister, Lauren Bessette, also were killed in the plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during Clinton's first term, in 1994, that Kennedy  
visited the White House inner sanctum for the first time as an 
adult, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy also was at the White House during Richard Nixon's  
presidency for a private dinner with his mother and sister, and 
again at a public ceremony honoring the late Robert F. Kennedy in 
1981 when Ronald Reagan was president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said took Kennedy to the Oval Office to show him the  
desk under which Kennedy had playfully crawled as a boy while his 
father worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure he wanted to come back to the White House before  
he did,'' Clinton said in a melancholy tone. ``In light of 
everything that's happened, I'm glad he had a chance to come back 
here one last time. I'm grateful that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1994 visit, Kennedy returned to the White House in  
February 1998 as a guest at a state dinner for British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair. A month later, on March 5, 1998, Kennedy and 
his wife attended a screening for the HBO series on the Apollo 
space program, ``From the Earth to the Moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When most of the guests had gone home, Clinton said he and the  
first lady offered Kennedy a personal tour of the White House 
residence, ``which he had not seen since he was a tiny boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very nice evening, and I sent him the pictures from  
it,'' Clinton said. ``He and Carolyn, they were delightful young 
people. Hillary and I loved having them here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said in her latest newspaper column that Kennedy  
struck her as ``elegant and eloquent'' that night, speaking 
movingly about how the space program was his father's ``proudest 
legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the tour, she said, Kennedy ``had trouble sorting out  
what he remembered from what he had seen only in pictures.'' She 
said they showed him the room where he slept, the grounds where he 
played, and the garden named in honor of his mother, Jacqueline 
Kennedy.

<HEADLINE> Sears Lifts Profits on Credit Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck and Co. today reported a dip in  
second-quarter profits as improved results in its credit operations 
failed to offset continued weak retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 13 weeks that ended July 3, the nation's largest  
department store chain reported operating income of $564 million, 
or 86 cents a share, compared to $566 million, or 85 cents a share, 
during the last year's second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched Wall Street expectations, according to a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	A breakdown in Sears' quarterly performance shows a retailer  
that continues to face trouble from competitors such as Kohl's and 
Target and specialty stores such as Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and Old 
Navy. Sears' stock is closing in on a 52-week low as Wall Street 
considers that a revitalization under chief executive Arthur 
Martinez may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales at stores open at least a year, an industry measure of  
performance, rose an anemic 1 percent, compared to a 2.9 percent 
increase in the year-ago second-quarter. Sales at competitors 
generally have increased at a faster clip. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez in a statement summed the problem up straightforwardly:  
``Results in our domestic retail and services segment were not 
indicative of our long-term objectives for those businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sears' total revenues for the quarter fell 3.1 percent to $9.99  
billion from $10.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail revenues fell to $7.25 billion, or 3.5 percent, from $7.5  
billion, although Sears blamed part of the loss of the divestiture 
of its HomeLife furniture and Western Auto businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit revenues fell 13.4 percent to $973 million from $1.12  
billion as the Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based retailer continues to 
whittle away at credit risks while at the same time losing other 
users to cards with much lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears' domestic retail profits also continued to flounder, with  
operating income falling 13.1 percent to $173 million from $199 
million, even as the company succeeded in slashing expenses in that 
segment of its business. Its Canadian operations, however, saw a 21 
percent increase in retail business, to $45 million in profits from 
$37 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Credit operations saw profits rise 10.1 percent to $315 million  
from $286 million, mainly as the unit reduced provisions for credit 
card losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The retailer is undertaking another makeover of its stores in  
hopes of attracting younger customers, while on the credit card 
side it has launched a rewards program for some shoppers who spend 
more than $600 annually on their Sears-brand credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the quarter fell 1.5 percent to $331 million, or  
86 cents a share, from $336 million, or 85 cents a share a year 
earlier. The year-ago quarter saw a one-time gain of $18 million 
for an accounting change. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, net income rose to $477  
million, or $1.24 a share, from $469 million, or $1.19 a share. The 
year-ago quarter, however, saw a $39 million gain on the accounting 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues fell 2.7 percent to $19 billion from $19.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Profits Jump at McDonald's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp., the world's largest fast-food  
chain, reported Thursday its second-quarter profits jumped amid 
strong sales overseas and heavy promotional activity domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	For the three months that ended June 30, the Oak Brook,  
Ill.-based company reported that net income rose to $518 million, 
or 37 cents a share, from $357.2 million, or 25 cents a share, in 
the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-ago results include a charge of $110 million to cut  
staff and expenses at the company's headquarters. The share figures 
reflect a stock split in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched Wall Street expectations, according to a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. McDonald's shares fell 12.5 
cents to $42.87 1/2 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Systemwide sales rose 7 percent to $9.9 billion from $9.25  
billion, while revenues also rose 7 percent to $3.4 billion from 
$3.18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company does not release figures detailing sales from stores  
open at least a year, an industry measure of performance. But 
McDonald's reported domestic revenues rose 5 percent on 
``positive'' same-store sales that came after three successful 
Happy Meal promotions -- Furby, Tarzan and Teenie Beanie Babies -- 
drove families into stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain also saw a boost in breakfast sales from its  
introduction of breakfast bagel sandwiches and its North American 
made-to-order cooking system -- which is two-thirds completed -- 
resulted in less wasted food. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, sales saw a 15 percent gain in Latin America, a 13  
percent increase in Europe and an 8 percent increase in Asia. The 
results illustrated the continued room for expansion overseas, 
while reflecting a near saturation of fast-food business 
domestically that has slowed sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``While difficult economic conditions continue in some of our  
major markets, we are cautiously optimistic that we have weathered 
the worst of the economic challenges,'' said James Cantalupo, chief 
executive of McDonald's international business. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, net income rose 11 percent  
to $920.8 million, or 65 cents a share, from $719.4 million, or 51 
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $18.7 billion from 
$17.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's operates or franchises nearly 25,000 restaurants  
around the globe. The company is opening 1,750 restaurants this 
year.

<HEADLINE>  More Umpires Change 'Out' Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With commissioner Bud Selig set to accept their  
resignations, more major league umpires changed their minds about 
quitting. 
</P>
<P>
	Union head Richie Phillips is facing renewed pressure from some  
umpires to step down, although he still has the support from the 
majority of his membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig hasn't set any deadlines for umpires to withdraw their  
resignations, which take effect Sept. 2. But baseball officials 
have said Selig is prepared to move on and hire new umps, several 
management officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though their Triple-A counterparts are ready to step in, it  
was too early to say how many would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Five AL umpires reversed themselves earlier this week and as  
many as 8-10 more umpires might be withdrawing their resignations, 
two baseball officials said. But umpires said baseball might be 
exaggerating the number to sway wavering umps. 
</P>
<P>
	Three NL umpires have changed their minds about resigning, said  
NL umpire Bruce Froemming, a union board member. Wally Bell's 
reversal was received by the National League on Wednesday and 
rookie umpire Jeff Nelson told the league his will be arriving 
shortly, one baseball official said. 
</P>
<P>
	A top minor league official said Triple-A umpires decided they  
would work major league games if they are called up. However, they 
are being pressured not to work, according to Pat O'Conner, a vice 
president of the governing body of the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to get them to change their minds,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and union president Jerry Crawford said they had no  
knowledge of any pressure attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Saying he was reacting to ``recent bashing by the media, jeering  
from irate fans, continued stonewalling from management and the 
union's own internal turmoil,'' Crawford issued a four-word 
statement: ``What else is new?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had turmoil,'' Crawford said later in San  
Francisco. ``We've always had fans against us. We've always had 
baseball management against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two top baseball officials, speaking on the condition they not  
be identified, said baseball was told more withdrawals of 
resignations were on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-three of the 66 unionized major league umpires quit last  
week, and Phillips said additional resignations will be submitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Froemming, a union board member, said Phillips had become the  
issue for some umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has become personal,'' Froemming said. ``We're not  
divided.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several AL umpires who voted in March against giving Phillips a  
new contract have renewed calls to replace him, but the majority 
still backs him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That group was there long before March,'' Phillips said.  
``That group existed for at least five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has attempted to organize minor league umpires and has  
held a series of telephone conference calls, with another scheduled 
for today. While there had been a threat of a walkout in the minors 
today, no date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll give the National Association ample time to  
prepare,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just in case, the National Association of Professional Baseball  
Leagues, the minor leagues' governing body, has instructed its 
teams to have alternate umpires at games. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league umpires, bound by a no-strike clause, decided on  
the resignations because they fear owners will lock them out after 
their labor contract expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bud said it's sad,'' Froemming said. ``What's sad is that  
baseball doesn't have enough respect to address a situation that 
they know was coming. ... It looks like they want a war, for 
whatever reason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and Froemming disputed the claim that Triple-A umps had  
voted to work major league games if asked to. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a very confusing vote,'' Phillips said, adding that  
a new ballot was under way.

	Kennedy Family Scattering Ashes

<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- A Navy destroyer carried family members  
today to a ceremony to scatter the ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., 
his wife and sister-in-law at a site off Martha's Vineyard about 
three miles from where the bodies were recovered. A group of about 
15 family members carried the cremated remains of Kennedy, Carolyn 
Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette onto the USS Briscoe. A 
private Mass for Kennedy and his wife is scheduled for tomorrow 
morning at the Church of St. Thomas More in New York. President

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans, their ranks precariously in  
line, are cautiously confident today of winning passage of a 
10-year, $792 billion package they say rewards Americans in the new 
age of budget surpluses. President Clinton has denounced the 
measure as too big and promised a veto. The bill was brought to the 
floor last night, only after daylong negotiations during which 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., with his leadership at stake, 
succeeded in bringing rebellious GOP moderates in line.

including a review of the long-delayed START II treaty, the prime 
minister said. Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who visited Yeltsin 
at his residence west of Moscow, is scheduled leave Sunday for the

ban, reported by state media, accused Falun Gong of spreading 
``superstitious, evil thinking'' to undermine social stability. 
Falun Gong, or the Wheel of Law, was founded in 1992 by Li Hongzhi, 
a former government clerk who now lives in the United States. The 
Chinese government estimated at one point that it had up to 70 
million followers. The ruling Chinese Communist Party has 60

month, spoke a day after returning from a weeklong trip to the

early gift today: the gates to the music festival were opened three 
hours early. Traffic had begun to build around the two main gates 
leading onto the former Griffiss Air Force base, site of the 
three-day festival, when state police persuaded concert promoters 
to open the gates at 9 a.m. The three-day rock festival starts at 
the former Griffiss Air Force Base tomorrow. Promoters said 
Wednesday that they had sold more than 170,000 tickets, but anyone 
hoping to find a hotel room at this late date is out of luck.

had consensual sex, according to a tape played at his trial today. 
Attorneys for Druckenmiller played an audiotape of a conversation 
the athlete had with a police sergeant the day after the alleged 
assault last March. Druckenmiller told the officer that the young 
woman was awake while they had sex and that they undressed each 
other beforehand. Druckenmiller, a 26-year-old reserve quarterback 
for the San Francisco 49ers, faces five years to life in prison if 
convicted.

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged To Help Africa AIDS </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An AIDS patient from Malawi asked Congress for  
help in settling trade disputes that could deprive poor African 
countries such as her own of vital drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatinkah Nkhoma, 37, believes she would be dead now had she  
stayed in Lilongwe, Malawi's capital, where the drugs she needs 
either are unavailable or cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of other Africans are not as lucky, said Nkhoma, who  
came to the United States as a graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm their voice. I'm here to cry for help,'' Nkhoma testified  
tearfully Thursday before the House Government Reform subcommittee 
on criminal justice, drug policy and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	The government did act this week: Vice President Gore on Monday  
announced a new $100 million proposal to help Africa stop the 
spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkhoma also appealed to lawmakers to reject arguments that the  
drugs may cause more harm than good in poor nations unable to 
ensure AIDS patients adhere to strict drug regimens. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have said that people who do not take the drugs as  
prescribed actually may become sicker or develop drug-resistant 
strains of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS deaths in the United States have declined because of  
advances in treatment, but they remain on the increase in Africa, 
where it is the leading cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade disputes have developed over some countries' efforts to  
reduce the cost of importing AIDS drugs, with some blame directed 
at pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens to countries who ... do not purchase their AIDS  
drugs from drug companies, instead looking to buy them through 
cheaper sellers, often times other countries? Under direct pressure 
from the pharmaceutical industry, they are punished by the United 
States,'' Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said these countries could lose their preferential tariff  
treatment ``all because the pharmaceutical companies do not wish to 
lose any of their tremendous profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Papovich, an assistant U.S. trade representative, said the  
Clinton administration believe it can resolve the disputes, which 
involve drug companies' efforts to protect their patents and help 
recoup research costs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration is working with South Africa, where  
45 percent of the military is infected with the AIDS virus, so that 
country can import lower-cost drugs without infringing on patents. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue of African access to AIDS drugs has taken on a  
political dimension recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has been caught in a fight between AIDS activists seeking  
cheap generic drugs for South African AIDS victims of the disease 
and U.S. laws intended to protect drug companies from having their 
patents violated abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has said he does not oppose South Africa's attempts to  
produce or obtain generic AIDS medicines as long as those efforts 
do not violate laws protecting patents. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 South African law granted the government unspecified  
power to obtain cheaper AIDS drugs. About 40 pharmaceutical 
companies worldwide are challenging the law in South African 
courts, fearing it may be used in a way that violates patent 
rights.

<HEADLINE> Quake Shakes Anchorage Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMER, Alaska (AP) -- A moderate earthquake shook the Anchorage  
area and portions of the Matanuska Valley, but there were no 
immediate reports of severe damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy Urban with the Alaska Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer said  
the quake at 9:35 p.m. Wednesday had a preliminary magnitude of 
5.3. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was felt sharply around Eagle River, Anchorage and  
Palmer,'' Urban said. ``The quake was strong enough to throw items 
off shelves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The epicenter was 20 miles east of Anchorage, Alaska's largest  
city. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Alaska sits along the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes  
and fault lines stretching along the West Coast and into Asia. It 
is one of the world's most earthquake-prone regions, though most 
quakes are mild.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Recalls Tour With JFK Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says it was ``the right  
thing'' to authorize an extensive ocean search for John F. Kennedy 
Jr.'s crashed airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	He said initial rescue and recovery efforts ``were consistent  
with what would have been done in any other case'' and that Coast 
Guard officials told him they could locate the plane and its 
passengers if given more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at  
fault, I am,'' Clinton said. ``It was because I thought it was the 
right thing to do under the circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he based his decision to authorize extraordinary  
government efforts to recover the private plane on the Kennedy 
family's role ``in our national lives, and because of the enormous 
losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the White House said Clinton and first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton would attend the Friday memorial services in New 
York for Kennedy and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy. She and 
her sister, Lauren Bessette, also were killed in the plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	It was during Clinton's first term, in 1994, that Kennedy  
visited the White House inner sanctum for the first time as an 
adult, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy also was at the White House during Richard Nixon's  
presidency for a private dinner with his mother and sister, and 
again at a public ceremony honoring the late Robert F. Kennedy in 
1981 when Ronald Reagan was president. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said took Kennedy to the Oval Office to show him the  
desk under which Kennedy had playfully crawled as a boy while his 
father worked. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure he wanted to come back to the White House before  
he did,'' Clinton said in a melancholy tone. ``In light of 
everything that's happened, I'm glad he had a chance to come back 
here one last time. I'm grateful that happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the 1994 visit, Kennedy returned to the White House in  
February 1998 as a guest at a state dinner for British Prime 
Minister Tony Blair. A month later, on March 5, 1998, Kennedy and 
his wife attended a screening for the HBO series on the Apollo 
space program, ``From the Earth to the Moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When most of the guests had gone home, Clinton said he and the  
first lady offered Kennedy a personal tour of the White House 
residence, ``which he had not seen since he was a tiny boy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very nice evening, and I sent him the pictures from  
it,'' Clinton said. ``He and Carolyn, they were delightful young 
people. Hillary and I loved having them here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said in her latest newspaper column that Kennedy  
struck her as ``elegant and eloquent'' that night, speaking 
movingly about how the space program was his father's ``proudest 
legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the tour, she said, Kennedy ``had trouble sorting out  
what he remembered from what he had seen only in pictures.'' She 
said they showed him the room where he slept, the grounds where he 
played, and the garden named in honor of his mother, Jacqueline 
Kennedy.

<HEADLINE> House Quadruples Embassy Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Protecting American embassies is becoming a  
top foreign policy priority for Congress, vying to claim more funds 
than any foreign account. 
</P>
<P>
	The House on Wednesday unanimously passed a $2.4 billion foreign  
operations bill that it renamed ``The American Embassy Security 
Act.'' The measure would set aside 60 percent of its proposed 
funding -- $1.4 billion -- for security upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
	The heightened concern comes amid State Department warnings of  
an increased terrorist threat surrounding the Aug. 7 anniversary of 
twin bombings that killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, at 
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure has not yet won approval of congressional  
appropriators who scheduled a meeting today to set the State 
Department budget for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers also will have to reconcile the House funding level  
with a Senate-passed version that adopts the Clinton 
administration's proposal to spend just $300 million on embassy 
security next year, with stepped-up spending envisioned in later 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	If the House spending level is accepted, the tab to protect  
embassies would top any single nonmilitary item in foreign affairs 
bills pending in Congress. It would exceed nonmilitary aid to 
Israel, Egypt or any other country, as well as funding for the 
United Nations, the World Bank or international refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	House members stressed the urgent need to act, with more than  
half of 250 foreign posts deemed inadequately unprotected against 
terrorist and new threats connected to the bombing anniversary. The 
State Department has closed several posts for varying periods in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The main perceived threat comes from a terrorist organization  
allegedly led by Saudi Arabian millionaire Osama bin Laden, who 
U.S. officials believe is based in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to see, for lack of attention to diplomatic  
security, any more acts of terrorism that succeed,'' said Rep. 
Chris Smith, R-N.J., the bill's chief author. ``Diplomats must be 
protected. They are us abroad. There's the flag and they're under 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith pledged to work hard to get full congressional approval  
for the $1.4 billion recommended by a commission headed by retired 
Adm. William Crowe. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said it would take the same amount every year  
over the next decade to adequately secure all posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some terrorism experts caution, however, that fortifying U.S.  
embassies may simply transfer the threat to private U.S. facilities 
abroad, some of which have already been targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department officials support heavy funding for security  
enhancements but are concerned that the money not be taken from 
other foreign affairs programs, which have received declining funds 
in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill was passed by voice vote with nearly all members  
in the chamber. No voices were raised against it. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to money for relocating, rebuilding and remodeling  
embassies, the legislation addresses concern over the response of 
U.S. law enforcement units to crises abroad. One provision would 
allow the FBI immediately to lease an aircraft for sending agents 
to the site of a crisis -- something officials say took over 13 
hours after word of the African bombings. 
</P>
<P>
	A major concern is the proximity of many embassies to open  
streets, making them vulnerable to car bombs such as those that hit 
the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	Other steps to combat terrorism include charges and arrests of  
alleged bin Laden accomplices, a $5 million reward program and 
preemptive strikes against a camp in Afghanistan that U.S. 
officials believe was used by bin Laden and against a factory it 
linked to him in Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Some Criticize ``Practical Shooting'' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The sport is called practical shooting, and  
critics are sure of one thing: It is not a game and certainly 
doesn't belong in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not paintball,'' said Philip Alpers, who researched  
the sport for the Violence Policy Center. ``There is a very serious 
political purpose behind this, and that is to legitimize the 
civilian ownership of lethal firearms, which are normally kept only 
for battlefields and SWAT teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In practical shooting, participants racing against the clock use  
assault rifles, shotguns and semiautomatic handguns to shoot 
human-shaped targets in simulated scenarios. For instance, the 
shooter may start in the prone position -- as if lying in bed -- and 
then get up to retrieve a handgun from a drawer and use it to shoot 
at targets through a window. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport is practiced in about 70 countries, according to the  
Canada-based International Practical Shooting Confederation. The 
group recently held talks with the International Olympic Committee, 
and practical shooting will be an exhibition, nonmedal sport at the 
2004 Games in Athens, Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	Advocates say practical shooting, formerly known as combat  
shooting, has no political connotations. Josh Sugarmann, executive 
director of the Violence Policy Center, contends it presents a 
convenient way to skirt laws that prohibit the trade of certain 
weapons unless they are used for sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugarmann also noted that Andrew Golden, the 11-year-old boy who  
was a participant in the Jonesboro, Ark., school shooting last 
year, had recently taken up practical shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Combat shooting doesn't just violate the goals of the Olympic  
charter, it's an effort by the gun industry and the gun lobby to 
entice kids and help create a youth gun culture,'' Sugarmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Hollar, president of the 14,000-member U.S. Practical  
Shooting Association, said his organization has no such agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need to understand that we're not a political  
organization; we're a sporting organization,'' Hollar said from 
USPSA headquarters in Sedro Woolley, Wash. ``People are going to 
look at our sport and read into it whatever they want to. We can't 
control that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IPSC president Nick Alexakos recently met with an IOC  
representative and played down his sport's chance for Olympic 
status. There are other shooting sports in the Olympics, such as 
skeet shooting and the biathlon. But Alexakos said practical 
shooting is a ``long shot'' that would take years to make it to the 
Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, Alexakos said, ``We're talking about the same  
dedication and same commitment you find in any Olympic sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't deal with weapons,'' Alexakos said. ``We deal with  
recreational implements. A weapon is more how you use something, 
than what it is. A baseball bat could be used a weapon.''

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon Condors Too Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The California condors are getting a little too  
friendly at the Grand Canyon, swooping down into parking lots and 
fishing camps in search of handouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unnerving to have this happen,'' said Michael Wallace, a  
specialist at the Zoological Society of San Diego who led the 
multi-agency recovery effort to bring California condors to Arizona 
in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep man and condor apart, authorities plan to close outlook  
points and trails whenever the birds come into view. People will be 
asked to stay at least 300 feet away. Wildlife specialists will try 
to train the reintroduced condors to fear humans by screaming and 
flapping their arms when the birds get too close. 
</P>
<P>
	And in backwoods areas, ``we will encourage campers to make a  
run at the condors'' to scare them off, Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	The baldheaded, dull-gray condor is North America's largest  
bird. With wingspans of 9 feet, they can ride thermal updrafts for 
hours, reach speeds of 55 mph and altitudes of 15,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past century, poisoning by ranchers and encroaching  
urbanization brought them to brink of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
	Three years ago, six condors were brought to the Vermilion  
Cliffs near the Grand Canyon. Now, about 15 reintroduced condors 
live in the area, roaming freely from Zion National Park in Utah to 
the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	But these condors are adolescents and naturally curious. They  
are mixing with humans because there are no adults to show them how 
to behave. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't really know what they're doing,'' Wallace said.  
``They have to gradually learn how to become condors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although good for bird watchers, visits from the endangered  
birds have been disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, a man shot and killed a 4-year-old female condor that  
had gotten too close to his campsite. A second condor was returned 
to captivity in April after it kept approaching river rafters and 
waddled onto an airstrip near the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take time before condors learn to avoid people, Wallace  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to remember that these birds evolved at an arm's  
length from saber-toothed cats,'' he said. ``They don't scare away 
easily.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Working Poor Want Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Most of the nation's working poor are eager  
to learn new job skills, but are hampered by a lack of access to 
education and the Internet, according to a new study. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll of 500 people across the nation with family incomes no  
more than twice the poverty level also found that the working poor 
are more willing to work long hours and sleep less to get ahead 
than the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are people that have the same work ethic, if not more  
so, than the rest of the American population,'' said Carl Van Horn, 
director of the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development 
at Rutgers University. ``There are other reasons why they're not 
succeeding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study, released Thursday, recommended more access to job  
training, child care and public transportation, as well as an 
increase in the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage, to bring people back 
from the edge of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	One in five Americans is considered among the working poor, with  
incomes that don't rise above double the poverty level, according 
to government figures. The federal poverty level is $16,450 for a 
family of four. Eighty of the 500 people surveyed for Thursday's 
poll were unemployed at the time, but belonged to working poor 
households. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by the Heldrich Center and the University of  
Connecticut's Center for Research and Analysis defined the typical 
working poor American as a single white woman, aged 30-49, with a 
40-hour-a-week job, an annual income of less than $25,000 and at 
least one child under the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
	About seven in 10 of those surveyed are paid by the hour, and  
more than six in 10 have either no paid vacation or a week or less 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty-two percent of those surveyed said they needed more  
education to get the job they want, but only 18 percent had 
received financial support from an employer for education or job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
	By comparison, 36 percent of the nonpoor population said their  
employers had helped pay for their education, the study said, 
relying on two earlier polls of 2,000 working adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 9 percent of the respondents had a college education, while  
19 percent had not graduated high school, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-nine percent of the respondents said they have access to  
the Internet, and less than half have access to a computer at work 
or home. Seventy-six percent of the working public have access to 
the Internet and more than 70 percent have computers at work and at 
home, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Horn said the poor are hurt by not having computer access in  
an economy that is increasingly driven by technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also found that 24 percent of the working poor would be  
willing to work longer hours, twice as much as the rest of the 
population, and 33 percent aren't concerned about getting enough 
sleep, again twice as much as the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Acs, a researcher on poverty at the Urban Institute, said  
his data supported many of the poll's findings. But he said the 
statistic on work hours is not surprising, because low-wage workers 
generally work far less than the rest of the population. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll, conducted by telephone between May 22 and June 15, has  
a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Congress Urged To Help Africa AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman from Malawi tearfully begged Congress  
on Thursday to send more AIDS drugs to fellow Africans unable to 
afford them. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatinkah Nkhoma, now in the United States for AIDS treatment,  
asked lawmakers to find a way around trade disputes that could 
impede the flow of essential drugs to Third World nations, 
especially in Africa, where drug companies conduct the tests needed 
to develop their products. 
</P>
<P>
	Nkhoma, 37, believes she would be dead now had she stayed in  
Lilongwe, Malawi's capital, where the expensive drugs she needs 
either are unavailable or cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of other Africans are not as lucky, said Nkhoma, who  
came to the United States as a graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm their voice. I'm here to cry for help,'' Nkhoma told the  
House Government Reform subcommittee on criminal justice, drug 
policy and human resources. 
</P>
<P>
	She also asked lawmakers to reject arguments that the drugs may  
cause more harm than good in poor nations unable to ensure AIDS 
patients adhere to strict drug regimens. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts have said that people who do not take the drugs as  
prescribed actually may become sicker or develop drug-resistant 
strains of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
	AIDS deaths have declined because of advances in treatment in  
the United States, but they remain on the increase in Africa, where 
it is the leading cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade disputes have developed over some countries' efforts to  
reduce the cost of importing AIDS drugs, with some blame directed 
at pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens to countries who ... do not purchase their AIDS  
drugs from drug companies, instead looking to buy them through 
cheaper sellers, often times other countries? Under direct pressure 
from the pharmaceutical industry, they are punished by the United 
States,'' Rep. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said these countries could lose their preferential tariff  
treatment ``all because the pharmaceutical companies do not wish to 
lose any of their tremendous profits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Papovich, an assistant U.S. trade representative, said the  
Clinton administration believe it can resolve the disputes, which 
involve drug companies' efforts to protect their patents and help 
recoup research costs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the administration is working with South Africa, where  
45 percent of the military is infected with the AIDS virus, so that 
country can import lower-cost drugs without infringing on patents. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Vice President Gore announced a new $100 million  
proposal to help Africa stop the spread of AIDS. The money included 
$48 million for AIDS education, counseling and testing, which 
involved a Defense Department program to train African militaries 
how to provide AIDS prevention training. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining funds would be targeted at home- and  
community-based care, caring for children orphaned by AIDS and 
helping other countries build infrastructure to confront the spread 
of AIDS.

<HEADLINE>  Ibeabuchi Arrested for Sex Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Heavyweight boxer Ike Ibeabuchi was arrested  
Thursday on charges he sexually assaulted a woman in his hotel 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Police Lt. Tom Monahan said a 21-year-old entertainer on  
call, whose name was not released, was called to Ibeabuchi's suite 
in The Mirage hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel guests heard a commotion and summoned hotel security, who  
then called police. When police arrived about 5:30 a.m., the woman 
said Ibeabuchi had sexually assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan said Ibeabuchi, 26, barricaded himself in the bathroom  
of his hotel suite and surrendered a few minutes later after 
officers sprayed pepper spray under the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on  
charges of sexual assault and battery with intent to commit sexual 
assault.

<HEADLINE>  Ibeabuchi Arrested for Sex Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Heavyweight boxer Ike Ibeabuchi was arrested  
Thursday on charges he sexually assaulted a woman in his hotel 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Police Lt. Tom Monahan said a 21-year-old entertainer on  
call, whose name was not released, was called to Ibeabuchi's suite 
in The Mirage hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel guests heard a commotion and summoned hotel security, who  
then called police. When police arrived about 5:30 a.m., the woman 
said Ibeabuchi had sexually assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan said Ibeabuchi, 26, barricaded himself in the bathroom  
of his hotel suite and surrendered a few minutes later after 
officers sprayed pepper spray under the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on  
charges of sexual assault and battery with intent to commit sexual 
assault.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen in New York  
Thursday as traders scooped up the Japanese currency in the absence 
of market intervention from Japan's central bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan had been selling yen in currency markets over  
the past several trading sessions in an effort to stem the yen's 
rise, which could hamper economic recovery efforts by trimming the 
profits of exporting companies. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the Bank of Japan apparently absent from Thursday's  
markets, traders swooped in to pick up yen, which have been in high 
demand as funds flow back into Japanese financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 116.70  
Japanese yen, down from 118.10 yen late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro slipped slightly against the dollar after three  
straight days of gains. In late New York trading, the euro was 
quoted at $1.0517, down from $1.0530. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5245 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5258, and 1.5080 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5001. The British 
pound rose to $1.5845 from $1.5778. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8598 German 
marks, up from 1.8574; 6.2383 French francs, up from 6.2305.

<HEADLINE> Senator: US Should Speak Up on Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's policy of silence  
regarding widespread student protests in Iran was assailed by a key 
senator today as counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., chairman of the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee on the Near East and South Asia, said the 
administration's decision to remain silent and avoid the issue 
``can only achieve the very opposite of its weak intent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a subcommittee hearing on Iran, Brownback said, ``I  
cannot think of a policy that is more likely to cause the Iranian 
public to believe that the U.S. is a guilty partner in the recent 
uprisings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mass student demonstrations erupted in Iran this month -- with  
some protesters demanding the ouster of Iran's hard-line supreme 
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, a figure traditionally held above 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been trying to nurture a dialogue with  
the regime but has been rebuffed. The Islamic government in Tehran 
is one of the world's most anti-American. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Murphy, a former assistant secretary of state, defended  
the administration's cautious approach. ``With the situation as 
tense as it is, whatever you said would be manipulated by the 
hard-liners,'' Murphy said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``To feel you have to tell an Iranian student that we believe in  
free speech is simply not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's caution was exemplified on Wednesday by  
President Clinton, who was asked about Iran during a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Iran, frankly, I'm reluctant to say anything for fear that  
it will be used in a way that's not helpful to the forces of 
openness and reform,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people everywhere, particularly younger people,  
hope that they will be able to pursue their religious convictions 
and their personal dreams in an atmosphere of greater freedom that 
still allows them to be deeply loyal to their nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Thursday's hearing, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said the  
administration cannot realistically pursue an opening with Iran, 
given the events of the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any attempt at dialogue now would be greatly misinterpreted  
and misunderstood,'' Torricelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,200 people were arrested during the protests, of whom  
about 750 have been released. Authorities have alleged that the 
unrest was directed by outside forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Also testifying was Bruce Laingen, a former diplomat who was in  
charge of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran when militants seized it and 
held 52 Americans hostage in 1979 for 444 days. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he deeply regrets the absence of a dialogue with Iran  
for two decades. Advocating a change in U.S. policy, Laingen said, 
``I can't see that a sanctions-driven containment policy has 
worked.''

<HEADLINE> Brit Farmers Wary of Modified Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATCHFIELD, England (AP) -- As potential enemies go, the one  
confronting farmer Pete Richardson is largely invisible. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson and other farmers who embrace organic production for  
both principles and profits say pollen from genetically modified, 
or GM, food grown nearby is threatening their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
	The farmers worry that if the modified crops cross-pollinate  
with their organic counterparts, the resulting product would not be 
considered organic and sales would plummet. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the world goes GM, no one can guarantee we will be able to  
buy non-GM crops,'' said Richardson from his eight-acre hillside 
plot in western England. ``There isn't a market. There isn't a 
necessity. Why take the risk?'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM producers in Britain, who describe worries about pollen  
contamination as nonsense, say their crops are more resistant to 
insects and viruses, subsequently enabling higher yields and better 
returns for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, the argument between organic and GM farmers is part  
of a wider, heated debate about farming's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm produce prices have fallen sharply over the past few years,  
causing many small and midsize farmers to diversify their crops in 
an attempt to stave off bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic farmers don't use pesticides or other chemicals to farm,  
instead employing natural fertilizers such as animal manures and 
crop rotation to keep the soil fertile. 
</P>
<P>
	``Organic is the only way that some small growers can make a  
livelihood,'' Richardson said, explaining that Britain's powerful 
supermarket chains are unwilling to take regular crops from smaller 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	If GM pollen is found in organic food, organic growers can lose  
their licenses and take a big drop in income, since organic crops 
command a premium of anything between 15 percent and 100 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the United States has approved 50 varieties of genetically  
modified crops, Britain has yet to approve one, although the 
government is overseeing the test growing of such crops in 100 
small-scale and five full-scale fields across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Organic farmers in the western counties of Gloucestershire and  
Wiltshire have a powerful champion in Prince Charles, whose 
Gloucestershire farm has been converted to organic production. 
</P>
<P>
	``On the basis of what we have seen so far, we don't appear to  
need it at all,'' the heir to the throne wrote in a May article in 
The Daily Mail. ``The benefits, such as there are, seem to be 
limited to the people who own the technology and the people who 
farm on an industrialized scale.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polls of Britons reveal conflicting desires.  
</P>
<P>
	After scares with ``mad cow disease,'' which medical researchers  
linked to a fatal human brain ailment, many Britons have become 
wary of food experimentation, and an opinion poll published in 
February indicated that the overwhelming majority of citizens did 
not want GM foods. 
</P>
<P>
	But other polls show Britons want at least research into GM  
foods to continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Tony Blair has said that he would be happy eating  
genetically modified food. Under pressure, however, the government 
has agreed to tighten labeling on the few imported food products 
that contain GM organisms. 
</P>
<P>
	GM producers say they have been surprised by the outcry and  
complain that their case has been weakened by what they see as a 
one-sided campaign by some of Britain's newspapers, which have 
nicknamed the products ``Frankenstein'' foods. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the GM industry has tried to put a positive side to the  
media, it is not a news story. Scare stuff sells papers, good news 
doesn't,'' said Desmond D' Souza, biotechnology communication 
manager for AgrEvo, a biotechnology company pushing for GM foods. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, just five miles from Richardson's small plot, farmer  
Fred Barker was forced to uproot the genetically modified oil seed 
rape he was growing as a test for AgrEvo after a national outcry 
fueled by the Soil Association, an organic farmers pressure group. 
</P>
<P>
	The association warned of a small risk that Richardon's crops --  
and those of other nearby organic farmers -- could be contaminated 
by the GM test. It also threatened to remove Barker's own organic 
license. 
</P>
<P>
	GM farmers dispute claims that pollen from GM crops could travel  
up to six miles to mix with non-GM crops. 
</P>
<P>
	And John Nesser, Barker's farm manager, remains unrepentant  
about the decision to start growing GM crops. If he can grow GM 
foods, he said he believes he would be able to use fewer, and 
weaker, chemical fertilizers on his crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Nesser: ``I think it is the future.''

<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Billionaire Carl Icahn and his wife,  
Liba, have settled their divorce out of court. 
</P>
<P>
	The terms were not disclosed, but Icahn's lawyer, Jay Goldberg,  
said the financier agreed to go beyond what he owed Mrs. Icahn 
under a prenuptial agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	At last count, Icahn, who made millions with quick moves on  
Marvel Entertainment, TWA and Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino 
resort, was worth $2.5 billion. Mrs. Icahn reportedly had 
complained that she was being offered only one-half of 1 percent of 
that -- $12.5 million. The Icahns have two children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever Carl did to settle this he was not forced to do,''  
Goldberg said Thursday. ``This was the mother of his children. He 
will never say a bad word about her.'' 
</P>

	Mrs. Icahn's lawyer, William Beslow, did not return a call

<HEADLINE> Garvey Has Hip Replacement Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Steve Garvey, a 10-time National League  
All-Star with the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres, had hip 
replacement surgery on Thursday at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Garvey did extremely well in total hip surgery with the  
latest state of the art components,'' his surgeon, Dr. Bert Thomas, 
said in a statement issued by the hospital Thursday night. ``With 
his excellent conditioning, we expect a full and rapid recovery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garvey reportedly had an arthritic condition in his left hip.  
</P>
<P>
	Garvey, 50, played for the Dodgers 1969-82 and Padres 1983-87.  
He was the NL Most Valuable Player in 1974, also winning the 
All-Star Game MVP honor that year. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named to the NL All-Star team every year from 1974-81  
with the Dodgers, and with the Padres 1984-85. Garvey had 200 or 
more hits in six seasons, with 100 RBI or more five seasons, 
finishing his career with a .294 batting average, 2,559 hits in 
2,332 games with 272 home runs and 1,308 RBI. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Moderates Whipped on Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The appeals were polite but unrelenting:  
Congressman, your vote for our tax cut proposal is important to the 
Republican Party. It's crucial to the credibility of the GOP 
leadership. People will think we can't lead if it fails. 
</P>
<P>
	And finally, GOP leaders asked this question of the band of  
moderates that stood in the way of an across-the-board tax cut: 
What would it take to win your vote? 
</P>
<P>
	The answer: making the tax cuts conditional on measures to  
reduce the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., and his lieutenants  
enlisted team loyalty, guilt and outright begging in what 
participants described as a relentless series of meetings with a 
group of GOP moderates who held the power Wednesday to sink one of 
the party's top legislative priorities -- and Hastert's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, GOP leaders gave in to the moderates' demands,  
agreeing to a concession conditioning the planned 10 percent 
reduction in income tax rates over the next 10 years to annual 
progress in reducing the nation's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 223-208, with only four Republicans breaking ranks  
and voting against the measure. They were Reps. Greg Ganske of 
Iowa, Constance Morella of Maryland, Jack Quinn of New York and 
Mike Castle of Delaware. Six Democrats supported the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote followed days of relentless negotiations with  
moderates. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been pleas to me,'' said Rep. Connie Morella,  
R-Md., one of the group who refused throughout the day to support 
the leaders' 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. ``But look,'' she 
added, thrusting out her wrists, ``My arms are untwisted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the GOP leadership searched for support, a compromise emerged  
that would make income tax cuts conditional on year-to-year 
progress in reducing the nation's debt. The plan was designed to 
attract support from rebellious GOP moderates, and was to be voted 
on today. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple arithmetic toughens the Republican drive for virtually  
any controversial proposal in the House, but the leaders' tax cut 
proposal was a cornerstone of the GOP agenda and a self-proclaimed 
test of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinging to the 222-211-seat majority it nearly lost in the  
impeachment-tinged November elections, GOP leaders struggled to 
secure the 218 votes needed to pass the tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	But the leadership's whip operation is as formidable as the  
arithmetic, lawmakers say. Senior Republicans powered it up 
Wednesday and unleashed it on about a half-dozen moderates who 
stood in the way of a proposal many in the party say was key to 
retaining control of the House next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the day, a parade of moderate lawmakers flowed in and  
out of Hastert's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said how important it is for our party, how important it  
is for the leadership,'' said Rep. Mike Castle, former governor of 
Delaware who as of late afternoon still refused to capitulate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They asked, 'What will it take?''' recounted Rep. Fred Upton,  
R-Mich., a one-time protege of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
who in 1993 resigned from the whip organization in part over its 
confrontational style. Like Castle, he was sticking with his 'no' 
vote because tax cuts, he said, likely would make debt reduction 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ray LaHood of Illinois, who refused to sign the GOP's  
Contract With American manifesto but has evolved into a 
widely-respected conciliator, late Tuesday ignored a summons to the 
speaker's suite for a chat about tax cuts. ``I had other plans,'' 
he explained with a shrug at midday Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But an hour later, he was spotted rushing from Hastert's office  
around the corner to the Ways and Means Committee, where the 
chairman, Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, had summoned the moderates for 
what one participant called a ``seminar'' on how the bill repays 
the federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They finally found me,'' Lahood said. But asked whether the  
leaders would change his mind, he only smiled, turned the knob and 
entered Archer's meeting.

<HEADLINE> More People Owed Benefits Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is expanding its search  
for nearly 10,000 people owed more than $19 million in pension 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. announced today that it will  
include last-known addresses of those named in its Internet pension 
search listing. It will also provide tips for self-searches in a 
new booklet. 
</P>
<P>
	PBGC, a federal agency designed to protect beneficiaries of  
pension plans that get into financial difficulty, is now searching 
for 9,887 people who worked for about 1,400 employers in 48 states, 
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet pension search gives names and now will include  
last-known addresses of workers who have pension money coming from 
terminated plans that were either closed by former sponsors who 
distributed the benefits or that were taken over by the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Also included are unlocated people who may be able to document  
that they are owned a benefit, even though current agency records 
show that no benefit is due. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal agency also has created a booklet ``Finding a Lost  
Pension'' to help people find and claim their benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The address for the Internet pension service is  
http://search.pbgc.gov and the guide books can be obtained at 
http://www.pbgc.gov. The booklets can also be requested by mail 
from the agency.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Defects Before Games Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- The Pan American Games could have as  
much action off the field as on it, if the days before they start 
are any indication. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days before the games officially begin, a Cuban shooter  
defected and several top American and Canadian athletes dropped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Well before today's opening events in canoe and kayak, Cuban  
pistol shooter Abel Juncosa Reyes walked into a Royal Canadian 
Mountain Police station on Tuesday and asked to remain in Canada. 
Just last week, five members of the Cuban basketball delegation, 
including four players, defected during the Tournament of the 
Americas in Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavier security was expected for the Cubans for this event, but  
Reyes apparently had no trouble walking away from the Southport 
athletes village outside of Winnipeg. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview before Reyes' defection, Brian Koshul, press  
secretary for the Pan American Games Society Inc., said games 
officials would not actively assist athletes wishing to defect. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not take them for a coke, they do not hide them in the  
trunk of a car, they do not hide them in the attic,'' he said. 
``Our only contact with applicants for refugee status is (to say) 
`Mr. police officer, this person wants to speak with you.' 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Vasquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports  
Organization, said he was unaware of any defections. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's top two finishers at these games will qualify for the  
2000 Olympics. While Cuba is expected to grab one of the berths 
with ease, Canada and the United States likely will be main 
contenders for the other spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's team was hurt by the last-minute dropouts of Double-A  
Birmingham pitchers Aaron Myette and Julien Tucker. Canada manager 
Ernie Whitt didn't find out until Tuesday that Myette, likely to be 
his top starter, and Tucker would not participate. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> GOP Conditions Tax Cuts to Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans overcame opposition from  
rebellious GOP moderates to their $792 billion tax cut with a 
compromise Wednesday to condition it on annual reductions in the 
federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Debate began late Wednesday after the deal was struck, but House  
leaders decided to save final action on the bill until Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident we have the votes,'' said Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo.,  
a member of the Republican leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, forged during hours of closed-door meetings,  
averted what could have been a political disaster for Republican 
leaders on a key piece of their agenda. It conditions the bill's 10 
percent reduction in income tax rates over the next 10 years on 
annual progress in reducing the nation's debt, a major concern of 
the moderates. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives the public confidence that the Congress is committed  
to debt reduction as well as tax relief,'' said moderate Rep. 
Charles Bass, R-N.H. ``If the debt doesn't go down, the 
across-the-board tax percentage doesn't kick in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other elements of the sweeping tax legislation, including a  
reduction in the capital gains tax, elimination of the estate tax 
and relief from the marriage penalty, would not be affected by the 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	``All taxpayers deserve a share of the rewards from a balanced  
budget -- the overpayment they have made to the federal 
government,'' saiid Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, opening the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a day of frantic efforts at persuasion by Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, R-Ill., and others, but leaders repeatedly insisted they 
would eventually get the necessary votes. 
</P>
<P>
	``You always know how many horses are in the herd. The only  
question is how long it takes to get them into the barn,'' said 
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Several moderate Republicans had balked at the original package,  
including Reps. John Edward Porter and Ray Lahood of Illinois, 
Michael Castle of Delaware, Fred Upton of Michigan, Marge Roukema 
of New Jersey and Sherwood Boehlert of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very concerned we will get ourselves right back into the  
deficit situation we just fought ourselves out of,'' Porter said. 
``There's no groundswell for tax cuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a slim 222-211 edge in the House, with one  
independent who usually votes with Democrats and one vacancy. 
Needing 218 votes to pass the bill, the GOP cannot afford to lose 
more than four members of its party to pass the tax cut with only 
Republican support. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and Democratic lawmakers almost uniformly  
opposed the size of the tax cut, contending it would take too much 
of the projected $2.9 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. 
They, instead, want to use the bulk of the surplus to ensure the 
future of Social Security and Medicare and add a prescription drug 
benefit to the Medicare program. They also want to set aside part 
of the annual surpluses for increases in defense and education 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	At his news conference Wednesday, Clinton said the GOP tax bill  
would ``squander'' the surplus and represents ``the kind of 
risk-taking that got us into deficits before.'' He issued his 
strongest veto threat yet, but said he would sign ``the right kind 
of tax cut'' of roughly $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress passes the wrong kind, of course, I will not sign  
it,'' the president said. ``I will not allow a risky plan to become 
law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican moderates questioned the accuracy of the budget  
surplus projections and sought to use more of the money to pay down 
the $3.6 trillion national debt. Many moderates supported a lesser 
tax cut of about $514 billion, but GOP leaders refused to allow a 
vote on that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all want a tax cut. The question is the amount,'' said Rep.  
Amo Houghton, R-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	There was some question about the significance of the emerging  
compromise, because a tax bill making its way to the Senate floor 
does not contain a similar income tax cut. The House modification 
could be largely a tactical retreat designed to advance the bill to 
final passage without reducing the size of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the usual horse-trading and arm-twisting on major bills,  
GOP leaders appealed to moderates not to abandon the party on such 
a critical political issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a basic provision of our agenda this year,'' said Rep.  
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash. ``It is one of our top four items.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP tax cut would be the largest since President Reagan's in  
1981 and would be phased in gradually over the next decade. It 
includes a 10 percent cut in all income tax rates, gradual repeal 
of estate taxes and the alternative minimum tax, cuts in capital 
gains taxes and relief from the ``marriage penalty'' affecting 
millions of two-income couples. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democratic lawmakers contend wealthy taxpayers would  
benefit most from the plan and claimed its cost would rocket to 
more than $3 trillion in the second decade -- just when the federal 
budget is strained by baby boomer retirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current House leadership seems ready to abdicate its duty  
to future generations to make a political point,'' said Rep. 
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. ``We cannot enact the Republican tax cut 
with its massive windfall for the rich and fulfill the goals of 
saving Social Security and Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Across the Capitol, the Senate Finance Committee approved its  
version of the GOP tax bill on a 13-7 vote, with Democrats John 
Breaux of Louisiana and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska joining 11 
Republicans in favor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill also totals $792 billion, but it differs in many  
respects from the House version by omitting capital gains tax cuts 
and estate tax repeal and including more expansions of individual 
retirement accounts and pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee rejected on a party-line 11-9 vote a Democratic  
alternative that sought to cut taxes by $290 billion over 10 years, 
reserving the rest of an estimated $996 billion non-Social Security 
surplus for Medicare and spending priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we ought to be doing here is trying to find a way to  
return as much of the surplus as possible to the people,'' said 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Committee made one significant change to the  
original bill by making the research and development tax credit 
sought by high-tech business permanent. It is usually renewed one 
year at a time.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Secrecy Needs Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- The need to protect grand jury secrecy  
and witness testimony outweighs the public's right to know more 
details of Orange County's $1.64 billion bankruptcy, the state 
Supreme Court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a unanimous ruling, which overturned an appeals court  
decision to release grand jury transcripts, the seven justices said 
that although the release of the documents may shed light on the 
role of a brokerage firm in the largest municipal insolvency in 
U.S. history, it would forever alter the grand jury process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whenever the media, or any member of the public, requested  
disclosure in a matter of public interest, the court would have 
authority to pierce the veil of grand jury secrecy based on a 
simple balancing test,'' the written ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, the court said, such requests ``for so fundamental  
a change in existing law is more appropriately addressed to the 
legislature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch, a chief broker and adviser to county officials,  
wanted to keep secret the testimony of its employees before a 
criminal grand jury that investigated the 1994 bankruptcy, saying 
disclosure could reveal personal information and discourage future 
grand jury witnesses from speaking candidly. 
</P>
<P>
	The criminal investigation ended in June 1997, with no  
indictments, when then-District Attorney Michael Capizzi agreed to 
accept a $30 million settlement from Merrill Lynch. The company 
later settled a civil suit filed by the county, accusing it of bad 
financial advice, for $437 million. 
</P>
<P>
	News organizations, including The Associated Press, sought the  
release of 5,000 pages of grand jury transcripts after the criminal 
investigation, saying they could contain information about 
responsibility for the bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch lawyers and 28 employees appealed lower-court  
rulings that ordered release of the transcripts, contending the law 
prohibits judges from releasing transcripts without an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court, in its opinion written by Justice  
Stanley Mosk, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the absence of an indictment, without the protections of  
the court process, the innocently accused and even witnesses are 
more vulnerable to a risk of adverse consequences ranging from 
reputational injury to retaliation,'' the ruling said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a prepared statement, Merrill Lynch said: ``We are pleased  
with the court's unanimous decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the ruling closes the Merrill Lynch matter, media  
attorney Karen Frederikson said the news organizations would now 
try to determine how to best approach legislators to change the 
existing law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the matter was of the utmost importance to the  
public in understanding what happened,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Daily Journal Corp. vs. Superior Court, S072133.

<HEADLINE> 25 Raise $100,000 Each for Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has a small army of foot soldiers out  
raising big money -- at last $100,000 -- for his bid for the 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief policy counsel for telecommunications company MCI, an  
entertainment executive who made a fortune on the Power Rangers 
phenomena and the governor of Puerto Rico were among 25 names 
released by the vice president's campaign office Wednesday of 
people who each have raised $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raisers have helped Gore take in $17.5 million during  
the first six months of the year, plus an additional $2 million for 
legal and accounting costs. The vice president has $9.4 million in 
the bank, giving him just $2 million more than Democratic contender 
Bill Bradley, who has $7.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has far  
outstripped the rest of the field, raising $37 million in the first 
six months of his campaign. Bush's campaign reported that 115 
people -- who earned the title ``Pioneers'' -- had brought in 
$100,000 for the governor's campaign, compared with 25 on Gore's 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore's $100,000-plus solicitors said they had little  
trouble finding donors to support his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that resonated the most is that people felt he was  
extremely competent to lead the country,'' said Chicago lawyer Joe 
Cari. On specific issues, donors were impressed with the way Gore 
has spoken about his family and with the vice president's 
experience with foreign affairs, Cari added. ``He's not somebody 
who is going to have to learn on the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rosello and New Jersey State Sen. Ray  
Lesniak were among the political officials helping the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington insiders include Jonathan Sallet, MCI's policy  
counsel, and Ernst &AMP; Young executive Jeff Hischberg. A number of 
media executives also have been soliciting for Gore. They include 
Haim Saban, chairman of Saban Entertainment, which produces 
live-action children's entertainment such as the Power Rangers; 
Sumner Redstone, chairman of Viacom Inc.; and Black Entertainment 
Television executive Robert Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	The list also includes several fund-raisers from Gore's home  
state of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Korge, a Miami lawyer and businessman, said even though  
Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, is the brother of the GOP 
front-runner, he has managed to raise $900,000 in the area south of 
Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't argue with the machinery the Republican Party, and  
particularly George W. Bush, has for raising money,'' Korge said. 
Nonetheless, he said he was ``ecstatic about the kind of response 
we've gotten in south Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Korge credited policies of the Clinton-Gore administration --  
such as empowerment zones in his region and restoration of the 
Everglades -- as helping galvanize support for the vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	About 98,000 people have contributed to Gore's campaign, with  
more than 80 percent of the donations in amounts of $200 or less, 
his campaign reported.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Railway Killer Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A grand jury today indicted suspected serial  
killer Angel Maturino Resendiz on a capital murder charge for the 
slaying of a Houston-area physician at her home last December. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they haven't made the final determination  
whether to seek the death penalty. Arraignment on the charge was 
set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury returned the indictment after about 45 minutes of  
presentations from prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. was among the  
prosecutors who filed into the grand jury room at a downtown 
courthouse annex this morning to secure the indictment in the 
slaying of Dr. Claudia Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have said fingerprint and other evidence link Maturino  
Resendiz with the crime. He already was charged with burglary of 
her home in West University, an enclave of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment came after about 45 minutes of presentation.  
</P>
<P>
	Assistant District Attorney Devon Anderson said it would not be  
decided for about a month whether to seek the death penalty. But 
when asked if there was any way this was not a death penalty case, 
she replied simply: ``No.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson said Maturino Resendiz would undergo a psychiatric  
evaluation to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Maturino Resendiz, 39, is already charged in four slayings, in  
Illinois, Texas and Kentucky. Police say evidence links him to five 
other Texas killings, including the December beating and stabbing 
death of Dr. Benton. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had charged Maturino Resendiz with burglarizing Dr.  
Benton's home but waited to pursue a murder charge until he was in 
custody and able to provide DNA samples. He remains held without 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say they found one of Maturino Resendiz's  
fingerprints in Dr. Benton's stolen Jeep, and jewelry associated 
with her was also recovered from his Mexico home. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials say similar evidence links Maturino Resendiz to the  
June death of Houston schoolteacher Noemi Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in three rural Texas counties where Maturino  
Resendiz is a murder suspect say they will let the Benton case 
proceed before moving forward. Prosecutors in Lexington, Ky., say 
they want to try him for the 1997 slaying of 21-year-old University 
of Kentucky student Christopher Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, prosecutors in Jackson County, Ill., say they will also  
seek to prosecute Maturino Resendiz for the June deaths of George 
Morber, 79, and his 51-year-old daughter, Carolyn Frederick.

<HEADLINE> Hazard Disclosure Moratorium OK'd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House agreed Wednesday to a one-year  
moratorium on the Internet dissemination of information about 
potential hazards at some 66,000 facilities using or making toxic 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	The House measure, approved without opposition, addresses law  
enforcement concerns that the information, aimed at helping 
communities prepare for worst-case accident scenarios, could be 
used by terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate last month approved a similar bill. Rep. Sherrod  
Brown, D-Ohio, said it was likely the Senate would accept the House 
version so that the legislation could be sent quickly to President 
Clinton for his signature. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1990 Clean Air Act required that plants dealing with toxic  
chemicals provide to the Environmental Protection Agency by June 21 
this year a Risk Management Plan including a worst-case scenario 
for accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA originally wanted to make much of that information  
public. But the FBI, the Justice Department and some members of 
Congress argued that detailing on the Internet possible disaster 
scenarios for each chemical plant or user poses a national security 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation requires that local safety officials still have  
access to the information. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said the administration would have a year to find ways to  
put the information on the Internet so that public interests are 
protected without giving terrorists a road map to potential 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalist groups opposed the moratorium, arguing that the  
potential danger to 85 million people living within five miles of a 
chemical facility outweigh the terrorist threat.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Home Products Corp. has reportedly paid  
more than $3 million to settle a lawsuit by a 70-year-old woman 
that linked her rare lung disease to the diet-drug combination 
fen-phen. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement in Ruth Burks' case, reported Thursday by the  
Dallas Morning News, is at least the 12th settlement by the 
pharmaceutical giant involving former users of fen-phen. The drug 
maker, based in Madison, N.J., faces more than 3,100 lawsuits 
nationwide related to health problems allegedly caused by its 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	An American Home Products spokesman could not immediately be  
reached by The Associated Press Thursday for comment. Mrs. Burks' 
lawyer, C.L. Mike Schmidt of Dallas, confirmed the settlement's 
existence to the Morning News but refused to discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products marketed fenfluramine and its chemical  
cousin dexfenfluramine until September 1997, when the U.S. Food and 
Drug Administration pushed for the drugs' withdrawal. Phentermine, 
the other drug used in the fen-phen combination, was not pulled 
from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper reported the settlement was more than $3 million,  
citing sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	The Burks settlement comes less than a month after American Home  
Products agreed to pay between $6 million and $7 million to settle 
a Harris County lawsuit linking a woman's death to fen-phen. The 
trial was the nation's first involving a patient who died after 
taking the product. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Burks took fen-phen from April 1996 to July 1997. Doctors  
diagnosed her with primary pulmonary hypertension, a potentially 
fatal lung disease, in April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Burks now lives in an assisted-living center in Tyler and  
receives medication intravenously through a chest catheter.

<HEADLINE> TWA Workers Ratify Labor Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Peace reigned Thursday at Trans World Airlines  
after the International Association of Machinists ratified an 
18-month labor agreement 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the 16,000 union mechanics, ramps workers,  
ticket agents and flight attendants will get double-digit pay 
raises, bringing them up to 90 percent of the projected industry 
wage standard by summer 2001. The contract takes affect Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement averts for at least 18 months a work stoppage that  
threatened to cripple the airline. Union spokesman Bob Haynes would 
not release the actual vote count or say how close it was. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased it passed,'' said Haynes said.  
</P>
<P>
	TWA officials were pleased as well. ``This is the green light we  
need to move ahead with our plans for the future,'' TWA president 
and chief executive William F. Compton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratification was no guarantee, and many workers angrily left  
union hall briefings earlier this month saying they were offended 
by the agreement and wouldn't vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
	But TWA officials called it their ``last, best'' offer and  
warned another strike could deal a fatal blow to the airline, which 
has been struggling over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of a work stoppage over the Fourth of July weekend  
translated into a dismal second-quarter earnings report, which the 
company released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA lost $6.2 million during the quarter, compared to a $19.5  
million profit in the year-ago period as cautious travelers chose 
to book elsewhere rather than risk long delays or cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company went through its second bankruptcy in 1995, and no  
major airline has ever endured three. A comeback seemed likely the 
following year, but an overly ambitious schedule expansion and the 
crash of TWA Flight 800 plunged the company back into the red.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Fall Sharply / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell sharply Thursday after Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted at another interest rate 
hike to contain inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 27/32  
point, or $8.44 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.96 percent, up from 5.88 percent 
late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 5/32 to 15/32 point, and intermediate maturities fell 3/4 to 
29/32 point, according to Bridge Telerate news service. 
</P>
<P>
	The selling picked up in the morning as Greenspan delivered his  
midyear report to Congress on the economy, warning that 
inflationary pressure persist. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan defended the central bank's recent interest rate  
increase, and pledged to move ``promptly and forcefully'' to raise 
rates again should inflation pressures intensify. Private 
economists said Greenspan's comments were a lot tougher than 
expected and increased the likelihood of further Fed rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were rose to 4.59 percent,  
while the discount rose to 4.47 percent, up 0.03 percentage point 
from late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields finished at 4.66 percent as the discount rose  
0.03 percentage point to 4.49 percent. One-year yields rose 4.97 
percent as the discount rose 0.05 percentage point to 4.72 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 percent from late Wednesday's 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 5/16 point to 119 9/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.50 percent, up from 5.48 percent late 
Wednesday.

<P>
	LAREDO, Texas (AP) -- Two investigators, a police officer and  
relatives of the county's top prosecutor were among 10 people 
indicted on charges of taking money to fix criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Indictments unsealed Thursday claimed the 10 men used the office  
of District Attorney Joe Rubio to extort money from defendants in

</P>
<P>
	All of the defendants were in federal custody Thursday. They  
face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubio, the district attorney for both Webb and Zapata counties,  
was not indicted. But Rubio's father, 70-year-old Jose Marcelino 
Rubio Sr., his brother, Carlos Manuel Rubio and a cousin, Jose

<HEADLINE> Yankees 5, Devil Rays 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bernie Williams hit a two-run homer, leading  
Andy Pettitte and the New York Yankees over Tampa Bay 5-4 Thursday 
for their 16th win in 17 meetings with the Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	New York won in its 15,000th game since entering the American  
League. The Yankees, formerly the Highlanders, are 8,451-6,463 with 
86 ties. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte (7-7), struggling for most of the season, won his  
second straight decision. He pitched into the seventh inning when 
the Devil Rays scored twice to make it 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte allowed four runs and six hits in six-plus innings. He  
walked four and struck out four. 
</P>
<P>
	Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth for his 26th save in 30  
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred McGriff hit a solo homer and an RBI double for the Devil  
Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' 15th homer gave the Yankees a 2-1 lead in the first  
inning. It came off emergency starter Rick White, who pitched when 
left-hander Wilson Alvarez was unable to work because of tightness 
in his triceps. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Rekar (6-6) took the loss. He allowed Paul O'Neill's RBI  
double in the fifth and two more runs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	McGriff gave the Devil Rays a 1-0 lead with his double in the  
first. He made it 2-all in the fourth with his 21st home run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees scored twice in the sixth on Joe Girardi's RBI  
single and Chuck Knoblauch's RBI grounder. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte walked the first two batters in the seventh. Reliever  
Mike Stanton allowed RBI singles to Miguel Cairo and Bobby Smith 
before Ramiro Mendoza struck out Bubba Trammell to end the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Tampa Bay's Wade Boggs failed to get a hit as a  
pinch-hitter, leaving him 14 hits shy of 3,000 for his career. ... 
The Devil Rays placed shortstop Kevin Stocker and third baseman 
Herbert Perry on the disabled list. Tampa Bay has used the DL 21 
times this season, tops in the majors. ... The Devil Rays played 
their season-best sixth straight errorless game. ... Pettitte is 
3-1 lifetime against the Devil Rays.

<HEADLINE> Exec Defends New Fox Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Fox programming chief Doug Herzog knows  
the network's racy new sitcom ``Action,'' a spoof of Hollywood, 
will offend some viewers. He's even advising some people to change 
the channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Watch somebody else's network for that hour,'' Herzog said.  
</P>
<P>
	But he said Fox is unapologetic about its decision to break the  
rules. Herzog is well-versed in the art; he moved to Fox from 
Comedy Central, home of the outrageous ``South Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Action,'' which stars Jay Mohr as an unscrupulous movie  
producer, features bleeped obscenities and ribald jokes about O.J. 
Simpson, sex and even a gag about an employee urinating in the Cobb 
salad of his boss. 
</P>
<P>
	It is ``definitely pushing the line a little bit,'' Herzog told  
the Television Critics Association summer gathering on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Action,'' a half-hour sitcom, debuts Sept. 16.  
</P>
<P>
	Fox also said it will air a two-hour special Aug. 3 on the  
upcoming ``Woodstock '99'' concert marking the 30th anniversary of 
the original festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The network also said that Johnathon Schaech (``That Thing You  
Do'') will be joining the cast of the new series ``Time of Your 
Life,'' a drama debuting in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The television critics meeting, with CBS, NBC, ABC and PBS set  
for next week, continues through Aug. 1.

<HEADLINE> More Security Needed at Capitol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a year after a gunman killed two police  
officers at the Capitol, police and lawmakers say more protection 
is needed for members of Congress and the 9,000 visitors who walk 
the halls each day. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings on July 24, 1998, were ``a wake-up call to  
police,'' said Officer Larry Schaefer of the Capitol Police, but 
some necessary safety improvements still have not been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer, a 14-year veteran of the force, is organizing a  
memorial vigil Friday to honor Officer Jacob J. Chestnut of Fort 
Washington, Md., and Detective John M. Gibson of Woodbridge, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Congress held a memorial service for the two  
officers and dedicated a plaque in their honor. It will hang near 
the East front of the Capitol, where Chestnut was shot. Gibson was 
shot a short distance away, near the office of House Majority Whip 
Tom DeLay. 
</P>
<P>
	Schaefer said Chestnut could have been better protected. ``He  
was the only officer at that door,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two officers were stationed at each entrance to the  
building Thursday. Capitol Police Spokesman Dan Nichols said 
officers must work overtime to ensure that level of security. 
</P>
<P>
	There were 1,076 officers on the Capitol force when the  
shootings occurred. The department now has 1,124 officers, and 
Congress has authorized the hiring of another 200, Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he acknowledged recruitment and training are slow-going.  
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., said he wants to know if a staff  
shortage or other problems led to last year's violence. Thomas, 
chairman of the Committee on House Administration, has asked for an 
update on the police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been one year since the tragedy occurred, and to date  
details about what happened and how it happened have not been 
forthcoming,'' he wrote in a letter to Sergeant at Arms James 
Ziglar. 
</P>
<P>
	Police are reluctant to talk about the case, Nichols said,  
because the man arrested, Russell Weston Jr., has not been tried. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge ruled that Weston, diagnosed as a paranoid  
schizophrenic, is incompetent to stand trial. He is being held at a 
federal prison medical facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichols and Thomas agree that a visitor's center outside the  
Capitol could enhance security. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea surfaced in 1991 and again in 1995. After the  
shootings, Congress approved $100 million for the project but has 
released just $2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman is redesigning the plan to  
meet security needs, but Congress still must decide who should 
oversee the project. 
</P>
<P>
	If built, the center would require visitors to go through a  
security check outside the Capitol. Visitors and staff now are 
checked inside entrances. Some tourists said they would be upset if 
it limited their access to Congress or created more lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, recent school shootings around the country have  
increased concerns among officers for large student groups escorted 
by members of Congress. Even young visitors are required to go 
through security checks, but representatives often request they be 
exempted from scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those people could bring anything in the building,'' Schaefer  
said. ``Who knows what's in their backpacks?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to more officers and a visitors' center, police said  
they also are awaiting new service weapons and better security 
cameras.

<HEADLINE> Europe Stocks Feel Inflation Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks ended lower Thursday after  
automakers suffered from a robust euro and Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan raised fears about renewed inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, speaking before the U.S. Congress, said the central  
bank remains worried that inflationary pressures could reemerge as 
unemployment continues falling. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments stoked immediate inflation fears, sending the  
German, French and British bourses into a further drop. Market 
commentators said those fears may offset any optimism about 
Europe's future, following the recent strength of the euro and a 
stronger-than-anticipated German economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 296 companies in  
countries having joined the single currency, ended down 2.98 
points, or 0.9 percent, at 322.18. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 590 European companies closed down  
1.7 points, or 0.6 percent, at 306.75. Technology and auto stocks 
were the worst performers, with a drop of 1.7 percent and 1.2 
percent in their respective indexes. 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers that fell included BMW, down 38 euros at 695 euros.  
Volkswagen closed down 1.60 euros at 56.70 euros, and 
DaimlerChrysler lost 1.30 euros to finish at 82.20 euros. The auto 
industry fell on concerns that exports could weaken, and imports 
into Europe rise on the back of a stronger euro. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks also suffered. Royal Philips Electronics  
closed down 7.6 percent after the company reported a 28 percent 
decline in second-quarter profits from ordinary operations. Philips 
said it was hurt by weakness in the semiconductor industry and flat 
sales in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses in technology and auto stocks were partially offset  
by gains in media shares. The Dow Jones Stoxx Media Index was the 
best performer of the day with a 1.2 percent gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index finished down 36.35 points at  
3,762.34, while the DJ Stoxx 50 Index ended down 31.93 points at 
3,727.21. 
</P>
<P>
	In domestic markets, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index closed down 1.4  
percent, the Paris CAC-40 index ended 0.3 percent lower, and 
London's FTSE 100 index closed down 0.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Helsinki's HEX index was the worst performer, losing 2.4  
percent with shares of Nokia down 2.25 euros at 86.50 euros.

<HEADLINE> Jousting Over Internet Addresses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration threatened anew  
Thursday to end its lucrative contract with the company that 
assigns and manages most of the world's Internet addresses. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for the Commerce Department warned that the government  
will end its exclusive deal with Network Solutions Inc. unless the 
company reaches agreement with the new non-profit organization 
taking over management of many of the Internet's technical 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we hit a stone wall, we've got to do it another way,'' Andy  
Pincus, Commerce Department general counsel, said during a 
congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pincus, sensitive to the uncertain impact the move could  
have on the stability of the Internet, cautioned that negotiations 
were continuing. ``I don't think we're up against the wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In what's become a tumultuous power struggle affecting the  
increasingly critical Internet, the government is in the midst of 
turning over management to the California-based Internet 
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or ICANN, which the 
government helped organize. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1992, Virginia-based contractor Network Solutions has  
coordinated the Internet's most important functions and registered 
more than 5 million addresses with the ``com'', ``net'' and ``org'' 
suffixes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current plans, Network Solutions ultimately will compete  
with others assigning the world's Internet addresses -- which each 
cost $35 annually to license -- but it alone will continue to 
maintain the world's master list of those addresses, called its 
registry, which lists more than 5 million addresses with these top 
three suffixes. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's chief executive officer, Jim Rutt, also testifying  
before a House Commerce subcommittee, bristled at the suggestion 
that the government could replace his company as the one 
controlling the Internet's all-important registry, which he said 
belongs to Network Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe they have the legal right to do so,'' Rutt  
said. But he added later that the groups were ``all working in good 
faith to get there. I really do think we'll get there, and it will 
be soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pincus originally warned in a letter earlier this month that  
Network Solutions could lose its responsibilities over the 
registry, but he acknowledged such a move ``would be extremely 
destabilizing for the Internet and therefore quite harmful to its 
development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Network Solutions dropped Thursday by $5.38, down  
nearly 7 percent, although it also announced record net revenue of 
$47.5 million for the second quarter, ending June 30. It was the 
company's 11th consecutive quarter of rising profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans organized Thursday's hearing to question ICANN about  
some of its policies. ICANN has held closed-door meetings and 
previously announced plans to charge companies and consumers $1 for 
each Internet address they register. 
</P>
<P>
	ICANN's interim chairwoman, Esther Dyson, sought to assuage  
lawmakers by promising to defer the controversial fund-raising 
plan. She also promised that to open ICANN's August meeting to the 
public, but not necessarily future meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also disclosed a March 31 e-mail from ICANN's  
lawyer, Joe Sims, in which Sims had urged a Justice Department 
lawyer, Chris Kelly, ``to increase the level of pressure'' on 
Commerce officials negotiating to force Network Solutions to work 
closely with ICANN.

<HEADLINE> USDA: Idle Land To Help Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Agriculture Department on Thursday gave  
its support to a congressional effort to aid financially strapped 
farmers by paying them to take more land out of production. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all recognize the farm crisis that's going on with these  
low (commodity) prices today,'' said Thomas Grau, USDA's deputy 
undersecretary for natural resources and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers have proposed adding millions of acres to the  
Conservation Reserve Program, under which 30 million acres 
nationally are now idled. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding the 14-year-old program would require lifting an  
acreage cap and relaxing enrollment restrictions intended to limit 
the program to environmentally sensitive land that's prone to 
erosion or adjacent to water. 
</P>
<P>
	But Grau, testifying before a House farm commodities panel, said  
USDA wasn't ready to endorse the scope of legislation that would 
allow as much as 45 million acres to be enrolled in the program. 
The expansion would cost taxpayers up to $500 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers like the program because of the guaranteed income it  
gives them, and it's also popular with hunters and conservation 
groups because of the habitat it provides for ducks, pheasants and 
other game. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 14-year-old program has taken so much land out of  
production in some areas that it's blamed for forcing many rural 
businesses to close. 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding the program would take money that could be used to  
help farmers in other ways, said Texas Rep. Charles Stenholm, the 
House Agriculture Committee's senior Democrat. ``The question is 
the scarce use of funds,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress provided $6 billion in emergency assistance to farmers  
last year and is expected to spend that much or more this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm-state Democrats in the Senate, led by Tom Harkin of Iowa,  
are seeking $10 billion in aid. The National Farmers Union this 
week asked for nearly $17 billion. And the American Farm Bureau 
Federation has proposed $9 billion in assistance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking at a 3-year period where it's going to be  
difficult to raise a crop and recover your costs,'' said Rep. Earl 
Pomeroy, a North Dakota Democrat who supports expansion of the 
land-idling program. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA has had to turn away many farmers who wanted to put land in  
the program but couldn't meet the enrollment standards, Grau said. 
Unless Congress lifts the acreage limit, USDA can't add more than a 
million acres of land a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers are required to keep the land out of production for 10  
years. In return they receive annual payments that average, 
nationwide, $45 an acre.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Face Brazil and Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) -- U.S. players know it will be tough to  
advance from a first-round group that includes Brazil and Germany, 
even though their opponents left their best players at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been playing very well,'' midfielder Cobi Jones said  
Thursday, two days before the Americans' Confederations Cup opener 
against New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
	``W we continue to play strong and try to impose our game on  
other teams,'' he said. ``Maybe we can come out with a victory 
against Brazil, even against Germany. How realistic that is, I 
don't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans beat Brazil 1-0 last year in the Gold Cup and  
blanked Germany 3-0 in February during an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	But in games that count, the Americans haven't come close to  
those soccer powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not an unsophisticated soccer country anymore,'' coach  
Bruce Arena said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. players said even if they don't beat Brazil and Germany,  
just playing against some of the best teams in the world will make 
them better as they prepare for next year's start of qualifying for 
the 2002 World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we're growing,'' said forward Brian McBride, one of  
the few bright spots at last year's World Cup in France. ``It's 
always good to play good talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States opens Saturday against New Zealand, the  
weakest team in the group. It goes on to play Brazil on July 28 and 
Germany two days later. The top two teams advance to the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's be honest with ourselves,'' goalkeeper Brad Friedel  
said. ``Brazil is arguably the best team in the world. To beat them 
we have to be our best.''

<HEADLINE> Smoltz To Start for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Atlanta Braves right-hander John Smoltz threw for  
10 minutes before Thursday's game and said he's ready to come off 
the disabled list and start Saturday at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like I can do the necessary things you have to do to  
win,'' said Smoltz, who has spent four stints on the disabled list 
the past two seasons because of soreness in his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz was unhappy with a pitching session Wednesday, saying he  
had too much discomfort and not enough control. The workout 
Thursday went better, although not pain-free. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could be in a body cast for two weeks and it's not going to  
change anything,'' he said. ``Throughout this process I'm going to 
have good days and bad. That's what I have to deal with. I never 
know until I throw.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Braves need the 1996 Cy Young Award winner. They lead the NL  
East but went into Thursday night's game against Florida with a 
five-game losing streak, their longest since September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz is 8-3 with a 3.49 ERA, but the one-time workhorse has  
been limited to 15 starts and 95 1-3 innings. He said he'll have no 
pitch limit Saturday, but the outing will likely be abbreviated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get caught up in thinking I have to go seven  
or eight innings,'' he said. ``I can't allow myself to look past 
going four or five.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smoltz, 32, was on the disabled list from May 15 to June 1, went  
3-2 in his next seven starts and then returned to the disabled list 
July 6. He also was on the disabled list twice in 1998, when he 
went 17-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Before that, Smoltz was among baseball's most durable pitchers.  
He has exceeded 225 innings for the Braves six times in this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pay me to pitch,'' Smoltz said. ``There have been a bunch  
of playoff games and situations where I probably shouldn't have 
pitched if I was truly looking for a 20-year career. I probably 
cost myself 20 to 30 losses through the course of my 11 years just 
based on that attitude. But it has made me the pitcher I am.''

<HEADLINE> CSX Sells Sea-Land International Biz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- CSX Corp. plans to sell Sea-Land Service  
Inc.'s international liner business to A.P. Moller-Maersk Line for 
$800 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined services will be marketed under the name  
Maersk-SeaLand, the companies said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The operation and management will be fully integrated, drawing  
on the best from both organizations,'' said Ib Kruse, partner of 
A.P. Moller. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes about 70 container vessels, about 200,000  
containers, related container terminals and certain lease 
obligations from CSX. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not include Sea-Land's domestic container shipping to  
and from Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Guam, or terminal 
facilities in Hong Kong and several other locations, which will 
remain under CSX ownership, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	A.P. Moller's container line, Maersk, is the world's largest  
shipping container company. Kruse said that Maersk has worked 
Sea-Land since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``When it's all under one heading, we can make a better company,  
we can have a better product and we can have lower prices,'' Kruse 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	For CSX, the deal is an ``opportunity to enhance shareholder  
value and refocus our maritime resources on our well-positioned 
domestic container shipping business and terminal management 
operations,'' chairman and CEO John W. Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale also will allow CSX to focus its resources on its  
takeover of Conrail, Snow said. Since CSX and Norfolk Southern 
Corp. assumed control of Conrail's routes in June, problems and 
mix-ups have plagued both companies, causing delayed shipments, 
clogged rail crossings and customer complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal should be finalized in about four months, the companies  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maersk Inc., with headquarters in Madison, N.J., is the parent  
entity to 10 U.S.-affiliated companies engaged in a variety of 
activities, including trucking, terminal services, third-party 
logistic services and government contracting. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX Corp., based in Richmond, Va., operates the largest rail  
network in the eastern United States and provides intermodal and 
contract logistics services. In 1998 CSX earned $537 million on 
revenue of $9.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	A.P. Moller Group, with headquarters in Copenhagen, is engaged  
in shipping, exploration for and production of oil and gas, 
shipbuilding, aviation and other ventures. It has more than 40,000 
employees and offices in about 100 countries.

<HEADLINE> Orange Co. Documents Kept Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Merrill Lynch won a legal battle to keep  
secret the grand jury records in a criminal investigation of Orange 
County's 1994 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	California Supreme Court barred disclosure of the documents in a  
unanimous decision Thursday, after finding that state law requires 
judges to keep secret all testimony to a criminal grand jury unless 
an indictment is issued. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling overturned lower-court decisions that would have made  
public the records of the county grand jury's probe into the role 
of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., a chief broker and financial adviser to 
county officials. 
</P>
<P>
	News organizations, including The Associated Press, had argued  
that state law allows judges to disclose records of the grand 
juries they supervise, if the information would be in the public 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's contrary ruling shows the need for changes in the  
law, said Karen Frederiksen, a lawyer for the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is entitled to know how its criminal justice system  
is working,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Merrill Lynch, joined by 28 of its employees, had argued that  
disclosure of the transcripts could reveal personal information and 
discourage future grand jury witnesses from speaking candidly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased with the court's unanimous decision,'' the  
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Orange County's $1.64 billion bankruptcy was the largest  
municipal insolvency in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury's criminal investigation ended in June 1997, with  
no indictments, when then-District Attorney Michael Capizzi agreed 
to accept $30 million in settlement money from Merrill Lynch. The 
company later settled a civil suit filed by the county, accusing it 
of bad financial advice, for $437 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge David Carter, who supervised the grand  
jury, granted news organizations' requests for 5,000 pages of 
transcripts, saying they could illuminate the causes of the 
bankruptcy and address public suspicions that the firm had bought 
its way out of the investigation. An appellate court upheld Carter 
but was overruled by the state's high court. 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion written by Justice Stanley Mosk said the  
longstanding law requiring grand jury secrecy is based on 
legitimate concerns about the privacy and safety of witnesses and 
the reputations of innocent people under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that an indictment is followed by public court  
proceedings in which defendants can try to clear their names. But 
with no indictment or legal protections, ``the innocently accused 
and even witnesses are more vulnerable to a risk of adverse 
consequences ranging from reputational injury to retaliation,'' 
Mosk said. 
</P>
<P>
	If a district attorney's settlement raises suspicions, that is a  
matter for the state attorney general, who oversees all county 
prosecutors, said Mosk, a former attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Daily Journal Corp. vs. Superior Court, S072133.

<HEADLINE> SWAC: Black Coaches Target in Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Con artists have scammed black coaches out of  
$100,000 and may be out for more, Southwestern Athletic Conference 
Commissioner Rudy Washington said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington warned black coaches in a press release about the  
scam involving a fake story about a nephew in need of emergency 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to get people to understand that they're doing this  
across the country,'' he said. ``It's widespread but we don't know 
how widespread. He's making a ton of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western Union, which handled the wired transactions, along with  
the NCAA and the FBI, has been unable to do anything to stop the 
scam, Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the money is sent, it can be picked up at any location in  
the United States without producing identification, Washington 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Someone posing as Washington called at least 15 coaches telling  
them about a nephew who needs money. The coaches were told the 
caller was on an airplane and needed money wired to a specific 
destination. Coaches were told the money would be returned to them 
when the plane landed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the caller never sent the money back.  
</P>
<P>
	The names of NFL Hall of Fame tight end Kellen Winslow, NBA  
player's union head Billy Hunter and Washington have been used. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Wasserman, a spokesman for the NBA players union, confirmed  
that Hunter's name was used, but said he couldn't say which coach 
had been asked for money. 
</P>
<P>
	The caller, posing as Hunter, said he was traveling by plane in  
Los Angeles. The coach found out he had been scammed after calling 
Hunter's office to verify the money was received. 
</P>
<P>
	``Billy was incredulous,'' Wasserman said. ``He couldn't believe  
that anyone would stoop so low to get money from these people. He 
sincerely hoped that no one would be damaged as a result of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Washington claims the same type of incident has happened dozens  
of times and coaches across the country have lost about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, the coaches picked up on the scam but others sent  
money in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't call law enforcement because it hasn't happened to  
me,'' Washington said. ``You're looking at dozens of people losing 
money on this same scheme.''

<HEADLINE> Drug May Help Stroke Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brain damage caused by stroke was reduced by  
half in laboratory tests of an experimental drug that someday may 
offer hope for the 500,000 Americans who suffer strokes each year. 
</P>
<P>
	In mouse experiments, the new drug appeared to stop two brain  
cell-killing reactions that usually follow a stroke caused by a 
blocked blood vessel, said Dr. David Pinsky, a researcher at the 
Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the study will be published Friday in the journal  
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a stroke, there is an immune system reaction that acts  
like a cluster bomb attack in the brain,'' said Pinsky. One type of 
immune cell kills neurons directly, while other cells cause 
inflammation that can slow blood flow to the stroke area and injure 
still more cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of these actions cause ``collateral damage,'' killing  
neurons that may not have been involved in the original stroke, 
said Pinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The new drug molecule appears to at least partially block both  
of these stroke reactions and significantly limit the collateral 
damage to the brains in mice who had been artificially induced to 
have strokes, said Pinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Pan Ganguly, a researcher at the National Heart Lung and  
Blood Institute, said the Pinsky study ``is an important piece of 
work'' that could lead to a new way to treat strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that ``after a stroke, the damaging process can continue  
for quite a while,'' and finding a drug to stop this process is 
``an important advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ganguly cautioned the drug, so far, has been studied only in  
animals and that it may be a long time before its benefits are 
proven in human patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a lot of reservations about this drug, but it is  
a novel approach in an area where we desperately need new 
therapeutics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Heart Association, about 500,000  
Americans suffer strokes annually. Also called ``brain attacks'', 
strokes kill about 150,000 Americans each year and are the third 
biggest cause of death behind heart disease and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. There are  
about 4 million American stroke survivors, many of whom have 
difficulties with speech, walking or caring for themselves. The 
direct and indirect annual cost of strokes has been estimated at 
about $41 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Strokes caused by vessel blockage, ischemic strokes, are often  
treated now by drugs called ``clot busters.'' These dissolve clots 
that cause strokes when they block the flow of blood and oxygen to 
brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky said the drug he is studying has a different function  
than the clot busters and the two drugs, in theory, would be used 
together to limit stroke damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a stroke, the researcher said, nearby neurons are  
often damaged. They respond to the damage by showing a molecule, 
called C1q, on the cell surface. This triggers a type of immune 
response, called complement, and activates a type of cell called 
the microglia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microglia are responsible for basically consuming debris or  
injured cells,'' said Pinsky. Following a stroke, the microglia 
will kill the injured neurons that might otherwise survive, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complement process, he said, ``sets off a cascade'' that  
includes inflammation of nearby vessels. This reduces blood and 
oxygen flow to nearby neurons. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky said the new drug blocks microglia from attacking damaged  
neurons and prevents the inflammation of nearby vessels.

<HEADLINE> Report: VA Wastes $1 Million a Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stuck with old, decrepit hospitals and serving  
a declining population, the Department of Veterans Affairs is 
wasting up to $1 million a day on unneeded medical facilities, 
congressional investigators report. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office report was highly critical of the  
VA's proposal to fix the system, contending vested interests that 
might balk at closing facilities would be given too much control. 
</P>
<P>
	Among these groups, the GAO said in a report obtained Wednesday,  
are medical schools, unions, veterans' organizations and state 
veterans agencies. They will be part of local committees that 
would, under current plans, choose their own leadership rather than 
allowing the VA to run the process, the investigators reported. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, medical schools might be reluctant to change  
long-standing business relationships with veterans hospitals, and 
unions could be reluctant to support staffing reductions, said the 
report, obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO, Congress' investigative agency, suggested using  
full-time VA planners or consultants with ``no vested interests in 
the geographic area'' to recommend changes in facilities, in 
consultation with the other groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The VA health care system's past experience suggests that the  
system now contemplated ``could result in a protracted 
decision-making process that continues the expenditure of scarce 
resources on unneeded buildings'' -- already totaling up to $1 
million a day, said the report, by Stephen P. Backhus, the GAO's 
veterans' health care export. 
</P>
<P>
	Backhus' report said the interest groups involved in the  
restructuring ``may have vested interests in maintaining the status 
quo.'' He added, ``In our view, this arrangement could lead to 
conflict among the various stakeholders sitting on the committees 
if they attempt to protect their interests at the expense of the 
overall process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans Affairs spokeswoman Laurie Trantner said in response,  
``We recognize that the current health care delivery costs money 
and there's a potential for savings. We are working cooperatively 
with the (congressional) committees to reach a solution that will 
benefit veterans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said committees to be formed to help change the system  
``will balance local interests and national priorities that will 
serve local veterans' needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report was prepared for Rep. Terry Everett, R-Ala., chairman  
of the House Veterans Affairs subcommittee on oversight and 
investigations. He said the agency must address ``findings that one 
in four veterans' health care dollars'' is spent on operating and 
maintaining facilities that include ``empty old buildings and 5 
million square feet of vacant space.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said experts have described the VA health care system as  
``archaic, decrepit, dysfunctional and inefficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The backdrop for the wasted spending is a VA hospital system  
that dropped from 49,000 patients a day in 1989 to 21,000 in 1998, 
with nearly half the decline occurring in the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of VA hospitals is further expected to ``decline  
significantly over the next 20 years,'' as the veteran population 
drops from the current 25 million to an estimated 16 million by 
2020, said the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The GAO gave the VA credit for beginning, in 1995, to transform  
itself from a hospital operator to a health care provider that 
relies on community-based medical and residential facilities and 
outpatient services. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the report said that over the next two  
decades, most VA health care buildings will approach or pass their 
useful life expectancy. More than 40 percent have already operated 
for more than 50 years, including almost 200 built before 1900.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Close Al Aqsa Mosque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Muslim clergymen closed Islam's third holiest  
shrine Thursday after Jewish extremists called for the expulsion of 
Muslims from the hill that once held the ancient Jewish Temple, 
Judaism's most sacred site. 
</P>
<P>
	Israeli police arrested three members of the outlawed anti-Arab  
Kach group early Thursday after they distributed leaflets near the 
Al Aqsa Mosque compound, calling on Jews to ``expel the strangers 
from the Temple Mount.'' The three were later released. 
</P>
<P>
	Police issued statements published in Palestinian newspapers  
Thursday promising that Jewish extremists would not be allowed into 
the mosque area. Police apparently hoped to prevent possible 
Palestinian demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates to the compound known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or  
Noble Sanctuary, were shut this afternoon. The mosque area is 
located on the site of the second Jewish Temple, which was 
destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70 
</P>
<P>
	Israel is in overall control of Jerusalem, including the holy  
sites. Under arrangements dating back to Israel's capture of the 
area in the 1967 Mideast war, the Waqf, the Muslim religious 
council, administers the mosque area. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerusalem police commander Yair Yitzhaki expressed displeasure  
with the Waqf decision to close the compound. The Waqf issued no 
statement, but the compound was likely to reopen by Friday noon, 
the most important Muslim prayer session of the week and the time 
the sanctuary attracts the largest crowds . 
</P>
<P>
	Some Jewish extremist groups believe the Al Aqsa and Dome of the  
Rock mosques should be razed to make way for the rebuilding of the 
Temple. But most observant Jews believe the structure will be built 
only with divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a semiannual tradition, one extremist group, the  
Temple Mount Faithful, made an attempt Thursday to enter the gates 
of the compound on the Ninth of Av, the day marking the destruction 
of the two ancient temples. 
</P>
<P>
	Police blocked the 30 demonstrators, including a few American  
Christian evangelists, who chanted mournful prayers and waved 
Israeli flags. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here to bless Israel and to support it,'' said Miriam Lee  
of Buena Vista, Ga. ``According to the Scriptures, this mount is 
Jewish land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some evangelical Christians believe the rebuilding of the Temple  
will hasten the Second Coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	Yitzhaki said the police decided not to let the group onto the  
Temple Mount after the Kach members distributed the leaflets. 
</P>
<P>
	Jews are allowed to visit the compound and pray, but only  
silently and in small groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The Haram as-Sharif hill overlooks the Western Wall, the holiest  
site to Jews and the last remnant of the Second Temple compound. 
Dozens were killed in Israeli-Palestinian clashes in the area in 
1990 and 1996 as part of disputes over the holy sites.

<HEADLINE> House Rejects Democrats' Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans moved toward passage today  
of a 10-year $792 billion tax cut package after defeating a 
Democratic challenge that would have sharply scaled it back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic substitute, defeated 258-173, would have provided  
about $250 billion in tax cuts through marriage-penalty relief, tax 
breaks for education and health care and the permanent extension of 
a research and development tax credit sought by high-tech 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote represented a critical test of support for the GOP  
plan, which had been in doubt Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who has also endorsed a cut of about $250  
billion, repeated that the GOP plan was far too large and he would 
veto it. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, at an appearance in Lansing, Mich., said the GOP plan  
would fail to pay down the debt or add to the life of Social 
Security and Medicare ``and I will veto it if it passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a House hearing it  
is more important to pay down the national debt than cut taxes. 
Reducing the debt, he said, would lower interest rates and put the 
government's books in better shape to meet the rising retirement 
demands of the Baby Boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the House Ways and  
Means Committee, said Democrats were ``fighting ferociously to keep 
the money of the workers of America in Washington. ... We believe 
the people know best how to spend their money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one Republican, Rep. Greg Ganske of Iowa, voted for the  
Democratic alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was brought to the floor Wednesday night, only after  
daylong negotiations during which House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., with his leadership at stake, succeeded in bringing 
rebellious GOP moderates in line. 
</P>
<P>
	His triumph could be short-lived. Clinton, saying the tax cuts  
are three times larger than what he could accept, said he would not 
allow them to become law. The 211 House Democrats were solidly 
against the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate version approved by the Senate Finance Committee  
Wednesday, while adding up to the same $792 billion, takes a 
different approach to tax reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The threatened desertion of GOP moderates who thought the tax  
cut was excessive was averted only after the House leadership 
agreed to a concession conditioning the planned 10 percent 
reduction in income tax rates over the next 10 years to annual 
progress in reducing the nation's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Other elements of the legislation, including a reduction in the  
capital-gains tax, elimination of the estate tax and relief from 
the marriage penalty, were not affected by the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill highlights the stark differences between  
Republicans and the White House over how to manage a projected $2.9 
trillion surplus over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Democrats want to use most of the surplus to  
ensure the future of Social Security and Medicare and add a 
prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. They also want 
to set aside part of the annual surpluses for increases in defense 
and education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Wednesday, Clinton said the GOP tax bill  
would ``squander'' the surplus and represented ``the kind of 
risk-taking that got us into deficits before.'' He issued his 
strongest veto threat yet, but said he would sign ``the right kind 
of tax cut'' of roughly $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is wrong,'' Hastert said in a written statement.  
``It is not risky to give the American people their money back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the choice is simple. ``We can give some of the surplus  
back to the people or we can spend it here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House distributed a statement today from 50  
economists, including six Nobel laureates, who say they are 
advising policy-makers against big tax cuts like those under 
consideration in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``A massive tax cut that encourages consumption would not be  
good economic policy,'' they said. ``An ever-growing tax cut would 
claim government resources just when the aging of the population 
starts to put substantial stress on Social Security and Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued as Clinton traveled to Lansing, Mich.,  
to push his Medicare overhaul plan.. 
</P>
<P>
	The first stage of the debate on the bill, starting after 10  
p.m. Wednesday and going past midnight, was heated and highly 
partisan. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., spoke of ``rhetorical 
terrorism ... designed to scare seniors, children, teachers and the 
needy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., showed a photo of a Marine scavenging  
for furniture and said Republicans couldn't find the money for 
better military pay but ``you've got $400 billion for the fat cats, 
the guys who write the $1,000 checks to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans needed near-total unity to win passage. They command  
a narrow 222-211 majority, with one independent who usually votes 
with the Democrats. Passage requires 218 votes. A 219-208 
procedural vote to advance debate on the bill went almost 
completely along party lines, with only two Republican defections -- 
Ganske and Rep. Connie Morella of Maryland.

<HEADLINE>  China Bans Meditation Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China banned a popular meditation sect today  
after three days of massive protests, intensifying a crackdown on a 
group Chinese leaders see as a serious threat to their rule. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban, reported by state media, accused Falun Gong of  
spreading ``superstitious, evil thinking'' to undermine social 
stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came after three days of protests by as many as  
30,000 people in dozens of Chinese cities over the arrest of about 
70 leading sect members. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong, or the Wheel of Law, was founded in 1992 by Li  
Hongzhi, a former government clerk who now lives in the United 
States. The Chinese government estimated at one point that it had 
up to 70 million followers. By comparison, the ruling Chinese 
Communist Party has 60 million members. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong doctrines mix martial arts with ideas from Buddhism  
and Taoism. Its leaders have argued that the sect, not the 
Communist Party, has the answers to make China a more stable, moral 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	With discontent widespread over unemployment and stagnating  
incomes, Chinese leaders are worried that independent groups could 
challenge their rule. Beijing has been cracking down on dissent in 
the months before the 50th anniversary of the founding of the 
People's Republic of China on Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders have regarded Falun Gong with suspicion since  
more than 10,000 members gathered April 25 in a silent, daylong 
protest around the Beijing compound where President Jiang Zemin and 
other Chinese leaders live and work. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said it was protesting harassment by the government.  
</P>
<P>
	State television today called that demonstration the most  
serious incident since the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. Those 
pro-democracy demonstrations ended in a bloody military attack that 
killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Falun Gong Research Society conducted illegal activities,  
spreading superstitious, evil thinking to blind people, to stir up 
trouble and sabotage social stability,'' said the announcement 
carried by the official Xinhua News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	State media accused Falun Gong of causing deaths and serious  
injuries among its followers. State television said some members 
died after refusing to take medicine, believing Falun Gong leaders 
had healed them. 
</P>
<P>
	After announcing the ban, state television aired a 30-minute  
documentary about Falun Gong. It included footage that appeared to 
have been shot clandestinely at Falun Gong functions, and its 
elaborate production indicated that Chinese leaders had been 
preparing the crackdown for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong members, many of them middle-aged women, often meet  
in parks to meditate and do yoga-like exercises. Some devotees say 
Li's teachings make people healthier and more moral. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are good people. How can good people be criminals? Why do  
we have to endure such persecution?'' said a message posted on the 
sect's Web site Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the crackdown, Li postponed a visit to Taiwan to lead  
meditation sessions, said his Taiwan liaison, Hung Chi-hung. He 
said Li also was concerned about recent tensions between Taiwan and 
the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	The assault on Falun Gong began with the arrest Tuesday of  
leading members in Beijing and other cities, according to the sect 
and human rights groups. They said police seized Falun Gong 
literature and smashed images of Li, the sect founder. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Tuesday evening, as many as 30,000 members have held  
silent, peaceful protests in Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and as 
many as 27 other cities, according to the Hong Kong-based 
Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in 
China. The report could not be confirmed independently. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing, protesters who gathered Tuesday and Wednesday  
outside the Zhongnanhai leadership compound were taken away by 
police. Today, hundreds of protesters gathered on a street about 
500 yards away. Police herded them onto buses and took them away, 
punching and kicking a handful who resisted. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, a group of seven protesters carried a banner  
outside the Xinhua office demanding the release of jailed Falun 
Gong members and hung a poster on the door criticizing the 
crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate announcement today, the Chinese Communist Party  
ordered its members not to take part in Falun Gong. It told them to 
``draw a clear ideological line of demarcation with Falun Gong, and 
expose the problems of Falun Gong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Party said it would expel members who still practiced Falun  
Gong's beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	A state newspaper hinted today at the involvement of foreign  
provocateurs in Falun Gong. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should remain highly vigilant against a few international  
forces that are trying to push power politics,'' the Science and 
Technology Daily said.

<HEADLINE>  Sean Elliott Needs New Kidney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Doctors don't rule out Sean Elliott returning  
to the San Antonio Spurs after he gets a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	Though such a comeback would be unprecedented, it doesn't mean  
it can't happen, physicians say. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a possibility that he could resume his career,'' said Dr.  
Francis Wright, kidney transplant director at the Texas Transplant 
Institute of Methodist Healthcare System, where Elliott may have 
the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott and his doctors revealed Wednesday the kidney disease,  
which has afflicted the 31-year-old forward for years, has worsened 
and that he needs a transplant soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Family members underwent blood screening this week to see if  
they qualify as kidney donors. If there is no family match, Elliott 
will be placed on a transplant waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I end up finding a match, I'll be lucky. I'll be  
fortunate,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 42,000 people nationwide are awaiting kidney  
donations. Last year, there were 5,791 donors nationally, including 
live and deceased donors, according to the National Kidney 
Foundation of South Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott learned of his condition after about four years in the  
league. His disease is known as focal segmental glomerular 
sclerosis, one of a variety of kidney diseases that result in 
severe, prolonged loss of protein into the urine. The cause of his 
disease is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Reineck, a kidney specialist seeing Elliott, said if it  
isn't treated, the illness could lead to exhaustion, weakness, 
nausea and weight loss. However, he said, Elliott has ``an 
excellent long-term prognosis for living a normal life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The doctor said Elliott hopes to have the transplant before  
dialysis is necessary, which could be later this year. Elliott 
could have a transplant as soon as August if a family match is 
found. The main criteria for a match is a compatible blood type, 
doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott's illness affects both his kidneys. The healthy donor  
kidney would be placed in Elliott's body along with the two 
malfunctioning kidneys, his doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
	It would likely be 2-3 months after surgery before doctors know  
whether a return to basketball is feasible, Reineck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great career, and if that's the end of it, so be  
it. But I don't really think that's the end of it,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	After surgery, transplant recipients typically take 6-8 weeks to  
gradually return to regular activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``As to playing basketball at the NBA level, that's clearly  
unprecedented. For someone as talented and dedicated as Sean 
Elliott, I would be the last person to tell him he couldn't play 
basketball,'' Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Lauren McDonald, a kidney specialist at the Mockingbird  
Dialysis unit in Dallas, described the possibility of Elliott 
resuming his NBA career as ``fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't say good or outstanding because the medicine  
regiment for someone who has a transplanted organ is very 
complicated and could have side effects that would prevent him from 
functioning at his peak athletic performance,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclist Lance Armstrong, currently leading the Tour de France,  
has been an inspiration to athletes and others facing major medical 
problems, Wright said. Armstrong, of Austin, battled back from 
testicular cancer that spread to his brain and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees pitcher David Cone, who threw only the 14th perfect game  
in modern baseball history Sunday, did so after recovering from a 
blood clot in his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga, sidelined since  
being diagnosed with back cancer in February, plans to complete 
radiation treatments early next month then join the Braves for 
workouts. He expects to play in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Hogan barely survived a head-on car collision with a bus in  
1949 that shattered his legs and caused blood clots. He went on to 
win the U.S. Open a little more than a year later. Hogan died in 
1997 at age 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott overcame knee injuries to turn in a strong performance  
in the 1999 season. He averaged 11.9 points in the playoffs, 
helping the Spurs win their first NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	His game-winning 3-pointer with nine seconds left in a pivotal  
Western Conference finals game against Portland was the shot of his 
career. Balancing on its tiptoes, Elliott barely stayed in bounds 
as he shot the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, who hung his head and appeared sad  
during Wednesday's news conference, said his main concern is 
Elliott's health. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, people will have an even greater respect for what  
this young man has done given the circumstances under which he had 
to do it,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	As word of Elliott's condition spread, fans called the Spurs  
offices, television stations and the National Kidney Foundation to 
ask whether they could be kidney donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers were referred to Methodist Hospital and University  
Hospital for possible screenings, foundation spokesman Roland Parga 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is touching a lot of people in our area, and I'm sure  
across the country,'' Parga said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a 10-year veteran, said he believes he will play again.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd rather go out the way I want to go out,'' he said. ``I  
think every athlete feels that way.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Off 37.04; Nasdaq Down 56.74 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned lower today as Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress the Fed is prepared to ``act 
promptly and forcefully'' at the first hint of inflation dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 37.04 at 10,965.74. Early gains evaporated as soon as 
highlights of Greenspan's testimony began circulating. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 13.75 at 1,365.54, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was off 56.74 at 2,705.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Fed raised interest rates last month in a bid to stave  
off inflation, stocks have rallied to new records, helped along by 
strong corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Greenspan was not expected to offer any hints of further  
rate increases, as recent economic barometers have shown virtually 
no signs of inflation. But he told Congress that while 1999 has 
been an exceptional year for the American economy, the central bank 
remains poised to fight any inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more threatening to markets, Greenspan said he remains  
worried about the high valuations of U.S. stocks in light of the 
continued growth of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted,  
perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity 
prices to levels that are unsupportable,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said they were reluctant to take major new positions  
until Greenspan completed his remarks. Bond prices plummeted, 
sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 5.97 percent, up 
from 5.9 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony drew Wall Street's focus away from the  
continuing stream of corporate earnings. The robust earnings season 
continued, but investors held to their pattern of selling stocks 
once their strong earnings are on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online fell 3 11/16 to 111 3/8 after reporting late  
Wednesday that its earnings nearly tripled in its fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com plunged 14 13/16 to 110 5/8 after surprising Wall Street  
with the prospect of steeper losses in future quarters. The online 
retailer Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss that matched 
analysts' estimates, and said it will spend heavily to expand its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-6 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 342.85 million 
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 4.56 at 642.92, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 7.30 at 799.51.

<HEADLINE> Jobless Claims Rise by 4,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for  
unemployment benefits rose for the second week in a row last week 
to its highest level in more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that 313,000 Americans filed new  
claims for jobless benefits for the week ending July 17 -- up by 
4,000 from the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second consecutive increase in weekly jobless claims  
after two back-to-back declines and left the claims at their 
highest point since June 5 when they were at 326,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-week moving average for claims, which smooths out  
week-to-week volatility, also was up, to 305,500. That was the 
highest level since June 26 when it was at 307,250. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's increase was a little higher than many economists  
had been expecting, but still kept claims at a level indicating 
that the nation's job market remains exceptionally healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	For the month of June, the nation's unemployment rate crept up  
to 4.3 percent, still near a 29-year low. Even with the increase in 
the jobless rate the nation's businesses added a sizeable 268,000 
new jobs to their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said today that for the week ending July  
10, 40 states and territories reported increases in jobless claims, 
while 11 had decreases. The state data lag a week behind the 
national figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest increase in applications for jobless  
benefits was Michigan, up 19,355, an increase officials blamed on 
layoffs in the automobile industry as companies prepare for new 
models. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with large increases were: New York, up 8,756;  
Indiana, up 8,072; Kentucky, up 5,933; and North Carolina, up 
3,746. 
</P>
<P>
	The state with the biggest decrease was California, down, 6,093,  
a decrease officials attributed to fewer layoffs in the service 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Other states with big decreases were: Missouri, down 2,941;  
Massachusetts, down 2,655; New Jersey, down 2,630; and Maine, down 
896.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks, Dollar Drop / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's key stock average closed almost 3 percent  
lower today after a selloff by foreign investors. The dollar 
declined against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 527.18 points,  
or 2.89 percent, closing the day's trading at 17,730.34. On 
Wednesday, the average closed down 275.06 points, or 1.48 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.44 yen in late-afternoon trading, down  
0.56 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its late New York 
level of 118.10 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices fell in afternoon trading amid  
selling by foreign investors worried that a weaker dollar may hurt 
Japanese exporters, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 41.09 points, or 2.79 percent, to 1,459.02 
at the end of trading. The TOPIX closed down 15.89 points, or 1.05 
percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the dollar lost ground amid speculation its  
slide below 120.00 yen suggests Japan now accepts a slightly 
stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's central bank has intervened in recent weeks to prevent  
gains by the yen, prompting U.S. complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	But Japanese leaders have said they believe excessive yen  
appreciation undercut a budding economic recovery in 1993, and are 
seen as unlikely to acquiesce to any significant rise in their 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains by the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while reducing the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved slightly higher in Tokyo today, bolstered by  
the stock market plunge and interbank buybacks of dollars for fear 
of possible intervention by the Bank of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign investors took profits on stock holdings and sold yen  
for dollars, supporting the U.S. currency, a dealer at a European 
bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 124.06 yen in  
late-afternoon, below its level of 124.48 yen late Wednesday in 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Tokyo's bond market posted gains once stocks started  
heading lower, as some dealers shifted out of stock futures and 
into bond futures, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond was 1.7100 percent in late-afternoon trading, below the 
closing yield of 1.7500 percent the day before. This pushed its 
price up to 100.77 yen from 100.43 yen on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Time-Shares Shun Some Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Resorts in this popular vacation city have  
long offered discounted theme park tickets to get tourists to 
listen to sales pitches for time shares. It's just that not 
everyone is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	``No single Brazilians'' and ``No Portugal'' warns a document  
from the Palms Resort &AMP; Country Club that was obtained by The Wall 
Street Journal. An accompanying list of some 130 qualified 
countries, including Swaziland and Vanuatu, advises: ``If a country 
is not on this list, please call!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time-share resorts pay solicitors a commission for each person  
or group that shows up for a tour. Tourists are often invited to 
sit through a 90-minute sales pitch at a time-share resort in 
exchange for theme park tickets, gift certificates or cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists who qualify can get theme park tickets that normally  
cost about $45 per person for as little as $12.50. 
</P>
<P>
	A solicitor sheet from the Cypress Pointe Resort lists ``not  
accepted'' countries as Israel, Pakistan, Turkey, India and people 
originally from India who live in the United States. Other 
qualifications are based on income, marital status and gender and 
age. 
</P>
<P>
	Debbie Newton, manager of fair housing investigations for the  
Florida Department of Human Relations, said any practices that 
discriminate on the basis of a person's country of origin may 
violate state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you treat people differently based on their national origin  
... that's unlawful,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some developers defend the practice.  
</P>
<P>
	David Siegel, who runs Central Florida Investments, an Orlando  
time-share company, said anybody is welcome to tour his resorts but 
only those from desirable countries will be given the bargain theme 
park tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 150,000 families at our resorts, and I think we  
probably have owners from every single walk of life, every 
religion, every race,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when you're spending the kind of money that you have to  
spend to get people to tour your resorts, and giving out these 
expensive gifts, then you have to be selective,'' he said. ``Or go 
out of business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson for Orlando-based Sunterra Corp., which owns  
Cypress Pointe Resort, said the company in May faxed a statement to 
its resorts telling them ``not to base any decisions on race, 
color, national origin'' or any other status that could be 
discriminatory.''

<HEADLINE> Petranoff in First Pan Am Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- Tom Petranoff is a nonconformist.  
Always has been, always will be. 
</P>
<P>
	When the former world record-holder in the javelin was at the  
prime of his career, he left the United States and went to live in 
South Africa for 9 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Petranoff returned in December 1997 and now thinks he can  
resurrect javelin throwing in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At 41, an age when most track and field athletes are retired, he  
will compete in the Pan American Games for the first time. Next 
year, he believes he'll be a cinch to make his third Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
	`I'm competing in Winnipeg because I've seen that, bought that,  
done that, but I've never been in the Pan Am Games,'' the wildly 
outspoken Petranoff said. ``I'm having fun, trying to bond with 
javelin throwers from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not thinking about the money any more. It's a country  
thing. We need more of that, just like the soccer World Cup with 
the U.S. women and China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petranoff probably had more fun years ago, when he was younger,  
friskier, bolder and the best javelin thrower in the world. After 
having been at the top of his profession during the mid-1980s, he 
figured his javelin career was over in 1993 when he stopped 
competing. That was only two years after having thrown his 
career-best of 292 feet, 6 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``After 17 or 18 years of throwing, it was time to kick back,  
drink some beer and develop a waistline,'' he said. ``I didn't even 
train for five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By 1998, Petranoff had ballooned to 260 pounds and was  
completely out of shape. That didn't stop him from competing in the 
U.S. Masters Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized I could still throw,'' Petranoff said.  
</P>
<P>
	He threw well enough to begin a comeback among the elite  
throwers. He noticed that javelin throwing in the United States had 
declined terribly. There was room for him to break through. 
</P>
<P>
	He was right.  
</P>
<P>
	His comeback, fueled by a 20-pound weight loss, culminated in a  
second-place finish at last month's USA Championships and a spot on 
the U.S. team for the Pan Ams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had trained only one hour a day and that was only my fourth  
meet,'' Petranoff said. ``You have to train three hours a day, five 
days a week, and I have to get down to 225 pounds. That would be my 
best fighting weight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's about what he weighed when he was No. 1 in the world and  
competed in the 1984 and 1988 Olympics. He missed the 1980 Olympics 
when the U.S. boycotted the Moscow Games because of Russia's 
intervention in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years later, he was the favorite at the Los Angeles  
Olympics ``and choked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His first two throws in the qualifying round were fouls and his  
third fell short of advancing Petranoff to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here it was the biggest meet of my life, before about 102,000  
fans,'' he said. ``In the third round, I come up and the crowd gets 
real quiet. Then, I see myself on the big screen across the 
stadium. I felt like I was throwing at myself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put a lot of painful pressure on myself.''  
</P>
<P>
	The pressure got to him.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, he broke some teeth and injured his jaw during a fall  
down a hill a few weeks before the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost 15 pounds recovering from that,'' said Petranoff, who  
again failed to make the final. ``That was a disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Barcelona Games, he lost his shoe contract, then  
headed to South Africa. He wanted to lend support to a country that 
was barred from the Olympics because of its apartheid policy. After 
leaving, he was barred for six years by the International Amateur 
Athletic Federation. The banishment lasted until South Africa was 
readmitted to the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Africa, Petranoff lived in Saneton, a suburb of  
Johannesburg, a wealthy area that reminded him of southern 
California. The crime rate became so bad -- ``three of my neighbors 
were killed in carjackings,'' he said -- that Petranoff was so 
afraid for his wife and four children that he left. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he is living in Cranston, R.I.,, working with juvenile  
delinquents, coaching javelin throwing, buying and selling the 
implement, and trying to convince youngsters to compete in the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never a dull day in my life,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Never was, never will be.

<HEADLINE> Americans Win One Gold on First Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It was the worst of beginnings for the  
U.S. team. No gold medals in five canoe-kayak races, the first 
events at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, a false start by the men's foursome in the final race  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The false start increased the tension,'' said Justin Piasecki,  
``but we were able to get off strong and settle into the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They settled so well that the first American gold came in the  
men's kayak 1,000, with a crew of Stein Jorgensen, John Mooney, 
Peter Newton and Piasecki finishing nearly three seconds ahead of 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping some of our teammates would have the honor of  
being the first U.S. gold medal of the Pan Ams,'' Mooney said, 
``but it felt good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did the bronze medal behind Canada and Cuba in the women's  
kayak 500 for Kathy Colin, Tamara Jenkins, Julia Sorzano and 
Alexandra Harbold. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be competing in the first women's event of the Pan Am Games  
and to win the first medal for the U.S. was really neat,'' Colin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other canoe-kayak winners were from Argentina and Cuba. Overall,  
Argentina and Canada won two golds and Cuba had the most medals, 
five. 
</P>
<P>
	The action on Lake Minnesdosa has no bearing on the Olympics for  
the United States. But the Pan Am Games serve as a qualifier for 
the 2000 Olympics in 11 disciplines: baseball; softball; men's and 
women's field hockey; rhythmic gymnastics; men's and women's team 
handball; triathlon; men's water polo; and equestrian show jumping 
and three-day event. Badminton participants will also receive 
points toward qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new events at these games are eight women's sports:  
women's soccer, weightlifting, shooting, pole vaulting, hammer 
throw, modern pentathlon, water polo and beach volleyball. The new 
men's event is beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's schedule is busier, with competition in canoe-kayak,  
soccer, water polo and volleyball. The American men play Cuba and 
the women face Costa Rica in soccer. In volleyball, the U.S. women 
take on favored Cuba, and in water polo, it's the American women 
again Puerto Rico and the men vs. Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	One sport in which the United States should fare well is  
gymnastics. Although the team is young -- the oldest woman is Alyssa 
Beckerman, 18 -- it should win several medals, particularly in 
women's events. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pan Am Games over the years have been a great experience  
and opportunity for U.S. gymnastics,'' women's coach Mary Lee Tracy 
said. ``In the 1995 group in Argentina, there were many of our team 
members who were then in the Atlanta Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official opening is Friday night, with 3,400 performers and  
three production numbers scheduled for the ceremony at Winnipeg 
Stadium. The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and Royal Winnipeg Ballet 
will be featured in a celebration of the city as the ``Heart of the 
Continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 5,100 athletes representing 42 nations are on hand.

<HEADLINE> House Set To Vote on Tax Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans, their ranks precariously in  
line, were cautiously confident today of winning passage of a 
10-year, $792 billion package they say rewards Americans in the new 
age of budget surpluses. President Clinton again denounced the 
measure as too big and promised a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is time, I believe, to honor our most fundamental values,  
not tax them,'' Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Calif., said as debate 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton, at an appearance in Lansing, Mich., said the GOP  
plan would fail to pay down the debt or add to the life of Social 
Security and Medicare ``and I will veto it if it passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a House hearing it  
is more important to pay down the national debt than cut taxes. The 
latter course, he said, would lower interest rates and put the 
government's books in better shape to meet the rising retirement 
demands of the Baby Boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was brought to the floor Wednesday night, only after  
daylong negotiations during which House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., with his leadership at stake, succeeded in bringing 
rebellious GOP moderates in line. 
</P>
<P>
	His triumph could be short-lived. Clinton, saying the tax cuts  
are three times larger than what he could accept, said he would not 
allow them to become law. The 211 House Democrats were solidly 
against the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate version approved by the Senate Finance Committee  
Wednesday, while adding up to the same $792 billion, takes a 
different approach to tax reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The threatened desertion of GOP moderates who thought the tax  
cut was excessive was averted only after the House leadership 
agreed to a concession conditioning the planned 10 percent 
reduction in income tax rates over the next 10 years to annual 
progress in reducing the nation's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Other elements of the legislation, including a reduction in the  
capital-gains tax, elimination of the estate tax and relief from 
the marriage penalty, were not affected by the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill highlights the stark differences between  
Republicans and the White House over how to manage a projected $2.9 
trillion surplus over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Democrats want to use most of the surplus to  
ensure the future of Social Security and Medicare and add a 
prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. They also want 
to set aside part of the annual surpluses for increases in defense 
and education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Wednesday, Clinton said the GOP tax bill  
would ``squander'' the surplus and represented ``the kind of 
risk-taking that got us into deficits before.'' He issued his 
strongest veto threat yet, but said he would sign ``the right kind 
of tax cut'' of roughly $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is wrong,'' Hastert said in a written statement.  
``It is not risky to give the American people their money back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the choice is simple. ``We can give some of the surplus  
back to the people or we can spend it here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House distributed a statement today from 50  
economists, including six Nobel laureates, who say they are 
advising policy-makers against big tax cuts like those under 
consideration in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``A massive tax cut that encourages consumption would not be  
good economic policy,'' they said. ``An ever-growing tax cut would 
claim government resources just when the aging of the population 
starts to put substantial stress on Social Security and Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued as Clinton traveled to Lansing, Mich.,  
to push his Medicare overhaul plan.. 
</P>
<P>
	The first stage of the debate on the bill, starting after 10  
p.m. Wednesday and going past midnight, was heated and highly 
partisan. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., spoke of ``rhetorical 
terrorism ... designed to scare seniors, children, teachers and the 
needy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., showed a photo of a Marine scavenging  
for furniture and said Republicans couldn't find the money for 
better military pay but ``you've got $400 billion for the fat cats, 
the guys who write the $1,000 checks to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans needed near-total unity to win passage. They command  
a narrow 222-211 majority, with one independent who usually votes 
with the Democrats. Passage requires 218 votes. A 219-208 
procedural vote to advance debate on the bill went almost 
completely along party lines, with only two Republican defections -- 
Greg Ganske of Iowa and Connie Morella of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP tax cut would be the largest since President Reagan's in  
1981 and would be phased in gradually over the next decade. It 
includes a 10 percent cut in all income tax rates, gradual repeal 
of estate taxes and the alternative minimum tax, cuts in 
capital-gains taxes and relief from the ``marriage penalty'' 
affecting millions of two-income couples. 
</P>
<P>
	The shape of the package could change significantly as it moves  
through the Senate and, against a background of the veto threat, is 
subject to House-Senate negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate bill lacks the 10 percent across-the-board cut. It  
omits capital gains tax cuts and estate tax repeal and includes 
more expansions of individual retirement accounts and pensions.

<HEADLINE> Baby Bells Profit From Wireless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp.'s second-quarter revenues  
grew 18 percent, with core telephone profits meeting expectations 
and the wireless PCS group posting a smaller-than-expected loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which split itself into two businesses late last  
year, earned $386 million, or 44 cents per share, from the new FON 
group of traditional calling operations and some newer ventures. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched most Wall Street forecasts and compared with  
last year's second-quarter profit of $364 million, or 41 cents per 
share, from the same operations before the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the FON group totaled $4.24 billion, up 7.3 percent  
from the year-ago period's $3.95 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Sprint PCS wireless group posted a second-quarter loss  
of $555 million, or $1.25 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss, reflecting expenditures of $450 million to expand the  
PCS digital network, compared with a loss of $153 million, or 98 
cents, in last year's second quarter, but was smaller than the loss 
of $1.28 a share many analysts were expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	The wireless group's second-quarter revenues totaled $736  
million, up from $265 million a year ago, before the purchase the 
remaining ownership interests in Sprint PCS held by 
Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS ended the quarter with nearly 4 million customers, a  
gain of 617,000 for the three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sprint PCS continues to lead the wireless industry with record  
subscriber growth for three consecutive quarters,'' said William T. 
Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the FON and PCS groups, Sprint's overall revenues for  
the quarter were $4.93 billion, up from $4.19 billion in the same 
period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, stocks  
representing both groups retreated amid a steep downturn across the 
market. Shares of FON group closed down $1.56 1/4, or nearly 3 
percent, at $51.62 1/2, while shares of the PCS group were down 
$2.56 1/4, or 4.4 percent, at $55.43 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Within Sprint's core operations, calling volume for the nation's  
third-largest long distance company rose 24 percent compared with 
the second quarter of 1998, while long-distance revenues rose 10 
percent to $2.67 billion. Local-calling revenues increased 5 
percent to $1.38 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint credited two of its residential calling plans -- Sprint  
Sense AnyTime and Sprint 1000 -- for the growth in residential 
long-distance customer minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, Sprint FON Group earned $792  
million, or 90 cents per share, compared to $716 million, or 81 
cents per share, from the same operations a year ago. Revenues rose 
7 percent to $8.42 billion from $7.84 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS Group's six-month loss totaled $1.18 billion, or  
$2.70 per share, compared to $812 million, or $1.95 cents per 
share, in the first half of 1998. Revenues increased to $1.34 
billion from $468 million.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Proposes Methadone Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an effort to improve treatment of heroin  
addiction, the government proposed Thursday that methadone clinics 
undergo the same type of medical accreditation as other health care 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, the Food and Drug Administration would end  
its 30-year program of inspecting clinics that dispense methadone, 
a narcotic that helps blunt the effects of heroin withdrawal. Such 
inspections don't focus on patients' quality of care, just that 
clinics perform certain steps. 
</P>
<P>
	In its place, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  
Association would establish standards for doctors, pushing them to 
improve patients' treatment but giving them flexibility to 
customize care. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors will have to ``understand more about their unique  
patients and make sure the patient is engaged in the treatment 
plan,'' explained SAMSHA's Dr. Westley Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal does not replace the Drug Enforcement  
Administration's separate regulation of methadone. 
</P>
<P>
	Methadone has some of the same physiological effects on the  
brain as heroin, but without the ``high'' that addicts crave. 
Scientific studies suggest methadone treatment can lead to 
decreased drug use and less criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	But methadone clinics are scarce and have long waiting lists.  
The government estimates there are 810,000 heroin addicts, but only 
138,000 to 170,000 are treated at the nation's 900 methadone 
clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the scarcity is partly due to doctors' reluctance to  
deal with overlapping federal agencies as well as a patchwork of 
state laws that restrict its use. 
</P>
<P>
	The public has 120 days to comment on the proposal before the  
government decides whether to finalize it.

<HEADLINE> Excerpts of Reagan Letters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from some of the 276 letters Ronald Reagan sent to  
Lorraine Wagner from 1943 to 1994. They were provided by Mrs. 
Wagner and Steven S. Raab Autographs: 

</P>
<P>
	``Janie is still a pretty sick girl, but I'm still hoping that  
things will be different when she gets over the nervousness, so 
don't listen to things you hear, please. I know she loves me, even 
though she thinks she doesn't ... . Keep your fingers crossed for 
me.'' -- Jan. 8, 1948, on marital problems with Jane Wyman. 

</P>
<P>
	``I'm under contract to them for just one picture a year, they  
decided I wasn't a very big drawing card, and are afraid to risk 
giving me good parts.'' -- Sept. 21, 1949, on losing his contract 
with Warner Bros. 

</P>
<P>
	``The aim of welfare should be to salvage people and make them  
able to take care of themselves. ... In America today there are 458 
different welfare and poverty programs, and the only result seems 
to be more people on the dole, not less. -- May 31, 1968. 

</P>
<P>
	``You know I've always resented the radical kids spoiling the  
Churchill V for Victory sign by their use of it as an anti-Vietnam 
gesture.'' -- Dec. 29, 1969. 

</P>
<P>
	``I also share your frustration about Watergate. I have to tell  
you it is not hard for me to accept that this could have gone on 
without the President's knowledge ... If my staff wanted to keep 
something of this kind from me, it would be very easy for them to 
do so.'' -- June 22, 1973. 

</P>
<P>
	``(President Jimmy) Carter disturbs me more than a little. I  
have a deep-seated feeling that he is a real phony.'' -- Oct. 26, 
1976. 

</P>
<P>
	``My interrogation on the Poindexter case was at worst a few  
hours of boredom. I had to say `I can't recall' to so many 
questions -- like what I did on November 26, 1986. I was tempted 
several times to reply by asking the lawyer, `Where were you three 
years ago last Friday?' But I didn't.'' -- March 4, 1990, on his 
deposition in the Iran-Contra case. 

</P>
<P>
	``I'm with you with regard to women serving in combat in the  
military. I'm against it ... I think our men today are better 
soldiers if they are fighting in defense of our women.'' -- April 1, 
1991. 

</P>
<P>
	``I am grateful for your friendship through the years.'' -- June  
20, 1994, his last letter to Mrs. Wagner.

<HEADLINE> Taylor Happy But Haunted by Demons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Hall of Fame inductee Lawrence  
Taylor is as happy as he has been in years and at peace with 
himself, yet says he still has to fight a daily battle with drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The demons come up every day,'' Taylor, 40, said Thursday  
during a news conference to discuss his induction into the Canton, 
Ohio, shrine on Aug. 7. ``You do the best you can with it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The person who says they have it under control and he knows  
exactly what is going to happen, really doesn't know what the hell 
he is talking about,'' the former New York Giants linebacker said. 
``I have it under control today and, hopefully, I'll have it under 
control tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's off-the-field problems, which included two drug-related  
arrests after his retirement in 1993, were his biggest obstacle to 
being voted into the Hall of Fame in January. Several didn't vote 
for the man considered the prototype for the modern linebacker 
because of it. Taylor later criticized them, calling them ``old 
phonies'' not fit to judge him. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview at Giants Stadium on Thursday, Taylor said he  
has mellowed since the vote and is becoming excited as his 
induction gets closer. 
</P>
<P>
	After saying he didn't want to pressure former coach Bill  
Parcells to attend, Taylor later said the current New York Jets 
coach should be there. Parcells would have to skip a day of 
training camp to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor admitted that he has been afraid to call Parcells because  
he had promised his former coach he would be the one presenting him 
at the induction. 
</P>
<P>
	That honor has gone to Taylor's teen-age son, T.J., who asked  
for the job. Taylor gave it to him so he would not have to choose 
between Parcells and Giants owner Wellington Mara, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a wide-ranging interview, Taylor said he realized he was the  
best player in the league in 1982, his second in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be cocky but I felt I was a man playing with  
boys,'' Taylor said. ``I really did, because the things I felt I 
could do naturally, people were in awe of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The North Carolina product said he never worked out in the  
offseason, but that he compensated by being in great shape during 
the season and understanding opposing offenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even today, nobody could play an offensive scheme that I could  
not defend,'' said Taylor, who admitted he at times drew defensive 
plays on the field on the spur of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 13 seasons with the Giants, Taylor had 132 1/2 sacks, 1,088  
tackles, 33 forced fumbles, 10 fumble recoveries and nine 
interceptions. The 10-time Pro Bowl selection led New York to two 
Super Bowl championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``A coach used to say there were four or five times in a game  
where you have situations that dictate the momentum or outcome of 
the game,'' Taylor said. ``You have to be able to recognize those 
situations and make a play during them. That's what I did and 
that's why I was considered a great player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor said his proudest moments with the Giants were the Super  
Bowl titles. He said the first over Denver in January 1987 was fun 
and the defeat of Buffalo in January 1991 more precious because the 
team was not expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we were supposed to be there,'' Taylor said.  
``We weren't actually the best team in the league but we played the 
best as a team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, who is in bankruptcy court, doesn't miss playing  
football except for the big checks. The only time he gets excited 
is during the playoffs when he dreams of making big plays and 
winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Elected in his first year of eligibility, Taylor will be  
inducted with running back Eric Dickerson, tight end Ozzie Newsome 
and guards Tom Mack and Billy Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor plans to show his game face.  
</P>
<P>
	``You got a better chance of hitting the lottery than seeing me  
cry,'' Taylor said. ``I'll tell you now, if I cry you can come up 
and spank me.''

<HEADLINE> New York Named Best Sports City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudy Giuliani has suspected this for some  
time and on Thursday the Sporting News confirmed it, selecting New 
York as the best sports city in America for 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani, who held a City Hall celebration for David Cone's  
perfect game and welcomed the women's World Cup championship team 
this week, proudly accepted the award for his town, which moved up 
from No. 7 a year ago when Detroit was No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether it's the world championship Yankees or this year's  
Knicks appearance in the NBA Finals, New York City's sports teams 
keep New Yorkers rooting throughout the year and make our city home 
to the world's greatest sports fans,'' Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Home to major and minor league baseball, professional  
basketball, football and hockey, New York City has it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sporting News studied every city in the United States and  
Canada that has a major league baseball, NFL, NBA, NHL, NCAA 
Division I basketball or football team, or a baseball or football 
training camp and then ranked them according to several criteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, we've tried to reward quality over quantity in our  
annual rankings,'' said Sporting News managing editor Bob Hille. 
``But New York gave its fans both over the past 12 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hille cited the Yankees' record 125-win season in 1998, the Jets  
reaching the AFC championship game, the Knicks in the NBA Finals, 
St. John's making the NCAA tournament's final eight and the New 
Jersey Devils having the second-best regular season record in the 
NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas-Fort Worth was second, followed by Denver, Atlanta and  
Philadelphia. Then Boston, Detroit, Oakland-San Francisco-San Jose, 
Los Angeles-Anaheim and Miami-Fort Lauderdale completed the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland was picked as the best baseball city, Green Bay the  
best for pro football, and Knoxville, Tenn., best for college 
football. The pro basketball nod went to San Antonio, with Durham, 
N.C., picked as best for college basketball, and Toronto best for 
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	Last place on the list of 351 cities went to Honolulu, where the  
climate is great but, according to the Sporting News, the sports 
aren't.

<HEADLINE> Family Bids Farewell to JFK Jr. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- Family members watched mournfully from  
the deck of a Navy destroyer Thursday as a brass quintet played a 
hymn and the ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister 
were cast into the sea, consigned to the depths where they died. 
</P>
<P>
	A flag was lowered to half-mast as about 15 mourners, some  
wearing black and flanked by sailors in dress whites, gathered on 
the stern of the USS Briscoe. The dead were returned to the sea 
along with three wreaths two miles from the spot where Kennedy's 
plane crashed last Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very simple, but very solemn,'' said the Rev. Louis  
Iasiello, a Navy chaplain who assisted the Rev. Charles O'Byrne in 
the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Byrne presided at JFK Jr.'s wedding nearly three years ago,  
and was to preside over the private family memorial Mass at Church 
of St. Thomas More in New York on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sun was out, it was a beautiful day,'' Iasiello said.  
``Everything was very quiet and tranquil and peaceful ... It added 
to the solemnity of the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six members of the clergy sat at the rear of the ship, taking  
turns at a podium reading scripture and prayers. About 300 members 
of the crew stood by silently. 
</P>
<P>
	The destroyer spent about half an hour nearly motionless in the  
hazy sunshine off Martha's Vineyard for the service, led by 
Kennedy's sister, Caroline, and mother-in-law. Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy and JFK Jr.'s cousins William Kennedy Smith and Maria 
Shriver were also there. 
</P>
<P>
	At least two people appeared to rise and speak. A Navy honor  
guard also was on hand to fire a rifle volley for the two women and 
the young man who at age 3 raised a famous salute to the casket of 
his assassinated father. Flags were presented to the families. 
</P>
<P>
	A brass quintet from the Newport Navy Band played ``Eternal  
Father,'' a Navy hymn, when the ashes were committed to the sea, 
Iasiello said. The quintet also played ``Abide With Me'' and ``For 
All the Saints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prayers and scriptures were read from the Book of Wisdom,  
including the passage: ``The souls of the just are in the hands of 
God, and no torment shall touch them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony, held the morning after the bodies were brought up  
from the ocean floor, provided a quick ending to the six-day 
national vigil that began when Kennedy's plane vanished. 
</P>
<P>
	The service was conducted in private, about five miles off  
Martha's Vineyard, amid orders that planes keep five miles away. 
Boats were allowed no closer than a mile. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., who died on the way to his cousin's wedding, was laid  
to rest on his grandmother Rose's birthday. He was returned to the 
waters where he enjoyed sailing, kayaking and swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic Church allows cremation, though burial is  
still the preferred practice. U.S. bishops forbid the scattering of 
ashes at sea; an urn containing the full set of remains must be 
placed into the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Iasiello would not say what practice was followed for JFK Jr.,  
38, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 
34. 
</P>
<P>
	Other memorials were to follow.  
</P>
<P>
	About 1,000 people crowded into a Catholic church in New York's  
Little Italy neighborhood Thursday night for a public memorial 
organized by the city's Irish community. Bagpipe music played and 
mourners sang hymns and listened to scripture read in Gaelic. 
Another 3,000 people waited outside. 
</P>
<P>
	The private Mass to be held Friday was to be attended by  
President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. A family source said 
Sen. Kennedy would deliver a eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also planned an observance Friday aboard the  
aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy. A private memorial for Lauren 
Bessette is planned at an Episcopal church in Greenwich, Conn., on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, hundreds gathered on Cape Cod near the Woods Hole  
harbor to catch a glimpse of the mourners boarding the Coast Guard 
boat that took them to the Briscoe. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kennedy family drove past hundreds of well-wishers,  
including children who threw wildflowers on the motorcade. Some of 
those who lined the main road carried signs of sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our prayers are with you all,'' read a sign held by Glen  
Rogers of Falmouth, who brought his two children to watch the 
motorcade pass. The sign, drawn with blue marker, also depicted a 
cross and an angel. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said he personally approved  
requests by Sen. Kennedy and the Bessette family for the use of the 
Briscoe, which had been conducting training operations off 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was piloting his single-engine Piper Saratoga from New  
Jersey on Friday night when it dropped from radar 16 1/2 miles from 
Martha's Vineyard Airport. Flight data showed the plane dropped 
precipitously after Kennedy took a right turn away from the 
Vineyard, and aviation experts said he may have been disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
	The medical examiner determined all three died instantly.  
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage, including a section of fuselage with the  
instrument panel, will be examined in Cape Cod. It will be six to 
nine months before the accident's cause is determined, said James 
Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	On Gay Head Beach, overlooking the spot where the wreckage was  
found, residents erected a 4-foot cross made of driftwood and 
lashed together with wild grapevines. The names John-John, Carolyn 
and Lauren were etched into each arm of the cross. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather Rynd, 52, who helped make the cross, said: ``JFK Jr.  
stands for something I carry in my heart politically, emotionally 
and spiritually.''

Thursday as George W. Bush's chief fund-raiser in Maine, saying he 
didn't want to become a distraction after inquiries were made about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't want to be any baggage. Young Bush doesn't have  
to justify why I was trying to help him,'' Richard E. Dyke, owner 
of Bushmaster Firearms in Windham, Maine, told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke's company makes automatic weapons for government agencies,  
semiautomatics that are sold to the public and a rifle widely used 
in shooting competition. 
</P>
<P>
	His company was one of nine makers of assault weapons that a Los  
Angeles police officer has sued after the officer was wounded in a 
shootout with bank robbers armed with such weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke said he called Don Evans, the Bush campaign's national  
finance chairman, to quit after about two months as finance 
chairman in Maine for the Texas governor's GOP presidential 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took the job as finance chairman because I helped other  
people in the Republican Party and want to help Bush,'' Dyke, who 
has been active in Maine politics for years, told The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke, 65, argues that gun makers shouldn't be held liable for  
the illegal use of their products if the company broke no laws in 
making or marketing them and has dismissed as ``window dressing'' 
efforts to mandate child safety locks on guns. His company's 
catalog also refers to the 1994 federal ban on some assault weapon 
sales to civilians as ``infamous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation was announced shortly after an AP reporter  
called the campaign to inquire about Dyke's position. Dyke said a 
similar inquiry had been received by the campaign on Wednesday, 
prompting him to rethink his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``I heard something yesterday about a concern that he had a gun  
manufacturer as a finance chair. If that disenfranchises me as a 
citizen to participate in the process, that's what it is,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke said he has given Bush $1,000. Campaign spokeswoman Mindy  
Tucker said $45,000 has been raised in Maine -- although some of the 
contributions predated the campaign's appointment of Dyke. 
</P>
<P>
	As the GOP front-runner, Bush has found himself at odds with gun  
control advocates. The Texas governor signed legislation this year 
barring cities in his state from suing gun makers for the costs of 
violence on their streets. He also has said he would have vetoed 
legislation defeated by the House that would have required a 
24-hour background check on weapons sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Democrats wanted a longer waiting period, arguing that 25  
hours was not enough time in some cases to complete the checks. 
They joined with some Republicans to defeat the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in a month the background of one of  
Bush's supporters has become an issue. Last month, it was revealed 
that a host of a Bush fund-raiser in Florida was a businesswoman, 
Remedios Diaz Oliver, who pleaded guilty in a tax evasion case. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said he wasn't aware that Dyke was a weapons manufacturer  
when he was named chief fund-raiser for Maine. He declined to 
speculate whether the businessman would have received the 
appointment if his background was known. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke ``called me and told me he was aware there was some inquiry  
of his ownership and in no way did he want to be a distraction to 
the governor,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyke's company's automatic rifles are similar to the military's  
M-16. The firm has advertised its sale of civilian guns that the 
ads say were modified to get around ``the infamous'' 1994 ban on 
some types of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bushmaster's 1999 catalogue has a page of pictures and  
descriptions of banned weapons that ``are still found at gun shows 
though they are now out of production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Dyke was quoted as saying that child safety  
locks that Congress was looking at mandating would be ``window 
dressing'' since they would only be sold with the guns, not 
attached to the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Bushmaster and other other manufacturers of automatic weapons  
were sued last year by Los Angeles police officer Martin Whitfield. 
His suit contends the gunmakers should be held liable for his 
injuries in the 1997 shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	Two bank robbers, armed with assault weapons, had the police  
seriously outgunned when they wounded 10 officers, including 
Whitfield, and two civilians.

<HEADLINE> HBO's 'Sopranos' Leads Emmy Nods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sopranos,'' HBO's critically acclaimed  
series about a mobster in suburbia, captured a leading 16 Emmy 
nominations today and became the first cable program recognized in 
the best dramatic series category. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making strong showings with 13 bids apiece were Fox's  
off-kilter comedy ``Ally McBeal,'' the ABC legal drama ``The 
Practice'' and the CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	HBO also fielded only the second cable comedy series to earn a  
nomination, the risque program ``Sex and the City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the most nominated network, with 82 bids, was NBC, with HBO  
second with 74. ABC received 58 nominations, CBS had 46 and Fox 
received 33. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards were announced by Camryn Manheim, who was nominated  
as best dramatic supporting actress for ``The Practice'' and by 
David Hyde Pierce, also a nominee for supporting comedy actor for 
``Frasier.'' The pair were winners in those categories last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meryl Marshall, chairman and chief executive officer of the  
Television Academy, broke the good news to Ms. Manheim and Pierce 
in a predawn announcement carried live on TV. Ms. Manheim squealed 
with glee and picked up Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Other best drama series bids went to NBC's top-rated medical  
drama ``ER'' and the network's ``Law &AMP; Order,'' to ABC's ``NYPD 
Blue,'' and to ``The Practice,'' last year's winner in the 
category. 
</P>
<P>
	``Law &AMP; Order'' producer Dick Wolf wasn't surprised by the  
show's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a complete hour of storytelling,'' he said. ``It doesn't  
matter if you haven't seen the show a day, a week or a year, you 
come back and get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos,'' nominated in its first year of eligibility  
also drew nominations for its stars, James Gandolfini, who plays 
mobster Tony Soprano, for Edie Falco, who portrays his wife, and 
Lorraine Bracco, who plays his therapist. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining ``Sex and the City'' and Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' in the  
comedy category were CBS' ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' and NBC's 
``Friends'' and ``Frasier.'' The latter set a record with its fifth 
win in the category last year. This was the first year ``Sex and 
the City'' was eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead actors in drama series who received nods included Dennis  
Franz and Jimmy Smits of ``NYPD Blue,'' Dylan McDermott of ``The 
Practice,'' and Sam Waterston of ``Law &AMP; Order,'' along with 
Gandolfini. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Soprano'' actresses Miss Bracco and Miss Falco,  
drama series lead actress nominees included Gillian Anderson of 
Fox's ``The X-Files,'' last year's winner Christine Lahti of CBS' 
``Chicago Hope'' and Julianna Margulies of ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelsey Grammer, who won the best comedy actor trophy last year,  
was nominated again. Joining him were Michael J. Fox of ABC's 
``Spin City,'' John Lithgow of NBC's ``3rd Rock From The Sun,'' 
Paul Reiser of NBC's ``Mad About You'' and Ray Romano of 
``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comedy lead actress nominees included Jenna Elfman of ABC's  
``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' Calista Flockhart of ``Ally McBeal,'' Patricia 
Heaton of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' Sarah Jessica Parker of 
``Sex and the City,'' and last year's winner, Helen Hunt of ``Mad 
About You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among snubs: ``The X-Files'' dropped from the dramatic series  
category along with its male lead, David Duchovny; besides Miss 
Kudrow, no other cast member of ``Friends'' grabbed a nomination, 
although the series itself got a bid after missing out for two 
years; and ABC's critically recognized new comedy ``Sports Night,'' 
failed to get a nod. 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations in the miniseries category, in addition to ``Joan of  
Arc,'' went to NBC's ``The Temptations'' and the network's ``The 
'60s,'' A&AMP;E's ``Horatio Hornblower'' and PBS' ``Great 
Expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations for TV movie went to HBO's ``The Rat Pack,'' the  
saga of Frank Sinatra and his pals which received a leading 11 
bids, A&AMP;E's ``Dash and Lilly,'' HBO's ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' 
TNT's ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' and Showtime's ``The Baby 
Dance.''	   Nominated as supporting actors in a drama series were Michael 
Badalucco and Steve Harris of ``The Practice,'' and Benjamin Bratt 
and Steven Hill of ``Law &AMP; Order,'' and Noah Wylie of ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actresses nominated in the category included a trio from ``The  
Practice'': Ms. Manheim, Lara Flynn Boyle and Holland Taylor. The 
other nominees were Kim Delaney of ``NYPD Blue'' and Nancy 
Marchand, who plays the scheming family matriarch on ``The 
Sopranos.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the comedy side, supporting actor nominations went to Peter  
Boyle of ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' Peter MacNicol of ``Ally 
McBeal,'' David Spade of NBC's ``Just Shoot Me,'' and two 
``Frasier'' co-stars, John Mahoney and Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids for supporting funny women went to Lisa Kudrow of  
``Friends,'' who was last year's winner, Kristen Johnston of ``3rd 
Rock From The Sun,'' Lucy Liu of ``Ally McBeal,'' Wendie Malick of 
``Just Shoot Me'' and Doris Roberts of ``Everybody Loves Raymond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strong showing by HBO newcomers ``The Sopranos'' and ``Sex  
and the City'' is unusual in light of the academy's tendency to 
honor old favorites. HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' was the only 
cable comedy series to be nominated previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The cable industry acknowledged its increasing Emmy clout last  
year by scrapping the Cable Ace Awards. Last year, HBO was second 
only to NBC in nominations and trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Emmy voters have a habit of revisiting old favorites in  
bestowing nominations. Among dramas, for instance, a quartet of 
series -- ``ER,'' ``Law &AMP; Order,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and ``The X-Files'' 
-- have dominated the category for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Award winners will be determined by peer panels meeting in  
August. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sept. 12 Emmy ceremony will be broadcast live from the  
Shrine Auditorium by Fox.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin OKs Nuclear Talks With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- President Boris Yeltsin today authorized his prime  
minister to discuss reducing nuclear arms with the United States, 
including a review of the long-delayed START II treaty, the prime 
minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin, who visited Yeltsin at his  
residence west of Moscow, was scheduled leave Sunday for the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	START II, which would cut Russian and American nuclear stocks to  
a maximum of 3,500 warheads each, has languished in the lower 
house, the State Duma, since it was signed in 1993. Stepashin did 
not elaborate on what Yeltsin said about arms reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting between Russia's leaders was the first since Yeltsin  
started his vacation on July 10. They also discussed upcoming 
parliamentary elections, friction with Chechnya and the state's 
efforts to control rising gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian television showed Yeltsin, dressed in a blue shirt,  
speaking to Stepashin across a small table. The tape didn't contain 
sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin, 68, has been in and out of the hospital with a variety  
of health problems in the last few years, but in recent weeks has 
appeared active and relatively fit. 
</P>
<P>
	The two discussed parliamentary elections set for December. The  
Kremlin has said it wants the next parliament to be dominated by 
reformists, not Communists as in the current legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	The escalating conflict with the separatist republic Chechnya  
and a planned meeting with Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov was also 
mentioned. But Stepashin was not specific. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin said they discussed the state's attempts to rein in  
gasoline prices, which have risen 30 percent recently. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin is scheduled to return to Moscow from the United  
States on Wednesday.

	Kennedy Ashes Committed To Sea  
</P>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- In a farewell at sea, family members  
aboard a Navy destroyer committed the ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., 
his wife and sister-in-law into the water today, at a site not far 
from where they died. A group of about 15 relatives carried the 
cremated remains of Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren 
Bessette onto the USS Briscoe. The Briscoe spent about half an hour 
nearly motionless off the Vineyard's southwest coast. A flag was 
lowered to half-mast as a group of mourners was seated. After two 
people appeared to rise and speak, passengers returned to the upper 
deck and the flag was taken down.

	House Passes Tax Cut Package  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House has passed a 10-year, $792 billion  
Republican tax cut bill that President Clinton has denounced as far 
too large and promised to veto. Republicans said that in an age of 
huge budget surpluses, they could give Americans the tax relief 
they deserve and still assure the future solvency of Social 
Security and Medicare. The vote was 223-208, with only four 
Republicans breaking ranks and voting against the measure. Six 
Democrats supported the GOP plan. 

</P>
<P>
	Bradley Issues Soft Money Challenge  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley today cast  
Vice President Al Gore and Texas governor George W. Bush as 
hypocrites on campaign finance reform and promised that if he is 
the Democratic nominee he would run without ``soft money'' if 
Republicans agreed to do the same. Bradley said both Gore and Bush 
have said they support changing the soft money system, in which 
large, unregulated contributions to the parties, made primarily by 
unions and corporations, indirectly help candidates. The campaign 
finance address is the second in a series of speeches in which 
Bradley is rolling out details of his platform.

	China Bans Meditation Group  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China banned the popular Falun Gong meditation  
sect today after three days of public protests heightened the 
government's fears the group was a threat to communist rule. The 
ban on a sect with millions of members highlighted official unease 
that such groups could become rallying points for public anger at 
rising unemployment and rampant corruption. Falun Gong's public 
image is that of a mild group of middle-age and older devotees who 
gather in parks to meditate and do yoga-like exercises. But state 
media claimed today it spread ``superstitious, evil thinking.''

	TWA Workers Ratify Labor Agreement  
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- A two-year labor dispute between Trans World  
Airlines and its biggest union ended today when machinists 
announced they had accepted the company's contract terms. Workers 
ratified the agreement their leaders negotiated, averting for at 
least 18 months a work stoppage that threatened to cripple the 
airline. Union spokesman Bob Haynes would not release the actual 
vote count or say how close it was. The 16,000 union mechanics, 
ramps workers, ticket agents and flight attendants will get 
double-digit pay raises, bringing them up to 90 percent of the 
projected industry wage standard by summer 2001.

	Greenspan Watches Out for Inflation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told  
Congress today that 1999 has been an ``exceptional year'' for the 
American economy, but he pledged the central bank will ``act 
promptly and forcefully'' at the first hint of inflation dangers. 
Delivering the Fed's midyear report on economic conditions, 
Greenspan defended the decision three weeks ago to nudge a key 
interest rate up by a quarter-point. Greenspan said the high-flying 
stock market had been bolstered by a healthy upturn in U.S. 
workers' productivity. But he cautioned investors against becoming 
overly optimistic that the strong gains in productivity can be 
sustained.

Tour de France today as the race left the grueling Pyrenees 
mountains and returned to flat ground in Bordeaux wine country. 
Armstrong came in 51st in a stage won by Belgium's Tom Steels. The 
27-year-old Texan crossed the finish line with much of the pack, 
retaining his overall lead of 6 minutes, 15 seconds. Armstrong 
remains on course for victory in Paris on Sunday, when the riders 
reach the Champs-Elysees for their grand finale.

<HEADLINE> Letters Shed Light on Reagan's Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Their correspondence started when she was 13  
and he was a dashing Hollywood actor, and it lasted for more than a 
half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Reagan shared candid details of his life, love, family,  
politics and careers in 276 letters to Lorraine Wagner, a 
Philadelphia woman who recently sold the collection to a dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters trace Reagan's life and times, from his early years  
as a Democrat and labor activist to his later life as a 
conservative politician who reached the California governor's 
office and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Reagan, who has Alzheimer's disease, lives in Los Angeles. He is  
88. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel extraordinarily fortunate to have known him,'' Mrs.  
Wagner said Wednesday from her home, where Reagan photographs, 
books and scrapbooks document the friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	It all began with a fan letter sent by junior high school  
student Lorraine Makler in 1943. She wrote to her 10 favorite movie 
stars, and Reagan sent the young fan a large photo and a 
personalized note. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was thrilled. I don't know that I would have answered me -- I  
was just a kid,'' said Mrs. Wagner, now 70. ``It speaks to the 
generosity and thoughtfulness Ronald Reagan had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence turned into a friendship that included  
several visits to Reagan's California ranch and to the White House. 
Her husband -- she married Elwood Wagner in 1954 -- and children came 
to know the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the subjects Reagan wrote about was his dismay over  
marital troubles with first wife, actress Jane Wyman (``I know she 
loves me, even though she thinks she doesn't''); his suspicion that 
President Jimmy Carter was ``a real phony;'' and his boredom during 
his deposition in the Iran-Contra case (``I was tempted several 
times to reply by asking the lawyer, `Where were you three years 
ago last Friday?' But I didn't.''). 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Wagner sold the letters to Steve Raab Autographs, a  
suburban Philadelphia dealer, in October. The sale wasn't widely 
known until an article on the letters appeared in The New Yorker 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	The dealer is asking $395,000 for the collection, said Neale  
Lanigan, an associate for the dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Wagner said she hopes the letters will end up in the Ronald  
Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they did make their way here or someone offered to donate  
them, we would most definitely be interested in them,'' said 
library archivist Rhonda Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	The last personal note to Mrs. Wagner from Reagan came in June  
1994, saying: ``I am grateful for your friendship through the 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that year, she received her final letter, a farewell  
message sent to thousands of friends to tell them he was suffering 
from Alzheimer's disease.

<HEADLINE> Panel Cuts Crop Insurance Premiums </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers want more farmers to protect  
themselves from bad weather and drops in commodity prices by 
purchasing federally subsidized crop insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Agriculture risk management subcommittee on Wednesday  
approved legislation that would substantially lower the premiums, 
doubling the cost of the insurance program to taxpayers to about $3 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many farmers have traditionally declined to buy crop insurance  
because they felt the premiums were too high for the coverage they 
got. About 65 percent of eligible acreage is now covered. 
</P>
<P>
	``Producers will have noticeable improvements to their crop  
insurance in time for the coverage of the fall crop,'' said Rep. 
Larry Combest, R-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	With the agricultural economy mired in recession, Congress is  
searching for ways to provide farmers with a safety net without 
rewriting the 1996 farm law that did away with a Depression-era 
system of price supports. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers now pay 45 percent to 87 percent of the cost of their  
insurance, with the government picking up the rest. Under the House 
bill, the farmers' share would range from 35 percent to 65 percent, 
depending on the level of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation also would improve coverage for farmers who have  
had one or two major crop losses in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was approved on a voice vote by the House Agriculture risk  
management subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The full Agriculture Committee is to debate the legislation next  
week, with a vote in the House to come in early August. The Senate 
has yet to take up the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than reduce premiums, the chairman of the Senate  
Agriculture Committee, Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., wants to give 
direct payments to growers to spend as they choose. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics fear that cutting insurance premiums will increase  
production of commodities that are already in surplus and encourage 
farmers to plant crops in areas that don't get enough rainfall or 
where the growing season is too short. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``it's the worst possible time to express concerns like  
that, because these people so desperately need help,'' said Ken 
Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a research and 
advocacy organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are still looking at ways to keep farmers from  
cheating the insurance system. The House committee is to consider a 
proposal next week to offer special premium discounts to farmers 
who turn in their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers know best what's going on in their communities,'' said  
Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released in March by USDA's inspector general said the  
insurance system was prone to abuse because taxpayers, not the 
private companies selling and servicing the policies, bear most of 
the risk of losses.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Rise in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds rose by $2.19 billion in the latest week to $873.37 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category rose  
by $2.53 billion to $723.40 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $346.5 million to $149.97 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of institutional money market funds rose by $4.09 billion  
to $588.42 billion for the same period. Among institutional funds, 
taxable money market fund assets rose by $3.93 billion to $538.60 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds rose by $150.9 million to 
$49.82 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.462 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.456 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.45 percent from 4.41 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day 
average yield rose 4.40 percent from 4.36 percent, IBC Financial 
Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.55 percent from 4.51  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.50 percent from 4.46 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
59 days, up from 58 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts was 2.03 percent as of 
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts fell to 0.85 percent from 0.86 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.20 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.19 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.55 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.54 
percent; 4.81 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.78 percent; and 
4.97 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 4.94 percent.

<HEADLINE> Panel OK's $4.5B for Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House panel voted Thursday to use $4.5  
billion of next year's projected surplus to pay for the 2000 
census, highlighting the problems Republicans face as they scramble 
to write spending and tax legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote occurred shortly after Republicans pushed a $792  
billion, 10-year tax cut through the House, a cut that would be 
paid for from projected federal surpluses. But the temptation to 
use next year's surplus for the census, and possibly other items, 
could end up eating into the very 10-year surplus that Republicans 
want to use for tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a thin reed the tax cuts hang on,'' said Rep. Jose  
Serrano of New York, ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations 
subcommittee that approved the census money as part of a $35.8 
billion measure financing the State, Justice and Commerce 
departments for the coming fiscal year. The bill was approved by 
voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The $4.5 billion was virtually the entire amount President  
Clinton requested for the census, which the Constitution requires 
every 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bill would declare the census expenditure an emergency,  
meaning the $4.5 billion would be exempted from legally required 
spending limits and, in effect, come from next year's projected $14 
billion surplus. Doing that freed up money that could be used for 
other programs covered by the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a tough year for us, obviously,'' said subcommittee  
Chairman Harold Rogers, R-Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers and others said declaring the census an emergency was  
decided by House GOP leaders. He said in an interview that the idea 
was justified because of a recent Supreme Court decision requiring 
the Census Bureau to use both a door-to-door count and 
computer-assisted statistical sampling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't anticipate what the costs would be,'' Rogers said.  
</P>
<P>
	This spring and last fall, many Republicans complained of budget  
gimmickry when Clinton proposed -- and Congress enacted -- 
multibillion-dollar spending bills of which large portions were 
declared emergencies. Democrats scoffed that this time, Republicans 
were using the technique for the constitutionally required head 
count. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess that means that we didn't see it coming,'' Rep. David  
Obey, D-Wis., said of the census. 
</P>
<P>
	The census aside, the bill falls nearly $3 billion short of what  
Clinton has requested and is not likely to become law until budget 
talks expected this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	It would cut his requests for hiring police officers, legal aid  
to the poor, U.S. contributions to international organizations and 
helping salmon populations in the Northwest recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Senate used a voice vote to pass its $35.3  
billion version of the bill. White House officials have already 
threatened a veto because it contains cuts similar to those of the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
	By voice vote, the Senate agreed to provide $496 million of  
Clinton's $1.3 billion proposal for helping communities hire police 
officers. Senators also used a voice vote to add provisions 
expanding federal jurisdiction over hate crimes to cover victims 
chosen because of their sexual orientation, gender or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure would provide $3 billion for the census, none  
of it paid for with the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The hate crimes legislation was among 34 amendments that  
senators approved -- without describing them -- in a single voice 
vote. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Columbia Launch Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Thunderstorms prevented space  
shuttle Columbia from blasting off early Thursday with Eileen 
Collins, the first woman to lead a U.S. space flight. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second launch delay this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Lightning flashed offshore and thunder rumbled as NASA held the  
countdown at the five-minute mark in hopes the storms would pass by 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch director even added 10 minutes to the launch window,  
but it didn't help. He waited until the last possible moment before 
radioing the bad news to Collins and her crew: They would not be 
lifting off Thursday with the world's most powerful X-ray 
telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eileen, we gave it our best shot,'' launch director Ralph Roe  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crew will be ready to go at the next opportunity,''  
Collins assured him. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said it will try again early Friday. If Columbia isn't off  
the ground by then, the mission will have to be delayed until 
mid-August because of an upcoming rocket launch and the impending 
shutdown of Air Force launch facilities, for more than three weeks 
of improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The first launch attempt, on Tuesday, ended seven seconds before  
liftoff when a dangerous hydrogen buildup was detected in the 
engine compartment. It turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Hawley, who has endured numerous launch delays in his 21  
years as an astronaut, did his best to ensure a punctual liftoff. 
He briefly pulled a brown paper bag over his head before boarding 
Columbia; he's used the bag before, as a joke, to disguise himself 
for launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton had returned for Thursday's early morning  
try, along with daughter Chelsea, a delegation of female members of 
Congress and the co-captain of the U.S. women's soccer team. The 
whole team showed up for the first launch attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle is carrying the Chandra X-ray Observatory, a $1.5  
billion telescope that will spend at least five years searching for 
black holes and scrutinizing galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time in 38 years of U.S. space flight that a  
woman is at the controls. Collins, a 42-year-old Air Force colonel, 
flew twice before in space, as a co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	``To women, I say, this represents a huge milestone,'' she said  
in a recent interview. ``I think it's long overdue, I really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five astronauts' first major task in orbit will be to  
release Chandra, the heaviest payload ever packed into a space 
shuttle. The 45-foot telescope, along with an attached rocket motor 
and support gear, weighs 50,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle had to be stripped of 7,000 pounds of unnecessary  
gear. And engineering studies were done to make sure the shuttle 
could sustain the weight if, because of some problem, it had to 
return to Earth with the telescope still on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra should have flown last summer but was grounded by  
technical problems, including bad circuit boards and a suspect 
rocket motor needed to propel it into an orbit extending one-third 
of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope is named for the late Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar,  
a Nobel-winning astrophysicist who taught at the University of 
Chicago. His 88-year-old widow, Lalitha, was on hand for the launch 
attempt.

<HEADLINE> Vandals Damage Site of 2001 US Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Vandals sprayed poison on greens at Southern  
Hills Country Club, site of the 2001 U.S. Open, carving obscenities 
into the grass and forcing the championship course to close until 
spring for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight greens at the championship course and four on a separate  
nine-hole course were damaged June 25 by the chemical, which killed 
the top layer of grass, general manager Nick Sidorakis said 
Thursday. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The championship course will close Aug. 16 for reseeding. The  
grass takes about 10 weeks to fully grow. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to change the contours of the greens, that's  
one of the biggest features,'' Sidorakis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The West Nine course will remain open for members.  
</P>
<P>
	Sidorakis, who refused to give more details on the damage, does  
not believe U.S. Open plans will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach officials at the U.S. Golf Association for  
comment late Thursday were not successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Hills has played host to five major championships,  
including the PGA Championship in 1970, 1982 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> New Cleveland Browns Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Three years of lost Sundays and life without  
pro football is finally over -- the Cleveland Browns are back in 
pads and back in town. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns opened preseason training camp today for the  
first time since the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of about 35 players -- rookies and a few selected  
veterans -- were ready for their first morning workout under coach 
Chris Palmer. The rest of the team's players will have their first 
formal workout on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven drift picks, receiver Kevin Johnson, linebacker Wali  
Rainer, wide receiver Darrin Chiaverini, defensive lineman Marcus 
Spriggs, linebacker Kendall Ogle, tight end James Dearth and 
running back Madre Hill, reached contract agreements Wednesday. 
Only draft picks Rahim Abdullah, a linebacker, and cornerback 
Daylon McCutcheon, were unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	While the team has had four minicamps, those were padless  
sessions with little contact. But now touch football is over and 
there will be a new sense of urgency on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 90 players who will strap on orange helmets Sunday,  
nearly half will be cut before Cleveland's regular season opener 
game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sept. 12.

<HEADLINE> Rio Grande Valley Cotton Crop Sours / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARLINGEN, Texas (AP) -- Aaron Shields, a third generation Rio  
Grande Valley cotton farmer, planted his 800 acres of cotton this 
year hoping to get a decent price with an early crop. 
</P>
<P>
	The Valley cotton seemed to cooperate, even as world cotton  
prices plummeted. Shields and other farmers hoped to harvest around 
the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it is practically August, prices are in the basement and an  
unusually persistent dose of rain is souring the cotton, making 
fields too soggy for harvesting equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The rain is) hurting us because we didn't get it at the time  
we needed it. Now we're getting it at the time we should be 
harvesting,'' said the Monte Alto farmer, who expected to have half 
his cotton harvested by now but has not even begun. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, hopes were high for Valley cotton. Well-timed  
rain and moderate temperatures allowed cotton farmers to plant 
early and helped the crop mature enough to be harvested before 
sweltering heat and insects took their toll in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Valley cotton's not usually picked until the third week in July,  
but the harvest was expected to start early this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, the rains came, and they seemed like a fluke. The Valley  
has been in a drought since the mid-1990s and is not known for its 
rainy summers -- or any rainy season, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
	But rain has soaked the area on and off for the past several  
weeks. It has seeped into some of the open bolls on the ripe 
cotton, staining them, washing away essential oils, making cotton 
seeds sprout and causing bolls to rot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the rains started, we had one of the better looking  
crops in many years,'' said John Norman, an entomologist with the 
Texas A&AMP;M Agricultural Research and Extension Service in Weslaco. 
</P>
<P>
	In fields where water has made cotton seeds worthless by causing  
them to sprout, farmers could lose $40 to $70 per acre. Only a few 
growers harvested in early July and not many have harvested since 
then. By now, about 40 percent of the cotton should have been out 
of the fields. 
</P>
<P>
	``My guess is probably 5 percent or so (has been harvested), if  
we're lucky,'' Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The harvest should have been wrapped up by mid-August, but at  
this rate it will go until the end of August, Norman said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rain has diminished the quality of the cotton. Even with  
a market price around 48 cents a pound, farmers can expect to get 5 
or 10 cents less than that per pound for the damaged cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a difficult situation to be in. However, we have not lost  
our entire crop,'' Shields said, adding that he doesn't know how 
much of his crop is damaged and that it would be several days 
before he could try to harvest. ``We're still optimistic that we 
have some areas that may have decent yields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rain also has made it difficult to apply expensive insecticides  
and defoliants to the plants. Defoliants knock leaves off the 
plants to make it easier for harvesters to pass through fields and 
to keep the cotton lint free of leaf debris. 
</P>
<P>
	Although defoliants are absorbed relatively quickly,  
insecticides wash off cotton easily, which has given boll weevils 
free rein in some fields. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in a best-case scenario, Shields and other farmers will get  
about half of what they need to break even. The break even price is 
more than 70 cents a pounds.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks, Dollar Down at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar traded lower against the yen at midday  
Friday, while Japanese stocks closed the morning session lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 117.26 yen, down 1.18 yen from late Thursday  
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 116.70 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 140.70 points,  
or 0.79 percent, to 17,589.64 at the end of the morning session. On 
Thursday, the average closed down 527.18 points, or 2.89 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, traders said the dollar was under selling  
pressure amid renewed concerns of U.S. inflation sparked by U.S. 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Greenspan stressed the Fed was poised to act at the first  
sign that inflation was heating up, he did not signal in his 
prepared remarks to lawmakers that such a move was imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan criticized what he called ``euphoria'' in stock  
prices, prompting a selloff on Wall Street on Thursday. The decline 
in demand for U.S. stocks, sharpest among technology issues, in 
turn sent the dollar lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi and Finance Minister  
Kiichi Miyazawa hinted Friday that Japanese financial authorities 
are still prepared to intervene to stem the yen's rapid 
appreciation against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But many investors are brushing off those threats.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan failed Thursday to intervene to prop up the  
U.S. currency, setting off a wave of pent-up demand for the yen 
that propelled the dollar as low as 116.05 yen, its lowest level in 
five months. The dollar's decline against the yen continued Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gains by the yen make Japanese exports more costly abroad, and  
thus less competitive, while reducing the value of foreign revenue 
in yen terms. Japan is struggling to emerge from its worst 
recession in more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro traded at 123.10 yen, down from  
124.06 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started sharply lower  
following a decline on Wall Street and gains by the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Early losers included international blue-chips such as Sony,  
Toyota, Canon, Advantest, Fujitsu and Toshiba. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost  
33.56 points to close at 10,969.22. The Standard and Poor's 500 
Stock Index lost 18.32 points, or 1.32 percent, while the Nasdaq 
Composite Index slipped 77.29 points, for a loss of 2.79 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 12.21 points, or 0.84 percent, to finish the 
morning at 1,446.81. The TOPIX closed down 41.09 points, or 2.79 
percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond  
stood at 1.7350 percent, unchanged from Tuesday's finish. Its price 
remained 100.55 yen.

<HEADLINE> SEC Settles Stock Giveaway Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Securities regulators, responding to a wave of  
free stock offerings over the Internet, said Thursday they have 
settled enforcement cases they brought against four promoters who 
offered free stock while allegedly failing to register it. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time the Securities and Exchange Commission had  
taken enforcement actions of this type. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock isn't really free, the SEC maintains, because the  
companies issuing it received valuable benefits in return such as 
investors' personal information. In some cases, investors were 
offered extra shares for soliciting other investors, the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC officials said they didn't have figures on how many  
companies have offered free stock. The practice dates back to the 
1950s but has been given new impetus by the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been telling various companies in recent months that  
if someone receives stock in exchange for providing personal data 
such as income and Social Security number, the person is actually 
buying the stock. That means the company has to register the 
giveaway with the SEC as a stock sale or demonstrate why it should 
be exempt from registering, the agency says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Free stock is really a misnomer in these cases,'' SEC  
Enforcement Director Richard Walker said in a statement Thursday. 
``Under these circumstances, the securities laws entitle investors 
to full and fair disclosure, which they did not receive in these 
cases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said it has received a number of complaints from  
investors that the companies offering free stock weren't providing 
adequate information about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of American Space Corp., the SEC said investors were  
told that the free shares they received would give them interests 
in an aerospace company that would revive moon exploration, while 
in fact the company was never incorporated and its promoter had no 
relevant experience. 
</P>
<P>
	In the four civil cases, the individual promoters and the  
companies agreed to refrain from future violations of securities 
registration laws. They neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The cases were brought against:  
</P>
<P>
	--Joe Loofbourrow, of Oklahoma City, who allegedly offered free  
stock in American Space without registering the offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	--Web Works Marketing.com Inc. and Trace D. Cornell, 32, of Rush,  
N.Y. Cornell allegedly offered unregistered free shares in Web 
Works Marketing, a telecommunications marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
	--WowAuction.com Inc. and Steven M. Gaddis Sr., 48, of Woodstock,  
Ga. Gaddis allegedly offered unregistered free stock in the 
company, an online auctioneer, to investors who signed up on its 
Web site or recruited others to do so. 
</P>
<P>
	--Theodore Sotirakis, 53, of Staten Island, N.Y., who allegedly  
offered unregistered free stock in Kinesis International Inc., an 
unincorporated business, to people who signed up on its Web site or 
linked their Web sites to it. 
</P>
<P>
	Loofbourrow and Cornell also agreed to refrain from violations  
of securities fraud laws.

<P>
	EDGELEY, N.D. (AP) -- At Willowbank Colony, folks don't pay much  
attention to the approaching millennium. There's too much work to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	A crop must be tended. An order of wooden trusses has to be  
hauled out. Livestock must be fed. 
</P>
<P>
	A distraction like the arrival of the year 2000 is of little  
concern to Dan Wipf, a spiritual leader of the Hutterite colony for 
29 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll just be another day, another hour, another minute,''  
said Wipf as he rushed from his home late one morning to the 
on-site truss company where he works. 
</P>
<P>
	Wipf, a short, bearded man, also dismissed forecasts that the  
so-called Y2K computer glitch could have catastrophic consequences, 
a phenomenon that some in other religious groups have seen as 
signaling the end of the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``God does not want us to know when that will happen, so why  
speculate?'' said Wipf. 
</P>
<P>
	Outward preparations for the end times aren't being made at the  
colony. There's no need. 
</P>
<P>
	The 90 or so Hutterites who live southeast of Edgeley,  
population 680, are self-sufficient. They drink the milk from dairy 
cows among the 100 head of cattle, raise 100,000 turkeys each year, 
use eggs from their chickens, and farm about 2,000 acres of corn, 
soybeans and wheat, plus garden crops. 
</P>
<P>
	They built the colony -- the long barns and garages, a church and  
school, a dining hall and laundry, a lumber business and identical 
three-apartment homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutterites are Anabaptists who trace their roots to the 16th  
century Protestant Reformation and take their name from Jacob 
Hutter, an Austrian religious reformer who was burned at the stake 
in 1536. They arrived in North America from Germany in the 1870s 
and number about 25,000, mainly in Minnesota and the Dakotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hutterite religion is based on communal life. A colony  
provides its members with food, clothing, shelter and medical care, 
and all eat at a common dining hall. The colony owns all property. 
Community life, including farming, is inseparable from religious 
belief, Hutterites say. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutterites speak a German dialect, reserving English for  
dealings with others. 
</P>
<P>
	Those relationships have improved. For the most part, Hutterites  
are no longer viewed as extremist or threatening and, after many 
years, are being accepted as part of the larger community. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're good for their word,'' said Clint Hoggarth, a salesman  
at the local farm implement dealership. ``They're good people to 
deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Schrader agrees. The Hutterites often come into her Edgeley  
cafe. ``They are very polite, very reasonable,'' she said. ``You 
don't hear complaints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commune resembles a small-town neighborhood. Trees grow in  
generous clusters, kids ride their bikes on paved sidewalks, and an 
underground sprinkler system waters the grass. 
</P>
<P>
	Women and girls wear ankle-skimming dresses they've sewn and  
head coverings that Wipf says are ``the mark of a true Christian.'' 
Women spend most of the day preparing large meals they serve to the 
men in the dining hall. Women and men eat separately. 
</P>
<P>
	The interior of each home is the same: basic furnishings and  
cabinetry made by the Hutterites, and perhaps a toaster and 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Hutterites do not live strictly off the land. Their  
communal income is primarily from their on-site hardware store and 
truss company, Golden Rule Lumber and Willowbank Truss. The trusses 
are sold through contractors to customers across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Wipf has a fax machine and desktop computer in his office and a  
laptop and two-way radio at home. Internet access for a select few 
is in the works. A pool of vehicles is available. There are 
delivery trucks for the trusses, plus tractors and a new combine. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wipf's home, which he shares with his wife, Mary Ann, and  
their son and his family, a stack of Bibles sits in the living 
room, and Wipf leads nightly church services and reads Scriptures 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Spirituality is central to colony life. A chaste lifestyle means  
no card games, photographs, jewelry or makeup. Smoking or swearing 
could lead to expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
	Rarely do Hutterites leave the colony, Wipf said. And rarely do  
newcomers join. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutterites pool their money. They get allowances for trips, but  
no pay for their work. 
</P>
<P>
	Work begins at age 10. Children are assigned to the dairy barns,  
fields, truss company, gardens or turkeys and chickens. They adopt 
the trade that a five-member governing board believes they do best. 
Their formal schooling ends after eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
	The Edgeley Public School District provides two teachers and an  
aide for the colony's 17 students. In addition to their schooling 
in English, they have two hours a day of German studies taught by a 
Hutterite. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutterites can go to college, though most don't, Wipf said,  
adding that he and others taught themselves their vocations. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has evolved this century, Wipf said, adding, ``You  
have to change. You can't always be the same.'' Women, for example, 
no longer milk the cows by hand. They now have milking machines. 
</P>
<P>
	Unchanged and unaffected by public perceptions is the  
Hutterites' faith, Wipf said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let people say what they want. This is our way of life,'' he  
said. ``As long as the people here are sincere about it, that way 
of life won't fade.''

<HEADLINE> Size Vs. Quantity in Campaign Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- George W. Bush, the runaway leader in the  
presidential money race, lags behind several competitors in one 
measure -- his percentage of donations from the multitudes who write 
checks for $25 instead of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Some political analysts say small-dollar donors help measure the  
breadth of a candidate's grassroots support. But small vs. big may 
also simply reflect differing fund-raising strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over 5 percent of Bush's record-setting $37 million haul  
came from contributions of under $200, according to an analysis by 
the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan, nonprofit 
research organization. 
</P>
<P>
	As of June 30, 74,000 people had donated to Bush. His campaign  
said 30,663 or 41.4 percent, gave $200 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates who raised much less money had a bigger  
percentage of small contributions, according to the center and 
campaigns. Since candidates don't have to itemize small 
contributions by donor, the Associated Press requested the number 
of donors from campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, some candidates such as commentator Alan  
Keyes and conservative activist Gary Bauer had especially high 
small-donor tallies. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes raised $1.4 million or 73.7 percent of his money in small  
donations, accounting for 94.5 percent of his donors. Bauer got 
$857,515 or 24.9 percent in small contributions, accounting for 
85.4 percent of his donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Democrats, Vice President Al Gore got $2 million or 11.1  
percent of his money from small contributions. The percentage of 
donors giving $200 or less was 85.9 percent in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley got just 2.6 percent of his  
money -- $299,710 -- from small donors. Of his estimated 19,335 
contributors, 26.6 percent gave $200 or less. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea of the campaign finance laws is you want to encourage  
small contributions, because people who are giving small amounts 
aren't going to be the people asking and expecting favors from the 
elected officials,'' said Paul Hendrie of the Center for Responsive 
Politics, which studies the role of money in federal politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law doesn't require small contributions to be itemized  
and puts a $1,000 limit on individual donations. Dollar-for-dollar 
matching funds are available for individual donations of up to 
$250. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Bush has decided to do without matching funds and their  
accompanying restrictions -- attracting some criticism -- he doesn't 
have an incentive to pile up numerous smaller donations. 
</P>
<P>
	While a large number of small contributions can indicate  
grass-roots support, large donations represent the most important 
money source, Hendrie said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cost of running these days at a presidential level makes  
it impossible to raise enough money to run for president just on 
small contributions,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Governmental Studies at  
the University of Virginia, said many people can ``easily afford'' 
$1,000 in today's dollars and that it makes sense for a candidate 
to appeal to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to get your money early and maximize that total.  
The way to do that is to get $1,000 gifts,'' he said, adding that 
small donations can be an indicator of direct-mail use. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes' campaign manager, Dan Godzich, estimated that 25 percent  
of his donations have been through direct mail and close to half 
through telemarketing. Jeff Bell, senior consultant to Bauer, said 
his campaign has sent out 2.5 million pieces of direct mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's camp has sent out about 1.35 million pieces of direct  
mail in two large efforts and more in smaller mailings, said 
spokesman Roger Salazar. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said although most of the  
governor's money has come through ``friend-to-friend fund 
raising,'' his campaign had sent out about 1.9 million pieces of 
direct mail as of June 30. About one-third went out right before 
that date, the end of the last reporting period, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will continue to do regular direct-mail fund raising,''  
said Ms. Hughes. But she added that Bush's contributions thus far 
demonstrate ``an enormous outpouring of grass-roots support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan  
emphasized that it's still early in the presidential race, and it's 
not surprising that large donations would make up a big percentage 
of a record campaign war chest. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Buchanan said, Bush's percentage of small contributors  
shows he still has something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he still has to struggle to show he has broader  
support and answer those allegations by the folks who think there's 
some threat to the principle of equal influence for ordinary 
folks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Goldford, chair of the Department of Politics and  
International Relations at Drake University in Des Moines, said 
those he calls populists -- religious and social conservatives -- 
like the image of many little people giving smaller donations in 
the range of $25 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
	``Populists are anti-big,'' he said, so the more Bush is  
perceived as being aligned with the big guys, ``You have the danger 
of irritating the religious and social conservatives quite a bit 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That becomes more important for Bush in the general election if  
he's the nominee, Goldford said -- although the danger isn't that 
such voters would back Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger is they'd stay home,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Extent of Inmate Sex Abuse Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Auditors were unable to determine the  
extent of prison guards' sexual abuse of female inmates because 
most prisons fail to keep good records on such assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the data indicate that staff sexual misconduct occurs,  
the full extent of the problem is unknown,'' according to a report 
released Wednesday. ``Many correctional experts believe that 
staff-on-inmate sexual misconduct is likely underreported 
nationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report is the first to examine the phenomenon, said Eleanor  
Holmes Norton, the District of Columbia's nonvoting delegate to the 
House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Norton requested the survey from the General Accounting Office,  
the investigative branch of Congress. The agency studied the three 
largest prison jurisdictions -- California, Texas and the federal 
Bureau of Prisons -- because they house more than a third of the 
nation's 80,000 female inmates. 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia's correction system also was examined  
because it has had ``nationally notorious problems of sexual abuse 
by correctional personnel,'' Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``None of the four jurisdictions we studied had readily  
available, comprehensive data or reports on the number, nature and 
outcomes of staff-on-inmate sexual misconduct allegations,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most states -- 41 and the District of Columbia -- have laws  
criminalizing sexual abuse of prison inmates. However, without 
comprehensive information ``it remains unclear the extent to which 
laws are routinely enforced and policies and procedures are 
followed,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1995 to 1998, 506 female inmates from Texas, California and  
federal prisons reported sexual abuse by corrections staff. Only 92 
of those reports, or 18 percent, resulted in a resignation, 
termination or disciplinary action, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The District of Columbia had 111 such allegations from December  
1995 to June 1998. Of those, 12 resulted in disciplinary actions or 
resignations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the four regions said so few allegations were  
sustained because of a lack of medical or other physical evidence. 
Another reason cited was false claims made in attempts to 
``manipulate the system and victimize staff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Christensen, a delegate to Congress from the U.S. Virgin  
Islands, said she believes there are far more authentic, and 
unreported, allegations than those made up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to believe that women who are at the mercy and  
control of the facility personnel would risk their ire by bringing 
false allegations,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	All four regions have, or were in the process of developing,  
staff sexual misconduct policies, the report found. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the federal Bureau of Prisons reported criminal  
prosecutions with convictions stemming from sexual misconduct by 
staff members, the report said. Each of the four jurisdictions 
reported at least two civil lawsuits related to such misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Dunne, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman, said all  
allegations are taken seriously. Employees at its 94 federal 
prisons are told that ``engaging in sexual misconduct risks 
everything, they risk their careers and they risk their freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the BOP disciplined 10 prison employees for sexual  
misconduct; seven were prosecuted, he said.

<HEADLINE> House Passes $792B Tax Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House today passed a 10-year, $792 billion  
Republican tax cut bill that President Clinton has denounced as far 
too large and promised to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said that in an age of huge budget surpluses, they  
could give Americans the tax relief they deserve and still assure 
the future solvency of Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not too risky to give the American people their money  
back,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who labored 
intensively to unify the GOP rank and file behind the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 223-208, with only four Republicans breaking ranks  
and voting against the measure. They were Reps. Greg Ganske of 
Iowa, Constance Morella of Maryland, Jack Quinn of New York and 
Mike Castle of Delaware. Six Democrats supported the measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill now goes to the Senate, which is expected to vote next  
week on a measure that differs in details but also provides nearly 
$800 billion in tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Democrats argued for a considerably smaller level of  
tax cuts, of around $250 billion. A Democratic substitute seeking 
the small tax cut level won only one Republican vote and was 
defeated, 258-173. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, at an appearance in Lansing, Mich., said the GOP plan  
would fail to pay down the debt or add to the life of Social 
Security and Medicare ``and I will veto it if it passes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The debate clearly defined differences between the parties, with  
Republicans saying the tax package represented the culmination of 
their small-government, lower-taxes philosophy and Democrats 
warning of a return to failed supply-side economics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a trillion-dollar tax cut. It's a Christmas tree.  
It's decorated with every cut that you can think of for Republican 
supporters,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., ``Your bill is what 
we call in Harlem `a trip to nowhere'.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told a House hearing it  
is more important to pay down the national debt than cut taxes. 
Reducing the debt, he said, would lower interest rates and put the 
government's books in better shape to meet the rising retirement 
demands of the Baby Boom generation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, who chairs the House Ways and  
Means Committee, said Democrats were ``fighting ferociously to keep 
the money of the workers of America in Washington. ... We believe 
the people know best how to spend their money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only one Republican, Rep. Greg Ganske of Iowa, voted for the  
Democratic alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill was brought to the floor Wednesday night, only after  
daylong negotiations during which House Speaker Dennis Hastert, 
R-Ill., with his leadership at stake, succeeded in bringing 
rebellious GOP moderates in line. 
</P>
<P>
	His triumph could be short-lived. Clinton, saying the tax cuts  
are three times larger than what he could accept, said he would not 
allow them to become law. The 211 House Democrats were solidly 
against the GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate version approved by the Senate Finance Committee  
Wednesday, while adding up to the same $792 billion, takes a 
different approach to tax reduction. 
</P>
<P>
	The threatened desertion of GOP moderates who thought the tax  
cut was excessive was averted only after the House leadership 
agreed to a concession conditioning the planned 10 percent 
reduction in income tax rates over the next 10 years to annual 
progress in reducing the nation's debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Other elements of the legislation, including a reduction in the  
capital-gains tax, elimination of the estate tax and relief from 
the marriage penalty, were not affected by the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill highlights the stark differences between  
Republicans and the White House over how to manage a projected $2.9 
trillion surplus over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and the Democrats want to use most of the surplus to  
ensure the future of Social Security and Medicare and add a 
prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. They also want 
to set aside part of the annual surpluses for increases in defense 
and education spending. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Wednesday, Clinton said the GOP tax bill  
would ``squander'' the surplus and represented ``the kind of 
risk-taking that got us into deficits before.'' He issued his 
strongest veto threat yet, but said he would sign ``the right kind 
of tax cut'' of roughly $250 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president is wrong,'' Hastert said in a written statement.  
``It is not risky to give the American people their money back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the choice is simple. ``We can give some of the surplus  
back to the people or we can spend it here in Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House distributed a statement today from 50  
economists, including six Nobel laureates, who say they are 
advising policy-makers against big tax cuts like those under 
consideration in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``A massive tax cut that encourages consumption would not be  
good economic policy,'' they said. ``An ever-growing tax cut would 
claim government resources just when the aging of the population 
starts to put substantial stress on Social Security and Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued as Clinton traveled to Lansing, Mich.,  
to push his Medicare overhaul plan.. 
</P>
<P>
	The first stage of the debate on the bill, starting after 10  
p.m. Wednesday and going past midnight, was heated and highly 
partisan. Rep. Jack Kingston, R-Ga., spoke of ``rhetorical 
terrorism ... designed to scare seniors, children, teachers and the 
needy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., showed a photo of a Marine scavenging  
for furniture and said Republicans couldn't find the money for 
better military pay but ``you've got $400 billion for the fat cats, 
the guys who write the $1,000 checks to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans needed near-total unity to win passage. They command  
a narrow 222-211 majority, with one independent who usually votes 
with the Democrats. Passage requires 218 votes. A 219-208 
procedural vote to advance debate on the bill went almost 
completely along party lines, with only two Republican defections -- 
Ganske and Rep. Connie Morella of Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Panel Set To OK $4.6B for Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are ready to provide nearly  
all of the $4.6 billion President Clinton wants for next year's 
census as part of a nearly $36 billion measure for the departments 
of Justice, State and Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	A subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee planned to  
vote on the spending bill today. By providing only about $15 
million less than Clinton sought for the census, the GOP would all 
but end a long-running fight over the constitutionally required 
head count. 
</P>
<P>
	A Senate version of the bill, however, falls about $1.7 billion  
short of Clinton's request, leaving the final congressional figure 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill was described by congressional officials who  
spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of their drive to secure House passage of spending bills  
by beefing them up, GOP leaders pushed the legislation's price tag 
to $36 billion by adding about $5 billion to it. It was unclear 
what savings they would claim to pay for the extra spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Just Wednesday, House leaders decided to indefinitely delay  
writing a $300 billion measure financing labor, welfare, health and 
education programs after they could not agree on how to pay for $12 
billion in extra spending for that bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce-Justice bill would provide a small fraction of the  
$1.3 billion Clinton wants to help communities hire more police 
officers, and less than half his $340 million request for legal 
services for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, Senate Republicans released a Congressional Budget  
Office report Wednesday projecting that GOP budget plans would 
yield bigger federal surpluses over the next decade than President 
Clinton has proposed -- even with the near $800 billion GOP tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest difference is that Clinton would spend far more than  
Republicans. Using new estimates of prescription drug spending, the 
CBO estimated that the president's proposed drug benefit for 
Medicare recipients would cost $111 billion over 10 years, nearly 
$50 billion more than the administration estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the  
report showed that ``there is no question the president intends to 
spend'' almost the entire budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	But White House budget director Jacob Lew said the CBO's  
findings were based on ``utterly unrealistic assumptions'' in the 
Republican budget that much federal spending will be held well 
below the inflation rate in coming years.

<HEADLINE> Pak Ready for LPGA Giant Eagle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) -- The slump that affected Se Ri Pak at the  
beginning of this year is over. That's not good news for the rest 
of the field at the LPGA Giant Eagle Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making a stop at the tournament's media day in May, Pak  
has regained the form that helped her win three events in 24 days 
last summer. Included in that stretch was a win in last year's 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a few good weeks since I was here before,'' Pak said  
at the Avalon Lakes Golf Course, where she prepared to defend her 
title starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had two wins and last week I had another top 10. I still had  
a good feeling even when I didn't win. I know now I can trust 
myself and my game more. I have good confidence in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak finished no higher than 11th in her first 11 tour  
appearances this season, but started to put her game back together 
when she finished in a fourth-place tie at the Rochester 
International in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	One week later, she won the ShopRite LPGA Classic, then tied for  
seventh at the LPGA Championship. She won the Jamie Farr Kroger 
Classic in Toledo after that, then tied for 10th at the JAL Big 
Apple Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak jumped into the national spotlight over a year ago, when she  
won the LPGA Championship -- her first major -- in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak then edged Jenny Chuasiriporn in a 20-hole playoff at the  
U.S. Women's Open in July. She followed that with a win at the 
Jamie Farr, in which she shattered the LPGA 18-hole record with a 
10-under-par 61 in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, Pak won the Giant Eagle.  
</P>
<P>
	By the time she returned to South Korea in the fall, she was a  
national hero, with media representatives following her everywhere. 
But the adulation eventually wore her down and she was hospitalized 
for exhaustion in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak's play suffered when she returned to the tour this year, but  
with good reason, according to Juli Inkster, who won this year's 
U.S. Women's Open and LPGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to imagine what she has gone through,'' Inkster  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing on the tour is strenuous enough without having the  
added pressure of playing for your nation each time you tee it up, 
Inkster added. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak acknowledged that some of her problems resulted from  
managing her time poorly and the strain of devoting so much of it 
to the media. But the attention has dwindled a bit this year, 
giving her a reprieve from the spotlight and a chance to refocus on 
her game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are a lot better this year,'' Pak said. ``Now I have a  
good schedule. Last year, I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still tired, but I'm happy.''

<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Columbia blasted off  
early Friday with the world's most powerful X-ray telescope and 
Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a U.S. space flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Her debut was delayed three days by faulty hydrogen  
measurements, then lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eileen, Just Do It!!!'' read a sign waved by a female space  
worker as Collins headed to the pad. In her other hand was the 
sign: ``Don't Come Back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure was on. If the space shuttle didn't lift off on try  
No. 3, it would have been grounded for a month at a cost of 
millions of dollars. The telescope-delivery mission already is 
almost one year late.

<P>
	In a superstitious jab at Steven Hawley, who's endured 13 launch  
delays in his astronaut career, several workers held sheets of 
white paper in front of their faces as disguises. And once again 
Hawley pulled a brown paper bag over his head before boarding 
Columbia late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms took NASA by surprise early Thursday and prevented  
Columbia from blasting off with Collins, the first woman to lead a 
mission in 38 years of U.S. human space flight, and the $1.5 
billion Chandra X-ray Observatory. On Tuesday, a hydrogen leak 
scare in the final seconds of the countdown scuttled everything. It 
turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Columbia rose from its seaside pad in a brilliant flash of light  
at 12:31 a.m., a little late because of last-minute trouble with a 
communication link. A half-moon gleamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins reported a fuel cell problem within seconds of lifting  
off, but Mission Control assured her that everything seemed to be 
fine and that it was a faulty reading. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see you in five days,'' Collins said moments before  
lifting off. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea, present for the  
first two attempts, did not return to cheer on the 42-year-old Air 
Force colonel riding in Columbia's front left seat. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists, some of whom have worked on the Chandra project for  
two decades, were growing more anxious with each passing day. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``when you've waited 20 years to get the X-ray telescope on  
orbit, one additional day is not something to get particularly 
concerned about,'' said Earle Huckins, NASA's deputy associate 
administrator for space science. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-foot telescope, once released from Columbia, will spend  
at least five years searching for black holes and peering at 
galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. Astronomers hope to learn 
more about the mysterious dark matter that is believed to fill the 
universe, and better determine the distance to celestial objects. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan called for the five astronauts to eject Chandra from  
the shuttle cargo bay seven hours after liftoff. At 50,000 pounds, 
including a rocket motor and support gear, it is the heaviest 
payload ever carried by a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	To improve the odds of sending Columbia up Friday, NASA extended  
the launch window from 46 minutes to nearly two hours after new 
calculations showed that the telescope has more battery power than 
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	As it turned out, NASA did not need the extra time.  
</P>
<P>
	Friday was NASA's last chance to launch Columbia until mid- to  
late August because of the impending shutdown of Air Force launch 
facilities for more than three weeks of improvements.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- It was the 27th day of Ramadan in  
Alexandria, Egypt. Leila Ahmed was 6 or 7 when she followed her 
grandmother up the steps to the roof, the old woman's long black 
robe and veil blowing in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
	Her grandmother always wore black, mourning a son lost long ago.  
But this evening was for celebrating, she told her. In Islam's 
holiest month, this was the Night of Glory when the gates between 
heaven and Earth opened and God might send the angels. 
</P>
<P>
	The little girl sat for hours, scanning the sky for signs.  
</P>
<P>
	``The angels didn't exactly come,'' she says now, sipping tea in  
a Cambridge, Mass., hotel. ``But it was so wondrous to sit there 
waiting at my grandmother's side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prayer in the mosque is central to the lives of most Muslim men.  
Women like Ahmed's mother and grandmother rarely went to the 
mosque, she says, but they were as true to the spirit of Islam as 
any imam. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, newly appointed as the first women's studies professor at  
Harvard Divinity School, 59-year-old Ahmed hopes to unveil a hidden 
Islam, a woman's Islam, as part of her work on women in world 
religions. 
</P>
<P>
	``For women, being in tune and aware of the wonder of life was  
part of what Islam was,'' Ahmed says. ``It was not the ritualistic 
things one reads about, or the official Islam. It was about what 
sense you make of your life and how aware you were of other people 
and the stars and the rhythms of existence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those rhythms are central to her most recent book, ``A Border  
Passage: From Cairo to America - A Woman's Journey'' (Farrar, 
Straus and Giroux). In this memoir of identity across cultures, 
Ahmed looks back at a childhood immersed in a woman's Islam: the 
long hours in her grandmother's receiving room, where no men 
entered and children were privy to private conversations and 
pointed, if affectionate, imitations of pompous men. 
</P>
<P>
	Many women had a low opinion of clerics, Ahmed says, and men  
were not considered necessary intermediaries in the realm of the 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We grew up understanding that nothing came between you and  
God,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed learned about religion by watching. ``The messages were  
hidden messages: attitudes, posture, a glance of approval,'' she 
says. ``It's the lived version of Islam that's passed down from 
generation just as surely as the textual tradition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother saw herself as a religious woman, but without the  
formal trappings. 
</P>
<P>
	She always quoted one verse as summing up everything Islam  
meant: ``The person who kills one being kills all of humanity, and 
the person who gives life to one being gives life to all 
humanity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her mother went so far as to prohibit her sons from serving as  
combatants in any of the wars that wracked the Middle East. She 
could not live, she said, with knowing that she had given birth to 
a man responsible for the death of another mother's son. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Ahmed would learn of another Islam preached among men in  
the mosque, which she describes as more authoritarian and sometimes 
violent. ``But for me Islam was a pacifist, gentle tradition,'' she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Only when she began teaching women's studies at the University  
of Massachusetts did Ahmed confront the prevailing images of Islam 
in the West. Her non-Muslim colleagues seemed to have only one 
subject on their minds: female circumcision. And Ahmed found 
herself continually explaining that it was a custom that predated 
Islam, a point she reiterated in her earlier book, ``Women and 
Gender in Islam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was no apologist for violence committed in the name of Islam  
nor the repression of women in any tradition. But she was 
distressed to see her religion viewed through a single lens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to address the issue of prejudice about Islam as much as  
sexism within Islam,'' she says. ``I was really stunned at how 
unaware American feminists were of what Islam was and any 
connection between Islam and Christianity and Judaism. It was as if 
it was a religion of some wild savages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to see Islam as violent you can find a violent  
Islamic history legitimated,'' she says. ``You can also find a 
completely pacifist tradition. The debate within Islam is a mirror 
of what is going on in Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism. Whose 
tradition is valorized?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or: Whose Islam is it anyway?  
</P>
<P>
	It's a question Ahmed will address in her women's studies  
classes at Harvard tracing the development of feminist thought on 
religion, courses that will treat women's testimony with the same 
respect as religious texts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to find ways to bring what is ordinarily left out of  
academic discourse, and makes up most of our lives, into recognized 
space,'' she says. ``It's knowledge my grandmother and mother 
passed onto me that is as key as any knowledge I acquired in the 
academy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orthodox interpreters of the Koran would likely dismiss such  
knowledge, says Judith Tucker, director of the Arab studies program 
at Georgetown University. ``They think lived experience is 
irrelevant, and that a good Muslim is trying to find the meaning of 
the text,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Tucker says, more scholars are recognizing the importance  
of such experience in Islam, particularly anthropologists who study 
how oral tradition is passed down from generation to generation, 
grandmother to granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ahmed looks back fondly on her days in her grandmother's  
receiving room, a woman's space she has never been able to recreate 
in America. And she remembers evenings on the roof, particularly 
the night of the year when heaven and earth opened, and an old 
woman and young girl sat gazing at the stars.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Issues Soft Money Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley today cast  
Vice President Al Gore and Texas governor George W. Bush as 
hypocrites on campaign finance reform and promised that if he is 
the Democratic nominee he would run without so-call soft money if 
Republicans agreed to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said both Gore and Bush have said they support changing  
the soft money system, in which large, unregulated contributions to 
the parties, made primarily by unions and corporations, indirectly 
help candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	``However,'' Bradley said, ``both reportedly have directed their  
top fund-raisers to begin raising soft money to the general 
election.''. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator, who is vying with Gore for the  
Democratic nomination, outlined an altruistic proposal for campaign 
finance reform that goes beyond Senate legislation endorsed by the 
Clinton-Gore administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before the money machine start humming let's pause and think  
about a better way.'' Bradley proposed national same-day 
registration to make voting easier and a ``Voting Leave Law'' 
requiring employers to give workers at least two hours off on 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Why, he asked, is voting ``the only right that you have to  
register in advance before you can use it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he was aiming for a system where ``candidates run  
on the strength of their ideas not the weight of their wallets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign finance address is the second in a series of  
speeches in which Bradley is slowly and deliberatively rolling out 
details of his platform. He earlier outlined anti-crime 
initiatives, including handgun registration. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming up, aides said, is a plan for universal health insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks at the National Press Club, Bradley recalled --  
and quoted from -- his high school term paper on the 1896 race, in 
which John D. Rockefeller's Standard oil gave William McKinley 
$250,000 to win the White House. Such big money ``is like a great 
stone wall that comes between the people and their 
representatives,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In doing that paper, I sensed that money was to politics as  
acid is to cloth -- eating away at the fabric of democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign money should come from just two places, he said, ``One  
is from individuals -- limited and instantly reported. The second 
source, the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This assertion contrasted with Bradley's 1996 plan, when he was  
still in the Senate, which rejected public financing of Senate 
campaigns in favor of a fund built through voluntary taxpayer 
contributions added on in the tax filing process. At that time 
Bradley said public financing was like ``forcing taxpayers to fund 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the McCain-Feingold bill named for Arizona Sen. John  
McCain, a candidate for the GOP nomination, Bradley's plan would 
ban the unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties 
known as soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 presidential race, Democrats effectively used soft  
money to promote through ``issue ads'' the re-election of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley pledged to seek a compact with Republicans in next  
year's general election if he is the Democratic nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will each direct our parties not to raise or spend soft  
money in the general election for such matters as, for example, 
issue advertising,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's campaign chairman, Tony Coelho, issued a statement  
pointing out that Bradley has taken Democratic Party money in past 
elections. ``Now he would leave the party and every Democratic 
candidate ... to fend for themselves while George W. Bush and the 
Republican money machine try to buy the election,'' said Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year Senate veteran called in 1997 for an independent  
counsel to investigate the Clinton-Gore fund-raising tactics, 
including Gore's controversial stop at a Buddhist temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley made no direct reference to Gore's shared troubles with  
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Public trust in government has eroded, Bradley said.  
``Dishonesty is part of it. Every little lie erodes trust 
invisibly, like acid rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Eric Hauser said campaign finance reform would be  
Bradley's first priority in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	For congressional primaries, Bradley today proposed doubling the  
government's current 1-to-1 match of small individual contributions 
$250 or less. General elections under Bradley's plan would be 
wholly paid for with public money. In exchange, candidates would 
have to limit their spending to an amount based on local population 
and media costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley would exempt from individual contribution limits --  
currently $1,000 -- personal, grass-roots expenditures like printing 
up bumper stickers or fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for free television time for candidates 60 days  
before an election. It's the least broadcasters should do, Bradley 
said, since they get to use public airways for considerable profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue could be neutered if Congress takes action before  
Campaign 2000 begins in earnest. McCain won earlier this week the 
Republican leadership's promise for a Senate debate of the 
McCain-Feingold bill by mid-October. Clinton has said he is eager 
to sign campaign finance legislation.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Promotes CEO Michael Capellas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reaching inside its own ranks for a new leader,  
Compaq Computer Corp. named chief operating officer Michael D. 
Capellas as chief executive on Thursday in a bid to revive its 
flagging computer sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of a relatively unknown manager surprised some Wall  
Street analysts, who expected Compaq to pick an outside executive 
experienced in running a major company. Capellas, 44, was the 
company's acting chief operating officer for less than two months, 
and before that was Compaq's chief technology officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a surprise because they chose a Mr. Insider instead of a  
Mr. Outsider,'' said David Wu, an analyst with ABN AMRO Chicago 
Corp., in San Francisco. But, he added, ``I don't care where he 
comes from, it's what he does that matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas, 44, succeeds Eckhard Pfeiffer, who was forced out in  
April after Compaq's first-quarter profit came in at less than half 
of analysts' expectations. The company has been under pressure from 
Wall Street to quickly fill a yawning management gap, aggravated by 
the departure of another half-dozen top managers in Pfeiffer's 
wake. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief executive, who takes office immediately, faces a  
challenge in reviving Houston-based Compaq, which has been hit hard 
by slow computer sales and shrinking profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines President Gregory D. Brenneman and Oracle  
Corp. President Ray Lane were reported to have turned down the 
Compaq CEO job, though Compaq chairman Benjamin Rosen said that 
only Capellas was offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was only one choice,'' he said at a press conference  
announcing the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	After pioneering the market for inexpensive personal computers  
in the early 1990s, Compaq's profits have plunged amid escalating 
price wars. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring opens the door for the replacement of other key  
executive positions, including the top human-resources post. Compaq 
named an acting chief financial officer, Ben Wells. Rosen and two 
other board members have performed the duties of chief executive 
since Pfeiffer's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is expected to report a second-quarter loss of about $250  
million next week, reflecting the company's troubles in selling 
personal computers as well as bigger business machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The new CEO faces the challenge of integrating Digital Equipment  
Corp., which Compaq bought for $9 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has had trouble increasing sales of its Alpha business  
computers, which were made by Digital. And Compaq has stumbled in 
trying to cope with the more efficient sales model of Dell Computer 
Corp., which saves money by selling computers directly to 
customers, eliminating the markup charged by retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place is a hell of a challenge. I think that is going to  
be an extraordinarily difficult job,'' said Mel Connet, head of the 
Connet &AMP; Co. executive recruitment firm in Atherton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas, at the press conference in New York, gave a lively  
presentation sketching out his major areas of focus, including 
reorganizing the company, bolstering sales of PCs and big business 
machines, and simplifying the company's methods of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions about a lack of executive-level  
experience, Capellas said in part that his background as Compaq's 
chief technology officer had helped him better understand 
customers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategy is about solving customers' business problems,  
and I have done that all my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas was named acting chief operating officer on June 2,  
with responsibility for Compaq's overall strategic planning, 
organizational changes and operations. He joined Compaq as chief 
technology officer in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Compaq, Capellas headed up software maker Oracle  
Corp.'s sales to oil and gas companies. Before that, he was with 
Schlumberger Ltd., an oil-field services company, for 18 years in a 
variety of management positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Compaq had chosen Capellas above a field of  
candidates because he had a track record in improving the company's 
management, technology and distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set out to find the ideal CEO and we discovered him right  
here at Compaq, hard at work,'' Rosen said. ``As COO, Michael has 
already mobilized the organization, moving us forward at Internet 
speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Compaq were down $1.06 1/4, or by 4 percent, at $24.93 3/4  
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange before the news was 
announced at the close of financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Watches Out for Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Using tough language that jolted Wall Street,  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan pledged Thursday to move 
``promptly and forcefully'' to counter inflation if the need 
arises. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's blunt talk, which also included new expressions of  
concern about the high-flying stock market, was seen as an 
unmistakable warning that future Fed rate increases were on the 
way. One analyst called it a ``stern lecture'' to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock prices, which had been hitting new highs on the belief  
that the Fed would be slow to boost interest rates further, 
initially plunged by more than 100 points on Greenspan's comments. 
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day down 33.56. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices fell sharply as well with the big drop in demand  
pushing the yield on Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond up to 5.97 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While declaring that the U.S. economy so far is enjoying an  
``exceptional year,'' Greenspan left no doubt that the central bank 
was ready to follow up last month's quarter-point increase in 
interest rates, the first in two years, with further increases 
should the need arise. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments, which came as he delivered the Fed's  
midyear economic report to Congress, were a lot tougher than 
investors had been expecting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I viewed Mr. Greenspan's testimony as a stern lecture to the  
stock market,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo 
in Minneapolis. ``He gave the market a cold shower to try to cool 
it down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed on June 30 nudged up to 5 percent its target for the  
federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other, 
triggering an immediate quarter-point increase in banks' prime 
lending rate, the benchmark for millions of consumer and small 
business loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street rallied after that rate hike because the Fed  
immediately announced it was moving its policy directive -- an 
indication of future moves -- from one leaning toward tightening 
back to neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Greenspan's comments Thursday were a strong  
indication the policy directive will now be switched back at the 
August meeting to one leaning toward higher rates. And many 
analysts said they were looking for the Fed to follow with one or 
two more rate hikes, beginning in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted a number of concerns about inflation coming from  
tight labor markets. He also cautioned that investors had become 
too confident that recent strong gains in productivity would 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
	If productivity does not continue rising at its recent pace and  
if red-hot consumer demand does not moderate, he said, then ``the 
economy could overheat. That would engender inflationary pressures 
and put the sustainability of this unprecedented period of 
remarkable growth in jeopardy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of this threat, Greenspan said, ``the Federal Reserve  
will have to act promptly and forcefully so as to preclude 
imbalances from arising that would only require more disruptive 
adjustments later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Greenspan became chairman in 1987, a common mistake at  
the Fed had been waiting too long to battle rising inflation, 
requiring even steeper hikes in interest rates and eventually 
pushing the country into a recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, who first worried about ``irrational exuberance'' in  
the stock market in December 1996, re-emphasized those concerns 
Thursday. He said that recent record highs in stock prices could be 
indicating the presence of an ``asset bubble,'' meaning when prices 
burst and fall back to more realistic levels, investors could face 
painful losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the job of economic policy-makers to mitigate the  
fallout ... and hopefully ease the transition to the next 
expansion,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems Greenspan wasn't happy with the financial markets'  
favorable response to his shift to a neutral policy stance in 
June,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; 
Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said 1999 thus far has been ``an exceptional year for  
the American economy'' with almost 1.25 million jobs being created 
and no pickup yet in consumer prices, he said. But he devoted the 
bulk of his testimony to stressing the need for ``pre-emptive 
policy-making,'' saying this was critical to keeping the 8-year-old 
economic expansion, already the longest in peacetime history, 
steaming ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed released a revised economic forecast predicting a slight  
slowdown in economic growth for the rest of this year and a bigger 
slowing in 2000 with a modest pickup in inflation. That tracked 
closely with recent forecasts by the administration and the 
Congressional Budget Office.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Steel Imports Drop in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steel imports declined 13 percent in June, the  
Commerce Department said today in a report the Clinton 
administration hailed as evidence that its trade policy is sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``As I have said repeatedly, we've turned back last year's surge  
of imports,'' said Commerce Secretary William Daley. The report 
said the decrease in imports in June followed a 30 percent increase 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley has been seeking to defend the administration's measured  
response to low-priced imports, which the U.S. steel industry 
blames for massive layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Daley also said the administration ``will remain vigilant  
and will continue to monitor the situation closely to ensure that 
the success we have seen to date is not eroded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has been a thorny one for President Clinton and gives  
Vice President Al Gore potential headaches as he courts organized 
labor for next year's presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	Steelworkers have complained that the administration has done  
too little and have found little solace in the recent import 
figures, which show reductions in some months but increases in 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been an inconsistency in the number of imports,''  
said Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala. ``We cannot be fooled with a game 
of numbers. ... I will be more encouraged when I see statistics 
showing more security of jobs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In preliminary figures, the Commerce Department said imports  
totaled 2.7 million metric tons in June, down from 3 million a 
month earlier. Imports rose 30 percent in May, following a drop in 
April, an increase in March and another reduction in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Since November, when the Commerce Department first threatened  
punitive tariffs on shipments of the industry's core product, 
imports have gone down 27 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1999, imports totaled 15.1 million  
metric tons. That is still higher than the 14.7 million in the 
first half of 1997, before the Asian economic crisis reduced demand 
for steel abroad and prompted foreign producers to sell their 
excesses in the healthy U.S. market. Steel imports in the first 
half of 1998 totaled 16.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The June decline reflected reductions primarily in shipments  
from Japan and Mexico. Indonesia, India and Spain also posted large 
decreases. Steel numbers for Brazil and Russia, two countries that 
agreed this month to curb shipments in order to avoid tariffs, 
changed little in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been reluctant to take action beyond  
granting industry's requests for tariffs for fear of starting a 
trade war that could hurt other U.S. industries' ability to ship 
goods overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	But each tariff request, targeting one variety of steel at a  
time, takes nearly a year to investigate and costs the industry 
more than $1 million in legal fees. Industry officials fear that as 
tariffs are imposed on one product, foreign countries simply would 
shift to other products, necessitating additional costly filings.

<HEADLINE> TWA Workers Ratify Labor Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- TWA's two-year labor dispute with its  
machinists is over. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members have ratified a contract with Trans World  
Airlines, averting for at least 18 months a strike that threatened 
to cripple the airline. Union spokesman Bob Haynes would not 
release the vote count Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, 16,000 union mechanics, ramp workers, ticket  
agents and flight attendants will get double-digit pay raises, 
bringing them up to 90 percent of the projected industry wage 
standard by summer 2001. The contract takes effect Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased it passed,'' Haynes said.  
</P>
<P>
	TWA officials were pleased as well.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can put aside the rancor associated with negotiating new  
contracts and focus on the future,'' TWA president and chief 
executive William Compton said. ``We're going to make this a 
company TWA employees are proud of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company went through its second bankruptcy in 1995, and no  
major airline has endured three. An overly ambitious schedule 
expansion and the crash of TWA Flight 800 plunged the company into 
the red in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first half of this decade, this was basically a  
company that was being managed to survive,'' Compton said. ``We now 
need to make the transition to manage this company to prosper.''

<HEADLINE> No McNown as Bears Arrive at Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLATTEVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- It's time for training camp for the  
Chicago Bears and that means one thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The first-round draft pick is a no-show.  
</P>
<P>
	While the rest of the Bears settled in to their dormitory rooms  
Thursday at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville -- center Olin 
Kreutz brought a television and most of his teammates were toting 
their own pillows -- quarterback Cade McNown was nowhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	Not exactly a great start for the Dick Jauron era, especially  
after the Bears waived veteran quarterback Erik Kramer two days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we'd like to get him signed and get him here  
tomorrow,'' the first-year coach said. ``He needs the work. He 
needs to see all the things that can happen, and he needs to see it 
on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Big-time draft picks who show up late for camp are a little too  
familiar for the Bears. Heisman Trophy winner Rashaan Salaam missed 
the first two weeks of camp in 1995 and barely knew the playbook by 
the time the season started. He ended up rushing for 1,074 yards, 
but also fumbled nine times. 
</P>
<P>
	Curtis Enis, picked fifth overall last year, missed almost all  
of training camp in an acrimonious holdout. He had a lot of work to 
make up by the time he finally arrived, and not just on the field. 
Holdouts don't usually go over well when the rest of the team is 
running around in heavy pads in hot, sticky weather a couple of 
hours from home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cade is going to make his bed. He's going to make his bed nice  
and soft, or he's going to make it hard,'' Enis said. ``But he's 
going to have to lay on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I made my bed hard, and I had to lay on it,'' he said. ``Cade  
holds his destiny in his hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown won't officially be a holdout until the first practice  
Friday morning, but the fact he hasn't signed yet makes the timing 
of Kramer's release all the more baffling. Picked 12th overall in 
this year's draft, it's no secret McNown is Chicago's future. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if McNown is ready to start by the time the season  
begins, he still needs a solid backup. The Bears should know that 
better than any team. When Kramer got hurt last year -- he missed 
the last eight games with shoulder and neck injuries -- there was no 
one who could adequately replace him. Rick Mirer was long gone, cut 
before training camp ended, Steve Stenstrom was ineffective and 
Moses Moreno was just a rookie. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened? The Bears lost seven of their last eight games,  
finished 4-12 for a second straight season and Dave Wannstedt was 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears have three other quarterbacks on their roster --  
Moreno, Shane Matthews and Jim Miller -- but they have a whopping 
two NFL starts between them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think there's any reason to pursue the Erik Kramer  
thing any further,'' Jauron said. ``We told him as early as we made 
the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears can't just sit around and wait for McNown to show up,  
so the other three quarterbacks will get plenty of work. Other than 
that, camp will proceed as planned, Jauron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-a-days start Friday morning, and Jauron planned to meet with  
the team Thursday night. McNown's absence wasn't going to be part 
of the discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to make it sound like I've been around a long  
time,'' he said. ``But I have been in the NFL for 20 years and I've 
seen a lot of situations. It'll work out. I believe it will work 
out.''

<HEADLINE> New Drug May Help Stroke Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An experimental drug appears in laboratory  
tests to reduce by about half the brain cell death that follows a 
stroke, researchers report today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug, tested so far only in mice, may some day offer hope  
for the 500,000 Americans who suffer strokes each year, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. David Pinsky, a researcher at the Columbia University  
College of Physicians and Surgeons, said the drug appears to stop 
two neuron-killing reactions that usually follow a stroke caused by 
a blocked blood vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	``After a stroke, there is an immune system reaction that acts  
like a cluster bomb attack in the brain,'' said Pinsky, the senior 
author of the Science study. The reactions involve immune system 
cells that kill neurons directly, and an inflammation in vessels 
that slows the flow of blood and oxygen to the stroke site. 
</P>
<P>
	Both of these actions cause ``collateral damage,'' killing  
neurons that may not have been involved in the original stroke, 
said Pinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The new drug molecule appears to at least partially block both  
of these stroke reactions and to significantly limit the collateral 
damage to the brains when given to mice 45 minutes after the 
animals have been artificially induced to have strokes, said 
Pinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Pan Ganguly, a researcher at the National Heart, Lung and  
Blood Institute, said the Pinsky study ``is an important piece of 
work'' that could lead to a new way to treat strokes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said that ``after a stroke, the damaging process can continue  
for quite a while,'' and finding a drug to stop this process is 
``an important advance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ganguly cautioned the drug, so far, has been studied only in  
animals and that it may be a long time before its benefits are 
proven in human patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have a lot of reservations about this drug, but it is  
a novel approach in an area where we desperately need new 
therapeutics,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the American Heart Association, about 500,000  
Americans suffer strokes annually. Also called ``brain attacks,'' 
strokes kill about 150,000 Americans each year and are the 
third-biggest cause of death after heart disease and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability. There are  
about 4 million American stroke survivors, many of whom have 
difficulties with speech, walking or caring for themselves. The 
direct and indirect annual cost of strokes has been estimated at 
about $41 billion annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Strokes caused by vessel blockage, ischemic strokes, are often  
treated now by drugs called ``clot busters,'' which dissolve clots 
that cause strokes when they block the flow of blood and oxygen to 
brain cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky said the drug he is studying has a different function  
from the clot busters, and the two drugs, in theory, would be used 
together to limit stroke damage. 
</P>
<P>
	After a stroke, the researcher said, nearby neurons are often  
damaged. They respond to the damage by showing a molecule, called 
C1q, on the cell surface. This triggers a type of immune response, 
called complement, and activates a type of cell called the 
microglia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microglia are responsible for basically consuming debris or  
injured cells,'' said Pinsky. After a stroke, the microglia will 
kill the injured neurons that might otherwise survive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complement process, he said, ``sets off a cascade'' that  
includes inflammation of nearby vessels. This reduces blood and 
oxygen flow to nearby neurons. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinsky said the new drug blocks microglia from attacking damaged  
neurons and prevents the inflammation of nearby vessels.

<HEADLINE> No Decision on Strawberry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The date for Darryl Strawberry's suspension to  
be reviewed by commissioner Bud Selig came and went Thursday with 
no announcements or decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry's 120-day suspension, imposed after he pleaded no  
contest to cocaine possession and solicitation charges, runs 
through Aug. 11. But Selig promised to review the case July 22 
because of ``mitigating health factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the confrontation between baseball and its umpires,  
however, Selig didn't consider the matter at all Thursday, baseball 
spokesman Rich Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig does not plan to alter Strawberry's status, according to a  
baseball official speaking on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	That means Strawberry will continue working out at the Yankees'  
training complex in Tampa, Fla. The 37-year-old outfielder will be 
eligible to join one of New York's minor league teams on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has been searching for help in left field all season.  
Shane Spencer, on the disabled list while undergoing treatment for 
an irregular heartbeat, seems to be the No. 1 choice of Yankees 
manager Joe Torre. Spencer, who is about to start a minor league 
rehab assignment, is hitting .243 with six homers and 12 RBIs is 
107 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Ledee, getting most of the playing time while Spencer has  
been disabled, is hitting .247 with three homers and 13 RBIs in 89 
at-bats.

	Families Bid Farewell to JFK Jr.  
</P>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- A brass quintet from the Newport Navy  
Band played ``Eternal Father,'' a Navy hymn, as the ashes of John 
F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and sister-in-law were cast into the 
ocean. The Rev. Louis Iasiello, who participated in today's 
memorial service for the three aboard a Navy destroyer, said the 
ceremony was ``very simple, but very solemn.'' The bodies were 
recovered last night from the wreckage of their plane, which 
crashed Friday night in the waters off Martha's Vineyard. The 
medical examiner said the three died on impact.

notes and bouquets. About 100 bouquets had been left outside the 
front door of the Church of St. Thomas More by noon. Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s uncle, will deliver a eulogy at the Mass 
tomorrow morning, according to a source close to the family. About 
350 people were invited to the private service.

indicted on a capital murder charge today for the slaying of a 
doctor, one of nine people he is suspected of killing. Prosecutors 
said they have not made the final determination whether to seek the 
death penalty. Arraignment was set for tomorrow. Maturino Resendiz, 
39, is already charged in four slayings in Illinois, Texas and 
Kentucky. Police say evidence links him to five other Texas 
killings. Thursday's indictment stems from the December beating and 
stabbing death of Dr. Claudia Benton.

surprised Wall Street analysts, who expected Compaq to pick an 
outside executive experienced in running a major company. Capellas, 
44, was the company's acting chief operating officer for less than 
two months, and before that was chief technology officer. He

<HEADLINE> Cohen To Work on Pentagon's Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen promised  
Thursday to work with Capitol Hill on complaints of Pentagon 
misspending. ``We're bound to have some deficiencies,'' he 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen responded to a congressional committee report that accuses  
the Defense Department of spending money on canceled programs and 
illegally redirecting other funds. Cohen said its conclusions are 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is attached to the $266 billion defense bill next on  
the House agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	A major Pentagon concern in the bill is a halt in orders for the  
F-22 stealth fighter, which the Air Force says would kill a $200 
million-plus plane vital to continued U.S. air supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The same House Appropriations Committee report says the military  
appears unable to control the F-22's rising costs and can maintain 
a 5-1 advanced fighter advantage through 2010 without it. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the report details the need for increased defense  
spending that would exceed Clinton's requested Pentagon budget by 
nearly $3 billion. The House bill calls for $15.5 billion more than 
last year's appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the size and complexity of the Pentagon's  
responsibilities and its need for flexibility, the report says the 
committee is ``little short of amazed'' at some of its failings, 
including expenditure of $2 million on a canceled missile system. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, however, suggests no total for misspending. It  
cites several instances where the Pentagon failed to give required 
notice to Congress that it was redirecting funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the report gives a misleading impression but  
acknowledged the inevitability of deficiencies, given the enormous 
number of military programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to reporters' questions, he said the report ``comes  
as somewhat of a surprise to all of us in the Pentagon,'' 
considering that it cites problems with only six of the 5,000 
military projects managed by the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is quite a significant statement in itself, that about  
99.9 percent of the time we seem to be doing things right,'' Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He promised, nonetheless, to work with congressional  
appropriators on ``any deficiencies or allegations of failure to 
comply with the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, who spent 24 years in Congress as a Maine Republican,  
said that in some cases the language in laws worked out between 
conflicting House and Senate versions is ``left ambiguous.'' That 
can lead to uncertainty over requirements for the Pentagon, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, too, acknowledges that the appropriations process  
always has involved discussions over ``budget rules and appropriate 
procedures regarding the use of appropriated funds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It notes that recent years of spending cuts for defense have put  
pressure on the Pentagon to deal with weapons modernization 
demands, but says this is no excuse for defying laws passed by 
Congress.

<HEADLINE> `Action' Has Expletives Deleted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With ``Action,'' the BLEEP is gonna fly.  
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other broadcast series, which stick to some semblance of  
family-friendly language, Fox's fall comedy ``Action'' uncorks the 
expletives -- then uproariously bleeps them. 
</P>
<P>
	At first blush, habitual bleeping would seem enough to set  
``Action'' apart from everything else in prime time. (Though not 
daytime: any single ``Jerry Springer Show'' could out-bleep a 
year's worth of ``Action'' episodes.) But ``Action'' is 
distinguished by more than a gimmick. There's much more to this 
racy spoof of Hollywood than conspicuously absent four-letter 
words. 
</P>
<P>
	``Action'' is funny, fresh (in more than one sense of the word)  
and smart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to think of it as sophisticated vulgarity,'' says Chris  
Thompson, its creator. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever else may be in store, ``Action,'' which premieres Sept.  
16 at 9:30 p.m. EDT, should rock the fall season. While cultural 
Pharisees foam at the mouth, ``Action'' is certain to keep its fans 
wildly amused. 
</P>
<P>
	After a half-century of programmers' jitters that if a show went  
too far it might just sail off the edge of the Earth, ``Action'' 
could be the show that proves the world is round. Indeed, if its 
pilot episode is any indication, ``Action'' could be the biggest 
broadcast-series breakthrough since ``Hill Street Blues,'' while 
stirring up more trouble than ``Ellen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I predict that the people who usually get outraged will be  
outraged,'' says Thompson, ``and I predict that the network will be 
extremely nervous as the first six or so episodes unspool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Action'' stars Jay Mohr as the young, hot-tempered, utterly  
unscrupulous producer Peter Dragon. His specialty is big-budget 
action pictures -- the more explosive and brutish the better. 
</P>
<P>
	In the pilot, he takes up with a hooker (the wonderful Illeana  
Douglas), whom he commissions to provide an additional service: 
advice on promising film projects. 
</P>
<P>
	An embarrassing administrative foul-up comes to light. Instead  
of signing talented screenwriter Alan Rifkin to write ``Beverly 
Hills Death Squad,'' Peter's minions have signed sitcom hack Adam 
Rafkin to write ``Beverly Hills Gun Club.'' Peter goes ballistic 
and outrageously says: ``Are you telling me we spent a quarter of a 
million dollars and we got the wrong Jew?!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is pitched by a talent agent with a client better known than  
Tom Hanks, yet willing to work for scale. Turns out it's O.J. 
Simpson. Peter throws him out, then privately marvels, ``God, he's 
a good agent!'' 
</P>
<P>
	He takes an awkward meeting with the tough-as-nails studio boss,  
who is: married to Peter's ex-wife; gay; and, stepping out of the 
shower, able to strike Peter dumb with the spectacle of what he 
later describes as ``an anaconda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And just to set the mood early on, the first scene has Peter  
bullying a worker from the studio commissary in a fusillade of 
bleeps. If HE were the lowly employee, Peter sneers, he would 
perform a retaliatory act in the kitchen ``every BLEEP day, so 
every one of those BLEEP in that commissary would have had a little 
taste of Peter BLEEP Dragon!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a monster,'' Thompson chuckles during a recent phone  
interview. ``Self-involved, abusive, with not the greatest moral 
center on the planet. The only thing that redeems him is, there are 
other people in Hollywood who are worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delicious. But how did this shockingly direct, hilariously bawdy  
take on Tinseltown find its way onto Fox's lineup? Watching the 
pilot, any viewer familiar with ``Arli$$,'' ``The Sopranos'' and 
especially ``The Larry Sanders Show'' would swear ``Action'' is an 
HBO escapee. 
</P>
<P>
	It is. The premium-cable network HBO is where it originated,  
courtesy of bona fide action-movie producer Joel Silver (``Die 
Hard''), who was asked to capture the film industry drolly on film. 
</P>
<P>
	To write the pilot script, Silver brought in Thompson, a TV  
veteran whose varied credits include ``Larry Sanders,'' ``Naked 
Truth'' and ``Bosom Buddies,'' and who this fall unveils a family 
sitcom, ``Ladies Man,'' on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	HBO let ``Action'' go. Then the script fell into the hands of  
Fox President Doug Herzog, just arrived after three years heading 
up cable's Comedy Central. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson recalls asking Herzog, ``Are you really willing to do  
the most outrageous show on TV?'' Herzog's reply: ``Yes, if it's 
also the funniest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Which ``Action'' may prove to be. In any case, the series the  
audience will see on Fox is essentially the same as the one created 
for HBO. The same, that is, other than those bleeps. But that's OK. 
They draw more attention to the naughtiness, and milk it for more 
laughs.

<HEADLINE> Pak Ready for LPGA Giant Eagle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOWLAND, Ohio (AP) -- The slump that affected Se Ri Pak at the  
beginning of this year is over. That's not good news for the rest 
of the field at the LPGA Giant Eagle Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Since making a stop at the tournament's media day in May, Pak  
has regained the form that helped her win three events in 24 days 
last summer. Included in that stretch was a win in last year's 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a few good weeks since I was here before,'' Pak said  
at the Avalon Lakes Golf Course, where she prepared to defend her 
title starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had two wins and last week I had another top 10. I still had  
a good feeling even when I didn't win. I know now I can trust 
myself and my game more. I have good confidence in myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pak finished no higher than 11th in her first 11 tour  
appearances this season, but started to put her game back together 
when she finished in a fourth-place tie at the Rochester 
International in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
	One week later, she won the ShopRite LPGA Classic, then tied for  
seventh at the LPGA Championship. She won the Jamie Farr Kroger 
Classic in Toledo after that, then tied for 10th at the JAL Big 
Apple Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak jumped into the national spotlight over a year ago, when she  
won the LPGA Championship -- her first major -- in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak then edged Jenny Chuasiriporn in a 20-hole playoff at the  
U.S. Women's Open in July. She followed that with a win at the 
Jamie Farr, in which she shattered the LPGA 18-hole record with a 
10-under-par 61 in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks later, Pak won the Giant Eagle.  
</P>
<P>
	By the time she returned to South Korea in the fall, she was a  
national hero, with media representatives following her everywhere. 
But the adulation eventually wore her down and she was hospitalized 
for exhaustion in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak's play suffered when she returned to the tour this year, but  
with good reason, according to Juli Inkster, who won this year's 
U.S. Women's Open and LPGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to imagine what she has gone through,'' Inkster  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing on the tour is strenuous enough without having the  
added pressure of playing for your nation each time you tee it up, 
Inkster added. 
</P>
<P>
	Pak acknowledged that some of her problems resulted from  
managing her time poorly and the strain of devoting so much of it 
to the media. But the attention has dwindled a bit this year, 
giving her a reprieve from the spotlight and a chance to refocus on 
her game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are a lot better this year,'' Pak said. ``Now I have a  
good schedule. Last year, I didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still tired, but I'm happy.''

<HEADLINE> Carlos Moya Eyes Top Ranking Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Carlos Moya, intent on regaining the  
No. 1 ranking, routed Fernando Meligeni of Brazil 6-4, 6-3 Thursday 
to reach the quarterfinals of the $1 million Mercedes Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya became the first Spanish man to hold the No. 1 ranking in  
March and is now No. 9. His ranking plummeted after lost in the 
round of 16 at the French Open, where he was defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was the No. 1 and that's where I want to be again,'' said  
Moya, seeded second. 
</P>
<P>
	Chile's Marcelo Rios, seeded third and another former No. 1,  
ousted Germany's Jens Knippschild 6-4, 6-4 despite being broken 
three times on the clay courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Moya next faces Tommy Haas, the seventh-seeded German who  
struggled past Norway's Christian Ruud 7-5, 6-3. Haas, an 
Australian Open semifinalist, let seven first-set points slip away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I failed to close the door in the first set because I risked  
too much,'' he said. ``But those things happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament lost two seeded players -- No. 8 Dominik Hrbaty of  
Slovakia and No. 12 Francisco Clavet of Spain. Ecuador's Nicolas 
Lapentti beat Hrbaty 7-5, 6-3, and Jiri Novak of the Czech Republic 
downed Clavet 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Promotes CEO Michael Capellas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Reaching inside its own ranks for a new leader,  
Compaq Computer Corp. named chief operating officer Michael D. 
Capellas as chief executive on Thursday in a bid to revive its 
flagging computer sales and profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of a relatively unknown manager surprised some Wall  
Street analysts, who expected Compaq to pick an outside executive 
experienced in running a major company. Capellas, 44, was the 
company's acting chief operating officer for less than two months, 
and before that was Compaq's chief technology officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a surprise because they chose a Mr. Insider instead of a  
Mr. Outsider,'' said David Wu, an analyst with ABN AMRO Chicago 
Corp., in San Francisco. But, he added, ``I don't care where he 
comes from, it's what he does that matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas, 44, succeeds Eckhard Pfeiffer, who was forced out in  
April after Compaq's first-quarter profit came in at less than half 
of analysts' expectations. The company has been under pressure from 
Wall Street to quickly fill a yawning management gap, aggravated by 
the departure of another half-dozen top managers in Pfeiffer's 
wake. 
</P>
<P>
	The new chief executive, who takes office immediately, faces a  
challenge in reviving Houston-based Compaq, which has been hit hard 
by slow computer sales and shrinking profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental Airlines President Gregory D. Brenneman and Oracle  
Corp. President Ray Lane were reported to have turned down the 
Compaq CEO job, though Compaq chairman Benjamin Rosen said that 
only Capellas was offered the job. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was only one choice,'' he said at a press conference  
announcing the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	After pioneering the market for inexpensive personal computers  
in the early 1990s, Compaq's profits have plunged amid escalating 
price wars. 
</P>
<P>
	The hiring opens the door for the replacement of other key  
executive positions, including the top human-resources post. Compaq 
named an acting chief financial officer, Ben Wells. Rosen and two 
other board members have performed the duties of chief executive 
since Pfeiffer's departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is expected to report a second-quarter loss of about $250  
million next week, reflecting the company's troubles in selling 
personal computers as well as bigger business machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The new CEO faces the challenge of integrating Digital Equipment  
Corp., which Compaq bought for $9 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has had trouble increasing sales of its Alpha business  
computers, which were made by Digital. And Compaq has stumbled in 
trying to cope with the more efficient sales model of Dell Computer 
Corp., which saves money by selling computers directly to 
customers, eliminating the markup charged by retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The place is a hell of a challenge. I think that is going to  
be an extraordinarily difficult job,'' said Mel Connet, head of the 
Connet &AMP; Co. executive recruitment firm in Atherton, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas, at the press conference in New York, gave a lively  
presentation sketching out his major areas of focus, including 
reorganizing the company, bolstering sales of PCs and big business 
machines, and simplifying the company's methods of distribution. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to questions about a lack of executive-level  
experience, Capellas said in part that his background as Compaq's 
chief technology officer had helped him better understand 
customers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategy is about solving customers' business problems,  
and I have done that all my life,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Capellas was named acting chief operating officer on June 2,  
with responsibility for Compaq's overall strategic planning, 
organizational changes and operations. He joined Compaq as chief 
technology officer in August 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining Compaq, Capellas headed up software maker Oracle  
Corp.'s sales to oil and gas companies. Before that, he was with 
Schlumberger Ltd., an oil-field services company, for 18 years in a 
variety of management positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said Compaq had chosen Capellas above a field of  
candidates because he had a track record in improving the company's 
management, technology and distribution system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We set out to find the ideal CEO and we discovered him right  
here at Compaq, hard at work,'' Rosen said. ``As COO, Michael has 
already mobilized the organization, moving us forward at Internet 
speed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Compaq were down $1.06 1/4, or by 4 percent, at $24.93 3/4  
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange before the news was 
announced at the close of financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Wanted: Heir For $375,000 Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clayton Goward has a $375,000 estate but no  
suitable heir. His solution? An ad in the Star Tribune newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``My estate is sizable and I have no worthy heirs,'' the July 11  
ad said. ``I need a solution now. If you have had this same problem 
and have found an answer, please write.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of Thursday, the 79-year-old Goward had received 32  
responses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the letters came from people who told him they were in  
dire straits and could use his money. Some were from churches and 
charities. Others just contained advice, such as the note from a 
sheriff who ``had nothing to say but `be careful,''' Goward said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goward is not sure what he's looking for, but he knows none of  
the letters has particularly moved him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I haven't opened up a can of worms,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Goward got divorced long ago, and his three sons grew up with  
their mother in northern Minnesota. He lived in Minneapolis then 
and didn't see them much. Their relationships are still strained, 
though he said he has tried to make amends, visiting them 
occasionally and giving them money. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were young, I wasn't with them. I can understand  
that. But I'm a better person now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goward had colon cancer surgery in December, and although he is  
recovering very well, he has no way of knowing how much longer he 
will live. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his house and his 13-acre lot about 60 miles north of  
Minneapolis, plus his other investments, easily bring his net worth 
up to $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to be able to leave it to someone who loves me,  
but I haven't found anybody like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Goward's sons, David Goward of Cloquet, wasn't home on  
Thursday but told the Star Tribune he tries not to dwell on their 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's entitled to do what he wants to do,'' he told the  
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A local talk radio host has invited Goward and his sons on her  
show to work things out. Goward said he is considering it. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Embassy OK on CIA Maps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA has found maps showing the correct  
location of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade that NATO mistakenly 
bombed on May 7, but accurate maps were never consulted by target 
planners, CIA director George Tenet said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying before a House committee today, Tenet also said that  
some CIA employees were aware of the correct location of the 
Chinese Embassy but they were not part of the target planning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Intelligence Committee today held a long-delayed  
hearing into the accidental bombing of the embassy, a strike that 
had been aimed at a Yugoslav military and weapons procurement 
headquarters. The mistaken location of that headquarters, combined 
with outdated maps and databases that showed the Chinese Embassy in 
a previous location in Belgrade, led to the accidental bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have subsequently found maps which show the correct current  
location of the Chinese Embassy although there are others, 
including some produced after 1996 by the Yugoslav government, 
which do not,'' Tenet told the committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of our employees knew the location of the Chinese  
Embassy,'' Tenet said. ``But keep in mind that we were not looking 
for it. None of these individuals were consulted as the target was 
selected and reviewed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO was attempting to bomb the Yugoslav Federal Directorate for  
Supply and Procurement in the new section of Belgrade. The actual 
directorate of headquarters turned out to be about 300 yards away. 
The CIA's target planners had a correct address for the directorate 
but mis-located on street maps and satellite imagery of Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet's testimony marks the first time the CIA has publicly  
acknowledged that it had maps and employees that could have told 
target planners of the correct location of the Chinese Embassy. In 
previous briefings, CIA officials said that none of the maps and 
databases available to the agency had the embassy's correct 
location. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the CIA was not intending to target the embassy and  
therefore was not looking for it, Tenet said that had target 
planners consulted knowledgeable individuals for accurate maps the 
error in pinpointing the Yugoslav directorate would have become 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	Also testifying today was Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre,  
the No. 2 CIA official. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre said that despite Tenet's testimony, he considered the  
bombing error being primarily the Pentagon's responsibility, not 
the CIA's. In particular Hamre said that the process of developing 
``no strike'' lists with information about schools, hospitals, 
embassies, and other facilities to be avoided, is clearly flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system is inadequate because it is currently dependent on  
databases which are not adequately updated, '' Hamre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that no one wanted to attack the Chinese Embassy.  
What is embarrassing to me is that no one knew where the Chinese 
Embassy really was,'' Hamre said. ``There were a few individuals in 
our government who knew where it really was, but they were not 
consulted where the target was.''

<HEADLINE> Saudi Princess Bids for Denver Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- John Elway faces some unusual competition in his  
bid to buy Denver's NHL and NBA teams -- a Saudi princess. 
</P>
<P>
	An investment bank is brokering the sale of the Denver Nuggets,  
the Colorado Avalanche and the Pepsi Center. Four formal offers 
were received Wednesday -- one from a group that includes the former 
Broncos quarterback and another from Princess Thara al Saud of 
Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Her bid was formally presented. She complied with the bid  
requirements,'' said Charles Grantham, a former NBA union head and 
the sports business adviser of the princess. ``She's in it to win 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The princess was born in the United States and is the widow of  
Prince Mohammed Abdul Aziz, a nephew of King Fahd who died in a 
plane crash 23 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Grantham said the princess had met with representatives of  
another recent retiree -- Michael Jordan -- in an attempt to interest 
him in investing in her bid. But he said there had been no response 
from the former Chicago Bulls great. 
</P>
<P>
	David Falk, Jordan's agent, said reports that Jordan might join  
the princess' bid are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Elway is a minority partner in a group led by Denver financier  
Bjorn Erik Borgen. The group also includes former ski mogul George 
Gillett. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good group of people he is dealing with and a great  
business venture,'' said Elway's business manager, Jeff Sperbeck. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other investor groups are bidding for the sports properties  
of Ascent Entertainment Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	A group led by Colorado banker Donald Sturm, whose earlier bid  
for Ascent was rebuffed, and a group led Snapple beverage magnate 
Nelson Peltz would not say Wednesday if they were among the 
bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent, a publicly held Denver corporation, agreed in March to  
sell the Nuggets, the Avalanche and the Pepsi Center -- which is 
being built for the NBA and NHL teams -- to Bill Laurie and Wal-Mart 
heiress Nancy Walton Laurie for $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But that deal was sidelined after Ascent shareholders filed  
lawsuits asserting the price was below market value and that former 
Ascent chairman Charlie Lyons cut a sweetheart deal for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties to the lawsuits, including the Lauries, agreed to  
set aside the sale and sell the assets at auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Ascent is expected to announce the investment group with the  
best bid next week, and that group is to compete with the Lauries 
in a two-party auction. 
</P>
<P>
	The princess and Grantham spoke with Nuggets general manager Dan  
Issel and Avalanche general manager Pierre LaCroix this week. She 
would retain both men to run the teams, and Grantham would become 
chief executive officer of her sports operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Valerian Butler Smith III, chairman of Ashland Capital Holdings  
in New York and Saud's principal investment manager, said her 
holdings include telecommunications companies, gas stations and an 
Italian women's pro basketball team.

<HEADLINE> Nokia's Profits, Sales Surge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finnish telecommunications group  
Nokia's profits in the first half of the year climbed 55 percent, 
fueled by strong demand for its mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported Thursday that it earned a net profit of  
1.09 billion euros ($1.14 billion) for the first six months of the 
year, compared with 701 million euros a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose more than 49 percent to 8.36 billion euros.  
</P>
<P>
	``Strong demand for our very competitive range of mobile phones  
continued and we strengthened our position as the number one mobile 
phone manufacturer in the world,'' said Nokia's Chief Executive, 
Jorma Ollila. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the mobile phones division climbed 72 percent from a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our overall performance during the first half of the year  
gives us confidence to reach or slightly exceed the high-end of our 
1999 net sales growth target of 25-35 percent,'' Ollila said in a 
statement.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Keeps Tour de France Lead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BORDEAUX, France (AP) -- Lance Armstrong is right where he wants  
to be. 
</P>
<P>
	He has left the mountains of the Pyrenees behind and is in  
control of the Tour de France in the Bordeaux wine country. Victory 
in Paris on Sunday seems more certain with each passing day. 
</P>
<P>
	He stayed safely in the pack on flat ground Thursday, finishing  
51st but losing none of his commanding lead of 6 minutes, 15 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the 27-year-old Texan who has overcome testicular cancer  
faces only a flat stage Friday and a time trial Saturday. Then 
comes the final ride up the Champs-Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the countryside, as he makes his triumphant run, the link  
between Lance Armstrong and Neil Armstrong did not go unnoticed. 
``Go Lance -- Reach the Moon!'' read a banner along the route, 
accompanied by an American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17th stage was a 120-mile ride through pine forests and past  
vineyards. Belgium's Tom Steels won in a sprint for his third stage 
victory. It would have been his fourth if not for a 
disqualification in another stage for rough tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Robbie McEwen of Australia was second and Erik Zabel of Germany  
was third. Stuart O'Grady of Australia was in position to contest 
the final sprint, but fell close to the finish. He was badly 
bruised but completed the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Pavel Tonkov, the Russian who was in 11th place overall, quit  
the race because of the death of his father. Tonkov, the leader of 
Italy's Mapei team, is a former Tour of Italy winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The day got off to a strange start when a labor dispute greeted  
the riders. Just three miles into the race, the cyclists were 
blocked by firemen protesting working conditions. ``Angry 
Firemen!'' said a banner. The race had to begin again. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, a number of riders found themselves wiping their eyes  
when a fan threw an unidentified substance onto the road that some 
said might have been pepper. 
</P>
<P>
	An eight-man group broke out after 28 miles and reached a lead  
of 7:55, before the pack started picking up speed and reeling them 
in. The group included two national champions, Germany's Udo Bolts 
and Australia's Henk Vogels.

	With almost nine miles left, the pack was grouped again, and the  
sprinters jockeyed for position. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong, a day after lashing out at the French media for what  
he called ``vulture journalism,'' was quiet Thursday, declining to 
speak at the postrace news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, he smiled when reminded by a TV interviewer of  
the link with Neil Armstrong -- but otherwise expressed only anger 
and frustration with the continued drug accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want me to crack on the bike -- and I'm not going to,'' he  
said.

	For two days, the French newspaper Le Monde had reported that  
traces of a corticosteroid were detected in his urine.

	Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs that  
are not listed as steroids. They are banned unless prescribed by 
doctors for a variety of conditions, including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body announced Wednesday the only drug  
Armstrong had been taking was an authorized skin cream for saddle 
sores. 
</P>
<P>
	In an editorial Thursday, Le Monde wrote, ``For the time being,  
there's no proof that Armstrong has taken banned substances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper added that the suspicions surrounding the Tour  
``can't focus solely on Armstrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if he wins, it asked, ``Will his superiority lead to doubts  
being cast over his performance and hint at possible drug abuse?''

<HEADLINE> Boycott Threat Leads to Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Under the threat of a boycott by blacks, the  
chairman of Flowers Industries -- one of the nation's largest baked 
goods companies -- resigned Wednesday from the board of a 
conservative group working to eliminate affirmative action 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Amos R. McMullian's resignation from the board of the  
Southeastern Legal Foundation, black leaders said they would not 
call off the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not lulled into believing because someone resigns, we  
have changed their conscience,'' Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Southeastern Legal Foundation, which has filed lawsuits  
opposing school busing programs and race-based admissions at state 
colleges, says it will sue Atlanta in August in an attempt to 
abolish the city's affirmative action program. The program, which 
the foundation claims is unconstitutional, requires a portion of 
city contracts to go to minority- and female-owned firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about race,'' said Todd Young, a spokesman for the  
foundation. ``This is about a corrupt government running an illegal 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell said he'll take whatever steps necessary to save  
Atlanta's affirmative action program. He did not, however, endorse 
the Georgia Black Chamber of Commerce's planned boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomasville-based Flowers Industries, which has 18,000 employees  
nationwide and 1998 revenues of $3.8 billion, markets foods under 
such brands as Keebler, Cheez-it, Famous Amos, Nature's Own and 
Mrs. Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
	McMullian sent a letter of resignation to the foundation's  
president, but refused to comment on his reason for quitting. The 
company did not immediately respond to calls for comment on the 
boycott. 
</P>
<P>
	Black leaders said McMullian's resignation was a sign that the  
company was bowing to the financial pressure a boycott would 
create. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're going to start hurting our affirmative action  
program, we're going to stop buying their cookies,'' Lou Walker, 
president of the Georgia Black Chamber of Commerce, a group devoted 
to helping black businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The mayor and other city leaders have said the fight for  
affirmative action programs across the nation is bringing about a 
renaissance of the Civil Rights Movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as in the '50s and '60s it would have been inappropriate  
to belong to the Ku Klux Klan, it is inappropriate to belong to the 
Southeastern Legal Foundation today,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Young said the foundation, which he described as a conservative  
version of the American Civil Liberties Union, is not racist and 
called Campbell's analogy flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very same laws that the civil rights movement rightly  
fought for are the very laws that are being violated by the city of 
Atlanta today,'' he said. ``If the mayor is so convinced his 
program is legal, why does he seem to fear court scrutiny?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation's board is made up of 15 members, including  
former Sen. Mack Mattingly, R-Ga., who is chairman. One of the 
foundation's original founders was W.H. Flowers, the first chairman 
of Flowers Industries.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Prosecutors said Thursday they are appealing  
a judge's order blocking the extradition of a suspected drug 
trafficker to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Luis Amezcua, described by U.S. and Mexican authorities as a  
leader of the biggest methamphetamine trafficking ring in the 
world, won a court injunction against a U.S. extradition order last 
week when a judge ruled that a life prison term he might face in 
the United States was cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Amezcua's brother and alleged accomplice, Jesus, got a similar  
injunction in May. Assistant Attorney General Eduardo Ibarrola said 
he will appeal both injunctions. If those fail, Ibarrola said 
Mexico has the power to try the brothers in Mexico for crimes 
committed in the United States.

	Joseph Gorins, 24, was also ordered Wednesday to pay $69,000 in

after the $20,000 ransom he demanded was paid. Gorins was arrested 
the next day as he tried to leave the country. Two accomplices have 
not been caught. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities released no information on the hometown of Gorins,  
now a resident of El Salvador.

<HEADLINE> Cohen OK'd Kennedy Burial Ship Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday  
he personally approved requests by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and the 
families of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and her sister Lauren Bessette 
for the use of a Navy ship to bury the aircraft crash victims at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Briscoe, a destroyer with a crew of 26 officers and 300  
sailors, was approved for use by Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval 
operations, at Cohen's request. Cohen said in a brief written 
statement that use of the Briscoe would have little impact on its 
training operations in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's chief spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said the Pentagon had no  
estimate of the cost incurred by the government for either the 
burial ceremony or the extensive search and recovery operation at 
the plane crash site. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon defended the decision to approve use of the Briscoe for  
the burial ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Navy was meeting the needs of the nation in responding to  
the request of the Kennedy family -- the needs for closure, needs 
for respect, needs for help,'' Bacon said. ``It was a completely 
appropriate response decided and supported by President Clinton and 
Secretary Cohen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., said the Clinton administration was  
right to help the Kennedy family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president's judgment was wise,'' said Hagel, an  
Army veteran. ``John Kennedy was a symbol to this country.'' Hagel 
said Kennedy represented something larger than just one person. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the additional efforts made by our military and the  
additional cost to the taxpayers here was justifiable,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a gesture of respect for the Kennedys, a Navy chaplain aboard  
the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy read a prayer over the 
public address system and asked for a moment of silence Thursday, 
Bacon said. The carrier, named for the late president, was sailing 
in the Atlantic off the coast of Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Kennedy was a Navy veteran.  
</P>
<P>
	The Briscoe, commissioned in 1978, was at sea conducting routine  
training operations in the Virginia Capes area when it was directed 
to head toward Martha's Vineyard in preparation for the ceremony. 
Bacon said he had no information on the actual burial-at-sea 
ceremony.

<HEADLINE> New Zealander Named WTO Head </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- A lawmaker from New Zealand was officially  
appointed director-general of the World Trade Organization today 
under a power-sharing deal with Thailand's deputy prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Moore will take the helm of the world's top trade body  
Sept. 1 and will be in charge for three years. Thailand's Supachai 
Panitchpakdi will then take over for the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The 134 nation WTO's general council approved the appointments  
at a short meeting today, ending months of deadlock between 
supporters of the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement from New Zealand, a ``delighted'' Moore said he  
was already preparing for the demanding responsibilities ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to roll up our sleeves and focus on the issues that  
are important to all the WTO's members,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old former trade unionist served as prime minister  
for eight weeks in 1990 before his Labor Party lost office. He is a 
member of parliament and the opposition's spokesman on foreign 
affairs and trade. 
</P>
<P>
	As director-general of the WTO, Moore will play an important  
role in setting the agenda for the next round of international 
trade talks, due to be launched in Seattle in November. 
</P>
<P>
	The complex trade negotiations will likely last longer than  
three years, leaving Supachai to steer through the expected 
dismantling of trade barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	The unorthodox decision to appoint both men came after members  
found themselves unable to break the deadlock and reach a consensus 
on either candidate. Under the agreement, neither man will be able 
to extend his term beyond three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization has been without a head since Italy's Renato  
Ruggiero left at the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody says it isn't the best solution but in the  
circumstances perhaps it's all that was possible,'' said Ali 
Mchumo, chairman of the decision-making council and the person 
responsible for steering the difficult and divisive negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Mchumo had originally proposed Moore for the job as he had  
slightly more support than Supachai. But Japan and other Asian 
nations refused to drop their candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Supachai sent a message of support to his rival.  
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to support my friend Mr. Moore in every way I can,''  
Supachai told The Associated Press in Bangkok. ``I am sure he will 
be a capable director-general and I look forward to working with 
him, with me as the representative of Thailand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the interim, Supachai is expected to stay in Thailand's  
coalition government to help ease the country out of its economic 
crisis and back to sustainable growth. 
</P>
<P>
	At the WTO's lakeside headquarters, there was widespread relief.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is a wonderful solution,'' said U.S. ambassador Rita Hayes,  
one of Moore's most prominent supporters. ``We are very, very 
fortunate that this organization is built on consensus because 
these two men have the leadership ability and most of all they have 
the support of all the members here at the WTO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are both very competent persons,'' said Thai ambassador  
Jairapaet Krirk-Krai. ``I haven't seen anyone who rejects their 
qualifications and experience so it should be a good 'buy one get 
one free' formula.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Differences persist over the appointment of the deputy  
directors-general. Ruggiero had four deputies, a number some 
countries would like to reduce, but any reduction is likely to 
leave some regions without a representative at the top of the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Gore Points to River Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORNISH, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore canoed Thursday down  
the Connecticut River and pointed to its cleanup as an example of 
how environmental and economic concerns can be addressed jointly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Environmental protection and economic growth are not opposing  
forces, but go hand in hand,'' the Democratic presidential 
candidate said in a speech on the bank of the river. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore spoke at an event celebrating the river's designation as an  
American Heritage River. Before the speech, he took a canoe trip on 
the river with Democratic New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Connecticut is one of 14 waterways designated as American  
Heritage Rivers that qualify for special federal money. Gore said 
$819,000 had been earmarked for various projects related to the 
river. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the communities surrounding the river that he praised  
for cooperating in their efforts to rid it of pollution and 
preserve it for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, these are more than public policy issues, they are  
moral issues,'' he said. ``We have to make the 21st century the 
time we right the environmental wrongs of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Connecticut River is intertwined with U.S. history, Gore  
said, serving as the main corridor for European settlement of the 
region in the 17th century and later as a major waterway for boat 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the 1950s, it had become so polluted that people taking  
water samples had to wear gas masks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cities along other waterways -- specifically Chattanooga, Memphis  
and San Antonio -- have revitalized themselves by making the effort 
to ``reconnect'' with their rivers, he said.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Tyson could get a shot at avenging his  
shocking heavyweight championship loss to James ``Buster'' Douglas 
in Tokyo nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 39-year-old Douglas is one of three men being considered as  
an opponent for Tyson's next comeback Oct. 2 at Las Vegas, 
according to Jay Larkin, senior vice president in charge of sports 
for Showtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Larkin said the other two are 33-year-old Orlin Norris and  
30-year-old Zeljko Mavrovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been negotiating with all three of them  
simultaneously,'' he said Thursday. ``We hope to have things done 
by the end of next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the shrinking time frame to publicize an Oct. 2 bout  
at the MGM Grand, indications are the match would be televised on 
Showtime, not on pay-per-view. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was knocked out in the 10th round by Douglas, a 42-1 shot,  
on Feb. 11, 1990, Since then, he has regained and lost pieces of 
the title (WBC and WBA), served two prison terms and had his 
license revoked for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in their title 
rematch in 1998. In his only fight since getting his license back, 
he knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth round Jan. 16. 
</P>
<P>
	Douglas wasn't champion long. Obviously, not in the best  
condition, he lost the undisputed title when he was knocked out in 
the third round by Holyfield in 1990. He then retired, but his 
weight soared to more than 400 pounds and in 1994 he was 
hospitalized in a diabetic coma. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the hospital, Douglas began exercising and this  
led to his return to boxing. Since coming back in 1996, he has won 
eight of nine fights against mostly mediocre opponents. It appeared 
he would retire again after being knocked out in the first round by 
Lou Savarese June 25, 1998. Since then, he scored a one-round 
knockout of Warren Williams and Andre Crowder. 
</P>
<P>
	``I screwed up big time,'' Douglas (37-6-1, 24 knockouts) said  
after the loss to Savarese. But that quick knockout defeat could 
play a big role in him getting him the rematch with a fading, 
33-year-old Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, older brother of former junior middleweight champion  
Terry Norris, is a former cruiserweight champion. Despite 26 
knockouts on his 49-5 record, Norris is defense-oriented and his 
fights are often devoid of action. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 220 pounds, Norris would be closer to Tyson's weight  
than would the much heavier Douglas and Mavrovic. Norris would have 
much less of a height advantage over Tyson than Douglas or 
Mavrovic, each 6-foot-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Mavrovic (27-1, 22 knockouts), a former European champion from  
Croatia, is an aggressive fighter. He lost a WBC title bid to 
Lennox Lewis on a unanimous decision last Sept. 26.

<HEADLINE> Union Pacific Beats Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Digging its way out of last year's losses,  
Union Pacific Corp. reported better-than-expected second-quarter 
net income of $194 million today. 
</P>
<P>
	The results, which include $8 million in one-time, after-tax  
expenses associated with implementation of its merger with Southern 
Pacific, translated to 77 cents a share. In last year's second 
quarter, Union Pacific reported a loss of $416 million, or $1.70 
per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had expected Union Pacific  
to earn 72 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue grew 6 percent to $2.77 billion from $2.62 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest railroad struggled in 1997 and last year  
with clogged rail lines and losses as it implemented its 1996 
merger with an aging Southern Pacific Rail Corp. It has invested 
heavily in updating track and hiring new workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our game plan is working,'' said Union Pacific chairman and  
chief executive officer Dick Davidson. ``By returning to the basics 
of quality railroading, we've been able to increase revenues, 
reduce failure costs and achieve merger benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of 1999, Union Pacific reported net  
income of $323 million, or $1.31 per share, compared with a net 
loss of $478 million, or $1.94 per share, in the first half of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	First-half revenue came to $5.51 billion, up from $5.21 billion.

<HEADLINE> New Cleveland Browns Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Three years of lost Sundays and life without  
pro football is finally over -- the Cleveland Browns are back in 
pads and back in town. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Browns opened preseason training camp today for the  
first time since the summer of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of about 35 players -- rookies and a few selected  
veterans -- were ready for their first morning workout under coach 
Chris Palmer. The rest of the team's players will have their first 
formal workout on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven drift picks, receiver Kevin Johnson, linebacker Wali  
Rainer, wide receiver Darrin Chiaverini, defensive lineman Marcus 
Spriggs, linebacker Kendall Ogle, tight end James Dearth and 
running back Madre Hill, reached contract agreements Wednesday. 
Only draft picks Rahim Abdullah, a linebacker, and cornerback 
Daylon McCutcheon, were unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
	While the team has had four minicamps, those were padless  
sessions with little contact. But now touch football is over and 
there will be a new sense of urgency on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 90 players who will strap on orange helmets Sunday,  
nearly half will be cut before Cleveland's regular season opener 
game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sept. 12.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Issues Soft Money Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Bill Bradley, condemning  
big campaign contributions as ``a great stone wall'' between people 
and elected representatives, promised today that he would run 
without so-called soft money from the Democratic Party if 
Republicans agreed to the same. 
</P>
<P>
	The former New Jersey senator, who is vying with Vice President  
Al Gore for the Democratic nomination, outlined an altruistic 
proposal for campaign finance reform that goes beyond Senate 
legislation endorsed by the Clinton-Gore administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, in remarks prepared for a luncheon address, proposed  
national same-day registration to make voting easier and a ``Voting 
Leave Law'' requiring employers to give workers at least two hours 
off on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Why, he asked, is voting ``the only right that you have to  
register in advance before you can use it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said he was aiming for a system where ``candidates run  
on the strength of their ideas not the weight of their wallets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign finance address is the second in a series of  
speeches in which Bradley is slowly and deliberatively rolling out 
details of his platform. He earlier outlined anti-crime 
initiatives, including handgun registration. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming up, aides said, is a plan for universal health insurance.  
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks at the National Press Club, Bradley recalled --  
and quoted from -- his high school term paper on the 1896 race, in 
which John D. Rockefeller's Standard oil gave William McKinley 
$250,000 to win the White House. Such big money ``is like a great 
stone wall that comes between the people and their 
representatives,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In doing that paper, I learned that money was to politics as  
acid is to cloth -- eating away at the fabric of democracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign money should come from just two places, he said, ``One  
is from individuals -- limited and instantly reported. The second 
source, the public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This assertion contrasted with Bradley's 1996 plan, when he was  
still in the Senate, which rejected public financing of Senate 
campaigns in favor of a fund built through voluntary taxpayer 
contributions added on in the tax filing process. At that time 
Bradley said public financing was like ``forcing taxpayers to fund 
politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like the McCain-Feingold bill named for Arizona Sen. John  
McCain, a candidate for the GOP nomination, Bradley's plan would 
ban the unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties 
known as soft money. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 presidential race, Democrats effectively used soft  
money to promote through ``issue ads'' the re-election of President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley pledged to seek a compact with Republicans in next  
year's general election if he is the Democratic nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will each direct our parties not to raise or spend soft  
money in the general election for such matters as, for example, 
issue advertising,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year Senate veteran called in 1997 for an independent  
counsel to investigate the Clinton-Gore fund-raising tactics, 
including Gore's controversial stop at a Buddhist temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's speech today made no direct reference to Gore or his  
shared troubles with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Public trust in government has eroded, Bradley said.  
``Dishonesty is part of it. Every little lie erodes trust 
invisibly, like acid rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman Eric Hauser said campaign finance reform would be  
Bradley's first priority in the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	For congressional primaries, Bradley today proposed doubling the  
government's current 1-to-1 match of small individual contributions 
$250 or less. General elections under Bradley's plan would be 
wholly paid for with public money. In exchange, candidates would 
have to limit their spending to an amount based on local population 
and media costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley would exempt from individual contribution limits --  
currently $1,000 -- personal, grass-roots expenditures like printing 
up bumper stickers or fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	He also called for free television time for candidates 60 days  
before an election. It's the least broadcasters should do, Bradley 
said, since they get to use public airways for considerable profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue could be neutered if Congress takes action before  
Campaign 2000 begins in earnest. McCain won earlier this week the 
Republican leadership's promise for a Senate debate of the 
McCain-Feingold bill by mid-October. Clinton has said he is eager 
to sign campaign finance legislation.

	Kennedys, Bessette Returned to Sea  
</P>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- The cremated remains of John F. Kennedy  
Jr., his wife, Carolyn, and her sister Lauren were returned to the 
waters off Martha's Vineyard today, not far from where their plane 
went down Friday night. About 15 family members attended the 
memorial service on a Navy destroyer. On the way to the Woods Hole 
port, the families drove past hundreds of well-wishers, including 
children who threw flowers on the motorcade. Some of those who 
lined the road carried signs of sympathy.

	Crowds Say Farewell to JFK Jr.  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The strains of a traditional Irish dirge filled  
Old St. Patrick's Cathedral tonight as hundreds of people bid 
goodbye to John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife and her sister. ``With 
faith, hope and certainly with love, we come together for healing, 
we come together for prayer,'' the Rev. Keith Fennessy told a crowd 
of about 800. About 1,000 people stood behind police barricades 
outside, listening as the Catholic Mass was broadcast on 
loudspeakers.

	Midwest Flooding Displaces 1,500  
</P>
<P>
	WAVERLY, Iowa (AP) -- About 1,500 people remained out of their  
homes today as the surging waters of the Cedar River flooded 65 
city blocks of this northeast Iowa town. The river crested this 
morning at just over 21 feet -- 2 feet higher than the record set in 
1993. About 650 homes and a dozen downtown businesses were 
affected. The water is not expected to recede until the weekend. 
Cedar Falls, Waterloo and other cities downriver were expected to 
take the worst of the floods tonight.

	Weapons Maker Leaves Bush Campaign  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A maker of assault rifles resigned today as  
George W. Bush's chief fund-raiser in Maine, saying he didn't want 
to become a distraction after inquiries were made about him. 
Richard E. Dyke owns Bushmaster Firearms in Windham, Maine, which 
makes automatic weapons for government agencies, semiautomatics 
that are sold to the public and a rifle widely used in shooting 
competition. His company was one of nine makers of assault weapons 
that a Los Angeles police officer has sued after the officer was 
wounded in a shootout with bank robbers armed with such weapons.

	House Approves Defense Budget  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House approved a $266 billion defense  
budget today without money to buy the next generation of stealth 
fighter jets that the Air Force considers critical to U.S. air 
superiority. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., withdrew an amendment that would 
have restored $1.8 billion for the F-22 Raptor after leading a 
parade of House members in support of the radar-evading aircraft. 
Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the Appropriations 
subcommittee, promised to carefully consider the funding in 
conference with the Senate, where the F-22 has strong support.

	Annan Urges Congo Fighting Stoppage

<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged  
all parties in the Congo to stop fighting between Aug. 8-20 so 
youngsters can be immunized against polio. Annan noted that 
Congolese President Laurent Kabila and the main rebel group have 
pledged to support the vaccination campaign, a U.N. spokesman said. 
The immunization campaign is aimed at some 10 million children 
under the age of five.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Barnesandnoble.com's second-quarter losses were  
smaller than expected and its sales more than tripled from a year 
ago, but the online retailer's business still lags significantly 
behind rival Amazon.com. The New York-based company reported today 
it lost $21.95 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a loss 
of $23.74 million, or 21 cents a share, a year ago. The company's 
results topped Wall Street analysts' expectations of a loss of 24

of inflation dangers. Wall Street fell on the remarks. The Dow 
Jones industrial average dropped 33.56 to 10,969.22. The Nasdaq 
closed down 77.33 at 2,684.44. On the NYSE, decliners led advancers 
1,821-1,073.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball, not waiting for its squabbling umpires  
to resign, hired 10 minor league umps today to take their place 
later this season. Making their first response to the mass 
resignations, commissioner Bud Selig and his top officials hired 
the Triple-A replacements, who had been working as vacation 
fill-ins. They were notified they were being added to major league 
staffs on a permanent basis starting Sept. 1 -- the day before the 
resignations were to take effect.

<HEADLINE> Pippig May Seek Injunction on Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Three-time Boston Marathon champion Uta Pippig  
said Thursday she may ask for a court injunction against the 
two-year doping ban imposed on her by the German Athletics 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippig, who has insisted she is innocent, told Deutsche Welle  
television that she doesn't accept the organization's ruling and 
may challenge it in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we can do that, some legal matters have to be cleared  
up,'' Pippig said. ``After consulting with my lawyers, we'll come 
to a decision as fast as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A legal panel of the German federation upheld her ban last week,  
saying there was no doubt that Pippig used performance-enhancing 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippig, who lives most of the year in Boulder, Colo., tested  
positive there in April 1998 for abnormally high levels of 
testosterone, a male hormone used by athletes to better their 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippig, 33, was banned for two years after the test, but  
appealed to the German federation. She claimed the testosterone 
abnormalities were caused by a medicine for a viral infection, but 
German drug experts have ruled out that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban runs through April 22, 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	Pippig won the Boston Marathon from 1994-96, and the New York  
City Marathon in 1993. She also won the Berlin Marathon three 
times.

<HEADLINE> NASA Looks for Ice on the Moon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA is planning to smash the moon with a used  
spacecraft next week in a search for ice, but two scientists 
predict it'll turn up only a concrete-like layer of lunar soil and 
no water. 
</P>
<P>
	The $63 million Lunar Prospector mission concludes Aug. 1 and  
researchers plan a spectacular end for the little spacecraft -- 
smacking it into a constantly shaded crater on the moon's South 
Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA researchers believe there is a good chance the 3,800 mph  
crash of the 354-pound craft will gouge a hole in the crater deep 
enough to free a cloud of water vapor if ice is locked in the 
frigid soil. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are eager to find water on the moon because H2O can  
be chemically reduced and used as a rocket fuel and as a breathable 
gas. The presence of water would make it possible to build a base 
on the moon without the need for fuel and oxygen resupply from 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	But Von R. Eshleman and George A. Parks, researchers at Stanford  
University, say in a letter to the journal Science that Lunar 
Prospector is more apt to collide with a concrete-like mineral 
inside the crater than ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't believe that crater is paved like a roadway, but we  
do believe the soil may be chemically very much like concrete,'' 
Eshleman said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	If there is water on the moon, Eshleman said, it is probably in  
the form of hydrous, or water-containing, mineral crystals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hydrous minerals do contain H2O, but it is so tightly bound  
chemically to the crystals that it would take temperatures up to 
1,500 degrees to break those bonds and extract useful water, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eshleman agrees with NASA scientists that if there is any water  
on the moon -- a highly uncertain possibility -- it is probably in 
the soils in deeply shaded craters at the lunar poles. But once the 
water got trapped there, he said, it is very likely the water 
combined with the dry lunar soil to form the crystal minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldstein, a University of Texas researcher who first  
suggested smashing the moon with the Lunar Prospector, conceded 
that some lunar water may be chemically locked in minerals, but he 
thinks there also might be ice. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the chances of there being free water there is about  
10 percent,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said the energy released by the Lunar Prospector's  
crash into the moon will vaporize ice, but not separate water from 
the minerals. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a half cubic meter of soil, the crash will raise the  
temperature by about 400 degrees Kelvin (about 720 degrees F),'' 
said Goldstein, far less than the 1,500 degrees F needed to extract 
the water from a concrete-like crystal. 
</P>
<P>
	This means that if any water is detected from the collision, it  
probably came from ice, not from hydrous minerals, said Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector was launched Jan. 6, 1998 and has spent 18  
months orbiting the moon. It used instruments to map the lunar 
surface, plot the moon's geology and search for water. 
</P>
<P>
	Data from the spacecraft suggested the presence of hydrogen, a  
key component of water, but could not detect water itself. Radar 
signals from an earlier spacecraft, called Clementine, suggested 
that water might be present at the lunar poles. And still another 
study, using Earthbound instruments, detected a group of craters at 
the lunar poles that are constantly shaded from the sun, the sites 
thought the most likely to contain water. 
</P>
<P>
	Lunar Prospector will smash into one such shaded crater at about  
5:52 a.m. EDT on July 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``We selected that day because the funding for Lunar Prospector  
runs out on Aug. 1,'' said Goldstein, a member of the spacecraft 
science team. ``We thought this would be a good way to end the 
mission and still get some science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers will send signals to fire retrorockets while the  
craft is about 124 miles above the lunar surface. This will slow 
the spacecraft and send it streaking toward the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said if all goes well, Lunar Prospector will approach  
the surface at a shallow angle and then smash into the inner wall 
of a 2 1/2-mile deep crater. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the approach and collision will be like ``a person doing  
a running belly flop into a pool. Much of the splash will be to the 
forward and to the sides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impact could produce a vapor with as much as 40 pounds of  
water -- about five gallons. A cloud of vapor should become visible 
to powerful telescopes within four seconds after the collision. 
Sunlight is expected to break the water vapor into hydrogen and 
hydroxyl. Telescopes on Earth and in space that can detect 
ultraviolet radiation will be able to tell if the plume contains 
hydroxyl, a key marker for water. 
</P>
<P>
	For amateurs, said Goldstein, there probably won't be much to  
see. 
</P>
<P>
	``I doubt if there will be a flash,'' he said. ``And the vapor  
cloud won't be visible.''

<HEADLINE> Polio Campaign Could Be Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The campaign to conquer polio, the feared  
childhood disease that is close to being eliminated, could be lost 
because of wars and money, the U.N. Children's Fund warned 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Actress Mia Farrow, who had polio as a child, and her 9-year-old  
adopted son Thaddeus, who is crippled by the disease, asked the 
world community to ensure the battle is won so that polio never 
again kills or cripples. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that Thaddeus has been affected when (a polio)  
vaccine has been in existence for more than 40 years seems so 
unnecessary,'' said Farrow, who spent three days in an iron lung at 
the age of nine but didn't suffer any lasting physical effects. 
</P>
<P>
	At one time, polio killed or crippled 500,000 people a year,  
mostly children. When the World Health Organization set the goal in 
1988 of eliminating polio by the end of the year 2000, there were 
35,000 cases annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, 450 million children were vaccinated against polio  
and there were 6,000 cases, concentrated in 13 countries in Africa, 
Asia and the Middle East, according to The Progress of Nations 1999 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``Victory is actually achingly close,'' UNICEF Executive  
Director Carol Bellamy told a news conference called to launch the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	But many children under the age of five can't be reached because  
of conflicts, particularly in Africa. Countries like Angola, Congo 
and Sudan face serious outbreaks of polio because fighting has 
forced the suspension of immunization efforts in many areas, 
Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price tag for completing the eradication of polio is $1.25  
billion, and $750 million has already been pledged. That leaves 527 
days to raise $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the polio eradication campaign began, the number of cases  
has dropped by 85 percent. But as long as one case exists, polio 
poses a threat to all children, said Donna Shalala, U.S. secretary 
for health and human services. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we want to ensure that no child is ever again sentenced to  
life in an iron lung, then we must wipe polio from the Earth by the 
end of the year 2000,'' Shalala said. ``We can do it, and we must 
do it -- and I'm convinced that we will do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She called for more national immunization days and  
house-to-house vaccinations in countries like India, where polio 
still has a strong hold. The United States is providing over $90 
million this year to combat polio. 
</P>
<P>
	UNICEF has been working on the polio campaign with the U.S.  
Center for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and 
Rotary International. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking ahead, Bellamy said the success of the polio campaign  
``has given us hope that we can mount a similar campaign to defeat 
HIV/AIDS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The UNICEF report included a new list of countries where  
children are most at risk. Topping the list are nations in 
conflict, including Angola, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, Somalia, 
Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Niger, Congo, Burundi and Eritrea. 
Children are least at risk in the industrialized world, Cuba and 
Libya.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Sounding upbeat after his return from  
Washington, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said today he is 
convinced he can reach peace agreements with the Palestinians, 
Syria and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak, a moderate who took office earlier this month, spoke a  
day after returning from a weeklong trip to the United States and 
Britain. In lengthy talks with President Clinton, Barak obtained 
the U.S. leader's agreement to set a loose time frame of 15 months 
for negotiating the peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's aides have said the date, October 2000, was tentative  
and mainly intended to signal that Israel does not plan to 
procrastinate. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into a meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman,  
Barak said he was optimistic about prospects for peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak is to meet next week with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat  
to discuss implementation of the interim Wye River 
land-for-security agreement. Under the accord, Israel is to 
withdraw from 13 percent of the disputed West Bank in three stages. 
</P>
<P>
	Netanyahu carried out the first pullback, but then suspended the  
agreement in December, claiming the Palestinians had not met their 
obligations. In the next installment, Israel must withdraw from 
five percent of the land. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak has said he hopes to persuade Arafat to begin talks on a  
permanent peace agreement after the second pullback. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Arafat has insisted that the Wye agreement be carried  
out in full before final status talks can begin. 
</P>
<P>
	No Israeli government had ever agreed to promise total  
withdrawal as a precondition for negotiations, Israeli Foreign 
Minister David Levy told Israel radio. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Syrian track, Levy said he thought Syrian President Hafez  
Assad had softened his position and would be willing now to resume 
talks without a prior pledge from Barak that Israel would return 
all of the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast 
war. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said he gained this impression from Spanish Prime Minister  
Jose Maria Aznar, who met with Assad in Damascus earlier this week 
and then with Levy on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Stevenson Interview Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tennis player Alexandra Stevenson's interview  
with Barbara Walters on ABC-TV's ``20/20'' has been postponed 
because of the network's coverage of the death of John F. Kennedy 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview with the 18-year-old Wimbledon semifinalist and  
her mother, free-lance journalist Samantha Stevenson, had been 
scheduled for Friday night. No new date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Samantha Stevenson tells Walters she listed  
Julius Erving as her daughter's father on the birth certificate 
because ``I wanted to give Alexandra a sense of belonging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The disclosure that the former basketball star was the tennis  
player's father was made during Stevenson's surprising run at 
Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by Walters if she missed having a father around while she  
grew up, Stevenson said, ``It just didn't bug me. I just pretty 
much didn't notice it at all.''

<HEADLINE> 15 Charged in Stock Fraud Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two brokerage executives were among 15 people  
charged Thursday with orchestrating a massive stock fraud by 
manipulating the demand for three initial public offerings. 
</P>
<P>
	The fraud, allegedly organized by two key figures at Kensington  
Wells Inc. on New York's Long Island, occurred in 1994 and 1995. 
Prosecutors believe it allowed at least 10 brokers and others to 
pocket millions of dollars in profits at the expense of other 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	An indictment charged the 15 defendants with securities fraud  
conspiracy, money conspiracy and money laundering in connection 
with the alleged manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the three initial public offerings, known as IPOs,  
followed a similar pattern, according to a statement released by 
federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, the FBI and the Internal Revenue 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
	First, authorities said, Kensington executives Elias Tacher and  
Salvador Tacher distributed IPO stock to friends who promised to 
immediately sell the shares to Kensington Wells for a pre-arranged 
profit. This allowed the company to control a supply of each stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the stock was in place at Kensington Wells, the defendants  
artificially inflated its price and marketed it to the public by 
calling random individuals and overstating the companies' potential 
so customers would want to buy in, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants then used off-shore accounts to launder the  
money, sometimes returning profits in duffel bags full of cash, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges centered on the initial public sales of stock of  
Universal Automotive Industries Inc., XeChem International Inc., 
and VideoLan Technologies Inc. No one was accused of wrongdoing at 
any of those companies. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Tachers, charges were filed against 10  
brokers at Kensington Wells, the firm's accountant, a Swiss 
investment banker and a Fahnestock &AMP; Co. broker who allegedly 
laundered Kensington Wells profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tachers have unlisted telephone numbers and could not be  
reached immediately for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the defendants could be subject to prison terms up  
to 20 years on the most serious charges, with a $250,000 fine and 
an order of restitution.

<HEADLINE> Executives Guilty of Radio Payola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two top executives at the nation's largest  
independent Latin music label have changed their pleas to guilty, 
admitting to illegally paying radio stations to play the company's 
recordings in a landmark case. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesus Gilberto Moreno and Guillermo Santiso, both executives at  
Fonovisa Inc., had pleaded innocent last week to the federal 
charges, but their lawyer indicated at that time that his clients 
would plead guilty if their cases were consolidated. They did so on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is the first involving a record company under federal  
payola statutes that were passed in the wake of radio airplay 
scandals in the 1950s, U.S. Attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents indicate Moreno, 48, Fonovisa's promotions  
chief, paid more than $1 million to radio station programmers from 
1987 to 1998, the U.S. Attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law prohibits the practice, known as payola.  
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old Santiso, Fonovisa's president, pleaded guilty to  
aiding and assisting in preparation of a false 1996 tax return for 
Fonovisa's parent company, Univisa Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Fonovisa Inc., also pleaded guilty to filing a false corporate  
tax return for 1992, taking a $1.5 million deduction for 
promotional expenses that did not occur. The company agreed to 
correct the improper deduction and pay a $700,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Artists from the record label dominated Spanish-language  
airwaves in 1997 with songs from such singers as Enrique Iglesias 
and Marco Antonio Solis.

<HEADLINE> R.J. Reynolds Exceeds Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- In its first quarter as an  
independent company, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. beat Wall 
Street analysts' predictions despite a 35 percent drop in ongoing 
net income. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds' second-quarter results were driven down by the cost of  
a corporate spin-off, the national tobacco settlement and declining 
sales caused by higher prices for cigarettes including Camel, 
Winston, Salem and Doral. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds, the holding company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the  
nation's No. 2 cigarette maker, was separated from RJR Nabisco 
Holdings Inc. on June 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Income excluding one-time items came to $98 million, or 90 cents  
per share, compared to $150 million, or $1.30 per share, for the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street analysts had predicted earnings of 79 cents per  
share, according to a survey of brokers by First Call Corp. 
Reynolds' stock closed up 31 1/4 cents at $28.93 3/4 a share on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The results excluded a $2.67 billion, or $24.54 per share,  
after-tax net gain on discontinued operations and $367 million, or 
$3.38 per share, in after-tax, one-time charges related to the 
spinoff from RJR Nabisco and debt repayment transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	With those one-time items included, Reynold earned $2.38  
billion, or $21.88 a share, compared to a $114 million, or $1.05 
loss in the year-earlier period. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $1.91 billion from $1.44 billion, reflecting  
higher prices for cigarettes although the number of cigarettes sold 
fell 12.4 percent. The higher prices resulted from a 64 cent-a-pack 
increase connected the tobacco industry's settlement with 46 states 
over the costs for treating sick smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	But that price increase helped cut cigarette consumption, and in  
turn, Reynolds' sales, contributing to the erosion in profits. 
Costs related to the settlement and competitive discounting also 
took a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's retail share of market for the quarter ending in  
May was down 1.28 percentage points to 24.17 percent vs. 25.45 
percent in the comparable period of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But management was upbeat. ``We begin this new era as a  
separately traded company with a very solid balance sheet and the 
cash flow flexibility to deliver a strong return to shareholders,'' 
said Andrew J. Schindler, chairman and CEO of Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months, income excluding one-time items came  
to $174 million, or $1.60 per share, down 34 percent from $264 
million, or $2.43 per share, in the first six months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Including one-time items, first-half net income came to $2.47  
billion, or $22.76 per share, compared to a loss of $122 million, 
or $1.13 per share, in the first six months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales rose to $3.6 billion from $2.65 billion

<HEADLINE> Senate at Impasse Over Rights Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate isn't going to approve the  
nomination of Bill Lann Lee as the Justice Department's civil 
rights chief, but he's got the job and he's going to keep doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	While President Clinton and Senate Democrats give confirmation a  
periodic push, the Republicans blocking it aren't budging, and 
neither side is making an issue of it. So the dispute makes no real 
difference, except that Lee's title is one word longer. He is 
acting assistant attorney general for civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under his leadership the Justice Department has enforced our  
civil rights laws justly and fairly,'' Clinton said Wednesday. He 
said the Republicans who won't permit confirmation are doing it 
because they oppose the civil rights laws Lee is enforcing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deserves to be considered based on his record and  
abilities, not blocked because some senators disagree with the law 
of the land,'' the president said. His statement was prompted by a 
complaint from the National Council of Asian-Pacific Americans at 
Senate failure to confirm Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican critics don't accept that characterization, of  
course. They argue that Lee went too far as an NAACP lawyer in 
pressuring companies to settle for racial hiring goals -- quotas in 
GOP judgment -- to avoid costly court action. 
</P>
<P>
	At this point, both sides seem to have settled into an  
acceptable impasse. 
</P>
<P>
	Six months after he nominated Lee, Clinton named him acting  
assistant attorney general. He said at the time, December of 1997, 
that there was no difference between what Lee could do as an acting 
appointee and as a confirmed one. 
</P>
<P>
	The nomination never got past the Senate Judiciary Committee,  
and the chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, has said it won't. When 
Clinton nominated Lee again this year, Hatch said it was 
unfortunate, and that he should have named a ``confirmable 
candidate'' instead. 
</P>
<P>
	But his unconfirmed choice is a veteran at the job now.  
</P>
<P>
	That's one route around political disputes and the balky  
confirmation process. Clinton has just had a dispute over another, 
his appointment of an openly gay ambassador to Luxembourg during a 
Senate recess. With that recess appointment, James C. Hormel can 
serve until the end of this Congress, when Clinton will be leaving 
the White House anyhow. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel's confirmation had been blocked by a handful of  
Republican senators who wouldn't let it come to a vote. When 
Clinton avoided that obstacle with the June 4 recess appointment, 
GOP leaders protested, and there were threats to bar other nominees 
in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton settled that by promising to alert Senate leaders to any  
recess appointments. The president said that in return for that 
assurance, he would expect ``expeditious consideration'' of his 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	But he's still waiting on the stalled confirmation of Richard  
Holbrooke to be ambassador to the United Nations. The top U.N. job 
has been open for nearly 11 months. The process snagged first in 
background checks and ethics inquiries; the nomination was not sent 
to the Senate until Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke was unanimously approved by the Senate Foreign  
Relations Committee on June 30, but action has since been blocked 
because four Republican senators have put what are called ``holds'' 
on the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a practice by which any senators can block action, for  
any reason, usually, and in this case, to pressure an 
administration on something else. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader, one of the senators  
with a hold on Holbrooke, said he thinks the nomination will be 
confirmed, eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Republican, Sen. John Warner, chairman of the Armed  
Services Committee, said the urgency of acting to send a new 
ambassador to the United Nations is increasing daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the situation in the Balkans, Warner told the Senate on  
July 16, ``the United States is increasingly in need of having a 
very powerful voice at the U.N. at this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh is acting as chief U.S.  
representative there now. And waiting for Holbrooke so that he can 
move on to his own nomination, as ambassador to The Philippines.

<HEADLINE> EU Investigators Raid Coca-Cola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union investigators have  
raided the offices of Coca-Cola Co. in four European nations on 
suspicion the company abused its position as the world's leading 
soft drinks maker by offering retailers unfair incentives to shut 
out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	EU Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said today he had  
ordered raids on Coke offices in Britain, Germany, Austria and 
Denmark over the past two days to seize documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``A dominant company on any market cannot indirectly bully  
competitors by pushing its customers to buy less of the 
competitors' products,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The raids were a fresh blow to Coca-Cola in Europe as the  
company recovers from a health scare last month that led to its 
drinks being removed from stores in several nations. The recall 
began after Belgian schoolchildren complained they fell sick from 
drinking Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the latest suspicions, the chief director of Nordic  
Coca Cola beverages, Svend Ivan Petersen, said the company did 
nothing wrong and does not understand the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were naturally very surprised by the raid,'' Petersen said.  
``But we opened up our files and the materials the commission 
wanted to see and tried to cooperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Coke's London office said the Cola giant was  
``very much in compliance with the spirit and letter of all 
competition laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under EU rules, companies found guilty of infringing regulations  
governing fair business competition can face fines of up to 10 
percent of their revenues, although in practice fines have been 
much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on any information they find in the raids, European  
regulators could decide to launch a full-scale investigation into 
Coke. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were apparently looking for evidence Coke offered  
retailers incentives to increase sales and stop selling competing 
drinks. It was unclear if the Commission acted on complaints from 
one of Coke's competitors or from disgruntled retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission, the executive branch of the EU,  
released a statement saying Coca-Cola was ``suspected of practices 
which would not be in line with European Community law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was primarily a question concerning bonuses which are  
granted by the Coca-Cola company to a number of customers,'' the EC 
said, adding that the British division of Coca-Cola promised to 
halt such payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission last week fined British Airways $7 million for  
offering similar incentives to travel agents. It also raided 
Belgium's Interbrew, the world's fourth largest brewer, last week 
to find out if it is using its dominance of the Belgian market to 
muscle out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke's position as the world's biggest soft drinks supplier has  
already brought it into conflict with European regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	The company scaled down plans to acquire operations from  
Britain's Cadbury Schweppes PLC after complaints from the EU. 
French authorities have blocked Coke's attempts to purchase the 
Orangina soda brand from Pernod Ricard SA. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulation of business competition is one of the few fields  
where national governments in the 15 EU nations have handed over 
authority to the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Miert has raised the profile of his antitrust regulators in  
a series of headline cases in recent years, including the 
imposition of conditions on Boeing's $15 billion takeover of 
McDonnell Douglas in 1997 and handing down a record $106 million 
fine on Volkswagen last year for restrictive sales practices.

<HEADLINE> Tampa Bay Adds Two More to DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shortstop Kevin Stocker and third baseman  
Herbert Perry joined baseball's longest disabled list Thursday when 
both were taken off the active roster by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocker has a left knee inflammation and Perry a strained left  
oblique muscle in his rib cage. 
</P>
<P>
	Tampa Bay has placed 17 players on the disabled list since  
opening day, 21 since the beginning of spring training.Stocker 
became the 14th player on the team's original 25-man roster to be 
on the DL this season. Tampa Bay leads the majors in disabled-list 
injuries, with the Pittsburgh Pirates the National League leader, 
with 16. 
</P>
<P>
	To fill the roster spots, the Devil Rays recalled infielder  
Bobby Smith and outfielder Rich Butler from Durham, their Triple A 
affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith batted .333 with 14 home runs in 57 games at Durham.  
Butler, who played in Thursday's game against the New York Yankees, 
and became the 38th player to play for the Rays this season, was 
hitting .293 with eight homers in 63 games at Durham.

<HEADLINE> Wanted: Heir For $375,000 Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Clayton Goward has a $375,000 estate. What  
the 79-year-old man doesn't have is a suitable heir. 
</P>
<P>
	So he placed an ad in the Star Tribune to try to solve the  
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``My estate is sizable and I have no worthy heirs,'' the July 11  
ad said. ``I need a solution now. If you have had this same problem 
and have found an answer, please write.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of Thursday, he had received 32 responses.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of the letters came from people who told him they were in  
dire straits and could use his money. Some were from churches and 
charities. Others just contained advice, such as the note from a 
sheriff who ``had nothing to say but `be careful,''' Goward said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goward is not sure what he's looking for, but he knows none of  
the letters has particularly moved him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I haven't opened up a can of worms,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Goward got divorced long ago, and his three sons grew up with  
their mother in northern Minnesota. He lived in Minneapolis then 
and didn't see them much. Their relationships are still strained, 
though he said he has tried to make amends, visited them 
occasionally and given them money. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they were young, I wasn't with them. I can understand  
that. But I'm a better person now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Goward had colon cancer surgery in December, and although he is  
recovering very well, he has no way of knowing how much longer he 
will live. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his house and his 13-acre lot about 60 miles north of  
Minneapolis, plus his other investments, easily bring his net worth 
up to $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to be able to leave it to someone who loves me,  
but I haven't found anybody like that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Goward's sons, David Goward of Cloquet, wasn't home on  
Thursday but told the Star Tribune he tries not to dwell on their 
relationship.

<HEADLINE> La Russa Released From Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa was  
released from Good Samaritan Hospital on Thursday and returned to 
St. Louis. He was expected to rejoin the team later this week in 
Colorado or early next week in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Rene Lachemann will manage the Cardinals in La Russa's  
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa went to the hospital Wednesday after complaining of  
stomach problems. A team spokesman said the tests found that La 
Russa has nothing more severe than an irritated stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	La Russa, who missed both games of the Cardinals' two-game  
series in Cincinnati, also had tests on his stomach Monday and 
watched most of the Twins' game from the clubhouse in St. Louis on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His stomach began bothering him again Wednesday morning after  
the team arrived in Cincinnati, and Reds team Dr. Timothy Kremchek 
arranged for more tests at Good Samaritan.

<HEADLINE> Pay Up Front for Domain Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- Network Solutions Inc. will begin making  
some customers prepay for registering Web site names, a move it 
hopes will alleviate ``cybersquatting'' -- people registering 
several domain names and then reselling them for a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Network Solutions, which until recently had an exclusive  
contract with the government for the registering of domain names, 
said today the new rules will take effect in September. 
</P>
<P>
	NSI has been criticized in the past for allowing customers to  
register domain names and pay for them later -- sometimes months 
later or not all -- while trying to resell them. This had the effect 
of removing domain names from the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, anyone wanting to register a Web address had to  
pay the Herndon, Va.-based NSI $70 for a registration covering the 
first two years. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year, the U.S. government decided to end NSI's monopoly  
and turn over government management of Internet domain registration 
to the non-profit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and 
Numbers (ICANN). 
</P>
<P>
	ICANN has authorized 20 additional companies, including America  
Online, to begin registering Web addresses, but stipulated that the 
new registrar had to have customers pay in advance, provoking 
criticism of NSI's delayed payment. 
</P>
<P>
	Under its new payment policy, NSI will still allow businesses  
that register domain names in bulk and meet other conditions to pay 
for the addresses later. 
</P>
<P>
	NSI's change in payment policy came only one day before today's  
hearing by the House Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight 
Investigations to look into the domain naming system and its 
problems.

<HEADLINE> NASA To Try Columbia Launch Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- For the third time this week, NASA  
fueled space shuttle Columbia on Thursday for liftoff on the first 
U.S. space flight to be commanded by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure was on: If Columbia didn't lift off early Friday,  
it would be grounded for a month at a cost of millions of dollars. 
The telescope-delivery mission already is almost one year late. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either three strikes and you're out, or the third time's  
the charm,'' said NASA spokesman George Diller. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms took NASA by surprise early Thursday and prevented  
Columbia from blasting off with Air Force Col. Eileen Collins, the 
first woman to lead a mission in 38 years of U.S. human space 
flight, and the $1.5 billion Chandra Observatory, the world's most 
powerful X-ray telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, a hydrogen leak scare in the final seconds of the  
countdown scuttled everything. It turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea went away  
disappointed both times. They were not expected to attend Friday's 
try. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists, some of whom have worked on the Chandra project for  
two decades, were growing more anxious. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``when you've waited 20 years to get the X-ray telescope on  
orbit, one additional day is not something to get particularly 
concerned about,'' said Earle Huckins, NASA's deputy associate 
administrator for space science. 
</P>
<P>
	The 45-foot telescope, once released from Columbia, will spend  
at least five years searching for black holes and peering at 
galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. Astronomers hope to learn 
more about the mysterious dark matter that is believed to fill the 
universe, and better determine the distance to celestial objects. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan called for the five astronauts to eject Chandra from  
the shuttle cargo bay seven hours after liftoff. At 50,000 pounds, 
including a rocket motor and support gear, it is the heaviest 
payload ever carried by a shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	To improve the odds of sending Columbia up Friday, NASA extended  
the launch window from 46 minutes to nearly two hours after new 
calculations showed that the telescope has more battery power than 
previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday was NASA's last chance to launch Columbia until mid- to  
late August because of the impending shutdown of Air Force launch 
facilities for more than three weeks of improvements.

<HEADLINE> Two Children Die in Hot Vans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Two toddlers sent to separate day-care  
facilities died within an hour of each other after both were left 
in vans for hours in 90-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	Darnecia Slater, 22 months, was dead when paramedics arrived at  
the Children's Palace Learning Center on Wednesday afternoon. 
Brandon Mann, 2, was alive when authorities got to the Pee Wee 
Wisdom Learning Center, but he died about an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
	Darnecia's uncle, who identified himself only as Donald, said  
the little girl, her older sister and brother were picked up at 
their home by a day care center van shortly after 7 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the two older children were taken into the center, but  
Darnecia, who was in a child safety seat inside the van, was 
forgotten until about 4 p.m. when it was time for the children to 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities didn't say who found Mann.  
</P>
<P>
	Police spokeswoman Debby Hall said detectives were interviewing  
day care operators and employees. No charges have been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is very odd to have two deaths this close together, 26  
minutes apart,'' she said. ``It is much harder when you are talking 
about a small child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Children's Services also is  
investigating the incidents, said Angeline Vaulx, supervisor with 
day care licensing at the Tennessee Department of Human Services.

<HEADLINE> Chargers, Kramer Agree to Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The San Diego Chargers have suddenly become a  
gathering place for castoff Chicago Bears quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Erik Kramer, dumped by the Bears two days earlier, signed a  
two-year deal Thursday evening, less than an hour before the 
opening team meeting of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer joins Jim Harbaugh, another ex-Bear. The Chargers say the  
starting job is Harbaugh's to lose, but Kramer heard similar talk 
from Chicago, which shocked him by cutting him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a hectic 48 hours,'' said Kramer, who grew up in the  
Los Angeles area. ``I'm just relieved I landed here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer was dazzled by the Chargers' Club Med-like training camp  
at UC San Diego, which overlooks the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday morning, he'll start to find out where he fits in as the  
Chargers open practice under new coach Mike Riley. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly, I don't know at this point. I'm starting from so far  
behind that it's probably going to take me a little bit of time to 
get caught up,'' Kramer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't really talked specifically. They basically said  
this is Jim's job, he's the No. 1 guy and I'm just kind of coming 
in to contribute what I can for the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But being No. 1, as Kramer found out in Chicago, ``doesn't mean  
what it used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer will room with Harbaugh, who joined the Chargers in a  
trade with Baltimore in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer took over with the Bears after Harbaugh was released in  
1994. They're both in San Diego because the Chargers, who once 
employed Jim McMahon, desperately need veteran help after Ryan 
Leaf's disastrous rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer's incentive-laden deal includes a $450,000 signing bonus  
and a base salary this year of approximately $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed the last half of 1998 with injuries to his right  
(throwing) shoulder and left knee that required surgery, but passed 
his physical Wednesday night, his second in 48 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I'm as strong as I need to be right now, but I feel I  
can still get stronger over the next 3-4 weeks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh doesn't feel threatened by the addition of another  
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm loose,'' he said. ``I'm going into this thing feeling  
prepared. I'm with the program here, so if it makes our team 
better, I'm all for it. Personally, I think there's a lot we can 
all learn from Eric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer spurned the Chargers while testing the free agent market  
in February 1998, but general manager Bobby Beathard said there 
were no hard feelings. At the time, Kramer wanted the Chargers to 
guarantee they wouldn't draft a quarterback, a promise Beathard 
wasn't willing to make. 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer ended up staying in Chicago, Stan Humphries retired from  
the Chargers and Beathard drafted Leaf, who threw 15 interceptions 
to just two touchdowns and made news with boorish off-field 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what we we're all looking for, to find the right  
fit,'' said Beathard, who also had pursued free agent Neil 
O'Donnell. ``We feel Kramer gives us that. Last year he's the guy 
we wanted and it didn't work out. We don't feel any different now. 
It's just that we didn't anticipate him being let go by Chicago. We 
went right to work on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kramer said it was a no-brainer to come to San Diego this time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was excited for the chance to be here the first time and it  
just didn't work out. My mind is accepting the fact that this is 
going to work out this time. I'm very excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he's eager for a shot at the Bears at home on Nov. 21.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing that would make me more happy than to get a  
chance to play against those guys,'' he said. ``I hope it's me 
that's on the field. But if it's not, I'll relish standing across 
the field from them as we're kicking their rear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Riley doesn't think the team has a quarterback controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're always in a competition mode,'' Riley said. ``What we're  
looking for is to get the quarterback position squared away through 
training camp. I'm encouraged by the whole thing. It shows the 
football team that the club is always trying to better itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, who was benched after nine starts, and Craig Whelihan  
combined for 34 interceptions and just 10 TD passes last year. By 
comparison, Harbaugh and Kramer combined for 21 touchdowns and 18 
pickoffs with their respective teams even though both battled 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh, 35, has started 123 games in 12 seasons. Kramer, 34,  
has made 63 starts in his previous nine NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers will have four quarterbacks in camp. Jeff Baker,  
who was on the practice squad last year, was cut Thursday.

<HEADLINE>  HBO's 'Sopranos' Leads Emmy Nods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sopranos,'' the HBO series about a  
stressed-out mobster from New Jersey who has issues to work through 
with his therapist, picked up a leading 16 Emmy nominations today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a cable show was ever nominated in the  
best dramatic series category. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a victory for edgy TV,'' said Thomas O'Neil, author of  
``The Emmys.'' Other risk-taking shows, such as ``NYPD Blue'' and 
``Ally McBeal,'' have found favor with Emmy voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' explores mob boss Tony Soprano's angst-ridden  
life and his parallel world of crime and sleaze, all with 
improbable humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations went to series star James Gandolfini; Edie Falco,  
who plays his wife; Lorraine Bracco, his therapist; and Nancy 
Marchand, who as Tony's treacherous mother nearly steals the show. 
John Heard received a nomination for a guest role as a corrupt 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope what it is, is the character flaws -- people identify  
with them,'' series creator and producer David Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making strong showings with 13 nominations apiece were  
Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' ABC's legal drama ``The Practice'' and the 
CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc.'' HBO's risque ``Sex and the City'' 
became the second cable series to be nominated as best comedy. 
HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' was the first. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC got the most nominations, with 82. HBO was second with 74.  
ABC received 58, CBS 46 and Fox 33. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the ABC nominations went to Tony Danza for a guest  
appearance as a savvy lawyer on ``The Practice.'' ``When you get a 
chance to work with those kind of people and those kind of words 
you really have a chance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards will be given out Sept. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the losers Thursday: ``The X-Files'' fell out of the  
dramatic series category, and while Gillian Anderson received a 
best actress nomination, co-star David Duchovny was snubbed. 
Patricia Richardson of ``Home Improvement'' failed to get a bid for 
the series' last year, despite past recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Edwards of ``ER'' was not nominated, and ``Felicity''  
star Keri Russell didn't find TV's fascination with youth extending 
to her or the show. It received only a cinematography nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Kudrow of ``Friends'' received a nomination, but the rest  
of the cast was ignored. The series itself, however, got a best 
comedy nomination after missing out for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports Night,'' ABC's critically praised new sitcom, was  
nominated for directing, writing and editing but failed to make the 
cut for best comedy series.

<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- A Creighton University study found that  
married couples from different Christian denominations divorce at a 
higher rate and are more likely to drift away from the church than 
those who wed within denominations. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the survey also indicated that shared religious  
activities are more important to the success of marriages than 
shared beliefs. And the divorce rate for the ``inter-church'' 
couples was only half that of the U.S. population at large. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denominational differences don't cause breakups,'' said  
Michael Lawlor of Creighton's Center for Marriage and Family. ``It 
depends on what the couple does together religiously and how they 
deal with differences. If they can fashion a shared religious life, 
their marriages will be as stable as any same-church marriage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Couples who were members of different denominations when engaged  
but later affiliated with the same church had a divorce rate of 
only 6 percent, compared with 14 percent for couples of the same 
denomination and 20 percent for those who maintained membership in 
different denominations.

 *Religion writers honor Gibson, O'Reilly, Dallas daily    	
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- David Gibson of The Record in Hackensack,  
N.J., and David O'Reilly of The Philadelphia Inquirer, received top 
individual honors in annual Religion Newswriters Association 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas Morning News religion section was named the nation's  
best for the fourth time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize for writers on mid-sized newspapers went to Larry  
Witham of The Washington (D.C.) Times, and for smaller papers to 
Robin Galiano of the Longview (Texas) News-Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Winners were named at the 50th anniversary of the association,  
which has 240 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Runners-up to Gibson as ``writer of the year'' were Diego  
Ribadeneira of The Boston Globe and Don Lattin of the San Francisco 
Chronicle. Runners-up to O'Reilly as ``reporter of the year'' were 
Gibson and Yonat Shimron of The News &AMP; Observer in Raleigh, NC. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Dallas daily, judges praised The Philadelphia  
Inquirer, The Grand Rapids Press and the Houston Chronicle for 
their religion sections. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-sized newspaper contest, runners-up were Monique  
Parsons of the Home News Tribune, East Brunswick, N.J. and Stephen 
Huba of The Cincinnati Post. Small paper runners-up were Loretta 
Fulton of the Abilene (Texas) Reporter-News and Anne Cumming of the 
Greeley (Colo.) Daily Tribune.

 *Religious sculptor aims to inspire diversity    	
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP)-- A 14-foot, 1,100-pound stainless steel sculpture  
by Wiktor Szostalo, titled Angel of Harmony, has been installed 
next to the St. Louis Cathedral Basilica. 
</P>
<P>
	The work, commissioned by the Catholic archdiocese, depicts a  
smiling black angel with outstretched arms, and wings comprised of 
over 100 wind chimes made of copper and brass. The angel protects 
three children: a Hispanic boy playing a flute, a black boy beating 
drums and an Asian girl ringing a bell. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our churches are covered with beautiful images of God,  
Jesus and Mary with European features,'' said Bishop Edward 
Braxton. ``If we're going to look at ourselves as Catholics in 
diversity, it's important that we see images that are diverse in 
backgrounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szostalo, an immigrant from Poland, is known for his work in  
welded stainless steel. He has many pieces in churches from 
California to New Jersey, often with black religious images. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like working with churches,'' he said. ``Usually the work  
means to them much more than a couple of abstract cubes stuck 
together in some lawn in a city where no one even looks.''

 *Maine rabbi hopes to draw Orthodox Jews    	
</P>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A rabbi newly arrived in Portland hopes  
to counter the perception that Maine has little to offer Orthodox 
Jews and to reverse a 30-year decline in worship attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	At Rabbi Isaac Yagod's Shaarey Tphiloh Synagogue, membership has  
fallen over the past 30 years from 500 families to just 125. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagod, 41, moved from Memphis, Tenn., a metropolitan area three  
times the size of Portland that was similarly considered a 
difficult location for Orthodox Jews. That changed, starting 20 
years ago, when an Orthodox synagogue began offering youth 
activities, contemporary music, classes, speakers and weeknight 
events designed to include all Jews. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagod wants that to happen in Portland. But he acknowledged that  
some shortcomings, for instance the lack of classes beyond second 
grade at Portland's Jewish day school, cannot be overcome quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of Shaarey Tphiloh, Peter Lewis, said resources for  
Orthodox Jews have shrunk so much that he's thinking of moving to a 
city with a larger observant community. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost a lot of younger families,'' he said.

 *North Dakotan plans to process halal meat for Muslims    	
</P>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- North Dakota is meat country, but the  
state's small Muslim population has difficulty buying fare that 
fits the faith's dietary rules. So investment consultant Adnan 
Aldayel plans to open a processing plant for Muslim meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some other states, they might have places that will sell it on  
a smaller scale. In North Dakota, it's impossible,'' said Aldayel, 
an immigrant from Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Islam forbids the eating of meat that is not halal, meaning  
legal. The religion requires that an animal be slaughtered by a 
Muslim who slits its jugular vein and says ``Allah.'' In a pinch, 
some Muslims use Jewish kosher meat. 
</P>
<P>
	Aldayel, who received a state grant for a marketing study, is  
enlisting investors and hopes to begin production by the fall. He 
will slaughter cattle, sheep, bison, goat and elk, giving producers 
of those livestock another outlet. Meanwhile, a regional lamb 
growers' cooperative says it also plans to process halal meat for 
restaurants with Muslim customers.

another half length back in the seven-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the second in five starts this year for Betsy Blue  
Eyes, who covered 1 1/16 miles in 1:43. She returned $5.60, $3.60

	Armstrong, making an inspirational return from testicular  
cancer, came in 51st in a stage won by Belgium's Tom Steels. The 
27-year-old Texan crossed the finish line with much of the pack, 
retaining his overall lead of 6 minutes, 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels surged past his rivals in the last seconds of the 17th  
stage to capture his third stage of the Tour. Robbie McEwen of 
Australia was second and Erik Zabel of Germany was third. 
</P>
<P>
	The 125-mile stage went from the foot of the Pyrenees mountains  
near Spain into the Bordeaux region, where cyclists rode through 
pine forests and past vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's run came a day after his name was cleared by cycling  
authorities. He contends he is the victim of a French media 
campaign to unsettle him during his bid to win the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said the unfounded drug abuse claims for the last week  
marred his performance during two days of climbing in the Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want me to crack on the bike -- and I'm not going to,'' he  
said defiantly on Wednesday. ``It's vulture journalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong is now just three days from what appears almost  
certain triumph. He looks stronger than ever, and now the climbing 
is done. The race finishes Sunday in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	For two days, the French newspaper Le Monde has reported traces  
of a corticosteroid were detected in his urine, and that of other 
riders as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs that  
are not classed as steroids. They are banned unless prescribed by 
doctors for conditions such as asthma. 
</P>
<P>
	Cycling's governing body confirmed Wednesday the only drug  
Armstrong has been taking is an authorized skin cream for saddle 
sores. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong said he has been ``persecuted,'' and that drug  
accusations that he believes will inevitably be leveled at leaders 
at the Tour de France in the future ``is bad for cycling and for 
the Tour de France.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of his closest competitors, Alex Zulle, doubts he is strong  
enough to catch Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great cyclist, one who is driven by huge motivation and  
determination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The French media began sniping at Armstrong a week ago after he  
powered to victory in the Alps, intimating only banned drugs can 
explain his dramatic success. 
</P>
<P>
	After being diagnosed in October 1996, he had surgery to remove  
his right testicle and brain lesions, then underwent three months 
of chemotherapy. He was out for the 1997 season and began his 
comeback only last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong described the accusations as the latest example of  
people not believing in him. First, he said, few gave him a chance 
of beating cancer. Then teams were reluctant to employ him because 
of his medical history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a story of not being given chances,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Hargrove Leaves Indians Without DH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A mix-up by manager Mike Hargrove left the  
Cleveland Indians in a mess Thursday night -- they were forced to 
play Toronto without a designated hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Charles Nagy became the first Indians pitcher to  
bat in an AL park since Jim Kern on July 28, 1978. Nagy, hitting in 
the seventh spot, struck out in the second inning against David 
Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove originally listed Manny Ramirez, who leads the majors  
with 101 RBIs, as the DH and had rookie Alex Ramirez in right 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Toronto batted in the first, Blue Jays manager Jim  
Fregosi came onto the field and pointed out to plate umpire Rocky 
Roe that Manny Ramirez had taken his regular place in right field 
for the top half of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the mistake -- a DH taking a position in the field --  
the Indians lost their DH and the pitcher had to bat. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove's lineup posted in the clubhouse hours before the game  
was intended to help rest Manny Ramirez, who had made 85 starts in 
right field this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I'd give Manny a bit of a break by putting him at DH  
and using Alex in right field,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	Apparently, Hargrove forgot to make the switch on the field.  
</P>
<P>
	Confused fans cheered Nagy on every swing when he came to bat in  
the second against Wells. Nagy fouled off three pitches before 
striking out to lower his career average to .067 (1-for-15).

<HEADLINE>  HBO's 'Sopranos' Leads Emmy Nods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``The Sopranos,'' the HBO series about a  
stressed-out mobster from New Jersey who has issues to work through 
with his therapist, picked up a leading 16 Emmy nominations today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time a cable show was ever nominated in the  
best dramatic series category. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a victory for edgy TV,'' said Thomas O'Neil, author of  
``The Emmys.'' Other risk-taking shows, such as ``NYPD Blue'' and 
``Ally McBeal,'' have found favor with Emmy voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Sopranos'' explores mob boss Tony Soprano's angst-ridden  
life and his parallel world of crime and sleaze, all with 
improbable humor. 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations went to series star James Gandolfini; Edie Falco,  
who plays his wife; Lorraine Bracco, his therapist; and Nancy 
Marchand, who as Tony's treacherous mother nearly steals the show. 
John Heard received a nomination for a guest role as a corrupt 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope what it is, is the character flaws -- people identify  
with them,'' series creator and producer David Chase said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making strong showings with 13 nominations apiece were  
Fox's ``Ally McBeal,'' ABC's legal drama ``The Practice'' and the 
CBS miniseries ``Joan of Arc.'' HBO's risque ``Sex and the City'' 
became the second cable series to be nominated as best comedy. 
HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' was the first. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC got the most nominations, with 82. HBO was second with 74.  
ABC received 58, CBS 46 and Fox 33. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the ABC nominations went to Tony Danza for a guest  
appearance as a savvy lawyer on ``The Practice.'' ``When you get a 
chance to work with those kind of people and those kind of words 
you really have a chance,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The awards will be given out Sept. 12.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the losers Thursday: ``The X-Files'' fell out of the  
dramatic series category, and while Gillian Anderson received a 
best actress nomination, co-star David Duchovny was snubbed. 
Patricia Richardson of ``Home Improvement'' failed to get a bid for 
the series' last year, despite past recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Edwards of ``ER'' was not nominated, and ``Felicity''  
star Keri Russell didn't find TV's fascination with youth extending 
to her or the show. It received only a cinematography nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Kudrow of ``Friends'' received a nomination, but the rest  
of the cast was ignored. The series itself, however, got a best 
comedy nomination after missing out for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sports Night,'' ABC's critically praised new sitcom, was  
nominated for directing, writing and editing but failed to make the 
cut for best comedy series.

<HEADLINE> Knight Ridder Quarterly Earnings Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Newspaper publisher Knight Ridder  
reported a 14 percent rise in quarterly earnings today, crediting 
advertising growth and lower newsprint costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings per share were 83 cents, up from 73 cents reported in  
second-quarter 1998 by Knight Ridder, which publishes The Miami 
Herald, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the San Jose Mercury News. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call had predicted 82 cents a share.  
Knight Ridder's stock rose 1 percent on the news in early trading, 
to $55. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income rose 29 percent to $86.6 million in the quarter ended  
June 27, up from $66.9 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Total revenues were $809.6 million, up from $779.2 million a  
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	These results exclude profits from Knight Ridder's sale of its  
minority investment in Zip2 Corp. and in AT&AMP;T stock that the 
company received in return for divesting its cable partnership with 
Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	It also doesn't include $2.4 million in severance costs, $11.6  
million in corporate relocation costs and $3.1 million in final 
settlements on 1997 newspaper sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a very good quarter, with both revenue growth and cost  
trends working in our favor. Most encouragingly, San Jose had its 
best quarter for ad revenue growth in a year and a half,'' Chairman 
and CEO Tony Ridder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder credited its 3.9 percent overall increase in ad  
revenue to ``unusually robust'' general advertising and surging 
classified sales with the help of cross-newspaper and 
cross-publisher buys through Newspapers First and Newspaper 
National Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Ross Jones, Knight Ridder's chief financial officer, attributed  
a 24 percent overall increase in general advertising to dramatic 
growth in national auto, telecom, Internet and travel advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating costs rose just 0.3 percent -- mostly because the price  
per ton of newsprint dropped 9.7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking ahead, we foresee an excellent 1999 for Knight Ridder,  
with perhaps even more strength in the second half than some had 
thought,'' Jones said, predicting continued cost controls and low 
newsprint prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight Ridder is the nation's second-largest newspaper  
publisher, with 31 daily newspapers, a readership of 9.2 million 
daily and 13.1 million Sunday, and 45 associated Web sites under 
the name Real Cities. Knight Ridder also has investments in two 
newsprint mills.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Asked To Reduce Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former presidents Ford and Carter are among  
prominent Americans asking the entertainment industry to reduce the 
amount of violent and sexual material shown to children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call upon industry leaders in all media -- television, film,  
music, video and electronic games -- to band together to develop a 
new voluntary code of conduct,'' wrote the signatories of ``An 
Appeal to Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We appeal to those who are reaping great profits to give  
something back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A bipartisan group of senators, including Joe Lieberman,  
D-Conn., Sam Brownback, R-Kan., Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, John 
McCain, R-Ariz., and Kent Conrad, D-N.D., released the appeal 
Wednesday at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those signing it, in addition to Ford and Carter, were  
Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, retired Gens. Norman 
Schwarzkopf and Colin Powell, entertainers Steve Allen, Naomi Judd, 
Carol Lawrence and Joan Van Ark, and political figures Sam Nunn, 
William Bennett and Jack Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeal refers to the ``growing public appreciation of the  
link between our excessively violent and degrading entertainment 
culture and the horrifying new crimes we see emerging among our 
young.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A voluntary code urged for the industry would:  
</P>
<P>
	--Affirm the industry's responsibility for the nation's cultural  
health. 
</P>
<P>
	--Establish minimum standards for violent, sexual and degrading  
material. 
</P>
<P>
	--Commit the industry to an overall reduction in entertainment  
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ban the targeting of adult-oriented entertainment to youth  
markets. 
</P>
<P>
	--Provide more accurate information to parents on media content.  
</P>
<P>
	Last month the National Association of Theater Owners, in  
response to requests from President Clinton, said it would adopt a 
new policy requiring youths unaccompanied by adults to produce 
photo identification before they could be admitted to R-rated 
films.

<HEADLINE> Rapper Wants To Change Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Foxy Brown doesn't want to be known as a bad  
girl anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old rapper, best known for her raunchy lyrics and  
revealing clothes, told the August edition of Essence magazine that 
she plans to clean up her image -- at least a little bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have teen-age girls who come up to me all the time, like,  
`Foxy!' and reciting my lyrics, and I'm like, `Whoa -- you know 
what? I need to stop using so much cursing,''' said Brown, who had 
hits with the albums ``Ill Na Na'' and ``Chyna Doll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want women to be proud of me as a whole -- grandmothers,  
mothers -- and I want to change the way I'm perceived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the current pin-up model for Calvin Klein says don't  
expect her to become chaste. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not even going to say that I'm going to change my lyrics,  
because I'll be going against everything I stand for. And I won't 
have any of the fans that loved me and supported me through the 
first four years of my career,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Browns May Be Football's Happiest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The big boys are going to summer camp.  
</P>
<P>
	And the happiest family is the one in Cleveland, whose boys will  
be attending camp at Berea, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Family is what the Cleveland Browns are to the city of  
Cleveland, and now the prodigal sons have returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps ``returned'' is incorrect because the Browns never  
really left. Sure, owner Art Modell, some front-office personnel 
and a bunch of players left after the 1995 NFL season for the 
money-greener fields of Maryland, where they became the Baltimore 
Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	The name Browns, the uniform colors of brown, burnt orange and  
white and the club records remained in the city that refused to let 
go. 
</P>
<P>
	The feats of Jim Brown, the greatest running back in history, is  
in the Browns' record book, not the Ravens' record book. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Couch, the quarterback from Kentucky, is just as much a  
member of the Browns as quarterbacks Otto Graham, Milt Plum, Frank 
Ryan or Bernie Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
	One of head coach Chris Palmer's jobs in training camp will be  
to make the players understand the legacy that's been handed down 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the players to know what it means to play for the  
Cleveland Browns, what it means to play in this city, and in front 
of these fans,'' Palmer said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be new owners, new coaches and new players, but to the  
fans, this is not a new franchise. The new people are just 
fortunate to be joining the old Cleveland Browns, one of the 
storied teams in sports. It's just another chapter in the 
continuing Browns saga that has resumed after a few blank pages. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this new chapter so interesting, of course, is that  
for once the chase after the almighty dollar was not allowed to 
tear community pride to shreds, as it did when the Dodgers left 
Brooklyn for Los Angeles after the 1957 season. 
</P>
<P>
	It won't take the players long to find out what the Browns mean  
to their fans. Because of the high interest, the team is making all 
of its practices open to the public and will give out 4,500 tickets 
each day there is a practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were the first NFL club to open camp, with rookies  
and free agents reporting Wednesday. Veteran players are scheduled 
to report Friday, and the first full-scale workout will be 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The first exhibition game will be against the Dallas Cowboys in  
the Hall of Fame Game at Canton, Ohio, the night of Monday, Aug. 3. 
It will be televised by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch and his teammates will become real Browns when the NFL  
season opens Sept. 12. Emotions will be high that Sunday night when 
the Browns play host to a team from another city, whose heart beats 
with the ups and downs of a football team -- the Pittsburgh 
Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
	While the name and the uniforms remain the same, there is one  
change that even the staunchest Browns fans have to welcome. 
Instead of vast and windy Cleveland Stadium, the new era will open 
in spanking new Cleveland Browns Stadium.

<HEADLINE> Business Reporter Loses Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Mercury News took away a  
business reporter's column after she made $9,000 by taking 
advantage of a stock deal offered by a local executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's editors said Wednesday that Chris Nolan, whose  
``Talk is Cheap'' column focused on Silicon Valley, had overstepped 
ethical boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercury News executive editor David Yarnold said Ms. Nolan had  
``at a minimum, created the appearance of a conflict of interest 
for herself and the Mercury News and she failed to exercise a 
reasonable level of professional responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Yarnold said, two editors involved in the case will  
face disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nolan was transferred out of the business news section and  
suspended for a week without pay. Her new assignment was not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper's ethics policy says staffers shouldn't make news  
decisions about companies in which they have a financial interest 
and advises business news staffers not to invest in local 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nolan's column was suspended last week after The Wall Street  
Journal reported she made $9,000 after buying Autoweb.com stock at 
a discount and selling her shares for a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief executive of Autoweb.com is a close friend of Ms.  
Nolan's and offered her the stock legally, though it was not an 
offer usually available to investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Nolan defended her actions, pointing out that she consulted  
an editor when considering the purchase in February and that she 
vowed not to write about Autoweb.com. She said her editors never 
told her not to proceed.

<HEADLINE> Senate Seeks New Nuclear Labs Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *BY JOHN DIAMOND   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration and the  
Republican-controlled Congress are moving toward agreement on a 
legislative response to alleged espionage at the U.S. nuclear 
weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson responded favorably to a  
near-unanimous Senate vote Wednesday that would create a new agency 
responsible for nuclear weapons development and security at the 
vast U.S. nuclear weapons lab complexes. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency would largely bypass the Energy Department  
bureaucracy, but with the help of amendments offered by Democrats, 
Richardson would retain control over the policy and operations of 
the newly dubbed Agency for Nuclear Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 96-1 on an amendment to a bill reauthorizing  
government intelligence programs. The intelligence legislation then 
passed on a voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson called the legislation ``a good start'' that was  
improved by the Democratic amendments ensuring Cabinet-level 
control over the new agency. The initial Republican proposal, 
Richardson said, would have repeated past mistakes by creating ``a 
firewall between the defense labs and the (Energy) Department's 
counterintelligence and security professionals whose sole mission 
is the protection of our nation's secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the White House held out the possibility of a veto if the  
final measure takes too much power away from the energy secretary, 
who would be ultimately responsible for the newly created agency. 
The House has not yet considered the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure stems from widespread concern over alleged espionage  
at U.S. nuclear weapons labs, which fall under the Energy 
Department's jurisdiction. The FBI has been investigating several 
cases dating back to the 1980s. In one case, a Taiwanese-American 
scientist who was assigned to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico is suspected of helping China gain classified information on 
at least one, and possibly several, U.S. nuclear weapons designs. 
No charges have been filed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of the reforms necessary to begin  
cleaning up this espionage mess and to begin seeing to it that it 
doesn't happen again,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., one of the 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional committees, along with a Clinton  
administration-sponsored commission study, have concluded that 
blurry lines of authority between the labs and the department 
allowed widely known security concerns to be ignored for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got a structure that addresses accountability in  
the weapons labs,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, another 
sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said, ``there were people who didn't  
know who was responsible'' for security ``or so many people 
responsible that no one was.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said in a statement that it wanted to examine  
the final version of the bill before supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If language is adopted that would undermine Secretary  
Richardson's ability to effectively manage the department, 
including efforts to reorganize the department's handling of 
counterintelligence and broader security matters, the secretary of 
energy would recommend that the president veto the bill,'' the 
White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some House members have said they would favor even stronger  
legislation, establishing an agency with greater independence, 
similar to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	And House committee leaders with jurisdiction over intelligence,  
military and scientific matters have said they want the bill to be 
freestanding, not part of broader legislation addressing other 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., won changes that would give Richardson  
and his successors greater authority over the new agency, which 
would be charged with research and development of nuclear weapons 
as well as counterintelligence and security at the weapons labs. 
Levin said the changes, which paved the way for the near-unanimous 
vote, would improve the chances that a bill ultimately will be sent 
to the president and signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., voted against the bill because he  
believed it would give DOE and the newly created agency the 
authority to reopen reactors at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in 
Washington state without any environmental oversight.

<HEADLINE> Winds Spread California Wildfires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CUYAMA, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters braced for another breezy  
afternoon today as they battled a wildfire that has scorched 8,775 
acres of northern Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
	``Late afternoon winds have been the biggest problem,'' U.S.  
Forest Service spokesman Joe Pasinato said Wednesday evening, as 
flames in dense brush threatened to move toward about 40 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Air tankers on Wednesday dumped retardant on dense foliage along  
the southern flank of the fire, which was started Sunday by a spark 
from a tractor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot of fuel in that area of the Los Padres National  
Forest, with old-growth vegetation that hasn't burned for more than 
75 years,'' Pasinato said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire area about 30 miles north of Santa Barbara was 45  
percent surrounded late Wednesday evening, with full containment 
expected possibly by Sunday night, said Santa Barbara County Fire 
Capt. Steve Kleist. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,500 firefighters battled flames on the ground in  
remote foothills. Eight air tankers and five helicopters were 
involved, with 14 bulldozers clearing brush in areas where the 
blaze may spread.

<HEADLINE> Health Warnings Urged for Cigars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators say they want to correct  
misperceptions that cigars are less dangerous than cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	But longtime cigar smoker George Gikas says proposed new health  
warning labels for cigars -- which stress their dangers -- totally 
miss the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's irrelevant. You don't smoke cigars because you  
don't want to smoke cigarettes,'' said Gikas, shopping at a 
Washington tobacco shop Wednesday. A consultant, Gikas has smoked 
about three cigars a day since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Federal Trade Commission says cigar smokers need to be  
aware that they face risks -- namely mouth, throat and even lung 
cancer -- when they light up, and on Wednesday, the commission urged 
Congress to require warning labels on cigars. 
</P>
<P>
	The recommendation came with figures showing cigar makers  
reported a 43 percent increase in dollar sales, from $613 million 
to $876 million, and a 15 percent increase in cigar unit sales from 
1996 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be people under the misimpression that if they  
switch to cigars they are in safe harbors,'' FTC Chairman Robert 
Pitofsky said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Most cigar boxes already include a label required under a  
settlement of a California court case that says the product 
``contains/produces chemicals known to the state of California to 
cause cancer and birth defects and other reproductive harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the commission suggested three stronger warning labels to be  
used in rotation and displayed prominently on cigar packages or 
boxes: 
</P>
<P>
	--Warning: Regular cigar smoking can cause cancers of the mouth  
and throat, even if you do not inhale. 
</P>
<P>
	--Warning: Inhaling cigar smoke can cause lung cancer. The more  
deeply you inhale, the greater your risk. 
</P>
<P>
	--Warning: Cigars are not a safe alternative to cigarettes.  
</P>
<P>
	For cigars sold individually, the FTC suggested that retailers  
should post signs in their shops. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has the power to require labels on its own, but  
Pitofsky said Congress traditionally has handled such tobacco 
labeling matters. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Rep. Ed Markey, 
D-Mass., already are reintroducing legislation that would treat 
cigars like other tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups said they don't think additional warning labels  
are needed, particularly given the background of their audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigar smokers tend to be well-educated, well-informed  
individuals,'' said Norman Sharp, president of the Cigar 
Association of America. Sharp cited surveys referred to in the 
report showing that the vast majority of cigar smokers light up 
only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chris Graae, a Washington architect who typically smokes one  
cigar a week, admits ``there are people who indiscriminately smoke 
a lot of cigars thinking it's not nearly as bad for you as 
cigarettes.'' He thinks the labels might dissuade younger smokers 
who think it's fashionable and smoke more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitofsky said he himself switched from smoking cigarettes to  
cigars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even I wasn't aware of the risks at the time,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The commission also urged a ban on television and radio cigar  
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar events at restaurants, bars and private clubs have become  
more common, the report also said. Total advertising and 
promotional expenditures for cigars increased 32 percent to $41 
million in 1997. Spending on celebrity endorsements, as well as 
payments for product placement in movies and television, more than 
doubled, the commission found.

<HEADLINE> Farm Protection Funding Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Few object to the idea of keeping bulldozers  
away from the nation's most fertile farmland. Finding $50 million 
to pay more farmers to keep farming is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said Wednesday that federal spending  
restrictions would make it difficult to renew a three-year-old farm 
preservation program that helps state and local governments buy 
easements, or development rights, from farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he plans to press on with his bill to authorize $50 million  
a year for easements, under which farmers would continue to own 
land but would be barred from nonfarm activities. A bill by Sen. 
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., would offer $55 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Farmland Preservation Program enables producers facing  
economic uncertainty to keep their valuable land in production 
while keeping development pressures at bay,'' Santorum said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Agriculture Secretary Richard Rominger came in support of  
such funding, saying urban sprawl threatens to pave over fertile 
farmland. But farm preservation must compete with other agriculture 
programs to stay within caps reached under a 1997 balanced budget 
agreement between Congress and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Rominger said farmland loss averages about 1.5 million acres  
each year. Conversion of prime farmland occurs two to four times 
faster than less-fertile land, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conversion of farmland threatens the future of the nation's  
food supply and also means lower standards of water and air quality 
and lack of open space,'' Rominger told the Senate Agriculture, 
Nutrition and Forestry Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 farm law set aside $35 million in federal funds over  
five years to match state and local spending for farm preservation 
programs, but the money lasted only three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rominger said the money was paying for 460 easements covering  
more than 127,000 acres. But the needs are greater, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton requested $77.5 million for farm preservation  
in his fiscal 2000 budget, although some of the money would come 
from existing accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions have come up about the program's price tag and  
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, said that although he did not  
necessarily oppose the program, he was concerned that the easements 
might not withstand court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	By selling an easement, a farmer agrees to keep the land for  
agricultural uses and passes on that requirement to any subsequent 
owners. Rominger said an easement should carry as much legal weight 
as the sale of mineral rights to a particular tract. 
</P>
<P>
	Guy F. Donaldson, a fruit grower who is president of the  
Pennsylvania Farm Bureau, said selling easements helps give farmers 
the money needed to buy additional farmland or farm equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Fitzpatrick, chairman of the Bucks County, Pa., Board of  
Commissioners, said his county next to Philadelphia has lost 
two-thirds of its farmland since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the federal, state and local governments do not step in to  
save family farms, we're certain they will disappear in the 
future,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Winds Kick Up Calif. Wildfire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW CUYAMA, Calif. (AP) -- A wildfire that has scorched 8,775  
acres on a four-day run through bush and brush intensified 
Wednesday afternoon as winds kicked up a smoky plume over northern 
Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
	Aircraft dumped water and retardant on flames creeping southward  
toward the edge of the San Rafael Wilderness Area, and more than 
1,500 firefighters battled on the ground in an all-out effort to 
halt the blaze in the remote foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winds have picked up and there is some significant burning  
right now,'' county fire Capt. Charlie Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight tankers and five helicopters continued the air assault,  
dumping water and retardant on hotspots. Fourteen bulldozers 
cleared brush in areas where the blaze may spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire area some 180 miles northwest of Los Angeles and 30  
miles north of Santa Barbara, was 40 percent surrounded, with full 
containment expected at 6 p.m. Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Jockey's Brother Tries as Trainer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Eighteen years after Cash Asmussen won the  
Coaching Club American Oaks as a jockey, his brother will try to 
win the Grade I stakes as a trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Asmussen will saddle Mother Goose winner Dreams Galore  
for the 1 1/2-mile race Saturday at Belmont Park. Cash Asumussen won 
the 1981 Oaks aboard Wayward Lass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very pleased with her,'' Stephen Asmussen said Thursday of  
Dreams Galore. ``The only question is the distance. But none of 
them has gone that far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mother Goose was 1 1/8 miles.  
</P>
<P>
	In other starts, Dreams Gallore finished second to the  
sensational Silverbulletday in the Kentucky Oaks at Churchill Downs 
and Black-Eyed Susan at Pimlico and was fourth when Silverbulletday 
won the Davonna Dale at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans. She also 
was third in the Fantasy won by Excellent Meeting at Oaklawn Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Dreams Galore rivals will be Irish-bred Gracious Plenty,  
making her debut in the United States and on dirt, and 
Canadian-bred Synchronized. 
</P>
<P>
	Gracious Plenty finished fifth on the grass at 1 1/2 miles at Royal  
Ascot in England. In the race before that, she broke her maiden an 
an all-weather track at Lingfield in England. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gracious Plenty has been a mile and a half, and I'm confident  
about her getting the distance,'' trainer Mark Hennig said. 
``Nobody knows how she's going to handle the dirt here. We didn't 
bring her over here to run on the dirt. I think she'll be a pretty 
nice grass horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sychronized has won stakes at Aqueduct, Laurel and Fort Erie.  
</P>
<P>
	Also in the field for the $350,000 race are Free Vacation, On a  
Soapbox, Strolling Belle, Queen's Word and Denver Zephyr.

<HEADLINE> Top CART Rookie Awed by Speedway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- Juan Montoya's eyes widened with the  
memory of his first laps around Michigan Speedway's high-banked 
oval. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was the fastest I've ever driven a car,'' the sensational  
rookie said, recalling his recent test session. ``The speeds in the 
corners were amazing. I kept telling my engineer on the radio, `I 
just set a new Montoya speed record!''' 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into today's opening practice for the U.S. 500, Montoya  
has a seven-point lead over Dario Franchitti in the season 
standings despite having failed to finish the last two races. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, a 23-year-old Colombian, has already won four poles and  
four races, but the youngster had never driven on a big oval like 
Michigan until he tested here for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited and a little bit nervous about my first 500-mile  
race, but I'm looking forward to experiencing those speeds during a 
race,'' Montoya said. 
</P>
<P>
	After running to the finish and scoring points in all but one of  
his first nine CART races, Montoya had a broken gearbox two weeks 
ago at Road America and crashed midway through the Toronto race 
last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very bad feeling not to finish a race and to have to  
come back to the pits and watch it from there,'' he said. ``You 
can't always control what happens to you on the track, but one of 
my goals is to finish all the remaining races this year, beginning 
with the U.S. 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is likely to be the most competitive race Montoya has ever  
been in. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, tragedy turned the U.S. 500 into an afterthought.  
</P>
<P>
	A wheel and other debris from the one-car crash of Adrian  
Fernandez flew into the stands, killing three spectators and 
injuring six others. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with new, higher fences and wheel tethers on the Champ Cars  
to help protect spectators, CART and speedway officials are praying 
the attention remains on the two-mile, high-banked oval. 
</P>
<P>
	The CART FedEx Series includes only two 500-mile events on its  
20-race schedule -- this one and the season-ending Marlboro 500 at 
California Speedway, Michigan's sister track in Fontana, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are also the only ovals where the cars are slowed by a  
wing-like rear aerodynamic piece called the Handford Device. 
</P>
<P>
	In its first race trial last July, the device paid extra  
dividends, not only cutting top speeds from more than 240 mph to 
just over 230, but also making it a cinch to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a CART record 62 lead changes among nine drivers  
during the 1998 U.S. 500, with winner Greg Moore making the final 
pass in the first turn of the last lap to beat Jimmy Vasser, 
Montoya's Target-Chip Ganassi Racing teammate. 
</P>
<P>
	On the slightly less-banked Fontana oval in November, there were  
25 lead changes among seven drivers before Vasser turned the tables 
on Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Handford Device does slow the cars down and bunch them  
up,'' said Michael Andretti, who led both races. ``It's a great 
show for the fans, but it makes for a hairy race for the drivers. 
To have wheel-to-wheel racing for 500 miles is pretty intense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Fittipaldi, Andretti's Newman-Haas Racing teammate,  
went out of last year's U.S. 500 after just 87 of the 250 laps due 
to overheating. But the Brazilian driver finished seventh at 
Fontana and is on a roll right now, gaining his first CART victory 
at Road America and finishing third in Toronto 
</P>
<P>
	``The Handford wing takes the downforce away from the car and  
therefore reduces the speeds. Some drivers liked it and some 
didn't,'' Fittipaldi said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 500-mile race is harder on your head than it is on your body  
because you are going so fast the entire time. You have to really 
concentrate hard every second. If you don't pay attention and fully 
concentrate for a split second, the consequences are huge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fittipaldi is third, just 17 points behind Montoya, followed one  
point back by Andretti. Gil de Ferran, Fernandez, Moore and Paul 
Tracy are all within striking distance with nine races remaining.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Heavyweight boxer Ike Ibeabuchi was arrested  
Thursday on charges he sexually assaulted a woman in his hotel 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
	Metro Police Lt. Tom Monahan said a 21-year-old entertainer on  
call, whose name was not released, was called to Ibeabuchi's suite 
in The Mirage hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Hotel guests heard a commotion and summoned hotel security, who  
then called police. When police arrived about 5:30 a.m., the woman 
said Ibeabuchi had sexually assaulted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Monahan said Ibeabuchi, 26, barricaded himself in the bathroom  
of his hotel suite and surrendered a few minutes later after 
officers sprayed pepper spray under the door. 
</P>
<P>
	Ibeabuchi was booked into the Clark County Detention Center on  
charges of sexual assault and battery with intent to commit sexual 
assault.

<HEADLINE> Two Sentenced in 'Scream' Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Two teen-age cousins who said the slasher  
movie ``Scream'' inspired them to kill one boy's mother in a 
stabbing attack have been sentenced to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Padilla, 17, received life imprisonment without the  
possibility of parole, while 16-year-old Samuel Ramirez received 25 
years to life. Ramirez was not eligible for the same sentence 
because he was only 14 at the time of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
	The teens were convicted of killing Padilla's mother, Gina  
Castillo, 37, who was stabbed 45 times in 1998. The boys admitted 
they attacked while she was seated at her home computer. Padilla 
stabbed her and Ramirez held her down. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony at a preliminary hearing showed the boys were obsessed  
with the movie ``Scream'' and its sequel, ``Scream 2.'' In the 
movies, teens are knifed by killers in Grim Reaper costumes. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the boys said the slayings depicted were ``cool.'' On the  
way home from one of many viewings, he told a friend: ``It was a 
perfect way to kill somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement read in court Thursday, Padilla described his  
reactions to TV and movie violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first stage you see a guy's head being blown off and you  
feel compassion,'' he said. ``The second stage you see it again, 
you feel compassion, but it's not as strong as the first ... the 
fifth stage, you want to do it but it's just a thought. The last 
stage you do it and you want to do it again.''

<HEADLINE> Organizers Contaced IOC Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Judging by newly disclosed records, Atlanta  
Olympics organizers definitely knew how to use a personal touch in 
securing the 1996 Games from the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	One memo reminds a staffer to get some baseballs signed by home  
run king Henry Aaron for officials from the baseball-mad Dominican 
Republic. There was no indication whether Aaron actually supplied 
the balls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press joined two other media outlets Wednesday in  
taking a preliminary glimpse through the documents, which initially 
showed no evidence of wrongdoing on the scale of Salt Lake City, 
where organizers gave cash, free college scholarships and other 
gifts to win the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents, available to the public for the first time, did  
show that Atlanta organizers made early contact with IOC members 
later disciplined for their role in the Salt Lake City bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	One memo shows Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne ordering a  
$875 live bulldog to help secure the bid of a since-deceased Cuban 
IOC member, and another shows him requesting free airfare for two 
IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	But most of the documents reviewed ranged from mundane thank-you  
notes to tersely written letters quibbling over printing bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,500 boxes of documents previously were kept private by the  
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games and the Georgia Amateur 
Athletic Foundation -- the organization founded by Payne to bid for 
the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	An index of the boxes of documents was made available Monday --  
with requests taking two days to process. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight additional boxes of what ACOG feels are private documents  
are under review by congressional investigators in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	They were not listed in the index made available to the public  
Monday, and are at the center of a continuing legal fight between 
ACOG and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The newspaper, which 
sent 10 reporters to pore over the boxes Wednesday, has joined with 
state Attorney General Thurbert Baker in arguing the papers are 
covered by the Georgia Open Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Atlanta was nominated as the U.S. bid city in April,  
1988, the bid committee was in contact with IOC members Kim Un-yong 
of Korea, Anton Geesink of Finland and Phil Coles of Australia -- 
all of whom were disciplined by the IOC earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim and Geesink were accused of accepting inappropriate gifts  
from Salt Lake City organizers, while Coles was accused of helping 
Salt Lake City by providing information on fellow IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members eventually resigned or were expelled in the  
wake of the scandal, which also has prompted the probe by the U.S. 
House Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In helping land the bid, Payne called in several favors from  
friends at the Augusta National Golf Club, home of The Masters 
tournament. The club played host to several rounds of golf for IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents indicate Payne used a deft touch not only in  
dealing with IOC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 1989 letter, Payne reminded University of Georgia president  
Charles Knapp of Georgia Tech's increasing involvement with the 
Olympic bid. Payne, a former Georgia Bulldogs football star, also 
mentioned that he was giving a commencement address at Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, Georgia hosted the Olympic soccer competition in  
Athens, and also some volleyball preliminaries and rhythmic 
gymnastics.

<HEADLINE> Kennedys Gather for Burial at Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WOODS HOLE, Mass. (AP) -- The Kennedy family gathered on Cape Cod  
today for the burial at sea of John F. Kennedy Jr., whose body was 
found in the fractured, sunken fuselage of his plane near those of 
his wife and sister-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The burial, the latest step in a tragedy that has gripped the  
nation for nearly a week, was to be held this morning from the USS 
Briscoe, a 563-foot Navy destroyer, a government source said on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The ashes of all three victims reportedly were to be scattered  
at sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy divers recovered their bodies Wednesday in murky waters off  
Martha's Vineyard, 116 feet below the surface and 7 1/2 miles from 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we were able to bring closure to two families and that I  
think we realize is very important,'' said Coast Guard Rear Adm. 
Richard M. Larrabee, who added the bodies were raised ``in a way 
that respected the situation they were in. It was something we were 
very sensitive to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's debris reflected the speed at which it struck the  
water, with pieces spread more than 40 yards from the main crash 
site, Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with visibility of 5 to 8 feet, divers encountered  
twisted wreckage, with wires and seats askew, ``the kind of thing 
you can imagine that would be the result of a high-impact contact 
with the water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep TV cameras away, flights were banned within five miles  
of the recovery effort led by the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship. 
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy and his sons, Patrick and Edward Jr., were 
aboard the Grasp when the bodies were recovered and accompanied the 
remains to Woods Hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' families endured a five-day vigil before the bodies  
were brought to Cape Cod on Wednesday night for autopsies. 
</P>
<P>
	After her brother's body was found, Caroline Kennedy went for a  
bicycle ride with her husband before returning to the seclusion of 
their summer home in Bridgehampton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, was piloting his single-engine plane Piper Saratoga  
from New Jersey on Friday night when it dropped from radar 16 1/2 
miles from Martha's Vineyard Airport. Also aboard were his 
33-year-old wife, Carolyn, and her sister Lauren Bessette, 34. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and his wife had planned to drop Ms. Bessette off at  
Martha's Vineyard and then fly to Hyannis Port for the wedding of 
his cousin, Rory. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight data showed the plane dropped precipitously after Kennedy  
took a right turn away from the Vineyard, and aviation experts said 
he may have been disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage, including a section of fuselage with the  
instrument panel, will be taken to the Coast Guard Air Station on 
Cape Cod for examination. It will be six to nine months before the 
accident's cause is determined, said James Hall, chairman of the 
National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the Bessette sisters issued a statement thanking  
everyone who assisted in the exhaustive search. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our children are with us in spirit each and  
every moment, and that is what helps sustain us,'' said Ann 
Freeman, their mother, and Dr. Richard Freeman, their stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
	A private Mass for Kennedy and his wife was scheduled for Friday  
morning at the Church of St. Thomas More, a Roman Catholic church 
in New York once attended by his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis. President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton were expected 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House news conference, President Clinton defended his  
decision to pour so many federal resources into the search for the 
plane. The USS Briscoe, which had been conducting training near 
Virginia, was sent to Massachusetts to pick up family members for 
the burial ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at  
fault, I am,'' said Clinton, who based his decision on the 
Kennedys' role ``in our national lives, and because of the enormous 
losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only service for Kennedy's sister-in-law is  
planned for Saturday night at Christ Church, an Episcopal church in 
Greenwich, Conn. New York's Irish community also planned a public 
ceremony tonight at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in downtown 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, the son of the 35th president, was being returned to  
waters where he enjoyed sailing, sea kayaking and even searching 
for a sunken pirate ship. His spirit of adventure led him to pursue 
a pilot's license, which he received last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember a time in my life when he wasn't there,''  
said Mary Anne Caruso, 36, a public relations executive who left a 
single red rose outside Kennedy's workplace in New York City. ``He 
represented my generation. I just feel like a part of my culture's 
gone now.''

	Kennedy, Kin To Be Buried at Sea  
</P>
<P>
	WOODS HOLE, Mass. (AP) -- The Kennedy family gathered on Cape Cod  
today for the burial at sea of John F. Kennedy Jr., whose body was 
found in the sunken fuselage of his plane near those of his wife 
and sister-in-law. The burial was to be held this morning from the 
USS Briscoe, a Navy destroyer, a government source said on 
condition of anonymity. The ashes of all three victims reportedly 
were to be scattered at sea. They were killed Friday when the plane

	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- President Lee Teng-hui said today that  
Beijing must gradually come to terms with his affirmation of 
Taiwan's statehood. Lee said his recent statement that Taiwan and 
China must deal with one another on a ``state-to-state'' basis, was 
intended to inject a ``positive and friendly meaning'' into 
dealings between the sides. But his latest remarks didn't appear to 
offer any room for concessions to China, which views Taiwan as a 
breakaway province to be reunified with the mainland, by force if 
necessary.

	BEIJING (AP) -- After three days of massive protests, China  
banned a popular meditation sect today, intensifying a crackdown on 
a group the nation's leaders view as a serious threat to their 
rule. The ban, announced by state media, accused Falun Gong of 
spreading ``superstitious, evil thinking'' to undermine social 
stability. Founded in 1992, Falun Gong, or the Wheel of Law, mixes 
slow-motion martial arts exercises with ideas borrowed from 
Buddhism and Taoism.

	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The launch of space shuttle Columbia  
with Eileen Collins, the first woman to lead a U.S. space flight, 
was scrapped for a second time this week. Thunderstorms prevented 
today's early morning blast off. NASA said it will try again early 
tomorrow. If Columbia isn't off the ground by then, the mission 
will have to be delayed until mid-August. The first launch attempt, 
on Tuesday, ended seven seconds before liftoff when a dangerous 
hydrogen buildup was detected in the engine compartment. It turned 
out to be a false alarm.

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 53.19; Nasdaq Down 64.08 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled today as Federal Reserve Chairman  
Alan Greenspan told Congress the Fed is prepared to ``act promptly 
and forcefully'' at the first hint of inflation dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 53.19 at 10,949.59. After some modest early gains, the index 
plunged as Greenspan began his remarks and at one point the Dow 
dipped more than 100 points from Wednesday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 index was down 17.00 at 1,362.29, and the Nasdaq composite 
index was off 64.08 at 2,697.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Fed raised interest rates last month in a bid to stave  
off inflation, stocks have rallied to new records, helped along by 
strong corporate earnings. Today, Greenspan was not expected to 
offer any hints of further rate increases, as recent economic 
barometers have shown virtually no signs of inflation. But he told 
Congress that while 1999 has been an exceptional year for the 
American economy, the central bank remains poised to fight any 
inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony ``left little doubt that he is nervous  
about inflation risks in the United States,'' said Michael Moran, 
chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. in New York. 
Still, Moran expects that the Fed will leave rates unchanged when 
its Open Market Committee meets Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps more threatening to markets, Greenspan said he remains  
worried about the high valuations of U.S. stocks in light of the 
continued growth of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger is that in these circumstances, an unwarranted,  
perhaps euphoric, extension of recent developments can drive equity 
prices to levels that are unsupportable,'' Greenspan said. He added 
that remarkable increases in workers' productivity have fostered 
growth in the economy and in the markets, and those increases may 
be too difficult to sustain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices plummeted, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury  
bond to 5.97 percent, up from 5.9 percent late Wednesday. That 
further pressured stocks, particularly the highly priced technology 
shares that could suffer most in higher interest-rate environments. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component Hewlett Packard fell 6 7/16 to 106 1/8, the steepest  
decliner among Dow stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony drew Wall Street's focus away from the  
continuing stream of corporate earnings. The robust earnings season 
continued, but investors held to their pattern of selling stocks 
once their strong earnings are on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	America Online fell 4 1/2 to 110 9/16 after reporting late  
Wednesday that its earnings nearly tripled in its fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com plunged 16 13/16 to 108 5/8 after surprising Wall Street  
with the prospect of steeper losses in future quarters. The online 
retailer Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss that matched 
analysts' estimates, and said it will spend heavily to expand its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 612.91 million 
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 6.24 at 641.24, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 10.54 at 796.27.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Hires Replacement Umps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Baseball, not waiting for its squabbling umpires  
to resign, hired 10 minor league umps Thursday to take their place 
later this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Making their first response to the mass resignations,  
commissioner Bud Selig and his top officials hired the Triple-A 
replacements, who had been working as vacation fill-ins. They were 
notified they were being added to major league staffs on a 
permanent basis starting Sept. 1 - the day before the resignations 
were to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The bickering umpires have split into two camps - those for and  
against union head Richie Phillips. The faction backing him is 
mostly in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	Some are having a hard time deciding whether to follow Phillips.  
For example, American League ump Greg Kosc resigned, withdrew it, 
then quit again. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, 33 of the 36 NL plan to quit, according to a count by  
The Associated Press, but only about half of the AL's 32 umpires 
plan to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires on each side have been pressuring their wavering  
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of this is all posturing, negotiating tactics,'' said AL  
ump Tim McClelland, who hasn't quit yet but says he intends to. 
``You have to take it with a grain of salt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's decision to hire new umpires wasn't expected so soon.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of their strategy, but I don't know what their  
strategy is yet,'' Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, 51 major league umpires held a conference call  
Thursday morning to discuss their position, NL umpire Bruce 
Froemming said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a lot more solidarity than there was two or  
three days ago,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there were some umpires who felt Phillips had to go.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am adamantly opposed to this kind of leadership,'' said the  
AL's Dave Phillips, who is no relation to the union head. ``There 
are times when you pull out your gun, your mortar and go 
winner-take-all. But communication and negotiation are the most 
important ingredients we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richie Phillips said he has been opposed by an AL faction that  
existed since before the 1995 lockout. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do not like me personally, do not like my style and  
believe I'm too confrontational a lawyer,'' he said. ``The media is 
providing them with a forum. Fifty-five guys say Richie Phillips is 
the greatest thing that ever happened to officiating in any sport 
and has won battle after battle after battle for us since 1978.''

<HEADLINE> Chief Justice Offends Some Lawyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chief Justice William Rehnquist led a  
sing-along of ``Dixie'' at a recent conference in Virginia, 
upsetting lawyers who view the song as a nostalgic appeal to the 
days of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
	Some black lawyers said they avoided last month's 4th Circuit  
Judicial Conference because of their distaste for ``Dixie,'' which 
was included in a song book distributed for the event and has been 
sung before. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs are mostly American standards, including ``America the  
Beautiful'' and ``Anchors Aweigh.'' The evening typically ends with 
``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' and ``Dixie,'' a Confederate 
marching song. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dixie'' is offensive to blacks, said Brent O.E. Clinkscale, a  
black attorney. ``I think it's nostalgic for slavery,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehnquist, 74, declined to comment on the controversy.  
</P>
<P>
	Defenders of ``Dixie'' say the song is a piece of Americana that  
is appropriate for a mostly Southern conference. The 4th Circuit 
event is for lawyers and judges from Maryland, Virginia, West 
Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Catholics Allow Cremation Since 1963 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cremation of a body is permitted by the Roman Catholic Church  
although burial of the body in the ground is still the preferred 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of John F. Kennedy Jr., his wife, Carolyn Bessette  
Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette were cremated and taken 
aboard a Navy destroyer to be cast into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Cremation has been an option for Roman Catholic burials only  
since 1963, when the Vatican ended a ban on condition that the 
practice not deny the Christian teaching that believers' bodies 
will be resurrected. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Rome specified that burial of bodies is still the  
preferred method. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. bishops forbid the scattering of ashes at sea, but  
permit a ``rite of committal,'' in which an urn containing the 
complete set of remains is placed into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The USS Briscoe carried family members out to sea with the  
cremated remains for a ceremony off Martha's Vineyard, about three 
miles from where the bodies were recovered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was raised a Roman Catholic; the Bessette family of  
Greenwich, Conn., has scheduled a memorial service Friday at an 
Episcopal church.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The church where the memorial Mass for John F.  
Kennedy Jr. and his wife will be celebrated became an instant 
shrine Thursday with a steady stream of visitors and a growing pile 
of notes and bouquets. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 bouquets had been left outside the front door of the  
Church of St. Thomas More by noon Thursday, along with the cover of 
the French children's classic ``The Little Prince,'' several tiny 
stuffed animals, and notes like this one: ``May you be at peace, 
reunited with your family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's heartbreaking,'' Victoria Ariza-Vogelman, who grew up in  
Colombia, said outside the church. ``As a kid, I would see pictures 
of him -- John-John growing up, going to school. I kept thinking, at 
the last minute, maybe he would wash ashore somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gothic-style church is on a quiet block of Manhattan's Upper  
East Side, a few blocks from where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis 
lived. She had worshipped at the church with her children. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was really the church where Jackie went to pray, to  
attend Mass,'' author Christopher Andersen said of the 126-year-old 
Catholic Church of St. Thomas More. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a place where she found refuge and solace and was able to  
stay out of the public eye,'' said Anderson, the author of the 
biographies ``Jackie After Jack'' (1998) and ``Jack and Jackie'' 
(1996). ``It's also the place where Caroline christened her 
children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mass was to be held at 11 a.m. Friday and President Clinton  
was expected to attend. The service will private, and Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, JFK Jr.'s uncle, will deliver a eulogy, according to a 
source close to the family. About 350 people were invited. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Charles O'Byrne was to celebrate the memorial Mass. He  
married JFK Jr. to Carolyn Bessette Kennedy in a clandestine 
ceremony off the coast of Georgia nearly three years ago and led 
Thursday's service in which their ashes were cast into the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	To have a funeral Mass in the Catholic Church, the remains of  
the deceased must be present. Kennedy, his wife, Carolyn Bessette 
Kennedy, and her sister Lauren Bessette were cremated and their 
ashes cast into sea off Cape Cod on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The three died when JFK Jr.'s private plane crashed into the  
ocean en route to a cousin's wedding at the Kennedy homestead in 
Hyannis Port, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate service for Lauren Bessette was scheduled for  
Saturday in Connecticut, where her mother and stepfather live.

	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The Reform Party holds a convention this  
weekend that could show just how powerful its biggest star and 
highest-ranking elected official, Gov. Jesse Ventura, is within the 
party. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegates will gather in Dearborn, Mich., to pick a new  
chairman. Current chairman Russell Verney, an ally of party founder 
Ross Perot, decided against seeking another two-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has endorsed Jack Gargan of Cedar Key, Fla., for  
chairman. Gargan, a 68-year-old retired financial consultant, 
founded T.H.R.O. (Throw The Hypocritical Rascals Out) and is 
considered by many as the father of the national term limits 
movement. While Perot refused an interview request, Verney said 
Perot is ``supporting whomever the delegates select.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contest will be important in determining not only the  
party's direction but also who the party endorses in the 2000 
presidential race. The party has more than $12 million in federal 
funds for its candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible contenders include Perot, conservative Republican Pat  
Buchanan, former Connecticut Gov. Lowell Weicker, independent Sen. 
Bob Smith of New Hampshire and Donald Trump. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura doesn't want Perot to be the party's presidential  
nominee again, saying his diminishing returns from the 1992 to 1996 
elections show it is time for him to step aside. Perot got 19 
percent in 1992 and 8.4 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The former professional wrestler, who has repeatedly dismissed  
the idea of running for president himself, met earlier this month 
Weicker and encouraged him to run. Ventura has said he would 
consider a vice presidential run with retired Gen. Colin Powell, 
who has said he isn't running. 
</P>
<P>
	Perot has long has been the party's most famous face. The Dallas  
billionaire began the movement with his presidential candidacy but 
hasn't said what his intentions are this year. 
</P>
<P>
	With his election last year, Ventura immediately became the  
party's biggest star. Although he gives the party no credit for his 
own election and rarely speaks with Perot, he waded into internal 
party politics with his endorsement of Gargan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the convention delegates are not willing to elect and  
support the best person for the job, I'll remain reluctant to fully 
embrace the national Reform Party,'' Ventura wrote in a letter to 
delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor -- who may skip the convention because of a bad back  
-- said he elieves his main role has been to show that a vote for a 
third party isn't wasted. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the leadership role that I'll take out there,'' Ventura  
said.

<HEADLINE> Albright Takes Alaska Fishing Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOLDOTNA, Alaska (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright  
turned an Alaskan refueling stop Thursday into a half-day 
excursion, taking a sight-seeing flight over glaciers and fjords 
and later casting for salmon in the fast-running Kenai River. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do need a lesson,'' Albright said as she tenatively tried  
her hand at fishing at a private fishing lodge in this community 
about 150 miles southwest of Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright's overnight visit came as she headed to Singapore for  
an Asian diplomatic conference to be followed by a visit to the 
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright was coaxed on by Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles, who had  
caught a 60-pound king salmon from a boat in roughly the same spot 
the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	On her first cast, Albright's line tangled with that of another  
angler. ``I need the whole river,'' she joked. 
</P>
<P>
	When she failed to land anything, her aides were  
characteristically diplomatic, contending she had been casting, not 
fishing, and that next time she would be fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	After arriving in Elmendorf Air Force Base in Anchorage and  
speaking to base personnel, Albright and her traveling party 
boarded a two-engine propeller-driven aircraft for a flight south 
to Seward, and then over the nearby Harding Icefield and the Kenai 
Fjords National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright visited a lodge owned by Bob Penney, who gave her  
pointers on fishing with a fly from his fishing deck. A local 
sporting goods store owner, Jim Golden, presented her with a 
temporary fishing license. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's legal,'' he joked. Albright thanked him.  
</P>
<P>
	Golden later said he paid $10 for the 24-hour  
out-of-state-resident license. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish she'd stay longer,'' he said. ``The fishing is good,  
but the catching is slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright stayed long enough to eat some grilled pieces from the  
salmon the governor had caught. And she apologized for her short 
visit, but noted, ``This is about as long as I'm anywhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said a key subject of the meeting in Singapore of the  
Association of Southeast Asian Nations would be tensions caused by 
wide speculation that North Korea was on the verge of launching 
another multi-stage missile, as it did last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling Korea ``perhaps the most dangerous place on earth  
today,'' Albright said, ``Our goal is to encourage the government 
of North Korea to end its isolation and choose the path of 
cooperation.''

<HEADLINE> Americans Win One Gold on First Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) -- It was the worst of beginnings for the  
U.S. team. No gold medals in five canoe-kayak races, the first 
events at the Pan American Games. 
</P>
<P>
	And then, a false start by the men's foursome in the final race  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The false start increased the tension,'' said Justin Piasecki,  
``but we were able to get off strong and settle into the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They settled so well that the first American gold came in the  
men's kayak 1,000, with a crew of Stein Jorgensen, John Mooney, 
Peter Newton and Piasecki finishing nearly three seconds ahead of 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were hoping some of our teammates would have the honor of  
being the first U.S. gold medal of the Pan Ams,'' Mooney said, 
``but it felt good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did the bronze medal behind Canada and Cuba in the women's  
kayak 500 for Kathy Colin, Tamara Jenkins, Julia Sorzano and 
Alexandra Harbold. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be competing in the first women's event of the Pan Am Games  
and to win the first medal for the U.S. was really neat,'' Colin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other canoe-kayak winners were from Argentina and Cuba. Overall,  
Argentina and Canada won two golds and Cuba had the most medals, 
five. 
</P>
<P>
	The action on Lake Minnesdosa has no bearing on the Olympics for  
the United States. But the Pan Am Games serve as a qualifier for 
the 2000 Olympics in 11 disciplines: baseball; softball; men's and 
women's field hockey; rhythmic gymnastics; men's and women's team 
handball; triathlon; men's water polo; and equestrian show jumping 
and three-day event. Badminton participants will also receive 
points toward qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the new events at these games are eight women's sports:  
women's soccer, weightlifting, shooting, pole vaulting, hammer 
throw, modern pentathlon, water polo and beach volleyball. The new 
men's event is beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's schedule is busier, with competition in canoe-kayak,  
soccer, water polo and volleyball. The American men play Cuba and 
the women face Costa Rica in soccer. In volleyball, the U.S. women 
take on favored Cuba, and in water polo, it's the American women 
again Puerto Rico and the men vs. Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	One sport in which the United States should fare well is  
gymnastics. Although the team is young -- the oldest woman is Alyssa 
Beckerman, 18 -- it should win several medals, particularly in 
women's events. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Pan Am Games over the years have been a great experience  
and opportunity for U.S. gymnastics,'' women's coach Mary Lee Tracy 
said. ``In the 1995 group in Argentina, there were many of our team 
members who were then in the Atlanta Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The official opening is Friday night, with 3,400 performers and  
three production numbers scheduled for the ceremony at Winnipeg 
Stadium. The Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and Royal Winnipeg Ballet 
will be featured in a celebration of the city as the ``Heart of the 
Continent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 5,100 athletes representing 42 nations are on hand.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 25.65; Nasdaq Down 46.95 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed in early trading today as Wall  
Street turned its focus away from corporate earnings reports and 
toward Alan Greenspan's testimony before the House Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 25.65 at 11,028.43, having reversed an early loss. But the gains 
were evaporating as highlights of Greenspan's testimony began 
circulating. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 10.93 at 1,368.36, and the Nasdaq composite index 
was off 46.95 at 2,714.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Efforts to build on Wednesday's modest gains were sapped by the  
prospect of the Federal Reserve chairman's testimony. Since the Fed 
raised interest rates last month in a bid to stave off inflation, 
stocks have rallied to new records, helped along by strong 
corporate earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Greenspan was not expected to offer any hints of further  
rate increases, as recent economic barometers have shown virtually 
no signs of inflation. According to advance copies of his remarks, 
Greenspan was poised to tell Congress that while 1999 has been an 
exceptional year for the American economy, the central bank will 
``act promptly and forcefully'' at the first hint of inflation 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said they were reluctant to take major new positions  
until Greenspan completed his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, investors continued their pattern of selling stocks  
once their strong earnings are on the table. America Online fell 2 1/2 
to 112 9/16 after reporting late Wednesday that its earnings nearly 
tripled in its fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com plunged 13 13/16 to 111 5/8 after surprising Wall Street  
with the prospect of steeper losses in future quarters. The online 
retailer Wednesday reported a second-quarter loss that matched 
analysts' estimates, and said it will spend heavily to expand its 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 222.02 million 
shares, below Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 0.62 at 646.86, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 5.60 at 801.21.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Launches Messaging Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. today launched a free  
service that is compatible with America Online's Instant Messenger 
and will allow Internet users to exchange messages without having 
to go through e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN Messenger Service will work through the  
Microsoft Network site, allowing message exchanges with the 40 
million users of MSN Hotmail. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have all these walled-off communities today where AOL  
users can talk to AOL users, Yahoo! users to Yahoo! users, but 
nobody has really bridged the gap,'' said Rob Bennett of 
Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce Group. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL released a new version of its Instant Messenger a week ago.  
It says registrations for the service have more than doubled in the 
last six months to more than 25 million users, making it the 
largest such service. 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett said Microsoft's program was written to work with  
Instant Messenger because MSN customers wanted to connect with the 
large number of AOL users, and because Microsoft hopes AOL 
customers will be drawn to the MSN site and its offerings.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Angers AOL With Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Microsoft Corp.'s new instant messaging software  
released Thursday kicked off a skirmish between two of the 
Internet's most powerful companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's MSN Messenger Service will work through the  
Microsoft Network site, allowing message exchanges with the 40 
million users of MSN Hotmail. 
</P>
<P>
	Messengers allow Internet users to instantly exchange messages  
with others on the Web, without having to go through e-mail. While 
common enough on the Web, few messenger programs are compatible 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
	However, one key element of Microsoft's new service is that it  
allows people to send messages to users of America Online Inc.'s 
popular AOL Instant Messenger system, a feature that won kudos from 
analysts but cries of anger from AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have all these walled-off communities today where AOL  
users can talk to AOL users, Yahoo! users to Yahoo! users, but 
nobody has really bridged the gap,'' said Rob Bennett of 
Microsoft's Consumer and Commerce Group. 
</P>
<P>
	But an AOL spokeswoman argued that MSN Messenger wasn't really  
compatible with AOL Instant Messenger, or AIM, because it requires 
that a user have both programs. 
</P>
<P>
	AIM users won't be notified when MSN Messenger users go online --  
as they are in the AOL system -- nor will they be able to save 
Messenger users to their ``buddy'' lists, unless they sign up for 
MSN Messenger, pointed out spokeswoman Ann Brackbill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dulles, Va.-based company is also upset that Microsoft  
requires AOL users to enter their AIM password in order to allow 
MSN Messenger to communicate with AIM users, she added. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises significant and serious privacy and security  
issues,'' Brackbill said. ``Its unauthorized access to the AOL 
namespace is akin to hacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's announcement Thursday was seen by analysts as a key  
step in the ever-escalating battle among Internet companies to 
obtain Web traffic to help them sell advertisments. 
</P>
<P>
	By designing its messaging service to work with AOL's system,  
Microsoft Network will position itself to draw more users to its 
Web site and keep them there longer, said Emily Meehan, an analyst 
with The Yankee Group research firm, based in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Deanna Sanford, MSN lead product manager, said Messenger was  
just one of the services MSN wanted to offer its users and wasn't 
directed towards competing with AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that overall we have been competing with AOL in terms  
of the online space and online services and portals. But this is 
part of our online communication strategy for MSN,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just part of our continuing efforts to provide  
consumers with a place they can go to get information no matter 
where they are.''

<HEADLINE> United States 115, Puerto Rico 76 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The United States stunned the crowd  
in the first few seconds and silenced it in the second half, 
playing its best all-around game of the Olympic qualifying 
tournament in a 115-76 victory Thursday night over Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States finished the second round undefeated (8-0) and  
clinched the No. 1 seed in the semifinals, which will be played 
Saturday with two berths in the 2000 Olympics at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina is the likely opponent for the United States, although  
that matchup was contingent on Canada beating Venezuela in 
Thursday's late game. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Smith scored 19 points, Gary Payton and Tim Hardaway 17  
each, Tim Duncan 16, Vin Baker 12, Kevin Garnett 11 and Allan 
Houston 10. Duncan also had nine rebounds and four blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite playing their eighth game in eight nights, the Americans  
came out focused and full of energy as a sellout crowd of 12,345 
was still settling into its seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Duncan, it took the Americans only 90 seconds to score  
the game's first 10 points. Duncan dunked just 4 seconds into the 
game and added another dunk with 18:30 left off a steal by Payton 
as the Americans opened with a full-court trap. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 25-16 before coach Larry Brown made his first  
substitutions with 12:40 left, and 34-20 before Puerto Rico made 
its only run of the night. 
</P>
<P>
	Orlando Vega had two 3-pointers and a layup in a 10-2 spurt that  
pulled the Puerto Ricans within 36-30, eliciting a deafening roar 
from a home crowd that came equipped with horns, drums, trombones, 
flags and even a anti-American political banner or two. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico then went more than 4 1/2 minutes before its next field  
goal, and the United States used a 13-3 run to go ahead by 16 
points en route to a 53-35 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan had 14 points, 11 rebounds and two blocks in the first  
half. 
</P>
<P>
	Puerto Rico pulled within 14 points on a 3-pointer by Carmelo  
Travieso with 16:02 left before the Americans ended all doubt with 
an 18-0 run including seven points by Payton, five by Hardaway and 
four by Garnett to make it 81-49. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker got the United States to 100 points on a foul shot with  
4:25 left, and the Americans finished just short of their 
tournament-high 118 in the opener against Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
	In earlier games, Argentina defeated Brazil 79-77 to clinch a  
spot in the semifinals, and the Dominican Republic defeated Uruguay 
78-71.

</P>
<P>
 *Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, up 3 3/8 at 46 5/16    	
</P>
<P>
	The British chemical company unveiled better-than-expected  
first-half profit. ICI said consumer spending in key markets was 
improving, and the core businesses of specialty chemicals and 
paints provided strong growth. 

</P>
<P>
 *Kimberly-Clark Corp., up 4 13/16 at 61 13/16    	
</P>
<P>
	The maker of Kleenex, Huggies and Kotex said Wednesday its  
second-quarter earnings from operations rose 38 percent. 

</P>
<P>
 *Nokia Corp., down 8 1/4 at 86 3/8    	
</P>
<P>
	The Finnish telecommunications group saw first-half profits soar  
55 percent, fueled by demand for mobile phones. But investors 
seized on the fact that Nokia's growth rate for phone sales, 58 
percent in the second quarter, missed estimates. 

</P>
<P>
 *Royal Philips Electronics NV, down 8 3/4 at 94 7/8    	
</P>
<P>
	The consumer electronics company released disappointing  
second-quarter results. Philips said European sales growth came to 
a standstill in the quarter, and sales in Eastern Europe fell 30 
percent. 

</P>
<P>
 *CommScope Inc., up 4 7/16 at 34 3/8    	
</P>
<P>
	CommScope, which makes coaxial cable for local area networks,  
earned 33 cents in the second quarter. Profits were on par with 
analysts' expectations, but well above the 17 cents per share 
earned in last year's second quarter. 

</P>
<P>
                              *NASDAQ   	

</P>
<P>
 *Compuware Corp., down 6 7/8 at 26 3/4    	
</P>
<P>
	Despite beating analysts' expectations by 3 cents per share in  
its fiscal first quarter, Compuware had disappointing software 
sales. Several analysts downgraded the stock, citing concerns about 
revenue growth. 

</P>
<P>
 *SpeedFam-IPEC Inc., down 4 13/16 at 10 5/16    	
</P>
<P>
	Banc of America downgraded SpeedFam stock after the company  
widened its losses in the recently ended quarter. The company also 
revealed its book-to-bill ratio, a measure of growth in the 
semiconductor industry, is below the standard. 

</P>
<P>
 *i2 Technologies, down 10 11/32 at 32 1/8    	
</P>
<P>
	The software maker met analysts' expectations for second-quarter  
sales and earnings, but Wall Street traders had hoped to see 
higher-than-expected licensing revenue. 

</P>
<P>
                               *AMEX    	

</P>
<P>
 *Moore Medical Corp., down 1 at 11 3/4    	
</P>
<P>
	Moore, a health-care products distributor, said sales and  
earnings declined for the first half of 1999 due in part to a 
software conversion in the second quarter. Also, last year's 
results were aided by the company's exit from wholesale drug 
distribution.

<HEADLINE> Opposition: 70 Arrested in Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINSK, Belarus (AP) -- Using clubs and tear gas, police broke up  
a street demonstration and arrested more than 50 people protesting 
against authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, opposition 
groups said today. 
</P>
<P>
	About 5,000 people carrying posters and singing songs gathered  
in the center of the capital, Minsk, on Wednesday to demand an end 
to what they called Lukashenko's illegitimate rule. 
</P>
<P>
	When the crowd assembled near Lukashenko's residence, police  
warned that the meeting had not been officially sanctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Police then used clubs and tear gas to break up the gathering,  
arresting 50 to 70 protesters, said Vladimir Yukho, a spokesman for 
the Belarusian Popular Front, the main opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
	Those arrested were expected to go on trial behind closed doors  
beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Belarus' Interior Ministry refused to comment on Wednesday's  
arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukashenko consistently has cracked down on opponents during his  
5-year term, which was to expire on July 20. But he introduced 
constitutional amendments in 1996 that extended his tenure to 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Belarusian opposition groups and international observers have  
never recognized the constitutional changes, approved in a 
referendum, because they said the changes were marred by fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	They have recommended Lukashenko hold new elections to clear up  
the debate, but Lukashenko insisted elections would be held no 
sooner than 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukashenko used the 1996 referendum to disband the  
opposition-led parliament and create a new one made up of his 
loyalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members of the old parliament held an underground session  
Wednesday to declare Lukashenko's term over and make Semyon 
Sharetsky, the speaker of the dissolved parliament, the acting head 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukashenko today lashed out at his foes on state television and  
scolded the media for covering the opposition rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``A harvester must be the main hero for the mass media,''  
Lukashenko said. ``But they show those unhinged people loitering 
around Minsk streets, and 600 out of this crowd of 1,000-strong are 
plainclothes policeman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lukashenko, who is openly nostalgic for the Soviet Union, has  
drawn strong criticism from international human rights groups and 
western governments. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in Minsk on Wednesday released a statement by  
State Department spokesman James Rubin, who said that the end of 
Lukashenko's legal term left Belarus at a ``constitutional 
impasse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Lukashenko's legitimacy as an elected representative of the  
Belarusian people can only be restored by free and fair democratic 
elections,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Market Data Bill Approved, Debated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee unanimously approved  
Wednesday legislation designed to protect market databases from 
hackers and pirates without giving the stock exchanges new 
ownership rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has pitted the stock exchanges against online  
brokerage firms such as Charles Schwab and Ameritrade, raising the 
question of who owns real-time stock quotes: the millions of 
Internet investors who ``create'' them by trading or the exchanges? 
</P>
<P>
	The House Commerce subcommittee on finance adopted the  
bipartisan bill, sending it to the full Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Proponents of the bill maintain that giving the stock exchanges  
an ownership right to the stock data would be akin to Major League 
Baseball getting a property right to Ted Williams' batting average 
in a given season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission, which oversees the  
financial markets, supports the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	A competing bill, authored by Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., would  
give the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Stock Market and other 
exchanges more control over the databases. 
</P>
<P>
	The brokerage firms pay fees to the nation's stock exchanges for  
the market data, charges which totaled an estimated $414 million 
last year. The NYSE, for example, charges the firms a penny every 
time they tap into a real-time stock quote. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE officials have said the nation's largest stock exchange  
needs the money it gets from selling data to run its operations and 
detect and prevent fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	But Charles Schwab and Co., which calls itself the biggest  
online brokerage in the world, maintains the public is the true 
owner of market data and it should be fairly priced. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange has proposed reducing the fee to 0.75 cent, but the  
brokerages such as Schwab maintain that a one-time fee would make 
more sense than charging for each use. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, if the exchanges were given property rights over  
the data, they might have the legal right to take action against 
companies that used the data in a way they did not approve or they 
believed hurt them competitively. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwab argues this could have a chilling effect on innovative  
uses of the market data by parties other than the exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	The fees charged by the exchanges for the data unfairly  
discriminate against online brokerage firms as opposed to 
full-service traditional brokers, and are a ``hidden cost'' passed 
on to investors, according to Schwab.

<HEADLINE> Advertising Exec Ogilvy Dies at 88 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- David Ogilvy altered advertising by adhering to  
a credo he repeated often. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer isn't a moron; she is your wife,'' he once wrote.  
``She wants all the information you can give her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ogilvy, the master ad man who put the eye-patched Man in the  
Hathaway Shirt and created the distinguished Commander Whitehead to 
pitch ``Schweppervescent'' mixers, died Wednesday at his home in 
Bonnes, France. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	His death was announced in New York by Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, the  
mega-agency he started in 1948 with two staffers and no clients. He 
had suffered a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
	While his advertising ideas have become American icons, Ogilvy's  
greatest legacy was an approach to his business that regarded the 
consumer as an intelligent buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogilvy was not necessarily an obvious candidate for success.  
Born in West Horsley, England, he flunked out of Oxford. He went to 
work in the kitchen of a Paris hotel, then returned to Britain and 
was hired as a door-to-door salesman for Aga Cookers. 
</P>
<P>
	He emigrated to the United States in 1938 and went to work at  
George Gallup's Audience Research Institute; during the war, he 
served as second secretary at the British Embassy in Washington. 
Later, he worked as a farmer in Pennsylvania's Lancaster County, 
amid the Amish. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 37 years old when he started his agency. Success was  
swift. Over the years, his clients included General Foods, Lever 
Brothers, Shell, Sears, and American Express. 
</P>
<P>
	Commander Whitehead, the tweed-wearing Brit with the Van Dyke  
beard, was born in 1953 and dubbed the ``Ambassador from 
Schweppes'' Ogilvy played off the character's snob appeal to sell 
the upscale brand of tonic water and club soda. 
</P>
<P>
	The mustachioed and eye-patched model for Hathaway shirts,  
created in the same year, intrigued magazine readers because of the 
mystery of how he sustained the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not a razzmatazz guy,'' said John Bergin, an old  
colleague in advertising, now retired from the McCann Erickson 
agency. ``He couldn't abide ads that didn't say, `This is why you 
should buy this product.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bergin recalled that Ogilvy even hated music and jingles in ads.  
Once, when Ogilvy was abroad, his agency sold a campaign that 
featured a tune -- the classic ``pucka-pucka-PUCK-PUCK'' of Maxwell 
House coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogilvy was not chastened by the ad's success. ``If I'd known  
they were doing it, I would have stopped it,'' he told Bergin. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogilvy retired as chairman in 1973, and moved to France. He  
continued to watch over the agency, however; the volume of his 
correspondence forced an upgrade of the local post office. 
</P>
<P>
	Charlotte Beers, former chairwoman of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, sought  
Ogilvy's blessing by visiting him in France after being selected to 
head the agency in 1992. She said she regularly got memos from him 
over the next five years about the business and the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had this fantastic laugh and incredible wit, and was  
completely blunt,'' she said. Ogilvy &AMP; Mather -- now consisting of 
359 offices in 100 countries -- was sold in 1989 to WPP, a British 
holding company, for $864 million. At the request of WPP's chief 
executive, Ogilvy then served as the holding company's 
non-executive chairman for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ogilvy is survived by his third wife, Herta, and by a son,  
David, a real estate executive in Greenwich, Conn. A private burial 
is to be held Friday at the family estate Bonnes, with a memorial 
service to follow in New York this fall.

<HEADLINE> Leaf Engaged to Former Cheerleader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Wedding bells are around the corner for  
Ryan Leaf, the San Diego Chargers quarterback trying to rebound 
from a troubled rookie season. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf is engaged to marry Niki Lucia, a 23-year-old San Diego  
fashion consultant and former Chargers cheerleader, Leaf's agent, 
Leigh Steinberg, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they both are very happy, and he sounds excited,''  
Steinberg said from his Newport Beach, Calif., office. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple tentatively plan to wed next July.  
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, a 23-year-old Great Falls, Mont., native who played at  
Washington State, popped the question last Saturday over dinner at 
a resort on northern Idaho's Lake Coeur d'Alene, about 80 miles 
north of his alma mater in Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf and the Chargers begin training camp Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	Leaf, who received an $11.25 million signing bonus after being  
chosen second in the 1998 NFL draft, was benched after nine starts 
last year. Leaf threw just two touchdown passes while throwing 15 
interceptions and losing four fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers (5-11) ranked 24th in the NFL in offense last  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf has been replaced as starter by veteran Jim Harbaugh.  
</P>
<P>
	Off-the-field troubles, including an obscenity-laced locker room  
tirade at a reporter and reports of bad behavior while bar-hopping 
during a visit to Pullman, contributed to his benching last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Leaf drew public criticism from Chargers general  
manager Bobby Beathard and at least one teammate for skipping the 
first three days of a voluntary summer workout session. Leaf had 
been honoring charity commitments, some of which involved golf 
tournaments.

<HEADLINE> McDonald's Profits Jump 45 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- McDonald's Corp. reported Thursday its  
second-quarter profits jumped 45 percent amid strong sales overseas 
and heavy promotional activity domestically. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's biggest fast-food company reported net income rose  
to $518 million, or 37 cents a share, from $357.2 million, or 25 
cents a share, in the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The year-ago results include a charge of $110 million to cut  
staff and expenses at the company's headquarters. The share figures 
reflect a stock split in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched Wall Street expectations, according to a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. McDonald's shares closed 
down 75 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $42.25 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Systemwide sales, which include franchised as well as  
company-owned restaurants, rose 7 percent to $9.9 billion from 
$9.25 billion, while revenues also rose 7 percent to $3.4 billion 
from $3.18 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oak Brook, Ill.-based company does not release figures  
detailing sales from stores open at least a year, an industrywide 
measure of performance. But McDonald's reported domestic revenues 
rose 5 percent on ``positive'' same-store sales that came after 
three successful Happy Meal promotions -- Furby, Tarzan and Teenie 
Beanie Babies -- drove families into stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain also saw a boost in breakfast sales from its  
introduction of breakfast bagel sandwiches and its North American 
made-to-order cooking system -- which is two-thirds completed -- 
resulted in less wasted food. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, sales saw a 15 percent gain in Latin America, a 13  
percent increase in Europe and an 8 percent increase in Asia. The 
results illustrated the continued room for expansion overseas, 
while reflecting a near saturation of fast-food business 
domestically that has slowed sales growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``While difficult economic conditions continue in some of our  
major markets, we are cautiously optimistic that we have weathered 
the worst of the economic challenges,'' said James Cantalupo, chief 
executive of McDonald's international business. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first six months of the year, net income rose 11 percent  
to $920.8 million, or 65 cents a share, from $719.4 million, or 51 
cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $18.7 billion from 
$17.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's operates or franchises nearly 25,000 restaurants  
around the globe. The company is opening 1,750 restaurants this 
year.

<HEADLINE> NFL Warns Canadian Sports Bars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL issued a warning Thursday to Canadian  
sports bars and restaurants, saying it would prosecute those 
illegally showing pro football games. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning came just days after the Federal Court awarded the  
league about $293,000 in damages from three southwestern Ontario 
establishments that illegally showed Buffalo Bills football games. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages weren't the first that the NFL has won from Canadian  
sports bars and restaurants. It has pursued dozens of similar 
lawsuits over the past four years, and has won every case. 
</P>
<P>
	The size of the award in the latest case sends a powerful  
message, league spokesman Brian McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very significant,'' McCarthy said. The ruling and fine  
``serves warning to other potential violators that both the NFL and 
the law is on the side of those who play by the rules when it comes 
to telecasting NFL games.''

<HEADLINE> Officials Want New Forfeiture Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House bill that would restrict the  
government's power to confiscate private property would undermine 
law enforcement's ability to fight crime, top law enforcement 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Justice Department, the Drug Enforcement  
Administration and the U.S. Customs Service told a Senate 
subcommittee they supported a more modest plan proposed by the 
Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department supports tightening the rules the federal  
government must follow to seize cars, cash, homes or other property 
linked to crime, Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder told senators 
Wednesday. But a bill the House passed 375-48 last month ``crosses 
the line between providing due process and giving unintended relief 
to drug dealers, money launderers and other criminals who victimize 
the elderly and the vulnerable in our society,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is legislation pending before the Congress which will,  
quite simply, undercut the ability of law enforcement to forfeit 
illegally gained property or property used to facilitate a crime, 
from drug dealers, terrorists, alien smugglers and other 
criminals,'' said Richard Fiano, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration's chief of operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the bill's author and chairman of the  
House Judiciary Committee, defended it as an effort to rid the 
legal system of a practice too vulnerable to abuse. The law 
shouldn't allow police to seize property simply because they 
suspect it was involved in wrongdoing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Too many innocent people have been deprived of their cash or  
possessions without due process, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some issues that really get to you, and this is  
one,'' he said. ``I think if you're a drug dealer and you're guilty 
-- not just accused, but you're guilty -- that you ought to lose your 
house, your car and your shoes and socks. But when you're not 
guilty, ... I don't want my country confiscating property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have used civil asset forfeiture to seize homes to shut  
down drug operations quickly even before charges are filed. 
Investigators also have seized boats, cash and other assets from 
suspected drug dealers in hopes of driving them out of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde faced skepticism from several subcommittee members. There  
should be a way to strike a better balance between the rights of 
property owners and the needs of law enforcement, Sen. Jeff 
Sessions, R-Ala., said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forfeiture is about the government using its powers to take  
private property, and there must be adequate restrictions to 
prevent abuse of this power,'' said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. But 
the bill passed by the House ``may undermine the use of forfeiture 
law in the war against drugs, child pornography, money laundering, 
telemarketing fraud, terrorism and a host of other crimes,'' 
Thurmond said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde criticized the Clinton administration's alternative plan,  
saying it would increase the government's power to seize property, 
not curb it. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Hyde bill, the federal government would have to prove  
with ``clear and convincing'' evidence that the property was 
eligible for forfeiture if an owner files a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plan recommends a lower standard of proof,  
a ``preponderance'' of the evidence, which is standard in civil 
cases. Current law requires property owners to prove they are not 
connected with the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also believes Hyde's bill would require the  
release of cash, vehicles and other property to owners 
demonstrating a ``hardship,'' pending a trial even when there is 
compelling evidence that the property was used in a crime. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Sprint Profits Up 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp. reported a 7 percent  
increase in its second-quarter earnings, a result of growth in its 
core long-distance and local telephone business and reduced costs 
per customer in its wireless group. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's FON group, consisting of the core businesses and  
certain other ventures, made a profit of $386 million, or 44 cents 
per share, in the period that ended June 30, the company reported 
today. Those results compared to $364 million, or 41 cents per 
share, in the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the FON group rose to $4.24 billion from $3.95  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS Group, whose results are reported separately, lost  
$555 million, or $1.25 per share, compared to a loss of $153 
million or 98 cents in the same quarter of 1998. The results 
reflect expenditures of $450 million as the company continued to 
build and expand the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS ended the quarter with a total of nearly 4 million  
customers, with 617,000 new customers added in the second quarter. 
Average monthly revenue per user was slightly more than $54 in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint completed the restructuring of Sprint PCS in November  
1998, buying the remaining interests of former partners 
Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Within its core operations, the nation's third-largest long  
distance company said earnings per share rose 14 percent to 56 
cents from 48 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance calling volume rose 24 percent from the second  
quarter of 1998, contributing to a 24 percent increase in operating 
earnings to $400 million from $322 million a year ago. Revenues 
totaled $2.67 billion, up 10 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In its local telephone business, Sprint reported a 4 percent  
rise in operating income, to $375 million from $360 million. Access 
lines rose 5.3 percent from the previous year, ending the quarter 
with a total of nearly 7.9 million access lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for second local phone lines to support Internet access  
as well as strong demand for local access lines in Nevada, Florida 
and the Carolinas boosted the local telephone division's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint credited two of its residential calling plans -- Sprint  
Sense AnyTime and Sprint 1000 -- for the growth in residential 
long-distance customer minutes. RadioShack was a strong outlet for 
sales of the services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sprint PCS continues to lead the wireless industry with record  
subscriber growth for three consecutive quarters,'' said William T. 
Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, Sprint FON Group earned $792  
million, or 90 cents per share, compared to $716 million, or 81 
cents per share, in 1998. Revenues rose 7 percent to $8.42 billion 
from $7.84 billion a year earlier. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> No Contest Plea in Actress Gun Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ``Happy Days'' actress Roz Kelly has pleaded  
no contest to charges she fired a gun at a neighbor's home because 
she was angry about a car alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly, 56, who played Fonzie's biker girlfriend, Pinky  
Tuscadero, on the sitcom, entered her plea Thursday. In exchange, 
the Los Angeles County district attorney's office planned to drop 
charges that Kelly fired into two cars during last November's 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelly was scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 20. The actress will  
undergo a 90-day evaluation to determine whether she should be

<HEADLINE> New Cleveland Browns Open Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Tim Couch pulled off his orange helmet, shed  
his No. 2 practice jersey and shoulder pads and walked over to some 
of the fans who arrived at 7 a.m. to see the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, how's it going?'' Couch asked.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, Cleveland is feeling much better, thank you.  
</P>
<P>
	After three lonely years without the NFL, Browns fans welcomed  
their beloved team Thursday at the expansion club's first summer 
training camp practice since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,300 days had passed since Cleveland had real-live  
NFL players to cheer. And about 200 die-hard fans braved sweltering 
heat to show how happy they were. 
</P>
<P>
	When Couch, Cleveland's future franchise quarterback, walked on  
the field alongside expected starter Ty Detmer, fans carried on as 
if this were a fall Sunday afternoon in the Dawg Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was amazing,'' Couch said after the two-hour morning  
workout. ``These fans are something special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it figures to be special in Cleveland this season for the  
rebirth of one of the NFL's storied franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything the Browns do, from their first workout until their  
final game of the 1999 season, will be important. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the reason we came today,'' said Dale Galbraith, who  
along with buddy Steve Heyman, drove six hours overnight from 
Indianapolis to see the workout. ``We had to be here. But it still 
doesn't feel like we're watching the Browns. I guess it really 
hasn't sunk in yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browns coach Chris Palmer had 34 players -- mostly rookies -- on  
the field Thursday. The veterans are expected Saturday and the full 
squad of 87 players will have its first workout Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie safety Marquis Smith was one of just four defensive backs  
who had to be on the field for every snap as the team went through 
7-on-7 passing drills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hot,'' said Smith, sweat pouring off his head 20  
minutes after practice. ``I was dying out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once Palmer gets his full roster on the field, he'll have just  
two weeks until the exhibition opener against Dallas on Aug. 9 in 
the Hall of Fame game. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, an NFL head coach for the first time, was pleased with  
Thursday's workout. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could see there weren't a lot of blown assignments,'' he  
said. ``We're making steps in the right direction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer likes the progress made by Couch, whom the Browns  
selected with the No. 1 overall pick in the April draft and signed 
to a seven-year, $59.4 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Couch struggled during minicamps, trying to adjust to the  
dizzying speed of the pro game and the various defensive coverages. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows the playbook and now he has to go out and execute the  
plays,'' Palmer said. ``Sometimes it takes four or five times to 
understand the plays and once they do that, they can go out and 
execute.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his time off, Couch returned home to Hyden, Ky., spending  
weeks learning the thick playbook and working out with Browns tight 
end Ryan Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt really comfortable today,'' Couch said. ``It's just a  
matter of getting a lot reps and just learning as I go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns want Detmer to quicken their young quarterback's  
development. But Detmer knows it won't be long before he's the one 
on the sideline watching. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows Tim is the guy for the future,'' said Detmer,  
a nine-year veteran. ``I don't have any pressure on me right now. 
I'm supposed to be a backup. I go out and play, do the best I can 
and just have fun and enjoy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans are doing the same. Their passion helped convince the  
NFL to return football to Cleveland. Now they're breaking out their 
old Browns gear to root for their new team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, it was a long, long three years,'' Galbraith said. ``I  
didn't even watch football for the first two. But now we're back.''

<HEADLINE>  Kennedy Ashes Committed To Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- In a farewell at sea, family members  
aboard a Navy destroyer committed the ashes of John F. Kennedy Jr., 
his wife and sister-in-law into the water today, at a site not far 
from where they died. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of about 15 family members carried the cremated remains  
of Kennedy, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren Bessette onto the 
USS Briscoe. Their ashes were committed to the sea off Martha's 
Vineyard, a source close to the family said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims' families had endured a five-day vigil before the  
bodies were brought to Cape Cod on Wednesday night for autopsies. 
The medical examiner determined all three died instantly of 
multiple traumatic injuries resulting from the plane crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Briscoe spent about half an hour nearly motionless off the  
Vineyard's southwest coast, two or three miles from the crash site. 
Mourners could be seen moving down to the stern, where a flag was 
lowered to half-mast as the group was seated, flanked by sailors in 
dress whites. 
</P>
<P>
	After a short time, during which at least two people appeared to  
rise and speak, passengers returned to the upper deck and the flag 
was taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	The Briscoe turned around and headed back to the Woods Hole port  
on Cape Cod. 
</P>
<P>
	On the road leading into the port this afternoon, 400 to 500  
people gathered in an apparent show of sympathy. ``Our prayers are 
with you,'' one sign said. 
</P>
<P>
	Around 9 a.m. today, family members dressed in dark clothing had  
boarded the Coast Guard cutter Sanibel, which took them to the 
Briscoe, in Woods Hole. The mourners included Kennedy's sister, 
Caroline Kennedy; his uncle, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy; and cousins 
Maria Shriver and William Kennedy Smith, 
</P>
<P>
	The Bessette sisters' relatives also were attending, including  
their mother, Ann Freeman, stepfather, Dr. Richard Freeman, and Ms. 
Bessette's twin sister, Lisa Ann Bessette, a family source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three folded American flags and three wreaths with red, yellow  
and white flowers had been placed on the ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen approved a request by the  
senator and the Bessette and Freeman families for Navy assistance 
for the ceremony, the Pentagon said this morning. Two Navy 
chaplains and a civilian priest -- all Roman Catholics -- were to 
officiate at the ceremony, the Navy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy divers recovered the three bodies in murky waters off  
Martha's Vineyard, 116 feet below the surface and 7 1/2 miles from 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we were able to bring closure to two families and that I  
think we realize is very important,'' said Coast Guard Rear Adm. 
Richard M. Larrabee, who added the bodies were raised ``in a way 
that respected the situation they were in. It was something we were 
very sensitive to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plane's debris reflected the speed at which it struck the  
water, with pieces spread more than 40 yards from the main crash 
site, Larrabee said. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with visibility of 5 to 8 feet, divers encountered  
twisted wreckage, with wires and seats askew, ``the kind of thing 
you can imagine that would be the result of a high-impact contact 
with the water,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	To keep TV cameras away, flights were banned within five miles  
of the recovery effort led by the USS Grasp, a Navy salvage ship. 
Sen. Kennedy and his sons, Patrick and Edward Jr., were aboard the 
Grasp when the bodies were recovered and accompanied the remains to 
Woods Hole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cape Cod Times reported today the Kennedy family had asked  
that no photographs be taken during Kennedy's autopsy because they 
could end up in tabloids or on the Internet. Such photographs are 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Cape &AMP; Islands First Assistant District Attorney Michael O'Keefe  
would not deny the published report or say whether the alleged 
request was honored. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wishes of the family were appropriately expressed,'' he  
said. ``Where it was possible, they were followed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, 38, was piloting his single-engine Piper Saratoga from  
New Jersey on Friday night when it dropped from radar 16 1/2 miles 
from Martha's Vineyard Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy and his 33-year-old wife had planned to drop Ms.  
Bessette, 34, off at Martha's Vineyard and then fly to Hyannis Port 
for the wedding of his cousin, Rory. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight data showed the plane dropped precipitously after Kennedy  
took a right turn away from the Vineyard, and aviation experts said 
he may have been disoriented. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage, including a section of fuselage with the  
instrument panel, will be taken to the Coast Guard Air Station on 
Cape Cod for examination. It will be six to nine months before the 
accident's cause is determined, said James Hall, chairman of the 
National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The family of the Bessette sisters issued a statement thanking  
everyone who assisted in the exhaustive search. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that our children are with us in spirit each and  
every moment, and that is what helps sustain us,'' the Freemans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A private Mass for Kennedy and his wife was scheduled for Friday  
morning at the Church of St. Thomas More, a Roman Catholic church 
in New York once attended by his mother, Jacqueline Kennedy 
Onassis. President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton were expected 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	At a White House news conference, Clinton defended his decision  
to pour so many federal resources into the search for the plane. 
The Briscoe had been conducting training near Virginia when it was 
sent to Massachusetts to pick up family members for the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anyone believes that was wrong, the Coast Guard is not at  
fault, I am,'' said Clinton, who based his decision on the 
Kennedys' role ``in our national lives, and because of the enormous 
losses that they have sustained in our lifetimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation-only service for Kennedy's sister-in-law is  
planned for Saturday night at Christ Church, an Episcopal church in 
Greenwich, Conn. New York's Irish community also planned a public 
ceremony tonight at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in downtown 
Manhattan, and the Pentagon planned an observance Friday aboard the 
aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy, the son of the 35th president, was being returned to  
waters where he enjoyed sailing, sea kayaking and even searching 
for a sunken pirate ship. His spirit of adventure led him to pursue 
a pilot's license, which he received last year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Gay Head Beach, overlooking the spot where the wreckage was  
found, residents erected a 4-foot high cross made of beach 
driftwood and lashed together with wild island grape vines. The 
names John-John, Carolyn and Lauren were etched into each arm of 
the cross. 
</P>
<P>
	West Tisbury resident Heather Rynd, who helped make the cross,  
said the monument was a symbol of loss and love for the Kennedy 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``JFK Jr. stands for something I carry in my heart politically,  
emotionally and spiritually,'' she said. ``I feel now that the 
spirit of him -- and the three of them -- will be here forever.''

<HEADLINE> Sprint Profits Up 7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Sprint Corp. reported a 7 percent  
increase in its second-quarter earnings, a result of growth in its 
core long-distance and local telephone business and reduced costs 
per customer in its wireless group. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint's FON group, consisting of the core businesses and  
certain other ventures, made a profit of $386 million, or 44 cents 
per share, in the period that ended June 30, the company reported 
today. Those results compared to $364 million, or 41 cents per 
share, in the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues in the FON group rose to $4.24 billion from $3.95  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS Group, whose results are reported separately, lost  
$555 million, or $1.25 per share, compared to a loss of $153 
million or 98 cents in the same quarter of 1998. The results 
reflect expenditures of $450 million as the company continued to 
build and expand the network. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS ended the quarter with a total of nearly 4 million  
customers, with 617,000 new customers added in the second quarter. 
Average monthly revenue per user was slightly more than $54 in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint completed the restructuring of Sprint PCS in November  
1998, buying the remaining interests of former partners 
Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Within its core operations, the nation's third-largest long  
distance company said earnings per share rose 14 percent to 56 
cents from 48 cents a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-distance calling volume rose 24 percent from the second  
quarter of 1998, contributing to a 24 percent increase in operating 
earnings to $400 million from $322 million a year ago. Revenues 
totaled $2.67 billion, up 10 percent from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In its local telephone business, Sprint reported a 4 percent  
rise in operating income, to $375 million from $360 million. Access 
lines rose 5.3 percent from the previous year, ending the quarter 
with a total of nearly 7.9 million access lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for second local phone lines to support Internet access  
as well as strong demand for local access lines in Nevada, Florida 
and the Carolinas boosted the local telephone division's 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint credited two of its residential calling plans -- Sprint  
Sense AnyTime and Sprint 1000 -- for the growth in residential 
long-distance customer minutes. RadioShack was a strong outlet for 
sales of the services. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sprint PCS continues to lead the wireless industry with record  
subscriber growth for three consecutive quarters,'' said William T. 
Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	For the six months ended June 30, Sprint FON Group earned $792  
million, or 90 cents per share, compared to $716 million, or 81 
cents per share, in 1998. Revenues rose 7 percent to $8.42 billion 
from $7.84 billion a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprint PCS Group in the first six months lost $1.18 billion, or  
$2.70 per share, compared to $812 million, or $1.95 cents per 
share, in the first half of 1998. Revenues increased to $1.34 
billion from $468 million in the same period a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Debate in Holocaust Insurance Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A commission administering Holocaust-era  
insurance claims worked past its deadline today trying to decide on 
payments to Holocaust victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, headed by former Secretary of State Lawrence  
Eagleburger, had hoped to conclude its work on Wednesday and issue 
a public statement. But the deliberations on establishing a claims 
process were carried over without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger was trying to forge a consensus on a schedule for  
the payments, with the possibility he would make the decision 
himself if there was no agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	He would like the payments to begin by the end of the month.  
</P>
<P>
	In dispute is how to arrange a formula for placing values on the  
claims of families of Jews who were killed in the Holocaust and 
survivors who were forced to sell their insurance policies and turn 
in the proceeds to their Nazi persecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the issue of claims in countries that became communist  
after World War II was a stumbling block for the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist governments nationalized branches of insurance  
companies and then either refused to accept liabilities or paid out 
according to calculations that rendered the claims almost 
worthless. 
</P>
<P>
	Attending the international commission on Holocaust insurance  
were five insurers, American and European regulators and Jewish 
groups.

driftwood and lashed together with wild island grape vines. The 
names John-John, Carolyn and Lauren were etched into each arm of 
the cross. 
</P>
<P>
	West Tisbury resident Heather Rynd, who helped make the cross,  
said the monument was a symbol of loss and love for the Kennedy 
legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``JFK Jr. stands for something I carry in my heart politically,  
emotionally and spiritually,'' she said. ``I feel now that the 
spirit of him -- and the three of them -- will be here forever.''

<HEADLINE> Sun Microsystems Profits Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Sun Microsystems Inc.'s fourth-quarter  
profit grew a better-than-expected 30 percent amid increased sales 
to businesses choosing Sun's ``dot.com'' services to go online. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, a leading maker of computer systems for businesses, said it  
earned $395 million, or 48 cents per share, in the three months 
ended June 30. That was up from a profit of $289 million, or 37 
cents per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings beat the 46 cents per share forecast by analysts  
surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sun's quarterly revenue surged 22 percent to a record $3.52  
billion from $2.88 billion during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The results reflect Sun's strong push this year to focus its  
business on networking computers and software for the growing 
Internet industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've based our solutions on open interfaces and industry  
standards-an approach that encourages innovation throughout the 
industry and gives customers greater flexibility and choice,'' said 
Sun CEO Scott McNealy. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong quarter topped off a good year for Sun, which  
surpassed the $1 billion mark in annual net income for the first 
time. For the year ending June 30, Sun had $11.7 billion in 
revenues, up from $9.8 billion in the 1997-1998 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	Net income for the year was $1.03 billion, or $1.35 per share,  
up from $762 million, or $1.02 per share, last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Sun fell $3.50 to $67.18 3/4 in trading on the Nasdaq  
Stock Market.

<HEADLINE>  Columbia Launch Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Thunderstorms prevented space  
shuttle Columbia from blasting off early Thursday with Eileen 
Collins, the first woman to lead a U.S. space flight. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second launch delay this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Lightning flashed offshore and thunder rumbled as NASA held the  
countdown at the five-minute mark in hopes the storms would pass by 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch director even added 10 minutes to the launch window,  
but it didn't help. He waited until the last possible moment before 
radioing the bad news to Collins and her crew: They would not be 
lifting off Thursday with the world's most powerful X-ray 
telescope. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eileen, we gave it our best shot,'' launch director Ralph Roe  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crew will be ready to go at the next opportunity,''  
Collins assured him. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said it will try again early Friday. If Columbia isn't off  
the ground by then, the mission will have to be delayed until 
mid-August because of an upcoming rocket launch and the impending 
shutdown of Air Force launch facilities, for more than three weeks 
of improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The first launch attempt, on Tuesday, ended seven seconds before  
liftoff when a dangerous hydrogen buildup was detected in the 
engine compartment. It turned out to be a false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Hawley, who has endured numerous launch delays in his 21  
years as an astronaut, did his best to ensure a punctual liftoff. 
He briefly pulled a brown paper bag over his head before boarding 
Columbia; he's used the bag before, as a joke, to disguise himself 
for launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton had returned for Thursday's early morning  
try, along with daughter Chelsea, a delegation of female members of 
Congress and the co-captain of the U.S. women's soccer team. The 
whole team showed up for the first launch attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle is carrying the Chandra X-ray Observatory, a $1.5  
billion telescope that will spend at least five years searching for 
black holes and scrutinizing galaxies, quasars and exploded stars. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time in 38 years of U.S. space flight that a  
woman is at the controls. Collins, a 42-year-old Air Force colonel, 
flew twice before in space, as a co-pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	``To women, I say, this represents a huge milestone,'' she said  
in a recent interview. ``I think it's long overdue, I really do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five astronauts' first major task in orbit will be to  
release Chandra, the heaviest payload ever packed into a space 
shuttle. The 45-foot telescope, along with an attached rocket motor 
and support gear, weighs 50,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The shuttle had to be stripped of 7,000 pounds of unnecessary  
gear. And engineering studies were done to make sure the shuttle 
could sustain the weight if, because of some problem, it had to 
return to Earth with the telescope still on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra should have flown last summer but was grounded by  
technical problems, including bad circuit boards and a suspect 
rocket motor needed to propel it into an orbit extending one-third 
of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope is named for the late Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar,  
a Nobel-winning astrophysicist who taught at the University of 
Chicago. His 88-year-old widow, Lalitha, was on hand for the launch 
attempt.

<HEADLINE> Study Cites Hurdles to Polio Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The world is close to reaching the target  
of eradicating polio by the end of the year 2000, but wars and a 
lack of money are blocking a final assault on the feared childhood 
disease, the United Nations Children's Fund reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	At one time, polio killed or crippled 500,000 people a year,  
most of them children. A decade ago, there were 35,000 cases 
annually. Last year, 450 million children were vaccinated against 
polio and there were only about 6,000 cases, according to The 
Progress of Nations 1999 report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't been as close to wiping out a major disease as we  
are now since smallpox -- and it can be done,'' UNICEF Executive 
Director Carol Bellamy said in an interview Wednesday. ``This is a 
call to action to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellamy said the main obstacles are access and money. The $1.2  
billion global campaign still needs approximately $500 million, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference launching the report today, Bellamy was  
joined by actress Mia Farrow, who had polio as a child, and her 
9-year-old son Thaddeus, who is crippled by polio and lived in an 
orphanage in Calcutta, India until she adopted him three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that Thaddeus has been affected when this vaccine has  
been in existence for more than 40 years seems so unnecessary,'' 
said Farrow, who spent three days in an iron lung at the age of 
nine but didn't suffer any lasting physical effects. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1988, the World Health Organization's assembly pledged to  
eliminate polio by the end of 2000 -- and UNICEF has been working 
with WHO, Rotary International and the U.S. Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention to try to achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellamy said the campaign is targeting a dozen countries:  
Angola, Afghanistan, Congo, Sudan, Somalia and Ethiopia, which are 
engulfed in conflict, as well as India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, 
Nigeria, Turkey and Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success of the global polio eradication strategy has given  
us hope that we can mount a similar campaign to defeat HIV/AIDS,'' 
Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``HIV/AIDS is virtually undermining all the development gains  
for children that have been achieved over this decade, if not 
before,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the report, 16,000 people are infected by HIV every  
day and there are 8.2 million AIDS orphans in developing countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Uganda, for example, 1.1 million children under the age of 15  
are AIDS orphans, a staggering 11 percent of the country's 
children. By contrast, only about 1 percent of children are 
orphaned in the industrialized world. 
</P>
<P>
	This kind of disparity, the UNICEF report said, is one of many  
that the world's six billionth baby will face, depending on where 
in the planet he or she is born. The six billionth person's birth 
will be marked later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Statistically, the six billionth child has less than 1 chance  
in 10 of being born into prosperity and a 3 in 10 chance of being 
born into extreme poverty,'' Bellamy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the baby is born in Africa, the odds are that life will  
bring malnutrition, inadequate schooling, poor sanitation, unsafe 
drinking water and a span of years shortened by the cumulative 
effects of grinding poverty and debilitating disease,'' she said.
