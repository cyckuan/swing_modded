<HEADLINE> Chretien Offers 18.7 Billion Canadian Dollars for Health Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien has offered 18.7 billion Canadian dollars (about 12.7
billion U.S. dollars) in order to secure a health deal that was
discussed at the first meeting of provincial leaders on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He made the offer during a three-hour private dinner at his 24
Sussex residence here on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Chretien told premiers from the country's 10 provinces and two
territorial leaders that the government would raise federal funds
for provincial health care and education to 18.7 billion Canadian
dollars in 2001 from this year's 15.5 billion (about 10.5 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In return, the provincial leaders should be publicly
accountable for healthcare spending by developing health report
cards that would be checked by independent experts.
</P>
<P>
Most of the premiers expressed optimism that a deal was
possible with so much federal money on the table.
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a brave, brave premier who walks away from a
document that is pretty good in its essentials and from a
substantial sum of money when Canadians are desperately looking to
us for a renewal of medicare," said Saskatchewan Premier Roy
Romanow.
</P>
<P>
After the dinner, the Atlantic premiers withdrew their veiled
threat that they would scuttle out of Monday's meeting unless
Ottawa immediately increased equalization payments from the
richest to the poorest provinces.
</P>
<P>
Even Ontario appeared to soften its stand. Last Friday, premier
Mike Harris promised not to sign an accord unless Quebec does, but
when asked after the dinner if he will approve a deal without
Quebec, he said: "We had a lovely dinner. A lot of work to do (
Monday)."
</P>
<P>
Quebec criticized the accountability condition attached to the
funding as an unacceptable intrusion into provincial jurisdiction.
However, objections are expected to be relatively weak, unable to
derail an agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see Quebec will have any objections to the premiers'
position on reporting," said Alberta Premier Ralph Klein. "We
believe there should be a reporting mechanism, but we believe that
should be decided by the provinces," he said.
</P>
<P>
Federal officials have admitted that it would be impossible to
strike a deal without Ontario and Quebec, the country's two
largest provinces.

<HEADLINE> Green Group Plans to Sandbag World's Climate Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ecology campaigners plan to
set up a wall of sandbags around a conference of the world's
environment ministers in November, in a call for action to halt
global warming, Friends of the Earth said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The environmental campaign group said it plans to bus in
supporters from Europe to protest outside the conference in the
Hague, Netherlands, where senior government officials will decide
on how to make good their commitment to reduce so-called
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
The action group believes thousands of people will help stack
up a one-kilometer wall of sandbags around the conference center
on November 18 as a symbolic reference to rising sea levels that
results from global weather pattern changes.
</P>
<P>
These environment campaigners fear that ministers attending the
meeting, by inserting "loopholes," will weaken the pledges
governments made in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997 to limit carbon dioxide
emissions and other gases that are thought to alter the climate.
</P>
<P>
"In the run-up to The Hague November meeting, the stance taken
by many European Union member states could end up in a recklessly
weakened Kyoto Protocol, riddled with loopholes and escape clauses,
" the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The world's governments must seize the last chance offered to
save the Kyoto agreement ... otherwise millions of us around the
world will pay a terrible price for their failure," Friends of the
Earth campaigner Roger Higman said in the statement.

LUANDA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- With little chance to reach
the final phase of the Sydney Olympic Games, Angola is still
hoping that the athletes can accomplish miracles in the games and
compete for titles for their motherland.
</P>
<P>
The country has focused on the performance of the national men'

Games.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan men's basketball team, the titleholder of the
African continent, aims to improve their position in the Games. In
1996 Atlanta Olympics, the Angolan team finished in the last place.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan women's handball team will also find it hard to
make its way to the finals. The team finished in the eighth place
in last Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some Angolans said that swimming can still dream of
good results as swimmers Joao Ntyamba and Nadia Cruz are expected
to have good performance. Paulo Silva also make efforts for
registering a good place in the shooting competition.

<HEADLINE> India to Increase Oil Product Prices as OPEC Decides to Increase Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Indian government
official hinted Monday that petroleum product prices would be
increased in the country though the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided a day earlier to increase oil
production by 800,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik told the media here
that, to offset the high prices in the international markets, a
decision would be made after the return next week of Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who is now on two-week trip abroad
including a visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We have to tackle the situation with a mixture of all the
three options -- adjustment of taxes and duties, issue bonds to
control oil pool deficit and increase prices," Naik said.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed his dissatisfaction over the OPEC
decision, saying that the increase should have been around 1.1
million barrels a day to keep oil prices under control.
</P>
<P>
"I welcome the OPEC move to increase output though I would have
been happy if the increase had been by about 1.05 million to 1.1
million barrels per day," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting in Vienna on Sunday, OPEC countries agreed to
increase their oil output by 800,000 barrels per day, or a three
percent increase at its current production level, from October 1
in the face of international crude prices reaching to nearly 36 U.
S. dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement, Naik also said in a statement
last night that he welcomed the decision but expressed his hope
that it would have "a salutary and lasting effect on international
oil prices".
</P>
<P>
Due to sharp increase of crude oil and its products in the
international markets, India's oil import bill would shoot to 700
billion rupees (some 1.56 billion dollars) in the current fiscal
year, which began on April 1, from 570 billion rupees (some 1.26
billion dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
India is expected to import about 78 million tons of crude oil
and over 3 million tons of oil products during the current
financial year, with official sources projecting foreign exchange
outgo of 17-18 billion dollars as against some 12.5 billion
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Oil pool deficit had gone up to 900 billion rupees (
approximately 2 billion dollars) by September 1 from about 600 (1.
42 billion dollars) at the beginning of this financial year, Naik
said, adding diesel was carrying a subsidy of 3 rupees (0.066
dollars) a liter at the current price level while cooking gas was
subsidized by 160 rupees (3.55 dollars) per cylinder.
</P>
<P>
Naik told reporters that "we expect them to increase production
by 1 to 1.5 million barrels a day to keep crude prices within the
band of 22-28 dollars a barrel in line with OPEC's decision in
March."
</P>
<P>
"Their decision is welcome but they should have kept in mind
the anticipated increase in consumption owing to increase in
winter demand in the western countries," he added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Trade Minister in Damascus for Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Transport Minister
Makram Ebeid held talks here Tuesday with visiting Iraqi Trade
Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah on bilateral relations and
cooperation in the domain of maritime, road and railway transport.
</P>
<P>
The two officials exported means of increasing the delivery of
Iraqi goods via Syrian wharves, and of facilitating bilateral trade
and boosting export and import volume within the framework of U.N.
resolutions and the oil-for-food deal, reported the Syrian News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Trade with Iraq, except that carried out under the oil-for-food
deal, is banned under an embargo imposed on Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Salah said that the Iraqi Transport Ministry was doing its best
to enhance the movement of goods via Syrian ports to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also reached an agreement on transiting 1 million
tons of goods to Iraq via Syrian wharves.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Iraqi economic trade cooperation has been developing
drastically over the past three years. The volume of bilateral
trade hit 500 million U.S. dollars last year and Iraq hoped the
figure would reach 1 billion dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister arrived here on Sunday for an official visit
to Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq severed diplomatic ties in August 1980 when
Damascus sided with traditional ally Iran before the Iran-Iraq war
erupted.
</P>
<P>
Their relations further deteriorated when Syria joined a U.S.-
led alliance that drove Iraqi forces out of Kuwait in the 1991 Gulf
War.

CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Six people were killed and five
others injured on Tuesday in a road accident in the west of Egypt's
Sinai Peninsular, the state-run Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place when a minibus collided with a car on
the highway near Ras Sudr on the Red Sea coast, about 50 kilometers
south of Suez, police officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
An initial police investigation report said the accident was due
to high speed of the two vehicles, which were travelling in
opposite directions. The collision blocked the traffic on the
highway linking al-Arish in the north of Sinai for 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been rushed to Ras Sudr hospital.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt because of reckless
driving. Figures released by the Interior Ministry show that an
average of 3,000 people die in accidents each year, with economic
losses estimated at a staggering 1 billion U.S. dollars.

ABU DHABI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The number of expatriates
registered in the Labor Ministry of the United Arab Emirates
reached 1,455,115 by April 23 this year, according to a ministry
statistical report published on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The figure does not include an estimated 1 million such
expatriates as home maids, home drivers, farm laborers and
government employees, whose visas were issued directly by the
Ministry of Interior, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report said Asians in the private sector account for 87.1
percent, Arabs 10.6 percent and other nationalities 2.3 percent,
while Indians are taking lion's share of 53.3 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The report is the first of its kind to be prepared by the
ministry in a bid to provide accurate database for the employment
market.
</P>
<P>
Matar Humaid Al Tayer, minister of labor and social affairs,
said the report differs from previous ones in that it presents data
of changes in the job market and discusses its problems and
development.
</P>
<P>
He said a transition to competition in labor imports based on
skills and high technology, which is necessary and essential as
international experience shows, needs government intervention. But
he did not elaborate on what measures the government is going to
take in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Over 100,000 Afghan Refugees Repatriated from Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 101,122 Afghan
refugees have been repatriated from different parts of Iran since
the start in April of a "voluntary repatriation program," the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The program was based on an agreement signed in February between
Iranian government and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), according to which some 100,000 Afghans were to
be sent back in six months.
</P>
<P>
The International Organization for Migration and the Medecins
Sans Frontieres of France are responsible for providing
transportation and medical help to the refugees under their
separate agreements with the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR office in Tehran, it offered aid to most
of those repatriated, but 10,819 refugees have chosen to return to
Afghanistan by their own means, without receiving any aid from the
international organization.
</P>
<P>
There are still a lot of Afghans who are unwilling to return
home because of the ongoing civil war in their country. Joint teams
of the UNHCR and Iranian government have given permission to most
of them to remain in Iran temporarily until the situation becomes
better.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR puts the total number of Afghan refugees in Iran at 1.
4 million, of which some 70,000 are living here illegally.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials blamed Afghan refugees for increasing
joblessness among the country's youths, and for the worsening drug
problem.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 154 Majlis (parliament) members sent an open letter
to President Mohammad Khatami demanding the expulsion of all Afghan
refugees.

<HEADLINE> Private Sector Urged to Help Avert Marginalization of Arab Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Finance Minister George
Korom on Tuesday urged private companies in Arab countries to take
bolder steps in an effort to help prevent marginalization of the
Arab economies.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international economic symposium here on emerging
Arab markets, Korom said Arab business behavior should be bolder
and more aggressive to curb the trend that Arab markets are being
marginalized in global economy.
</P>
<P>
He told the conference sponsored by London-based Euromoney
Forums that it is easy to blame war and state-controlled economies
for the marginalization problem, what is more important is the
attitude of the private sector toward globalization.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Arab private sector to devote more financial
resources to research, development and manpower training.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he proposed that Arab governments and the private
sector consult more openly, much like the successful countries in
Asia, to define new policies to confront the challenges of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and the private sector must join efforts to
stimulate investment and create employment, the Lebanese official
added.
</P>
<P>
Arab governments such as in Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco have
taken giant steps in opening their economies in the last decade,
with privatization now accepted as a tool to cut the state role in
the economy, Korom said.
</P>
<P>
Euromoney Forums is part of a publishing group in London that
sponsors economic conferences around the world, including previous
ones in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> Austrian FM "Extremely Satisfied" With EU Decision to Lift Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ferrero-Waldner, who is in New York to attend the general
debate of the 55th U.N. General Assembly session, told a press
conference that "this is a victory of reason, and it's also a
victory for Europe."
</P>
<P>
"I hope this will be the basis now for the normalization of our
relations with the (other) 14 European Union members," she said. "
And I do hope that we can now start to have the full resumption of
our formal and informal work within the European Union," she said.
</P>
<P>
She made the remarks just two hours after sanctions imposed
seven months ago on Austria by its 14 EU partners have been lifted.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister, who described the sanctions as "the most
difficult time" for herself, said that she was not invited to the
EU institution in Vienna as the sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
The entry of the Freedom Party into Austria's coalition
government in February led to the sanctions, effectively a freeze
on bilateral ties -- notably the reduction of contacts with
Austria's ambassadors to level of "officials" -- and a refusal to
support Austrian candidates for international offices.
</P>
<P>
The removal of the embargo comes after the release of a report
last Friday by an EU-appointed committee of three experts, who the
Austrian foreign minister described as "the three wise men"
producing "an objective analysis."
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that the sanctions were counter-productive
and could incite even stronger nationalist feeling in Austria.
</P>
<P>
It was wise for the three wise men to conclude in the report
that "the members of the Freedom Party in the government have done
nothing against the European value," she said.
</P>
<P>
Though "very glad" to see the removal of the sanctions, she
said it is "a little too early" to think of bilateral meetings
with foreign ministers from other 14 EU countries during the
general debate in the U.N. headquarters in New York.

WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton remains fully committed to the Middle East peace process
but recognizes the difficulties to narrow the gaps between
Israelis and Palestinians, the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have no illusions here," P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the
White House National Security Council, told reporters. "This is an
extraordinarily difficult process. There are still very hard
decisions that both parties have to make. We continue to review
the situation and formulate ideas that we think can help bring the
parties closer together."
</P>
<P>
Crowley noted that Clinton, who has been trying to broke a
Middle East peace settlement before he leaves office in January, "
remains fully committed to support the parties and is willing to
do everything that he can to help them reach an agreement."
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. envoy Dennis Ross would continue to have contacts
with both sides over the next couple weeks on the margins of the
United Nations General Assembly.

<TEXT>
<P>
Tunis, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The ninth session of Arab-
African Parliamentary Conference opened here Tuesday, with the
participation of 47 Arab and African parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the three-day session, presided over by
President of the National Assembly (parliament) of Tunisia Fouad
Mbazaa, was attended by representatives from the Arab Parliamentary
Union and the African Parliamentary Union.
</P>
<P>
Mbazaa said: "The conference comes at a time when the world
witnesses steady changes and increasing regional and international
economic and political blocs, tilted economic and political
balances in favor of the North and broadening of the gap between
the rich and poor nations."
</P>
<P>
Highlighting the close coordination and intensive common Arab-
African efforts, he said "African-Arab cooperation has become an
inevitable strategic option to face up to challenges, notch up
aspired goals mainly including developments, keep up with
globalization and join the new world order."
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, he called on Arab and African countries
to invest their potential and "draw upon initiatives in deepening
dialogue and understanding between African and Arab peoples."
</P>
<P>
He also urged participants at the meeting to conduct direct
contacts so as to help push forward African and Arab cooperation to
forge a common policy aimed at "preserving our joint interests and
enabling our peoples to deal with challenges."
</P>
<P>
The conference will discuss international political, economic
and social conditions, global transformations and their impacts on
African and Arab policies, together with common cooperation in the
utilization of natural resources.

<HEADLINE> EU Officials to Visit Cyprus to Push Accession Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's (EU)
chief negotiator in the accession talks with Cyprus Leopold Maurer
will arrive here Wednesday for a five-day visit in a bid to push
forward the island's EU accession process.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Maurer and his 12-member European Commission
team will sort out technical details in the individual chapters,
keep the pressure going and push Cyprus parliament to speed up
harmonizing laws and legislation with those of the EU.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency, the chapters to be
addressed include competition, transport (road and maritime),
energy, taxation, environment, free movements of services and
capital.
</P>
<P>
The European mission, some members of which are already on the
island, will meet officials from the foreign and other ministries,
the law office, the planning bureau, as well as the House of
Representatives' committee for external and european affairs.
</P>
<P>
They will also have talks Friday with Cyprus chief negotiator on
EU membership George Vassiliou.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Maurer and his delegation, including environmental
experts, will visit Akamas peninsula in the western tip of the
island, which is designated to become a national park as it is
considered unique for its flora and fauna.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on Akamas' future have been going on for years, with
local people wishing to develop the area for tourism purposes,
which has drawn opposition and concern from environmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, along with Slovenia, Hungary, Poland, Estonia and the
Czech Republic started substantive accession negotiations with the
EU in November 1998. So far 15 chapters out of a total of 29 have
been closed. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member in the first

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is prepared to expand its
fledging Internet services to sectors other than government
departments, said Iraqi Minister of Transport and Communications
Ahmad Murtadha Ahmad Khalil on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Khalil said that his ministry, in cooperation with an
international Internet company based in the Iraqi capital, is
planning to provide Internet services to private sectors,
universities, private colleges and organizations, as well as
foreign embassies with very low prices.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, his ministry has targeted at extending the Internet
services to all other Iraqi provinces besides the capital.
</P>
<P>
Since the Internet services first began in Iraq last July,
priority has been given to ministries, commissions and other
organizations, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Khalil attended the opening ceremony of Iraq's first Internet
center on July 27. The move has been regarded as an attempt by the
Iraqi government to provide its isolated people with a glimpse of
what is happening in the outside world.
</P>
<P>
A total of three such centers have been opened in the capital.

CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Obeid on Tuesday conferred with Italian Minister of Industry and
Foreign Trade Enrico Letta on ways to beef up bilateral cooperation
in economic, trade and industrial fields.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Obeid hailed the Egyptian-Italian relations
in various fields, terming them as "excellent and deeply-rooted,"
Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides will make a giant leap forward in
cooperation in the fields of electricity and petrochemical
industry, and praised the role played by some Italian companies,
including Edison International and Agip, in oil and natural gas
exploration in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt will further exert efforts to expand the trade volume with
Italy and attract more investments from it, Obeid said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians May Accept Islamic Sovereignty in Jerusalem: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said here on Tuesday that the Palestinian side was willing to
accept "Islamic sovereignty" in Jerusalem, which was proposed by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has proposed that Jerusalem Committee of the Organization
of the Islamic Conference have the sovereignty over Islamic shrines
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of International Cooperation Nabil Shaath
said the proposal did not mean representatives from the committee
would be involved in the current negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arafat merely wanted to highlight the Palestinians' willingness
to accept the committee's sovereignty over Jerusalem, he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian sovereignty over 8 percent of Jerusalem, as offered
by Israel, is not enough, as it did not include the most important
Muslim and Christian holy sites, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The offer fell short of enabling the Palestinians to have Arab
East Jerusalem, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war, as
the capital of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The minister expected the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations to
achieve a breakthrough in the coming five weeks, during which the
peace talks will last.
</P>
<P>
Shaath said the Palestinian leadership would seek the next
period as a final bid to make tangible progress in the final status
negotiations with Israel.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Pilot Suspended for Banning Israel Searching Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian national carrier,
EgyptAir, announced Tuesday to ground a prominent pilot who had
refused to allow Israeli security men to search his plane at the
Palestinian Gaza airport.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir President Fahim Rayan said an investigation into the
incident is under way and captain Ali Murad will be banned from
work until the end of the probe, the Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Murad refused to allow Israeli security men to board
his Airbus 320 and search it at the Gaza airport. As a result,
Murad flew his plane back to Cairo by himself while all the
passengers were stopped by the Israeli security force. A second
plane was sent to fly the passengers hours later.
</P>
<P>
Murad has caused large financial losses to the airline and what
is worse, some passengers have refused to buy EgyptAir tickets to
and from Gaza for fear of more delays, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He also said Murad violated the laws by failing to abide by an
agreement signed between the Palestinian National Authority and
Israel, which allows a Palestinian and an Israeli security member
to inspect planes since the Gaza route opened in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security services control air traffic in and out of Gaza
under agreements governing Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Murad, meanwhile, has said that no one had told him there was an
agreement to allow security staff to search the plane.
</P>
<P>
But the EgyptAir chief stressed that the pilot's ignorance of
such an agreement does not exempt him from responsibility.

<P>
MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in the sea
mishap that hit the Philippines on Monday morning has reached
eight as of Tuesday evening, said a report of the ABS-CBN
television.
</P>
<P>
A small passenger ferry carrying about 30 people capsized
around 7 a.m. near Bonito island off Mabini in the northern
Batangas province.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Erwin Balagas, director for operations of
Philippine Coast Guard in Batangas, as saying that all four crew
members along with 18 other passengers of the 7.44-ton motorized
outrigger boat were rescued by the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
Bad weather conditions hampered search and rescue operations
for the missing passengers of M/V Cocobeach, which was en route to
Batangas after leaving the nearby Cocobeach Resort when the
incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
The resort, about 135 kilometers southeast of Manila, is a
favorite among local and foreign tourists. Aside from Filipinos,
the passengers of the boat are composed of British, Chinese,
Japanese, Austrians and Polish.
</P>
<P>
Balagas said the boat's engine stalled as it was swamped by big
waves. The boat then capsized and sank about 500 meters off Bonito
island, about 110 kilometers south of Manila.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Cape Town Mayor Dismissed for Watching Porn  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- William Bantom, mayor of
Cape Town, South Africa, was expelled from his New National Party
(NNP) Tuesday after he was caught down-loading pornography from
the internet and watching pornographic videos in his office.
</P>
<P>
The NNP's decision will force Bantom, who is also a highly
respected church minister, to resign his mayoral seat, South
African Western Cape premier Gerald Morkel told a news conference
in Cape Town on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Morkel said he had been formerly informed that Bantom had
visited a number of pornographic sites in October last year.
</P>
<P>
The premier said he pardoned Bantom after the latter promised
no repetition of this kind of activities in the future.
</P>
<P>
But at the end of last week, Morkel said he learned that Bantom
had been playing adult pornographic videos in his office.
</P>
<P>
"It was clear that Bantom had not honored his undertaking to me
and after confirming the pornography video incident on Monday, I
asked Bantom to come to see me to discuss the matter," Morkel said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of our discussion I have demanded his resignation
from the NNP with immediate effect," he said.
</P>
<P>
Morkel said he took this drastic step because it was clear that
Bantom had not ceased his pornographic activities and was not fit
to be a candidate in the coming municipal election.
</P>
<P>
Bantom handed in his resignation on Tuesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Guinea-Bissau Political Parties Seek to Revive Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The two parties that
previously formed the Guinea-Bissau coalition government held an
meeting Monday in the capital Bissau with an aim to revive their
partnership that ended last week, the Portuguese news agency Lusa
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Defense Minister Fernando Correia Landim, who is
also spokesman for the ruling Social Renovation Party (PRS), the
meeting was aimed to "discuss matters related to the current
crisis" in the government.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government collapsed last Tuesday when President
Kumba Iala issued a decree to dismiss all five ministers of the
Guinea-Bissau Resistance (RGB) from the cabinet led by Prime
Minister Caetano Intchama.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to re-establish the coalition should "safeguard the
dignity of the leaders, members and supporters" of the RGB and
guarantee effective partnership conditions, said RGB spokesman
Dauda Saw on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Thank to the efforts by U.N. special envoy Nana Sinkam, a first
inconclusive meeting between representatives of the two parties
was held last Friday. Meanwhile, Iala has had a series of contacts
with leaders of various political parties to discuss the situation
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government of Guinea-Bissau was formed last
February when the PRS and the RGB, the largest and second largest
party of the country, decided to establish their partnership.
</P>
<P>
The PRS, led by Iala, won the November 1999 legislative
elections. However, the party did not obtain an absolute majority
in the parliament and had to form a coalition with the RGB.

HARARE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's second largest city,
Bulawayo, has launched a "clean-up" campaign to pool efforts from
various stakeholders including civic and governmental
organizations, industry and commerce circles, police and soldiers
to reduce environmental pollution.
</P>
<P>
The city is fast losing its status as one of Africa's cleanest
city due to the massive littering and dumping by some of its

unauthorized shop stands, kiosks and barber shops have worsened
the situation.

"Industrialists are dumping trade effluent into the city's
drainage system, contributing tremendously to the problem of
pollution," he said.
</P>

According to Ndlovu, the city council will soon introduce trade
waste tariffs to help deter pollution. Besides, a competition will
be launched to encourage citizens to improve their environment, he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government
Tuesday launched an anti-poverty forum aimed at bringing voices of
the poor into the national policy plan for poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
"We want to stimulate critical discussions and understanding
about the nature of poverty in Uganda and make the war against it,
" said Leonard Okello, national co-ordinator of the Uganda
Participatory Poverty Assessment Project.
</P>
<P>
The forum, with the theme "Good Governance and Decentralization:
Learning from the Poor", is presided by the country's prime
minister and is expected to pool together suggestions on poverty
alleviation from over 300 delegates from civil society, non-
governmental organizations, academic community and government
departments.
</P>
<P>
According to Okello, although the poverty rate in Uganda has
fallen from 56 to 44 percent in the last 10 years, a 1998 censor
showed that about 9 million Ugandans were still living below the
poverty line, lacking the basic daily-life necessities.

government began compiling the data in 1975.
</P>
<P>
It was the 17th month in a row that underlying inflation, the
figure targeted by the Bank of England, has been below that target.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the National Statistics Office (NSO) said the
largest downward effect on inflation had come from changes in
motoring costs due to falling petrol and oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices had fallen sharply in August compared to rises last
year, reflecting falls in crude oil prices, the NSO added.
</P>
<P>
It said the average price of a liter of unleaded petrol had
fallen from 85p in July to 81p in August this year. This compared
to last year's figures showing prices up from 71p to 73p, led by
supermarket competition.
</P>
<P>
The fall in inflation has led the Bank of England's monetary
policy committee to keep interest rates unchanged for the last
seven months at 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
That has led to a sharp fall in the value of the pound against
the dollar in recent weeks, with the pound now worth less than 1.
40 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> General Assembly Must Keep Momentum of Millennium Summit Alive: GA President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
General Assembly (GA) must avoid a "business-as-usual" mentality
and strive to maintain the momentum generated at the Millennium
Summit, which concluded here last Friday, the GA president has
said.
</P>
<P>
The GA president, Harri Holkeri of Finland, told his first news
conference here Monday, "The General Assembly has got a very clear
message from the summit that its task now will be to follow up the
summit and, if I may say so, to keep the spirit of the Millennium
Summit alive -- I will call it the Millennium Summit spirit."
</P>
<P>
"We must keep this momentum going and this spirit alive, and we
must start today -- not tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 55th GA session kicked off the two-week general debate
Tuesday at the U.N. headquarters in New York, in which speakers
from more than 180 countries are expected to voice their views on
major international issues, such as peace and development,
disarmament, U.N. peacekeeping operations and U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Holkeri presided over the GA meeting, which adopted
a 179-item agenda for its current session, including several new
items such as cooperation between the United Nations and the
Council of Europe, the financing of the peacekeeping mission in
Ethiopia and Eritrea, the role of the organization in promoting
the global order and the links between the illegal diamond trade
and the financing of conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Romania's National Airline Put Out for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian Transport
Ministry put out for sale 54.2 percent of Tarom National Airline's
stake and the bids are expected over September 12-November 3.
</P>
<P>
As many as 51 percent of stock will be owned by Romanian
natural and juristic persons and thus Tarom will preserve its
status of national airline, the official Rompres news agency
reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sale will be done by a capital increase and/or a sale of
the existing shares.
</P>
<P>
Romanian authorities hope that after the privatization Tarom
will enter one of the European airlines alliances such as the one
around Lufthansa, Starlines or KLM-British Airways and Swissair/
Sabena/Turkish, according to the Transport Ministry's secretary of
state Aleodor Francu.
</P>
<P>
Tarom has a share capital worth 1,949 billion lei (23,421 lei
for 1 U.S. dollar) and is on the list of the companies to be
privatized through the PSAL Program signed by the Romanian
government with the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Sees Protectionism in Int'l Trade as Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- It is unacceptable
that major global issues and campaigns for transnational
solidarity be manipulated and exploited to disguise what amounts
to the protection of narrow interests, Brazil said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Luiz Felipe Lampreia, minister of
foreign affairs of Brazil, said the inconsistency between free
trade rhetoric and the continued use of protectionist policies of
various types by developed countries is actually called
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Discrimination, especially when waged against the weakest, is
the absolute negation of solitary, the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We must reverse these grave distortions in international trade,
especially as concerns agricultural products," said the foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
"It is inadmissible that the most prosperous nations, whose
economies are strongly based in the manufacturing and service
industries, should be legally entitled to restrict access to their
markets for agricultural goods. While, at the same time, they call
for the free flow of those goods in which they benefit from an
enormous competitive advantage," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is even more intolerable that these countries be allowed,
as is presently the case, to subsidize the production and export
of agricultural commodities to the tune of dozens of billions of
dollars," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"These policies cause enormous harm to exporting nations that
are more efficient and competitive in this field, but lack the
financial means to offer equally generous fiscal incentives to
their farmer," he noted.
</P>
<P>
It should be made clear that the developed countries must not
presume to unilaterally write the rules of international trade
solely according to their interests and points of view, as if the
other 5 billion human beings did not have equally legitimate
aspirations to progress, justice and well-being, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> UNEP Announces Winners of Int'l Photo Competition on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Environment Program (UNEP) Monday evening announced the prize
winners in the UNEP International Photographic Competition on the
Environment 1999-2000 -- "Focus of Your World."
</P>
<P>
The announcement came at a gala awards ceremony held Monday
evening in New York City.
</P>
<P>
The competition, the third such contest organized by the UNEP
and sponsored by Canon Inc., was held from June 1999 to April 2000
and encouraged people, young and old alike, to submit photographs
reflecting the environmental health of the planet, and the
interlinkages between the physical, social, economic and spiritual
aspects of life on Earth.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16,650 entries from 7,877 people in 160 countries
and states were submitted. A panel of judges made up of
photographers from around the world awarded gold, silver and
bronze prizes in adult and junior divisions, together with four
special prizes and 110 honorary mentions.
</P>
<P>
All the major prize winners, who hail from Germany, Brazil,
China and Canada, were able to receive their awards in person.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the ceremony, UNEP Executive Director Klaus
Toepfrer said, "As we work towards a sustainable future, we need a
common language that can instantly touch hearts and minds.
Photography is that common language, a creative act that gives
color, expression and a human dimension to our scientific finding.
"
</P>
<P>
The Gold Prize in the Adult Division has been awarded to
Hartmut Schwarzbach of Germany for a portfolio of three
photographs of children who live in Manila's slums, entitled "
Floating Kids at Manila Bay."
</P>
<P>
The 124 prize-winning photographs will begin their
international touring after the September 12-22 exhibition at the
Park Avenue Atrium in New York.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will then be on display in a number of countries
around the world, with the Japanese leg of the tour scheduled to
be staged in Yokohama on October 7-22.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based UNEP, founded in 1972, is the principal body
in the field of the environment with its mission to provide
leadership and encourage partnerships in caring for the
environment by enabling nations and peoples to improve their
quality of life without compromising that of future generations.

<HEADLINE> Annan Appeals to General Assembly for More Openness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening the general debate of the 55th General Assembly session,
Annan said, "Consensus is highly desirable, but it need not mean
waiting for absolute unanimity on every sub-clause among 189
member states," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two-week general debate, which is scheduled to end on
September 22, traditionally starts each annual General Assembly
session. Most countries send their heads of state or government to
the debate, but this year the General Assembly began with last
week's three-day Millennium Summit, which attracted more than 150
heads of state or government.
</P>
<P>
"This year, coming the week after our historic Millennium
Summit, it may seem something of an anticlimax," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to see it as the moment when we roll up our sleeves
and start putting into action the bold pledges that our heads of
state and government have made," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the scheduled speakers in the general debate this year
are foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
Annan recalled that the summit had said the United Nations must
be "a more effective instrument for pursuing the priorities they
have outlined."
</P>
<P>
"The minority, often a very small minority, should not withhold
its consent unreasonably," he said, urging member states to allow
other actors to have a greater say in the working of the world
body.
</P>
<P>
"Members of parliament, the private sector, nongovernmental
organizations and civil society in general must have more
opportunities to contribute to the U.N.'s activities, to the
realization of its goals and the work of its programs," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Sees Poverty, Exclusion at Root of Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The statement came as Foreign Minister Chakra Prasad Bastola of
Nepal was taking the floor at the general debate of the 55th
General Assembly session, which began here Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
"A survey of the present trouble spots on earth would lead us
to one unmistakable conclusion: most conflicts have poverty and
exclusion at their root. All too often, we tend to treat symptoms,
not the cause," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nepal strongly believes a durable peace will continue to elude
us as long as we do not eliminate dehumanizing poverty and
deprivation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, more than one-fifth of humanity lives on less than a
dollar a day," he said. "Poverty, illiteracy, and diseases are
rife in the poor countries. Unemployment among youths is rampant.
A growing population finds itself scrambling over shrinking
resources in a stagnant economy, which has been the case in most
developing countries."
</P>
<P>
"The pandemic of AIDS has become a major scourge of the
developing world, particularly in Africa," he said. "Unscrupulous
leaders, often for narrow political gains, fish in the troubled
waters; and incite violence, which shatters the fragile economy
further, making the next cycle of violence inevitable and even
more deadly."
</P>
<P>
"If we are ever to achieve peace, we must reduce poverty and
build up peace from here," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, "most advanced countries have, for instance, sorely
lagged in meeting their pledge of development assistance," he said.
"More aid now means no need for it later."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Maintains Hard-Line on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States
maintained its hard-line on Iraq Tuesday by urging the
international community to stand up to the campaign launched by
Baghdad against the U.N. authority and international law.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 55th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Madeleine Albright, U.S. secretary of
state, said United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284
provided an effective plan for protecting world security through
resumed weapons inspection and monitoring in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Thus far, Baghdad has flatly refused to accept the resolution,
" Albright said.
</P>
<P>
"The regime's strategy is to ignore its U.N. Charter
obligations, and to seek to preserve at all costs its capacity to
produce the deadliest weapons humanity has ever known," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We must continue to do all we can to ease the hardships faced
by Iraq's people. But we must also defend the integrity of this
institution, our security and international law," she said.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 1284, adopted in December 1999, established the
United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
to resume arms inspection in Iraq. U.N. weapons inspection in Iraq
has been suspended since the U.S.-led military strikes against
Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reiterated that lifting the sanctions against the
country is the precondition for the U.N. arms inspectors to return.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under stringent U.N. sanctions since its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. The sanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq is
clarified to be free from weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Annan Distressed at Innocent Villagers' Deaths in Liberia-Guinea Rift </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A statement, issued here by Annan's spokesman, said, "The
secretary-general has been following with concern the mounting
tension between Guinea and Liberia following armed clashes along
their common border, as well as reported clashes along the Guinea-
Sierra Leone border."
</P>
<P>
"He is distressed at the loss of life and injuries sustained by
innocent villagers," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general urges the presidents of Guinea and
Liberia to refrain from any action that might aggravate the
situation," the statement said. "He also calls on them to fully
support the efforts of the current chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), President (Alpha)
Konaire of Mali, to reduce tension and restore peace and security
between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general is grateful to the government of Guinea
for continuing to extend its generous hospitality to refugees from
Liberia and Sierra Leone and urges the refugees to respect their
obligations towards the host country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Annan said that border tensions between Guinea and
Liberia could harm Sierra Leone, where the United Nations is
trying to rescue a 1999 peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Konaire, who holds the rotating chair of the 16-nation ECOWAS,
met his Liberian counterpart, Charles Taylor of Liberia, Tuesday
morning before leaving for Guinea, reports said.
</P>
<P>
President Lansana Conte of Guinea has accused Liberia of
involvement in a cross-border attack on the Guinea village of
Massadou on September 1 in which 47 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liberia has accused Guinea of harboring insurgents
who have been fighting government forces in northern Liberia since
they crossed the border from Guinea in early July.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules Out Force For Iraq's Arms Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States
Tuesday ruled out the use of force solely to try to make Iraq let
U.N. arms inspectors resume their work.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after making a speech at the general
debate of the 55th session of the United Nations General Assembly,
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright repeated the U.S.
position that letting in the new U.N. arms inspection agency was
the key to the United Nations easing sanctions imposed on Iraq in
1990.
</P>
<P>
"The key here is Dr. Hans Blix and UNMOVIC (the United Nations
Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission) and he has
said he is ready to go in. It's a little bit like Alice in
Wonderland. The key's on the table. All he (Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein) has to do is pick it up," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the international community that is keeping the
Iraqi children and people from eating. The villain is Saddam
Hussein. It's very simple," she said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1284 in
December 1999 which established the UNMOVIC to replace the United
Nations Special Commission in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons
of mass destruction, which was barred from returning after the U.S.
-led military strikes against Iraq in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reiterated that lifting sanctions is the precondition
for the U.N. arms inspectors to resume their work in Iraq.
</P>

Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions since its invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. The sanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq is clarified to

<HEADLINE> Iraq Earns Another 340 Mln Dlrs in U.N. "Oil-for-Food" Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq exported 11.8
million barrels of oil last week, earning an additional 340
million U.S. dollars for the United Nations humanitarian "oil-for-
food" program, the United Nations Office of Iraq Program said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The office, which administers the U.N. humanitarian "oil-for-
food" program, reported that in the week to September 8, the U.N.
Security Council sanctions committee approved four new contracts
for the sale of Iraqi oil, bringing the total of approved
contracts in the current phase VIII to 103 with a volume of over
391 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The office said that since the first oil exports under the
program, on December 10, 1996, Iraq has exported 2,016 million
barrels with a value of over 33.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolution establishing the "oil-for-
food program," 66 percent of earning goes to fund the country's
humanitarian needs and 30 percent is directed to the Compensation
Commission which pays claims arising from Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. The remainder goes to pay the costs of the U.N. Monitoring,
Verification and Inspection Commission and U.N. operational costs.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions against Iraq cannot be lifted until the United
Nations clarifies that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. arm inspectors have been away from Iraq since the U.S.-
led military air strikes against the country in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Urges Broader Approach to Reducing Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Major reductions in
poverty are possible but achieving these will require a more
comprehensive approach that directly addresses the needs of poor
people in three important areas: opportunity, empowerment, and
security, according to a new World Bank report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The World Development Report 2000/2001: Attacking Poverty,"
the World Bank's most detailed-ever investigation of global
poverty, said that economic growth is crucial but often not
sufficient to create conditions in which the world's poorest
people can improve their lives.
</P>
<P>
At present, according to the World Bank, 2.8 billion people,
almost half the world's population, are living on less than two U.
S. dollars a day. Of these people, 1.2 billion live on less than
one dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
Progress in poverty reduction has varied widely across regions,
the report said. In East Asia the number of people living on less
than one dollar a day fell from around 420 million in 1987 to
around 280 million in 1998. But in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,
and Latin America, the number of poor people have been rising
steadily. In the countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia in
transition to market economies, the number of people living in
poverty has risen 20-fold.
</P>
<P>
The report recommended that developing country governments at
all levels, donor countries, international agencies, non-
governmental organizations, and local communities, mobilize behind
three priority areas:
</P>
<P>
-- Opportunity: Expanding economic opportunity for poor people
by stimulating economic growth, making markets work better for
poor people, and working for their inclusion, particularly by
building up their assets, such as land and education;
</P>
<P>
-- Empowerment: Strengthening the ability of poor people to
shape decisions that affect their lives and removing
discrimination based on gender, race, ethnicity, and social status;
</P>
<P>
-- Security: reducing poor people's vulnerability to sickness,
economic shocks, crop failure, unemployment, natural disasters,
and violence, and helping them cope when such misfortunes occur.
</P>
<P>
"Advances in these areas are complementary. Each is important
in its own right, and each enhances the others," said Nora Lustig,
director of the World Development Report 2000/2001.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this framework will be helpful to countries in
developing their own poverty-reduction strategies according to
their own circumstances," she said. "There is no universal
blueprint."
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed that there are many areas that require
international action, especially by developed countries, to
improve the prospects for poor countries and their people. It
urged developed countries to increase debt relief for poor
countries and make development aid more effective.
</P>
<P>
Equally important are actions in other areas, such as expanding
the access to developed country markets, promoting the production
of public goods that benefit poor people such as vaccines for
tropical diseases and agricultural research, combating HIV/AIDS,
enhancing global financial stability, closing the digital and
knowledge divides, enabling the participation of poor countries in
international discussions, and fostering global peace, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> France Stresses Positive Effects of EU Sanctions Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- France stressed Tuesday evening
the positive effects of the sanctions of the European Union
imposed upon Austria after the entry of the extreme right into the
government.
</P>
<P>
"If we need to do it again, we will do it again," said the
Elysee presidential palace in a statement after the announcement
of lifting the EU sanctions against Vienna.
</P>
<P>
The EU Tuesday decided to lift its sanctions against Austria
imposed in February after the entry into the government of the
extreme-right Freedom Party led by Joerg Haider.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include suspension of bilateral cooperation
between the 14 other EU countries and Austria, a minimum reception
of Austrian ambassadors, and refusal to support Austrian
candidates for international posts.
</P>
<P>
The lifting of sanctions followed a proposal by the three "wise
men" appointed by the European Court of Human Rights, who said in
a report submitted to the EU presidency state France last weekend
that it is advisable to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Elysee presidential palace said in a statement that the
nature of the Freedom Party justifies a continuous vigilance of
all EU countries against it.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Freedom Party is "far from changing" its
nature and France is reluctant to meet with Austrian government
members who came from the Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
"The measures decided by the 14 other EU countries were useful
and were justified by the situation," said the statement.

OTTAWA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 17,000 counterfeit
credit cards have been seized in Brampton, northeast of Toronto,
Canadian police said Tuesday.
</P>

Along with the fake cards, which could cost the credit card
industry some 50 million Canadian dollars (about 33.8 million U.S.
dollars), the investigation also netted one arrest and the
equipment at a storage facility.
</P>

Police said counterfeiters acquired information from real
credit cards in Montreal before making the fakes which also
include driver's license cards and social insurance number cards.
</P>
<P>
A 25-year-old citizen in Brampton has been charged with

<P>
The signed document will be presented at the United Nation's
Special Session on Children next year.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that millions of children around the world have
been left homeless, traumatized or injured due to wars.
</P>
<P>
Nancy Wildgoose, secretary-general of the conference, said
about two million children have been killed in the past decade,
while four to five million others are disabled. In addition, one
million children were left orphaned and 12 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
A report being circulated at the conference says in war-torn
Rwanda alone, about 300,000, of a total of 800,000 people
massacred, were children.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government estimates that about 300,000 children
are currently directly involved in armed conflicts in about 30
regions in the world.
</P>
<P>
Christine Tokar, a Canadian Red Cross worker, said some 24,000
children were abducted during war in Sierra Leone and forced to be
child soldiers, sex slaves or laborers for armed groups.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Canadian Minister for International
Cooperation Maria Minna urged quick actions to be taken to tackle
the situation, while Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said:
"Tomorrow's international security depends on finding solutions to
the culture of violence that endangers children's lives and
jeopardizes their future."
</P>
<P>
Minna said she believed that scars can heal with the help of
the international community.
</P>
<P>
"From our experience working with war-affected children, we
have seen that they can become peacebuilders and act as agents of
change within their communities."
</P>
<P>
Attending the 6-day conference are government officials,
experts and young people from more than 130 countries, including
ministers from about 50 countries.

HARARE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's opposition Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC) headquarters in Harare were rocked on
Monday night by a bomb which shattered four windows at the
entrance door and two car window panes, the Zimbabwe News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bomb hit the ground about one meter away from the entrance.
Two cars were parked close to entrance of the offices with their

<P>
MDC spokesman Learmore Jongwe Tuesday told the news agency that
security guards who were manning the building at the time of the

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Global Support for United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday said that it is vital that the United Nations
should act as the world's peoples expect of it, but he said that
he does not mean the world body should be able to win all the
battles by itself to fight for global development and world peace.
</P>
<P>
Opening the general debate of the 55th General Assembly session,
Annan said, "I do not mean, of course, that this organization
should be able to win all these battles by itself."
</P>
<P>
"It is vital that this organization, the United Nations itself,
should be capable of playing the role that the world's peoples
expect of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, there is broad consensus on what needs to be done --
broader than many people would have expected in so large and
diverse an organization," he said. "What is vital now, however, is
that we also agree on the means of doing it, and that we equip
ourselves with the right tools."
</P>
<P>
The general debate came a week after the Millennium Summit,
which attracted more than 150 heads of state and government,
concluded Friday. They outlined the priorities to fight for
development, to fight against injustice in all its forms, against
violence, and against the degradation and destruction of
environment.
</P>
<P>
"In other years this day, when you begin your general debate,
marks the climax of the United Nations calendar. This year, coming
the week after our historic Millennium Summit, it may seem
something of an anticlimax," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"Your heads of state and government have reaffirmed the central
position of this assembly as the chief deliberative, policy-
marking and representative organ of the United Nations, and have
resolved to enable it to play the role effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to you to give effect to that resolution, by taking
decisions which reflect the will of the great majority of member
states, and taking them when they are needed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to you, likewise, to achieve the comprehensive reform
of the Security Council that your heads of state and government
have called off -- a reform that will make the council more
representative and legitimate, but also more effective," he said.
</P>
<P>
African conflicts, U.N. financial crisis, disarmament,
international arms control, and U.N. peacekeeping operations are
expected to be high on the agenda of the two-week general debate,
which is scheduled to conclude on September 22.
</P>
<P>
"One of the role of the United Nations is to be the forum where
international norms are agreed and promulgated, and where all
voices can be heard -- especially those of the poor and vulnerable,
whose views and interests are too often ignored elsewhere," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Government Tries to End Road Blockade Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian government tried
Tuesday to end the road blockade throughout the country as
truckers and farmers used their vehicles as obstacles to block
access to roads leading to Brussels and to oil depots in several
cities and towns.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of truck drivers met with officials at the
Ministry of Transport for a new round of negotiations Tuesday
after the two sides failed to reach agreement on Monday. But
Transport Minister Isabelle Durant did not attend Tuesday's talks,
which were being described as "a technical meeting."
</P>
<P>
During Monday's talks, a list of complaints related to hauling
freight over the country's roads was drawn up. The government
promised the truckers that the list would be discussed at a
cabinet meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, who is expected to return home
later Tuesday from the United Nations' Millennium Summit, will
call a full cabinet meeting Friday to discuss measures to end the
nationwide road blockade crisis, which has arisen as the result of
rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's transport organization Febetra stands
firm on its position, demanding lower duty on fuel plus a
reduction in wage cost and road tax.
</P>
<P>
Febetra, which has not taken part in the protests since last
Sunday when truckers launched the road blockade, said its members
would blockade oil refineries and border crossings if the cabinet
meeting on Wednesday does not make concessions to truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
Oil companies are consulting with the government on measures to
help families with low incomes pay their heating fuel bills this
winter.
</P>
<P>
Economic Minister Charles Picque has suggested issuing special
checks, while State Secretary for Energy Olivier Deleuze is
proposing a plan for "underprivileged families" to receive 1,000
liters of heating fuel oil free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the government has to put forward a
package of measures in order to cushion the impact of high oil
prices across Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Currently, many European governments are facing social chaos
after the French government made concessions to protesters to
reduce the fuel tax, and protesters are following suit to force
their governments into accepting their terms.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Top Legislator Meets Russian Duma Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese top
legislator Li Peng met Russian State Duma Speaker Gennady
Seleznyov on Tuesday on bilateral ties and other topics of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese National
People's Congress (NPC), expressed satisfaction with the
increasingly frequent contacts between the NPC and the State Duma,
or the Russian lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader arrived here Monday on a nine-day official
visit. Besides Moscow, he will also travel to Novosibirsk and
Vladivostock.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov welcomed Li Peng and expressed his belief that the
visit will further promote bilateral ties and enhance exchanges
and cooperation between the two legislative bodies.
</P>
<P>
The speaker noted that Russia and China hold identical views on
some major international issues: both oppose hegemonism and the
practice of one country making indiscreet remarks or criticisms
about other countries.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China and Russia share many common interests and
have had fruitful cooperation in recent years in such areas as
human rights, arms control, and the reform of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Following their talks, Li and Seleznyov attended the signing
ceremony of an agreement on cooperation between the general
affairs departments of the NPC Standing Committee and the State
Duma.

national coaches have pledged their support for UEFA's campaign to
protect the transfer system, UEFA announced on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Rap Israel for Procrastination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator in
the final-status talks Ahmed Qurei, known as Abu Ala, on Tuesday
accused Israel of procrastination over the resumption of final
status talks.
</P>
<P>
Qurei, speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC),
told Voice of Palestine radio that Israel's refusal to continue the
negotiations manifested the procrastination and time-wasting policy
of the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the firm Palestinian stand regarding Jerusalem and
the Islamic and Christian sites in the holy city, stressing that
any proposals denying the Palestinian sovereignty over the Aqsa
mosque would be categorically rejected.
</P>
<P>
The gap was still wide over the key issues between the
Palestinians and Israelis, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chief Palestinian negotiator in the interim talks
Saeb Erekat said the Palestinian side was waiting for an official
Israeli response with regard to the overdue resumption of the
planned five-week negotiations between the two sides in the region.
</P>
<P>
Erekat disclosed that he had discussed with his Israeli
counterpart Oded Eran in an unidentified venue over some of the
interim issues, such as the release of another batch of Palestinian
prisoners in Israeli jails, the final Israeli troop withdrawal from
the West Bank, the Gaza harbor project and opening the northern
safe passage.
</P>
<P>
Erekat met on Sunday with Israeli negotiator to the final status
talks Gilad Sher on the agreed arrangements before resuming the
marathon talks in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), led by
Chairman Yasser Arafat, rejected the plans to merge the interim
negotiations with the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Middle East peace process was in a mess under
the Israeli detour around legitimate resolutions and the spirit of
the 1993 Madrid peace conference.
</P>
<P>
Israel failed so far to respond positively to the Palestinian
statements pertaining to the resumption of negotiations and
statehood declaration postponement initiative.
</P>
<P>
Palestine Central Council (PCC) decided Sunday to postpone the
statehood declaration, which was originally scheduled for September
13.
</P>
<P>
Israeli acting Foreign Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami said Monday the
delay in proclaiming a state was a "free decision" made by the
Palestinians, not a favor "Israel should pay for in terms of assets
of negotiations."

<HEADLINE> Hostage Drama in Bangladesh Ends Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The hostage drama in Bangladesh
's eastern Khagrachari Hill District came to an end peacefully 24
hours after it began as the gunman who made 14 high civil and
military officials, political leaders and a journalist hostage
Monday evening surrendered unconditionally, a source in the
district told Xinhua Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ashraful Makbul, Deputy Commissioner of the district said the
gunman, Abul Kalam Azad, a trader of wood in the hill tracts, held
the hostage in the Khagrachari Hill district Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Makbul said Azad entered the chamber of the deputy
commissioner with a brief case and then unlocked his brief case,
took out a revolver from it and pointed it to the deputy
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The gunman then asked the deputy commission to make calls to 34
listed civil and military officials and local political leaders of
major political parties including ruling Awami League and
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, three majors of Bangladesh Army and
police superintendent to his chamber for "an emergency meeting."
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of them, including police superintendent came and all
of them were kept captive. He claimed that he had planted
explosives including dynamite around the building.
</P>
<P>
The demands he placed, however, seemed to be disproportionate
to his commando attack, which included pay hike of police force,
ban on tobacco and restriction on burning wood in brick kilns.
</P>
<P>
After negotiation with the Divisional Commissioner, Azad at
last agreed to surrender unconditionally and was taken to Army
custody, the deputy commissioner said, adding that he was assured
of considering his demands.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Hostages Turned Over to Kin of Abu Sayyaf Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that the three Malaysian workers snatched from Pandanan
Island in Malaysia had been turned over to the first cousin of Abu
Sayyaf commander Mujib Susukan.
</P>
<P>
In a press briefing, Press Secretary and Presidential Spokesman
Ricardo Puno said the three Malaysian workers were abducted by a
group led by a certain Landasan Omar, but was later turned over to
be Commander Agga Noman, the first cousin of Susukan.
</P>
<P>
Susukan is working closely with Commander Ghalib Andang alias
Commander Robot who has been negotiating with the government for
the release of hostages abducted from Sipadan, a dive resort also
in Malaysia in April.
</P>
<P>
Commander Robot had earlier assured the government that no new
abductions will take place until the release of all the Sipadan
hostages and the two French journalists who were taken captives.
</P>
<P>
Of the 21 hostages abducted from Sipadan, only Filipino
national Roland Ullah remains in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf,
while the two French journalists were taken as hostages after
entering the camp of the Muslim group to do a news story on the
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Puno said he was informed by chief government negotiator
Secretary Robert Aventajado that Commander Robot called him to
deny any involvement in the kidnapping of the three Malaysians.
</P>
<P>
Puno said Commander Robot assured Aventajado that negotiations
for the release of Ullah and the two French journalist will still
push through, despite the kidnapping of the three new Malaysian
hostages.
</P>
<P>
The press secretary also said that Omar's group had originally
taken 16 workers from the Pasir Dive Resort, as hostages on Sunday.
However 13 of them managed to escape, leaving him with only three
captives.
</P>
<P>
He said the group entered Philippine waters and landed in
Talipao, Sulu Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the press secretary said it would be an unwise move
for the Abu Sayyaf to behead American hostage Jeffrey Schilling,
saying the group would lose its leverage and would have nothing
else to negotiate with.
</P>
<P>
Puno was reacting to reports that the Abu Sayyaf threatened to
behead Schiling, unless the government begins negotiations by
replacing Sulu Vice-Governor Munib Estino with Roland Sarmiento as
government negotiator.

<HEADLINE> Developing the West, A Long-Term Job: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
emphasized that the development of the economically backward west
China is a long-term, historic task calling for a strong sense of
urgency and the preparedness for long-term strife.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Politburo, made
the remark during his recent tour to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region from September 4-10.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, the premier visited local oilfields, railway
departments and farms of the Xinjiang Production and Construction
Corps (XPCC).
</P>
<P>
The premier praised the local people for their enthusiasm for
speeding up local development and urged people to work according
to the market law and avoid overlapping efforts, similar to what
have been experienced by other parts of the country over the past
decades.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a recent speech by President Jiang Zemin who said that
the west could make breakthroughs in local development in 5-10
years, Zhu said the goal must be reached in a step-by-step and
planned way.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to accelerate the building of
infrastructure including water conservancy, communications,
telecommunications and power facilities.
</P>
<P>
In his talks, the premier highlighted the strategic status of
Xinjiang, saying that the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council have paid great attention to the development of the
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
He urged local authorities to make a general plan for local
development according to the layout of the central leadership, so
as to turn its advantages in natural resources into economic
advantages with focus on the role of the market.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that Xinjiang could achieve breakthroughs
in infrastructure construction and environmental protection in the
coming 5-10 years. Xinjiang should concentrate its forces to
develop and utilize its abundant water resources and build a
project to transport natural gas from the region to the eastern
part of the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the XPCC farms, Zhu praised the farm workers for
their role in developing and safeguarding the border areas.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, the premier repeatedly stressed the importance
of strengthening national unity and social stability in Xinjiang,
an area inhabited by people from different ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
He called for an iron fist in cracking down separatists,
religious fundamentalists and terrorists to build the western
border region into a rock-hard stronghold.

<HEADLINE> Protection of Cultural Relics Urged in West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Wenbin, director of the
State Administration of Cultural Heritage, has urged western areas
of China to attach greater importance to the protection of
cultural relics while carrying out the government strategy of
developing the region.
</P>
<P>
The official made the call at a work conference on heritage
work in the west, which was inaugurated today in Urumqi, the
capital of the northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
China has paid great attention to the protection of local
cultural heritage, an issue that has been included in the
government development strategy for the region, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,231 cultural relics sites in the 12 western
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions have been put
under state or provincial government protection, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Among the relics are Potala Palace in Tibet and revolutionary
sites like Yan'an, where was the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China in the 30s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have adopted measures to protect these sites,
while government efforts in restoring farmland to forests and
grassland will also aid the purpose, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The official said his administration will assist some
localities in their efforts to build or rebuild local museums and
projects to set up protected zones for ethnic cultures and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The developed eastern areas are being encouraged to help the
western region in the protection of cultural heritage, he noted.

TIANJIN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 5,000 local residents in
Tianjin, a port city 120 km southeast of Beijing, gathered today
to celebrate the completion of a major environmental project to
clean up five rivulets.
</P>
<P>
The five brooks, which share a combined name of Qiangzi River,
had brought continual suffering to over 200,000 local residents
from severe pollution.
</P>
<P>
Between March 10 and September 10, some 110,000 local
volunteers comprising of officials and residents joined hands to
remove 600,000 cubic meters of mud, to shore up banks with 150,000
cubic meters of stones and to plant trees and grass in an area of
300,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The people linked the rivulets and refreshed them with water
from Haihe River, a main waterway of the city.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local residents have changed the name of the
brooks to Jinhe River.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is known for its success in upgrading living conditions

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Economy Recover From Asian Financial Turmoil: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef
Obeid said here on Tuesday that Egypt's economy is returning to
normal after being hit by the Southeast Asian financial turmoil in
the previous years and declined oil and tourism revenues.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international economic symposium, Obeid said
Egypt's emerging market economy is back on track this year and the
country will forge ahead with the privatization of state-run firms,
including Egypt Telecom and electricity distribution.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product is expected to grow at 5.5 percent
this year, he said, adding that the inflation rate is projected at
2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said in the last year the non-oil exports increased by 23
percent and imports declined by 9.7 percent, effectively reducing
Egypt's billions of U.S. dollars of trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Tourism and oil, two of the country's four main hard currency
earners, are now increasing following a period of decline, the
prime minister added.
</P>
<P>
Obeid said that new laws aimed at drawing investment, including
laws on mortgage, capital markets, and intellectual property
rights, would be submitted to parliament shortly.
</P>
<P>
He pledged a stable currency following a recent adjustment.
Egypt has allowed the Egyptian pound to drop about 5 percent
against the U.S. dollar over the past three months in a bid to ease
a year-long liquidity crisis affecting both the dollar and the
pound.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have been reluctant to invest in Egypt in fear
that the Egyptian pound would be devalued against the dollar. Some
analysts expect further devaluation.
</P>
<P>
But as the foreign exchange receipts increase due to continued
growth of tourism in the past two years, and the deficits in trade
and current account decrease, Egypt's monetary situation will soon
improve.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Urges Local Governments to Cut Levies on Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Reducing the financial
burdens on Chinese farmers is an imperative government task,said
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao here today.
</P>
<P>
Wen made the remark at a teleconference on reducing the
financial load on farmers. A report was delivered to the meeting
about major incidents concerning the financial load on farmers in
the second half of 1999 and the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who is concurrently a member of both the Political Bureau
and Secretariat of the Communist Party of China Central Committee,
urged local Party committees and governments at different levels
to see the significance of the issue by taking into political and
overall considerations.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the countryside is generally sound, though,
there are some problems that must not be ignored, such as the
difficulty for farmers to increase their incomes, excessive levies
by local governments, simple and rough style of work of local
officials which have resulted in a series of violent incidents in
some areas, according to the vice premier.
</P>
<P>
The key to cutting farmers' financial burdens is to carry out
the central government policies on rural taxation, with the
average levy not surpassing five percent of the total annual
income of the farmers and the budgetary figure of 1997, he noted.
</P>
<P>
All the extra charges by local authorities must be waived and
returned to the farmers, Wen said. Local governments must not levy
illegal taxes on farmers in any form, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also talked about the reduction of taxes on farmers in
disaster-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that to reduce the financial load on
farmers, the taxation system must be reformed, by streamlining
relations on distribution between the state, the collective and
the individual.
</P>
<P>
Local officials should be taught to improve their awareness
about central government policies and the law, which is a
guarantee for reducing the farmers' burdens, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The majority of Chinese farmers are not wealthy, he said. "We
must give more to farmers and take less from them," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local officials to learn how to deal with
confrontation in the countryside under new circumstances. Leading
local officials must go to the site whenever a major incident
involving groups of farmers occurs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Gang, director of the General Office of the CPC Central
Committee, presided over the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The intermediate court of
Chengdu, the capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, today
sentenced a local official to death for accepting bribes and
possessing huge properties without a known source for the money.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Daofang, a former deputy director of the communications
bureau of the provincial government, was also deprived of his own
properties and political rights for life.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court sentenced his wife, Gao Jialan, and his
son, Zheng Qin, to 15 years and 12 years in prison, respectively,
on charges of taking bribes. The two also had their own properties
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The court ruled to confiscate the detained and frozen assets of
the couple worth of 8,129,252.66 yuan, 84,591 US dollars, and 45,
080 HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
The former official accepted the bribes in collaboration with
his two family members, when he was holding a number of leading
positions responsible for building expressways across the province
between 1994 and April this year, according to the court.
</P>
<P>
On April 18, local public prosecutors searched the office of
the former official and the residences of the couple and their son
to find and confiscate the huge amounts of local and foreign
currencies.
</P>
<P>
The former official has failed to prove the source of 4,811,906.
41 yuan and 45,000 HK dollars the prosecutors found in his
possession.
</P>
<P>
The former official was to take most responsibility for the
crimes, while his two family members received lighter charges for
their lesser role in the case. His son was given less time in
prison for confessing all the crimes he committed and also for
exposing others', the court said.
</P>
<P>
All the three defendants have objections to the sentencing and
said they will appeal against the rulings.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese PM Leaves Beirut for U.N. General Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Salim Hoss left
for New York on Tuesday, heading Lebanon's delegation to the 55th
session of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He is due to address the General Assembly on Thursday in a
speech which is expected to focus on Lebanon's reservations
regarding a number of border points set up in the wake of the
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement before he left the Beirut Airport that he

will raise Lebanon's demand to restore its sovereignty over the
Shebaa Farms, a point contested by Israel.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that other key points include Lebanon's
refusal to resettle Palestinian refugees on its territory and its
call on the international community to recognize the refugees'
right to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
There are about 360,000 registered Palestinian refugees in
Lebanon, whom the Lebanese government refuses to resettle or
nationalize.
</P>
<P>
"We will also urge the international community to exert pressure
on Israel to release all Lebanese detainees still held in its
jails," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel detains about 20 Lebanese prisoners in its jail. The
Israeli
government wants to exchange the detainees for the missing Israeli
airman Ron Arad or his fate.
</P>
<P>
Hoss' talks with other leaders on the sidelines of the General
Assembly session are also expected to cover the need to convene a
promised conference of donor countries in Beirut during the first
week of October, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Hoss discussed a number of issues with ministers and senior
government officials on the eve of his departure.

<HEADLINE> Change in Israeli Public Opinion on Jerusalem Favorable to Peace Deal: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli public opinion on
Jerusalem has changed dramatically which indicates the public's
readiness for a final peace accord with the Palestinians, a recent
survey ordered by the Israeli Peace Now movement showed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey conducted by the Smith Institute, a long-established
polling company in Israel, last week among 501 adult Jewish
respondents revealed that a clear majority, or 55 percent of those
polled, understands that the resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict hinges on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, 73 percent of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's
voters are prepared to make far-reaching concessions over
Jerusalem's Arab neighborhoods while 59 percent are ready for that
regarding the Arab sections in Jerusalem's Old City, even without
any reference in the question to the Palestinians' agreeing to an
end of the conflict as a condition.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 27 percent of the public and 47
percent of Barak voters is willing to accept absolute Palestinian
sovereignty on the Temple Mount, a holy site inside the Old City
which is most sacred in Judaism and also home to Islamic shrines,
even without reference in the question to the Palestinian agreement
to an end of conflict.
</P>
<P>
Professor Arie Arnon from Peace Now, the largest peace
organization in Israel, said that the public opinion in Israel is
ready for a final peace accord, even regarding the most difficult
of issues.
</P>
<P>
Arnon, who took note of the fact that Arab-Israeli voters were
not included in the survey, said that if Barak and Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat succeed in reaching an
agreement on Jerusalem, there are significant signs that the
Israeli public will support it.
</P>
<P>
Barak has said that any peace deal that he signs with the
Palestinians will be put to the national referendum.
</P>
<P>
According to Sharm el-Sheikh memorandum signed by Israel and the
Palestinians last year, the two sides are to sign a permanent peace
deal by September 13, 2000 concerning the final status issues such
as the status of Jerusalem, border, water resources, the future of
Jewish
settlers and refugees.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, however, have been stalled since the July Camp
David summit due to the wide gaps between the two sides' positions
on the core issues, particularly the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Central Council of the Palestinian Liberation Organization
decided on Sunday to postpone the declaration of an independent
state as east Jerusalem as its capital which was originally set for
Wednesday so as to give the peace talks a few more weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Peace Now movement has been calling on the Israelis
and Palestinians to share Jerusalem as their joint capitals.
</P>
<P>
To mark the date originally set for the Palestinians'
proclamation of statehood, Peace Now activists will march in
Jerusalem on Wednesday under the slogan: IN JERUSALEM THE CONFLICT
WILL COME TO AN END -- ONE CITY-TWO CAPITALS, calling on Barak and
Arafat not to give up their peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Stresses Strategic Partnership With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top legislator Li Peng
said here Tuesday that promoting a strategic partnership of
cooperation with Russia is China's established policy, and such a
policy will not be altered whatever happens in the world.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of China's National
People's Congress, made the remark during a meeting with Yegor
Stroyev, chairman of Russia's Federation Council, or upper house
of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev said Moscow highly values its relations with China, and
Russian President Vladimir Putin's successful trip to China was a
manifestation of the continued development of the bilateral
strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Monday on a nine-day official visit to Russia.
Besides Moscow, he will also travel to Novosibirsk and
Vladivostock.
</P>
<P>
He said China and Russia hold identical or similar views on
many issues; both share the view that the world is facing the
trends of multi-polarization and economic globalization; and both
countries believe that all states have the right to choose their
own road of development and to live in accordance with their own
ways.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said that Putin's recent visit to China
breathed new life into their bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev extended a warm welcome to Li on his visit. He said the
Russian Federation Council and China's NPC have had frequent
contacts; Federation Council delegations have visited China many
times, and during each of the visits, the Russian delegates
experienced profound affection toward Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should work together to fight against extreme
nationalism and maintain stability, Stroyev said, adding that
Russia needs to take China's experiences as a reference in its
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Following the talks between Li and Stroyev, the two sides
signed an agreement on cooperation between the general affairs
departments of the NPC and the Federation Council.

<P>
JINAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Officials in the eastern
coastal province of Shandong confirmed today that two large local
electronics producers are negotiating on a merger, which, if
successful, would become the country's largest electronic products
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
A local official, who declined to give his name, said the
Qingdao-based Hisense Group and the Jinan-based Langchao
Electronic Information Industrial Group. Co. have been discussing
the details for the merger for nearly one year.
</P>
<P>
The merger will enable the new company to dwarf the Beijing-
based Legend Group, China's largest computer developer, and the
Sichuan-based Changhong Group, the largest electrical household
appliances producer, becoming the leading electronics producer
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Hisense, established in 1994, mainly produces TVs, air
conditioners, computers and software. It ranked among China's top
ten electronics manufacturers with a sales volume of 10.7 billion
yuan (about 1.28 billion U.S. dollars) in 1999.

<P>
Langchao is so far the largest server producer in the country.
It reported a sales volume of nearly four billion yuan last year,
ranking 22nd among the country's electronics companies.

<HEADLINE> PLA Mental Illness Control Center Set Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) today established a mental illness
prevention and control center at the No. 102 Hospital of the PLA
Nanjing Military Area Command.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as a move by the Chinese army to carry out its
mental health work in a scientific manner, according army sources.
</P>
<P>
The No. 102 Hospital has made remarkable progress in the
research and application of psychology among PLA officers and men.
A series of research projects have been completed by its research
fellows, including over 20 tools for studying the psychological
conditions of servicemen.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, military psychologists have helped create
greater awareness about mental health wellness among PLA officers
and soldiers, so as to increase their psychological endurance.
</P>
<P>
The hospital has published the Manual on Mental Health for
Servicemen and 250 Questions and Answers on Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
The hospital's experts have held over 120 lectures on the
subject, provided therapy for more than 50,000 servicemen, trained
almost 300 part-time psychologists for grass-roots army units, and
set up a three-level mental illness prevention and control network
in the Nanjing Military Area Command.

<HEADLINE> Self-Taught Graduates to Have Their Graduation Certificates Put on Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Office for Home Education
of the Ministry of Education will place on the Internet the
certificates of graduates who have passed a national examination
for self-taught students.
</P>
<P>
This action has been taken for the convenience of employers who
want to prove the authenticity of the educational background of
self-taught students, an official from the office said here today.
</P>
<P>
It will be blow to those who have been profiteering from
manufacturing and selling counterfeit graduation certificates and
should curb this booming underground business in many Chinese
cities, including the national capital of Beijing, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1981, China launched a national examination system for the
large number of self-taught students, and since then, over two
million students have passed the exams and received certificates
to prove their university-level home education.
</P>
<P>
In addition to a series of regulations that govern the
examination system for self-taught students, the ministry has also
developed a system to manage the certificates of these graduates.
The system will be adopted in over 20 provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions by 2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian industrial
production continued to fall to 4.3 percent in July as against 6.2

the industrial growth during the first four months April-July of
the current fiscal also dipped to 5.4 percent as against 5.9

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Govt. to Punish School Funds Misusers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Education Ministry
has pledged stern action against headmasters who traveled to South
Africa last month if they spent school funds without authority.
</P>
<P>
Education Assistant Minister Moody Awori on Monday expressed
his shock over the expense of 13 million shillings (about 180,000
U.S. dollars) spent by 130 teachers in the 10-day trip, Kenya's
major newspaper East African Standard reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Awori said the ministry hoped that the teachers had financed
their own trip and that they had not "dipped their hands into
school funds".
</P>
<P>
"We will definitely take action if we establish that parents'
money has been badly spent by the headmasters," he told reporters
in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Awori, however, said that the Parents and Teachers Association
operate autonomously and may have authorized the teachers to
withdraw the funds.
</P>
<P>
"If we find that they authorized the expenditure, there is
little we can do," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The press here on Monday exposed the scandal, provoking outrage
among education officials and parents. It was reported that some
teachers who traveled to Johannesburg were from schools steeped in
debts.
</P>
<P>
Awori said that the ministry will investigate the circumstances
of the trip and look into "extenuating factors" that led to the
withdrawal of school funds.

</P>
<P>
The relief aid to Kasese district was targeting eight sub-
counties worst affected by the ADF insurgency, Julius said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second disbursement of relief aid to war-torn
western Uganda this year. The first relief aid of 12,000 kits to
the districts was in April and May.

<HEADLINE> British PM Holds Emergency Talks on Fuel Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair has canceled a regional tour of Yorkshire and returned to
London for emergency meetings with ministers to discuss the
deepening fuel crisis.
</P>
<P>
A Downing Street spokesman said Blair's decision followed a
series of phone calls by the prime minister from his hotel in
Sheffield late Monday night and early this morning.
</P>
<P>
Late on Monday, the Privy Council and the Queen approved the
use by the government of emergency powers to ensure the flow of
fuel to schools and public transport.
</P>
<P>
Blair will discuss the possibility of invoking these
contingency measures, including the possible use of troops, at the
emergency meeting.
</P>
<P>
As the blockades entered their sixth day as many as 3000 petrol
stations were closed and the whole country began to feel the
pressure, many ambulances and fire crews have been put on
emergency only duties.
</P>
<P>
Public transport also began to feel the effects of the crisis
Tuesday as South West Trains curtailed its London Waterloo to
Paignton, south Devon service and its service from Brighton to
Reading service.
</P>
<P>
The protesters have vowed to continue their campaign until the
government acts. A spokesman said: "Tony Blair has made a gross
mistake and has grossly underestimated the will of the country."
</P>
<P>
"He had the power to call an emergency Cabinet meeting today to
put pen to paper and put a stop to this. Will we back down? Never,
" the spokesman added.

<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Sun Yuxi said today that China hopes to promote the long-
term and stable development of the China-EU constructive
partnership based on mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit
and seeking common ground while reserving differences.
</P>
<P>
Sun made the remarks in reply to a question concerning the
report released by the EU Commission, in which EU stood for
strengthening dialog and cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that the EU Commission published such a report,
reviewing and assessing China-EU relations and their cooperation
in various fields and putting forth some proposals," he said,
adding that China welcomes this.
</P>
<P>
China-EU relations have shown good momentum in recent years

he said.

<HEADLINE> China Protects Teachers' Legal Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China has formed laws to
protect teachers' legal rights since the country adopted the
policy of reform and opening to the outside world, the Ministry of
Education said today.
</P>
<P>
With the enactment of the Compulsory Education Law in 1986, the
Education Law in 1995, the Vocational Education Law in 1996 and
the Higher Education Law in 1998, China began to build up a legal
system to protect teachers' rights.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 Teachers Law for the first time thoroughly regulated
the rights, obligation, competency, training, examination and
treatment of teachers.
</P>
<P>
In further years, China will continue to issue a series of
regulations on the management and qualification of more than ten
million teachers in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to make a nationwide
investigation into research and development (R&AMP;D) resources in the
first five months of 2001.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Ministry of Science and
Technology, China's largest-scaled scientific and technological
resource review since 1985 will be jointly sponsored by the
ministry and six other government departments.
</P>
<P>
All personnel engaged in scientific and technological research
activities in research institutions, enterprises, universities and
other trades will be covered in the study, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The survey is in preparation for the drafting of the country's
10th five-year scientific and technological development plan for
2001-2005, meeting policy-making requirements of the central and
local governments.
</P>
<P>
China's total R&AMP;D investment and human resources at the end of
the 9th five-year plan period, which ends this year, will be the
focus of the review.
</P>
<P>
Distribution of the country's scientific research forces,
especially those in enterprises, will also be a major part of the
work, and information gathered will be used to build the national
technological innovation system.
</P>
<P>
The review is scheduled to begin soon, and results will be
announced next September.

<HEADLINE> China to Study Young People's Creativity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A survey was launched today
as part of China's educational reform to study the creative
ability of Chinese youngsters.
</P>
<P>
The survey, jointly sponsored by the Ministry of Education, the
Chinese Communist Youth League Central Committee, and the China
Association for Science and Technology, will be conducted among 11,
800 students in universities and high schools through
questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
The survey was first held last year and has drawn wide
attention from education-related government organizations and
society. A report on last year's investigation and proposed
countermeasures was published today.
</P>
<P>
The report shows that only 14.9 percent of the questioned
Chinese youth believe they have creative ability. Chinese families,
schools and society as a whole that have neglected the development
of young people's creativity should make a change as soon as
possible, it suggests.
</P>
<P>
The survey also indicates that 60 percent of the youngsters
recognize the importance of creativity and 65.3 percent have
curiosity about the world around them.
</P>
<P>
Education experts say an environment that fosters creativity
among young people can be formed with the combined efforts of
families, schools and society.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be conducted every two years to offer
theoretical and practical experience for the education and science
popularization in China, said Ma Kangmei, one of the experts
conducting the survey.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Meet on Fighting Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 heads of provincial-
level procuratorates and anti-bribery bureaus gathered here today
to inaugurate the four-day fifth national conference on battling
bribery.
</P>
<P>
The anti-corruption officials are expected to study ways to
increase efforts in building up the anti-bribery policies and
improve their ability to detect cases.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, when the first such meeting was held, more than 277,
000 bribery cases have been uncovered across the country, with
over 13,000 officials at the county level and above and over 57,
000 officials at lower levels prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
The public prosecutors have helped the government recover
financial losses exceeding 22.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, procuratorates at all levels have
worked diligently to build up a professional team of prosecutors
with their quality much improved as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Under the new situation, the procuratorates are facing new
phenomena and it is more difficult for them to deal with
corruption cases.
</P>
<P>
Some cases have involved a large number of people from
different parts of the country or overseas, making it necessary
for the procuratorates to contact other departments for help in
handling the cases.

<HEADLINE> Tian Jiyun Calls for Further Ideological Emancipation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Tian Jiyun, a vice-chairman
of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, has
called for further ideological emancipation and boldness in
creation for achieving development by reform and realizing
stability through development.
</P>
<P>
He urged adherence to Deng Xiaoping Theory and the leadership
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee with Jiang
Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Tian made the remarks during a trip to east China's Zhejiang
Province from September 9-12. He visited a number of private
businesses and schools in Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing
cities, accompanied by the provincial Party chief Zhang Dejiang
and Governor Chai Songyue.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with local officials, Tian spoke highly of the
social and economic achievements made by Zhejiang over the past
two decades. Local people have abandoned the planned economy and
adjusted to develop an economy that allows for the development of
different types of ownership.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang, though lacking in natural resources, has developed
into a big economy, one of the leading provinces in terms of gross
domestic product, foreign trade, revenue and the income of rural
and urban residents, according to Tian.
</P>
<P>
Tian said that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh
CPC Central Committee in 1978, Chinese cities and the countryside
have experienced earth-shattering changes.
</P>
<P>
"Every major reform we have undertaken is a result of adhering
to Deng Xiaoping Theory, ideological emancipation, and being bold
in practicing," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Proposes Ways to Strengthen FPDA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has proposed ways
to strengthen the Five Power Defense Arrangements (FPDA) with more
joint and combined exercises.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Second Defense Minister Teo Chee Hean put forward the
proposals while delivering his opening address at the FPDA Joint
Air Defense Seminar here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Teo said that the most significant development this year is the
defense ministers' agreement that FPDA exercises become more joint
and combined in future.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this end, Teo said, one way is to adopt a "building
block" approach so that units and sub-units achieve a high level
of individual proficiency before any joint and combined operations
can be undertaken.
</P>
<P>
Teo said that this is necessary from both the safety and the
operational viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
He added that common procedures and doctrines will have to be
developed.
</P>
<P>
As operations become more complex, he said, command and control
will also need to be improved.
</P>
<P>
However, Teo stressed that while the FPDA members emphasize
joint and combined exercises, they should not forget the pivotal
importance of air defense in the conduct of operations.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the last 30 years, a strong air defense
system has provided Singapore and Malaysia with a credible
deterrence.
</P>
<P>
About 200 participants from the five FPDA countries-- Australia,
Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and United Kingdom-- are
attending the two-day seminar.
</P>
<P>
The seminar aims to enhance cooperation and coordination among
the member nations' armed forces and the level of professionalism
among FPDA forces.

Nusa Tenggara on Monday, the suspects in Moruk's murder were
henchmen of a local criminal gang leader Aloysius Bere, who was
delivered by Moruk to the police after he attempted to extort
money from Moruk's driver.
</P>
<P>
Bere's men killed Moruk in revenge for having handed their
leader over to the police, Tobing said.
</P>
<P>
A total of eight people, including Moruk and three staff
members of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (
UNHCR), had been killed in the violence in and around Atambua, a
city in East Nusa Tenggara province, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three staff members of the UNHCR were killed when an angry
mob of pro-Jakarta East Timorese or so-called militia launched an
armed attack on the representative office of the UNHCR in Atambua.
</P>
<P>
Four local people were burned to death in their homes and two
others seriously injured after Moruk's supporters set fire to
around 67 houses in Lorotulus village near Atambua.
</P>
<P>
Rusdihardjo further said that the locals have also been
searching for five people allegedly involved in the torching of
the UNHCR office.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Police will send four companies to East Nusa
Tenggara to handle the situation in Atambua.
</P>
<P>
"One company has already been sent this morning," he added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Soccer Head Coach Undecided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- With only one month left to
go to the 2000 Asian Cup in Lebanon, the Soccer Association of
Indonesia (PSSI) remained tight-lipped on the fate of national
coach Nandar Iskandar.
</P>
<P>
PSSI Secretary General Tri Goestoro said he was still unsure as
to whether the association would take the opportunity of replacing
Nandar with Dutchman Henk Wullems.
</P>
<P>
He also brushed aside media reports saying that Nandar would
ask to resign from his post as head coach should PSSI insist on
including Wullems in the national squad.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of resignation. Nandar is still the
national team's head coach. We are still unsure if we will discuss
this matter with other PSSI officials as it is really difficult to
organize an internal plenary meeting right now," he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nandar, who has been preparing the team for the championships
which run from October 12 through 29, was not available for
comment as he failed to show up for the first training session on
Monday at the Senayan soccer ground. The training session was led
by assistant coach Dananjaya.
</P>
<P>
The news on Nandar's replacement emerged after Indonesia
managed to win the Independence Cup two weeks ago, beating Iraq 3-
0 in the final.
</P>
<P>
The national team director Muhammad Zein said after attending
the final on September 3 that Wullems was expected to join the
national team as a technical advisor and would start on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Zein indicated that it was Nurdin Halid, the PSSI official in
charge of athletes development, who recommended Wullems to
chairman Agum Gumelar.
</P>
<P>
Wullems' latest success was to lead PSM club, owned by Halid,
to win the Bank Mandiri national soccer league in July. The
Dutchman also helped the national team win the 1997 Southeast
Asian Games silver.

<HEADLINE> Quality Over Quantity: Priority for Attracting Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Investment analysts to the
Fourth China Fair for Investment and Trade, which closed here
today, said China will pursue a quality-over-quantity approach in
attracting foreign funding.
</P>
<P>
During the fair held in east China's Xiamen city, one of China'
s five special economic zones, State Councilor Wu Yi told
participants that China is entering another phase in absorbing
foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
And Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said China is trying to induce foreign capital to the
mid-west regions, to industries of technological development,
mechanical and electronic parts, and to the reform of State-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government decided early this year to open sectors
including finance, insurance, stocks, telecommunications, tourism
to foreign investment, so it's likely that more foreign capital
will be injected into agriculture, infrastructure, energy,
environmental protection and other service industries.
</P>
<P>
All these, analysts said, have reflected that China is
introducing a new "quality counts" philosophy in attracting
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Taking this into consideration, analysts pointed out that China
will be more selective in attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The availability of cheap labor and raw materials will no
longer be as important as they used to be in deciding projects for
foreign cooperation, they said.
</P>
<P>
Instead, China hopes to bring in foreign capital to some pillar
industries that will sustain the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, referred to the change as "a change of thought,"
which brings the absorption of foreign funding into the orbit of
globalization.
</P>
<P>
In another development, China is making efforts to gain an
advantage in absorbing funds, as experts have suggested that the
low competitive ability of Chinese enterprises has prevented
themselves from attracting foreign partners.
</P>
<P>
China has adopted new methods in attracting foreign funding,
including stocks, bonds, and BOT items.
</P>
<P>
As for industries that will face toughest challenges after
China's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO), like
information technology, engineering, and petro-chemicals, China
has established a number of groups of global competitive ability,
which are expected to be in a better position to absorb foreign
funds.
</P>
<P>
China has also encouraged potential companies to go public
abroad in search of investment.
</P>
<P>
For the past seven years, China has taken in the largest amount
of foreign capital among developing countries.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urged to Correctly Understand History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China today urged Japan to
correctly understand history, and not to repeat the past.
</P>
<P>
The remark came from Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun
Yuxi who was asked to comment a report that some Japanese
publishing houses recently submitted the proposed version of the
2002 history textbook, which whitewashes the history of Japan's
invasion of Asian countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that the international community has come to the
proper conclusion about the history of World War II, adding that
the Nanjing Massacre, the conscription of comfort women and the
establishment of the No. 731 troop were heinous crimes committed
by the Japanese military.
</P>
<P>
"These historic facts can not be weakened or forgotten by
revamping textbooks," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the heart of the textbook issue is whether Japan can
sincerely and correctly understand and deal with its history of
aggression, so as to genuinely draw on lessons from it and not to
return to the past, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has repeatedly made clear its stance, and the
Japanese side said that it would properly deal with the matter,
the spokesman said, adding that "We hope Japan will honor its
commitments by taking concrete actions."

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Expands Investigation Into Export Fraud Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish police has expanded
the investigation into a big export fraud case, a scandal of
fictitious exports worth 22 million U.S. dollars and fake receipts
worth 35 million dollars, Turkish Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly uncovered fake export documents and
receipts, the two illegal gains have reached 80 million dollars and
350 million dollars respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
So far 55 suspects have been taken into custody due to
involvement in the case, mainly civil servants working in the
Customs Directorate and accountants. Among them was accountant
Serif Sener, a nephew of former President Suleyman Demirel's wife.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, codenamed Operation Whale, has found that the
fictitious exports taking place in the western province of Izmir
were made by the Yeser, Guncteks and Ege Adonis textile companies
allegely to countries such as Hungary, Germany, Tunisia, Poland,
Romania, Russia, Italy and Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, those textile companies were not paid
by companies abroad actually. The fake receipts were issued by Koc
Nakis A.S., the Ekip, Begum, Goknil, Sezginsoy and Varim textile
companies based in Istanbul and southern Adana.
</P>
<P>
The police said that these companies were set up specifically to
issue fake receipts for the companies to commit fictitious exports.
</P>
<P>
Last month at a news conference, the Izmir Police Chief Hasan
Yucesan said that "not a single penny has arrived in Turkey from
the exporters of these goods. There has been no shipment. It's a
hoax."

<HEADLINE> Jordanian MPs to Petition Against Underground Water Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-four deputies from the
80-member Jordanian House of Representatives (lower house) are
mapping out a petition against rampant underground water abuses by
private well owners, parliament sources said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The petition, expected to be submitted to lower house Speaker
Abdul Hadi Majali to pass over to the government next week,
appealed to the water authorities to control illicit exploitation
of wells and ration the use of privately-owned wells to end years
of depleting of the kingdom's strategic reserve of underground
water.
</P>
<P>
Among the 510 million cubic meters of water pumped from private
and public wells each year, only 275 million cubic meters are taken
within safe parameters, according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
The government allows private land owners to pump water from
wells for farming and domestic purposes in areas which have no
access to municipal water supplies, but water meters must be
installed to make sure that the 50,000-ton quota for each well is
not surpassed.
</P>
<P>
However, over pumping remained unabated in the kingdom as meters
at licensed private wells are often reset illegally or broken on
purpose, while 528 of the 1,654 private wells are not licensed at
all and had no meter readers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The desert kingdom mainly depends on rainfalls and surface water
resources for home, industrial and agricultural purposes, but its
underground waters are often over-pumped during the dry seasons in
summer.

<HEADLINE> No PM Can Give Palestinians Sovereignty Over Temple Mount: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Temple Mount in East
Jerusalem is Israel's anchor and no Israeli prime minister could
ever give the Palestinians sovereignty over it, Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are connected to Jerusalem in a very deep way," Barak told
the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic holy sites, the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of Rock,
as well as the Jewish holy site of the Western Wall are all located
on the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
Barak did not say how to solve the Temple Mount issue, which is
the stumbling block hindering the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks,
but said there is still a 50-50 chance of reaching a peace
agreement with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
He refused to give his deadline for reaching such an agreement,
saying he does not "live with a timer in his hand."
</P>
<P>
He said he is waiting to see whether there is a partner for
peace before he establishes a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
"If an agreement is reached with the Palestinians, I will allow
the Israeli people to make their choice in a state referendum," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, his office denied reports that he is ready
to compromise over the sovereignty on the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Ha'aretz reported on Tuesday that Israel is not
ruling out the possibility of acceding to a proposal by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to place sovereignty over the Temple Mount in
the hands of a body consisting of the permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council and the Jerusalem Committee of the
Islamic organization Conference.

<HEADLINE> Sharon Urges Barak to Set Date for Early Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel's opposition Likud
party leader Ariel Sharon on Tuesday called on Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to fix a date for new elections.
</P>
<P>
"I no longer believe a word that the prime minister says...and
every day passes, Barak causes more serious trouble to the
country," Sharon told the Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said new elections will be the only way to
end the political crisis that Barak is facing.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the July Camp David summit, all the ultra-Orthodox
parties such as Shas and National Religious Party left Barak's
coalition, leaving the government to be a minority one in the 120-
member Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Sharon again denied that there were talks for Likud to join a
national unity government.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no proposal for us to join the government. We
will not join a government that has made so many big mistakes...I
will form the next government and then we can ask Labor to join a
coalition," Sharon added.
</P>
<P>
Barak said earlier in the day that as long as there are talks
with the Palestinians, it will not be right to call on Likud to
join in the government.
</P>
<P>
If the Palestinians prove that they are not ready for an
agreement, then he will ask One Israel's "natural partners" to join
the coalition, and then Likud, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak has to form his new coalition government before October 30
when the Knesset resumes its winter session.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, it will be very difficult for him to push the 2001
state budget through the Knesset, repulse a no-confidence vote and
kill the early elections bill submitted by Likud.

<HEADLINE> Official: Indonesian Rupiah to Regain Strength </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian currency of
rupiah is expected to regain strength within this year and stand
at the level between 7,500 and 8,000 per U.S. dollar, a senior
official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Rizal Ramli
expressed his optimism about the rupiah "as the economic recovery
has been working well."
</P>
<P>
"Well, at the moment, the rupiah is still fluctuating due to
regional sentiment. But we are not worried at all. And we are
optimistic it will regain strength and we are sure that the
currency will stand at the level between 7,500 and 8,000 per
dollar, at the end of this year," Ramli told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The government set the exchange rate of rupiah within the
current fiscal year at 7,500 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
But on Tuesday's trade session, the currency traded at 8,400 (
buying) and 8,550 (selling) per U.S. dollar, lower than Monday's
trade session with 8,325 (buying) and 8,450 (selling) per U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ramli added that the government will hammer out a plan to
stabilize the financial sector, saying the economic team was also
optimistic about the monetary targets in the next fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
"We have been successful in drafting the budget for the fiscal
year 2001. All has been based on conservative assumptions," he
said, adding the economic growth in the next fiscal year is
expected to reach 4 to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that the budget deficit within the next fiscal
year will be 3.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product (
GDP) or lower than the current deficit (which reaches 4.8 percent
of the GDP)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the budget draft for the fiscal year 2001, the government
assumed that the country's economic growth was envisaged to reach
4-5 percent while the rupiah was targeted to stand at 6,800 to 7,
800 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
However Rizal Ramli admitted many parties at home were
pessimistic over the recovery process. "I see some parties here
are pessimistic in connection with the government's policies to
deal with the crisis. But we will move forward," he said, adding
the government will provide funds to boost small and medium scale
industries in a bid to speed up the recovery process.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government
has exempted 156 computer parts from customs duty in order to
promote the information technology, reported the Associated Press
of Pakistan (APP) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sources were quoted as saying the step has been taken to make
the computer hardware affordable to individuals and institutions.
"The whole country in fact has been turned into an export
processing zone to boost the software exports," the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology is negotiating with the
Central Board of Revenue to give exemption to remaining computer
parts, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The prices of personal computers are too high in Pakistan and
the government intends to bring them down to less than 9,000
rupees (167 U.S. dollars) through bulk purchase for schools and
educational institutions and also through local manufacturing,
according to APP.
</P>
<P>
State Bank of Pakistan has also directed the banks to consider
Pakistani firms' contracts for software exports with foreign firms
as collateral for the purposes of loans.
</P>
<P>
Boasting similar human resources with India proficient at
English, Pakistan looks forward to boosting its economy also
through enhancing software exports.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urges UNTAET to Deal With East Timor Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
here Tuesday urged the United Nations Transitional Administration
in East Timor (UNTAET) to soon complete its duties to form a
government in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the U.N. body to soon settle the problems now
being faced by East Timorese after the territory voted in favor of
independence in August a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"As the transitional government in East Timor, the UNTAET
should take necessary measures to deal with the problems outpoured
in East Timor. The United Nations should take steps for the
establishment of East Timorese government," Minister of Justice
and Human Right Affairs, Yusril Ihza Mahendra told reporters at
the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra regretted the U.N. failure in dealing with the East
Timorese problems.
</P>
<P>
"Now all the burden of East Timorese seems to be put on the
shoulder of the Indonesian government. That is not fair, of course.
We have no interests any more, with East Timor as the territory
has separated from the unitary state of Indonesia. East Timor now
has become the United Nations business," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But for more than a year, there is no significant achievement
made by the UNTAET in East Timor to deal with the problems there.
This causes difficulties for the Indonesian government to work out
a good relation with East Timor," he said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor separated from the unitary state of Indonesia after
23 years of integration. The territory overwhelmingly voted in
favor of independence through a U.N.-sponsored direct ballot in
August 1999.
</P>
<P>
The territory now has been put under the U.N. transitional
administration.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the East Timorese government will be established
soon," Mahendra said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in connection with "the Atambua (a city of East Nusa
Tenggara province, Indonesia) incident" during which at least
three staff members of the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) were killed by pro-Jakarta East Timorese militias,
Mahendra said that the Indonesian government was not responsible
for the incident.
</P>
<P>
The incident has triggered mounting critics and condemnations
from the international community. The U.N. issued a resolution to
push the Indonesian government to launch comprehensive
investigation into the incident.

<HEADLINE> UAE Newspaper Hails Palestinian Postponement of Statehood Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A major Arabic daily of the
United Arab Emirates on Tuesday hailed the decision by the
Palestinian Central Council (PCC) to delay the declaration of
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based "Al Bayan" indicated that the decision provided
another chance for an effort to break the deadlock "caused by
Israeli intransigence and clear American bias."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian decision has kept the door open and has made
strong the possibility of reaching a compromise on the final-status
negotiations between the Palestinians and the Israelis," the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the decision had thrown the ball in the court of
the Israelis and proven to the world the Palestinians' full
commitment to peace and their determination to reclaim all their
rights.
</P>
<P>
The paper called on the United States to play its role as a fair
broker by pressing the Israelis to "bow down for peace" instead
of "taking sides with all the intransigent stands of the Jewish
entity."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian decision needs a bold Palestinian stand against
the Israeli intransigence. Arab countries should therefore throw
their weight behind that decision so as to win a just and honorable
deal for the Palestinians who, for so long, have been deprived of
their legitimate rights," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The PCC decided on Sunday in Gaza City to postpone the statehood
declaration, saying it will meet again before November 15 to decide
when to declare an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The PCC also authorized the Executive Committee of the Palestine
Liberation Organization to tackle all the statehood-related issues,
while several committees have been set up to prepare legal papers,
including drafting the constitution, for the establishment of the
independent state.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Paper Holds Western Countries Responsible for High Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian newspaper on Tuesday
held Western countries responsible for the soaring oil prices in
the world market, and urged the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) not to raise oil output under Western pressure.
</P>
<P>
Western countries as well as their oil giants are more to be
blamed for the soaring oil prices than the OPEC member states,
commented the English-language daily Tehran Times.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that Western countries impose heavy taxes and
duties on the imported crude, thus forcing the consumers in these
countries to buy fuel at almost twice the price set by oil
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of OPEC members agreed on Sunday to increase
output by 800,000 barrels per day, lifting their daily output
ceiling from the original 25.4 million barrels to 26.2 million
barrels.
</P>
<P>
Following the agreement, an Iranian Oil Ministry official
announced Monday that Iran will increase its oil output to 3.884
million barrels per day as of October 1 to meet its new quota
within OPEC. Iran is the second largest OPEC oil producer after
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Tehran Times pointed out in its comment that it is the third
time since March that OPEC has decided to pump more oil into the
market under Western pressure.
</P>
<P>
It stressed, however, that as long as crude oil is heavily taxed
by Western countries, raising the oil output will not benefit
the consumers in those countries and the oil price issue could not
be solved effectively.
</P>
<P>
The paper also criticized Saudi Arabia, OPEC's most influential
member, for its "submission to Western pressure" and advocating for
output hike. It accused Riyadh of "ignoring OPEC interests" by
planning to further raise oil output.

<HEADLINE> Barak Denies Reports of Compromise on Temple Mount </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister's
Office denied on Tuesday the reports that Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is ready to compromise over the sovereignty on Temple Mount in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Ha'aretz reported on Tuesday that Israel is not
ruling out the possibility of acceding to a proposal by Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat to place sovereignty over the Temple Mount in
the hands of an international joint body.
</P>
<P>
The joint body will consist of the five permanent members of the
United Nations Security Council and the Jerusalem Committee of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference.
</P>
<P>
Under this idea, the joint body will confer on Arafat the
jurisdiction over the Temple Mount and appoint him custodian of the
Islamic holy sites, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Israel would retain sovereignty over the Western Wall and work
out with the Palestinians and representatives of the Jerusalem
Committee arrangements for day-to-day administration of the Islamic
holy site, including security, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
In a conversation held in New York last week, Barak and United
States President Bill Clinton agreed that the new proposal might be
able to keep the negotiations alive, the daily quoted a senior
Israeli source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal represented a shift from Arafat's previous
refusal to back down from his demand for exclusive Palestinian
sovereignty on the Temple Mount, it added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Barak also agreed to continue bilateral and
trilateral talks in order to work on the compromise over the Temple
Mount and the Old City of Jerusalem, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross is due to
return to the region at the weekend to try and get Arafat to show
flexibility on the issues that are still unresolved, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
In response to the reports, Barak's office said the newspaper
was reporting a political speculation rather than a government
policy and that the Israeli sovereignty over the Temple Mount would
not be compromised.
</P>
<P>
Barak returned from the U.S. Monday evening and on Tuesday
morning he is holding meetings with his cabinet ministers on how to
settle the domestic political crisis such as the formation of a new
coalition government and push the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
forward.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Back from a week of unproductive meetings on the peace
process in the United States, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is
expected on Tuesday to forge ahead with a plan to reform religious-
secular ties in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister is determined to lead with the imperative
steps to make Israel a modern state in the 21st century, while
preserving its Jewish and Zionist character," said a statement
released by the Prime Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
A senior Israeli official said contacts with the Palestinians
will continue, but that the momentum has gone out of the process.
Another official said it is unrealistic to expect that what had not
been achieved before, during, or after the Camp David summit can be
obtained in the next couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel is not ruling out the possibility of acceding to a
proposal by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to place sovereignty
on the Temple Mount in the hands of a body consisting of the
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and the
Jerusalem Committee of the Islamic Organization Conference.
</P>
<P>
Under this idea, which is still being formulated, the joint body
would confer on Arafat the jurisdiction over the Temple Mount and
appoint him custodian of the Islamic holy places.
</P>
<P>
Israel would retain sovereignty over the Western Wall and work
out with the Palestinians and representatives of the Jerusalem
Committee arrangements for the day-to-day administration of the
compound, including security, worship for Jews and so forth.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Communications Minister Binyamin Ben Eliezer had
dinner with Likud Chairman Ariel Sharon at the latter's ranch in
the Negev Monday night. Afterward, Sharon went out of his way to
describe the session as a "social, friendly, and family" meeting,
initiated by the minister, even detailing family members who were
present.
</P>
<P>
The point was to stress that the objective was not to discuss
the possibility of forming a national unity government with Barak.
Likud whip Reuven Rivlin also participated. His presence is
believed to have been important to back up that Sharon was telling
the truth.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, Ben Eliezer did raise the issue of a unity
government. In his statement, Sharon said: "Among the political
issues discussed, it was clearly raised that there is no room for
establishing a national unity government, in light of the dangerous
processes that Prime Minister Ehud Barak is following."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Barak is planning to offer the Likud a predetermined approach
to the negotiations with the Palestinians, if the main opposition
party is willing to join his coalition, a senior diplomatic source
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no problem in reversing what was said at Camp David,
because we made no promises and did not give a thing. The
government of Israel was willing to discuss (the U.S. proposals)
and remains ready to do so in the future. Preliminary talks in the
government will determine the nature of our position (in the
negotiations)," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Barak is said to believe that the Likud is also interested in
participating in the negotiations, as proved by its willingness to
sign the Wye and Hebron agreements with the Palestinians. As a
result, Barak believes that the Likud would not formulate an
unrealistic negotiating stance.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Official Calls for AIDS Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official has
called for the inclusion of AIDS education in school textbooks,
local press reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Teachers as well as students should be educated on the
consequences of the spread of AIDS, Gholamreza Sahraian, governor
of the southern Fars province, was quoted by the English-language
Iran Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said that all people should know more about AIDS, "
otherwise, the next generation will hold us responsible for the
wide spread of the disease."
</P>
<P>
He added that the government should not be worried about AIDS
education inciting public opinion.
</P>
<P>
Health officials say that more than 1,800 out of some 7.5
million Iranians, who have been tested, were proved positive of
HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial figures show that more than 63,000 Iranians are HIV-
positive. Most AIDS victims in Iran are drug-addicts who have
contracted the virus through intravenous injections.

NEW DELHI -- India welcomed the decision of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in Vienna to increase the
crude oil production by 800,000 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the announcement of the OPEC decision on Sunday,
Indian Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Ram Naik expressed his
hope that the increase, which is three percent of the present OPEC
production quota, would have "a salutary and lasting effect on
international oil prices."
</P>
<P>
However, according to a statement issued Sunday night, the
minister said New Delhi would have been happier if the increase
was of a larger magnitude considering the already very high prices
and the strong demand in the market.

HONG KONG -- Hong Kong is meeting with an extraordinary
opportunity to be an even greater commercial and market center in
the years ahead because of the potential for economic growth in a
market-based Chinese economy, said a U.S. economist.
</P>
<P>
With China undergoing its great transformation, China must
develop market skills more broadly, and Hong Kong can play a
particularly pivotal role in this regard, said Robert E. Rubin,
chairman of the Executive Committee and member of the Office of
the Chairman of Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at a luncheon in Hong Kong, Rubin said a
market based financial system poses a great challenge for China,
as it requires an effective system of regulation and supervision,
and of well-established accounting standards and rules and
processes of law.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is world class locus of the entrepreneurial and
financial and market skills that China so greatly needs, and has
long served this function within broader Chinese economy, he noted.

SINGAPORE -- Singapore's top two telecom players, SingTel and
StarHub, will get a total of 1.9 billion Singapore dollars (about
1.1 billion U.S. dollars) from the government as a compensation
for the accelerated freeing-up of the telecommunications sector.
</P>
<P>
SingTel will get 859 million Singapore dollars (about 499
million U.S. dollars) and StarHub 1.082 billion Singapore dollars
(about 629 million U.S. dollars), the Information Development
Authority (IDA) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have accepted the compensations, IDA said.
</P>
<P>
"Compensation is being offered in recognition of the business
and investment plans that both operators had made for duopoly-
based public telecommunications services market, prior to the
announcement of full market liberalization," IDA said.
</P>
<P>
IDA said that the government is committed to introducing full
market competition in the telecommunications sector as competition
spurs innovation, raises efficiency, improves services and lowers
prices.

BANGKOK -- Rising global oil prices will hit Thailand's
mooncake market hard, as the psychological effect of dearer petrol
causes consumers to buy fewer cakes, a report said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report released by the Thai Farmers Bank research center
suggested the runaway oil prices would generate psychological
effects on buyers and the number of mooncakes purchased would drop.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was based on a poll of 1,142 mooncake
enthusiasts, revealed most consumers polled planned to buy at
least one fewer cake this year than last year.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) agreed
Sunday to boost daily global crude oil output by three per cent,
or 800,000 barrels, in a bid to ease soaring prices which has
sparked worldwide concern and protests in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is particularly vulnerable to changes in world oil
prices, since the kingdom is highly dependent on oil. Oil
consumption in Thailand rose by nearly 80 percent between 1990 and
1998, according to the U.S. investment banking company Merrill
Linch.
</P>
<P>
The company forecasts that Thailand's growth rate will be
shaved by one percentage point or more in 2001 due largely to
higher import prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil accounts for close to 61 percent of Thailand's primary
energy consumption and natural gas 25 percent.

PHNOM PENH -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB) will provide
Cambodia's Kompong Thom province a loan of 16 million U.S. dollars
for irrigation and infrastructure projects, the Cambodia Daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Urooj Malik, ADB's representative in Cambodia confirmed this in
a telephone interview, saying that ADB last week approved the low-
interest loan to help villagers increase their agricultural
productivity and income.
</P>
<P>
More than 9,000 hectares of rice fields will be equipped with
irrigation systems, and about 150 km of rural roads will be
renovated in communities along the Stung Chinit and Stung Tang
Krasang rivers in the south-central part of the province, the bank
official said.
</P>
<P>
Villagers will also be trained on new farming technologies, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The ADB will finance roughly two-thirds of the project cost,
which will be completed in 2007. The remainder will be paid by the
French Development Agency, the government and villagers themselves,
the report said.

COLOMBO -- Sri Lanka is targeting around 100 million U.S.
dollars Indian direct investment by the end of 2001, the state
owned Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Board of Investment Shehara de Silva was
quoted as saying that Sri Lanka has been an attractive destination
for foreign direct investment due to its geographic location and
the incentives offered since 1977. Over 50 percent of Indian joint
ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries in the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation region are located in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
She said that the recent Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between
India and Sri Lanka will create a springboard for creating greater
mutual understanding about business. Moreover, businesses in
either country could look for opportunities to set up
manufacturing units and capitalize on the rules of the original
criteria of FTA which entails 35 percent of value added factor.
</P>
<P>
The FTA became operative only this year and Sri Lankan
exporters are enthusiastic about their business prospects with
India. The agreement facilitates tariff reduction and abolition of
tariffs in a phased manner.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Urges U.N. to Lead in Energy Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations should
lead the world in launching campaigns on energy conservation, and
supporting studies on oil substitutes, the Thai News Agency (TNA)
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary to Thai Foreign Minister Nopadol Patama was quoted as
saying that Thailand would call for the United Nations and
industrialized countries to lead global campaigns on energy
conservation, though the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) had decided to boost its overall oil production
by 800,000 barrels a day as of October 1.
</P>
<P>
The current problem of soaring world oil prices does not just
involve the production side, but the consumption side. So solving
the problem involves not only the OPEC's decision to increase its
oil production by 800,000 barrels a day, but oil importing
countries' moves to conserve energy and find new sources of energy,
namely natural gas, solar energy, water power, and others, he said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations should, therefore, lead the world in
launching global campaigns on energy conservation, and in
supporting research projects to seek oil alternatives and
substitutes, as the current oil price hike is a common problem of
every country and a global agenda, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Measures and projects on energy conservation and oil
substitutes introduced and launched by the United Nations should
be commonly observed by all countries, either developed, or
developing ones, he urged.
</P>
<P>
Nopadol said that the Thai government could authorize Deputy
Prime Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, in his
capacity as the current chairman of United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD), to launch a mission on energy
conservation internationally, if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Police Confirm Three Captured Malaysians in Jolo, Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Police Tuesday confirmed
that the three Malaysians abducted from a resort at Pandanan
island off Sabah, East Malaysia last Sunday have been brought to
Jolo in southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Police have received information that the trio are being held
in Jolo, the same island where a Philippine rebel group held 21
people abducted from Sipadan island, also off Sabah, for almost
four months, according to Deputy Inspector-General of Police
Mohamed Jamil Johari.
</P>
<P>
"We have received information to this effect," Bernama news
agency quoted him as saying at the Semporna police station in
Semporna which is 20 nautical miles from Pandanan island.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, police have stepped up security at all resorts in
Semporna in the wake of the abduction of the three people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The police are considering other medium and long-term security
plans, he said.
</P>
<P>
The deputy police chief is in Semporna leading a team of senior
officers from the federal police headquarters to oversee search
and rescue operations for the trio missing from the Pandanan
Semporna Island Resort last Sunday evening when four men in
tracksuits and armed with M-16 rifles raided the resort and
escaped with the resort manager Mohamed Noh Sulaiman of Penang,
dive-master Joseph Onkinoh of Kota Kinabalu and contractor Kan Wei
Chong as hostages.
</P>
<P>
This was the second abduction at resorts off Sabah this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21 people -- nine Malaysians and 12 foreigners --
were kidnapped from a diving resort in Sipadan Island last April
23.
</P>
<P>
All the 21 except for a Filipino have been released unharmed by
the abductors from their hideout in Jolo in southern Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Role Helps Support U.N. Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's increasing role in
the international community has helped support missions of the
United Nations in parts of the world so far, the Thai News Agency
(TNA) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, who represents the Thai
government in attending the U.N. Millennium Summit in New York
between September 6 and 8 and the 53rd U.N. General Assembly, was
quoted as saying here Tuesday that the U.N. Millennium Summit
endorsed Thailand's continued role in supporting U.N. missions in
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's participation in U.N. and international missions
included the Thai peacekeeping force in East Timor, and campaigns
on prevention and control of HIV/AIDS and other social problems,
which have been recognized as good examples for other countries,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's success in promoting its candidate, Deputy Prime
Minister and Commerce Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi, to become
the next Director of the Geneva-based World Trade Organization (
WTO), taking office in 2002, also reflected Thailand's increasing
role in key world organizations and the country's readiness in
making world trade and development fairer and equitable to all, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's leadership in the WTO and in the present U.N.-led
peacekeeping forces in East Timor represent the country's
increasing role in taking more responsibility in both regional and
international affairs to bring peace and stability to the world
politically, economically, and socially, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Surin said that member states also called for increasing the
role of the U.N. in addressing and dealing with key global issues,
including poverty eradication, human resource development, and
transfer of scientific and other technologies so that the
globalization would benefit all countries equally.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. was also urged to implement reforms and
decentralization to increase efficiency and flexibility in its
mechanisms and world missions, namely peacekeeping operations,
conflict management in regions, comprehensive development, and
control of deadly diseases, said the Thai Foreign Minister.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Draw Up Comprehensive Policy vs. Abductions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
come up with a comprehensive policy in dealing with abductions
similar to those which occurred in Sipadan island in April and at
the Pandanan resort -- both in Malaysia -- over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said Cabinet Cluster E,
which deals with political affairs and security concerns, will
discuss with President Joseph Estrada its recommendations in fine-
tuning the government's existing policy on kidnappings after he
returns from the United States Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf kidnapped 21 foreign hostages from a resort in
Sipadan island in Malaysia on April 23 and took them later in Jolo
island in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations lasted for almost five months until all the
foreign hostages were freed. Only Filipino captive Roland Ullah
remains in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
As in the Sipadan abduction, the kidnappers of three Malaysians
took their captives from the Pandanan dive resort off Borneo to
their hideout in Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
"We hope we'll be able to present a consistent policy. We have
to stop this once and for all," Zamora said of the kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the Philippine government has an elite force to
deal with these kidnapping cases, but "until we decide to use them
" it will remain on standby.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada has ruled out military action in dealing with
the Sipadan case, stressing that the government will always place
a premium on the safety of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"We in Cluster E have drawn up some recommendations to the
president. When he arrives we'll talk about it and we will form a
policy about this." Zamora said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Jose Calimlim, chief of the Intelligence Service of
the Armed Forces, said the Pandanan island abductors were sighted
near Talipao in Sulu province Monday night.
</P>
<P>

Abu Sayyaf rebel group, albeit a different one from the rebels'
main faction in Jolo.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Implement New Food Production Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has drawn up
six main strategies to sustain the country's food production from
the effects of globalization besides meeting local and export
demand, Agriculture Minister Effendi Norwawi said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The strategies include increasing productivity efficiently,
setting up food production zones, strengthening marketing system,
strengthening food production supporting industries, developing
infrastructure, and developing human resources, he told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
"We need to seriously embark on all these six strategies if we
do not want to be overwhelmed by the effects of globalization and
to sustain the country's food industry," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He was of the view that being weak in these six strategies
would not only make Malaysia lose out to foreign competition in
food production but also have to import more food.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia now imports food products of some 100 billion ringgit
(26.31 billion U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
He said that in implementing those strategies, priority would
be for production of rice, fruits, vegetables, fisheries and
poultry farming.
</P>
<P>
"Our concentration is not only to fulfill local demand but also
for export. We aim to be one of the main food exporters in the
world," the minister said, adding that to reach this goal,
Malaysia would have to position itself to face the effects of
globalization, which brings along the open market system.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia was however worried over the underhand tactics
of the developed nations practicing unfair trade to protect their
own food production industries.
</P>
<P>
With developed countries imposing various restrictions like the
Sanitary and Phytosanitary requirements, products from developing
and under developed countries found it hard to penetrate
international markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Malaysia raised this issue at the 25th Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional Conference for Asia
and Pacific from August 28 to September 1 in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Former Rebels in Kenya Seek to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Ugandan rebel
representatives taking refuge in Kenya have come back to negotiate
the return of over 2,800 Ugandan former rebels who are facing
starvation in Kenya, the Monitor newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nimorod Chandi and Charles Kisembo, who acquired entry letters
from the Uganda High Commission in Kenya, said this is the third
time they are to negotiate with the government.
</P>
<P>
Chandi said they have so far met the minister of Internal
Affairs and will meet President Yoweri Museveni before returning
to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He said the group in Kenya comprises refugees and rebels who
broke away from various groups including the Allied Democratic
Forces (ADF) and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).
</P>
<P>
Chandi said there are 300 children who had been abducted by LRA
and 400 female rebels in the group.
</P>
<P>
The children are starving and have resorted to pick-pocketing
and stealing from shops in Nairobi, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than six children have died of starvation and many others
are in critical conditions, said Chandi, adding that "we have no
drugs, food or warming during the night and the situation is hard".
</P>
<P>
Chandi said they are responding to the amnesty law established
by the Ugandan government and want to return to Uganda.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Launch Anti-poverty Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A National Poverty Forum (NPF)
will open Tuesday in Uganda to discuss issues concerning poverty
reduction in the east African country, the New Vision newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to stimulate critical discussion and understanding
about the nature of poverty in Uganda, and make the war against it
a national issue," said Leonard Okello, National Project
Coordinator of the Uganda Participatory Poverty Assessment Project.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Apolo Nsibambi is to preside over the forum
which is expected to bring together over 300 delegates from civil
societies, non-government organizations, research centers and
government departments.
</P>
<P>
According to Okello, research conducted in 1998 showed that
nine million Ugandans were living below the poverty line, chained
in the total lack of essential commodities in life.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Firms Urge Reduction of Import Duty on Raw Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's manufacturers have
urged the government to reduce duty on imported textile raw
materials for commercial competition in the region, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
K.S. Bedi, chairman of the Kenya Association of Manufacturers,
was quoted by the paper as saying tariffs on imported fiber and
other raw materials should be lowered to enable local firms to
compete effectively in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA).
</P>
<P>
Bedi noted that Kenya's textile firms were disadvantaged
because duty on finished imported garments from the COMESA was
lower than that imposed on imported fiber.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan manufacturers are also paying more for electricity than
those in the COMESA member states who sell their goods in Kenya,
Bedi said.
</P>
<P>
He argued that "we pay 10 U.S. cents for a unit of electricity
while manufacturers in South Africa pay only 2.8 U.S. cents".
</P>
<P>
Bedi claimed that manufacturers in the country were also
greatly constrained by poor roads and urged the government to
expedite the privatization of the Kenya Railways Corporation in
order to improve efficiency in the transport sector.

<HEADLINE> Eight Arrested in Corsica for Suspected Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were arrested
Tuesday morning in a large-scale police action against suspected
terrorists in the island of Corsica, reported Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
Some of the arrested are believed to be members of the
underground nationalist group, the Armata Corsa, which is the
rival of the National Liberation Front of Corsica.
</P>
<P>
They were suspected to have made two bombing attacks in
December on the island and have been involved in the assassination
of a rival Corsican nationalist.
</P>
<P>
Three leaders of nationalist groups in the island were recently
killed in mafia-style executions in the street, signaling an
escalation of terrorist actions in Corsica.
</P>
<P>
The Corsica problem has become a national debate in France
after Prime Minister Lionel Jospin presented in July a plan to
give limited self-rule to the island in four years.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Granting of China's NTR Favorable to World Economy, Businessmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The United States granting of
permanent normal trade relations (NTR) to China is favorable for
the development of Sino-U.S. economic and trade relations, and
economic globalization as well.
</P>
<P>
These remarks were made by both Chinese and foreign businessmen
and experts attending the fourth China Fair for International
Investment and Trade, which concludes today in Xiamen, a port city
in southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Friedrich Seitz, managing director of BASF-China, said he
hopes that the United States passes the motion on granting China
the permanent NTR as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
However, Friedrich said, "This is not a prerequisite condition
for China's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO).
Whether the U.S. adopts the motion or not, China is certain to
become a full member of the WTO."
</P>
<P>
Claus Gersonde, director of IBMT research institute under the
Fraunhofer Engineering Research Academy of Germany, said, "Normal
trade relations can promote open and just competition on the
market."
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. should grant China permanent NTR treatment, which
benefits the two countries, and world trade as well," he said
</P>
<P>
Shao Ning, director of the Maryland Business Center China is
confident that the U.S. will approve the motion. "The majority of
the U.S. Congress support granting China permanent normal trade
relations," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I think and we hope that the U.S. Congress will adopt the
motion. If not, the U.S. will suffer a greater loss than China,"
said Chu Baotai, a researcher with the China Academy of Management
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from Hong Kong and Taiwan also expressed the hope
that the United States would adopt the motion of granting China
permanent NTR, noting this will benefit all countries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have given each other the most-
favored nation trading status after the two sides established
diplomatic relations in 1979. However, every year the United
States discusses unilaterally whether or not to grant China the
MFN, which means, "most-favored nation trading status."
</P>
<P>
U.S. president Bill Clinton changed the wording of "MFN status"
into "normal trade relations" in a bill in 1998.
</P>
<P>
On May 24 this year, the U.S. House of Representatives adopted
the motion voting 237 to 197. According to the motion, the U.S.
will stop its annual examination and discussion on granting China
permanent NTR treatment after China becomes a full member of the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Senate, on September 7, approved that the examination
and discussion of the motion has entered its final stage, by
voting in favor of it 92 to 5. The U.S. Senate will have a final
voting before September 15.

<HEADLINE> China Embarks on Building Major Channel to Attract Overseas Capital (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists here noted that the high-level fair demonstrates
China's determination to push its opening-up policy further
forward.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the globe's largest markets and has for seven
years been the largest absorber of overseas capital among
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen fair has now gathered almost all potential business
projects from across the country. It is estimated that the volume
of overseas capital attracted through the five-day fair could
account for one-fourth of the yearly total.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the fair has actually become a major forum where
senior Chinese officials can announce new policies to overseas
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Along with China's pending accession into the World Trade
Organization, Ma said, the market access conditions for overseas
capital will continue to ease and more fields will open to
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
She believed that the Xiamen fair will therefore "play a
greater role in connecting overseas capital and the domestic
market."

<HEADLINE> China to Remain World's Major Market in 21st Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A great number of overseas
businessmen are still confident that China will remain one of the
biggest investment markets in the world in the new century.
</P>
<P>
Herb Heryyuana Lin, manager of Intel Capital, who is attending
the fourth China Fair for International Investment and Trade in
this port city of Xiamen, said that the decrease of overseas
investment in China is a temporary phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"China is absolutely going to be the most competitive
investment market in developing countries in the next 10 years,"
Lin said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Jun Park, a representative from Hyundai of the Republic of
Korea, who is also visiting the fair, scheduled to conclude today,
held that "China will be an infinitely big market in the coming 10
to 20 years."
</P>
<P>
Nearly 10,000 overseas businessmen are at the fair, so far the
only national event which aims to lure foreign funds into China.
Contracts involving over 10 billion U.S. dollars have been signed -
- a much higher figure than for any previous event.
</P>
<P>
Since it adopted the opening-up policy in 1978, China, with a
population of over one billion, has been regarded as "a name which
is most attractive to foreign investors."
</P>
<P>
China has been the biggest recipient of foreign direct
investment in developing countries for seven straight years since
1993. Over 400 of the world's top 500 multinational corporations
have invested in China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in China has shown a declining trend since
the mid-1990s for various reasons. However, the situation took a
turn for the better since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The recovery of the economies in Asian countries which were
affected by the Asian financial crisis, and the rise of the world
economy as a whole are cited as the factors that are playing
positive roles in stimulating the inflow of foreign investment
into China.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative sources said that the Chinese market is still as
attractive as it was more than two decades ago, despite
competition brought about by the opening up of the Latin American
market.
</P>
<P>
As for the domestic factors, Ma Yu, a research fellow with the
research institute under the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC), predicted that as a result of over
20 years of reform and opening up, the Chinese economy has the
potential to absorb 70 billion U.S. dollars of foreign funds
annually in the coming 10 years.

Chinese leaders said recently that in the coming 10 years,
China will continue its efforts in large-scale modernization. It
is predicted that the investment in fixed assets will grow by an
average rate of 10 percent annually, and the total import volume
will surpass 2 trillion U.S. dollars in the period.
</P>
<P>
By readjusting its economic structure, analysts pointed out,
China is creating more business opportunities such as the
stimulation of domestic demand, the development of its western
region, the reform of state enterprises, the development of high-
tech industries and the expansion of the service sector.
</P>
<P>
China's accession into the World Trade Organization (WTO),
which has entered its final stage, will further help open wider
the Chinese market, they said.
</P>
<P>
China has put forward more bold policies for luring foreign
funds into its high-tech industries, and it has gradually opened
the market for commerce, foreign trade, finance, insurance,
securities, telecommunications and tourism in accordance with the
basic rules of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence Klein, a winner of Nobel Prize for Economics, said
that "China will, as an economic giant, participate in the world
economic development, and it will enter a new period of
development following its accession into the WTO."
</P>
<P>
"Multinational corporations will bring to China much more and
stable funds," added Klein.
</P>
<P>
Juergen D. Lagleder, senior vice president of the Siemens Ltd.,
China, is confident that his company will enjoy more just
treatment and a wider space for development following China's
upcoming entry into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make extra investment in all sectors in China," Lagleder
stressed.

XIAMEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China has set out to turn the
China Fair for Investment and Trade, held every Autumn since 1997
in Xiamen in southeast China's Fujian province, into the nation's
most important channel to attract overseas capital.
</P>
<P>
The fourth investment and trade fair, which closed here today,
welcomed nearly 10,000 overseas businessmen from over 60 countries
and regions and registered a record high of nearly 10 billion U.S.
dollars in contracted value.
</P>
<P>
Originally a local trade gathering, the Xiamen fair is now
sponsored by MOFTEC and is the country's sole nationwide fair on a
theme of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Minister of China's Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) Ma Xiuhong hailed the fair, together with the
Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair, as two major activities in
attracting overseas fund.
</P>
<P>
As many developing countries have introduced new initiatives to
attract overseas investment, China is obliged to make changes in
its traditional approach so it can be more competitive, said Hu
Jingyan, a senior MOFTEC official in charge of overseas capital.

ANKARA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- It was reported that General Huseyin Kivrikoglu, chief of
general staff of Turkish Armed Forces, proposed on Monday that the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should set up a second
emergency intervention force in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
If his proposal is accepted, Ayazara and Mamak, located in
southern Turkey, will be likely to become the two new NATO bases.
</P>
<P>
Right now, the United States and British warplanes are using the
NATO air base in southern Turkey's Incirlik to enforce a no-fly
zone over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Yenibinyil:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said on Monday that as
long as the existence of two states in Cyprus is denied, the fourth
round of the proximity talks on Cyprus held in New York can not
yield any positive result.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a Mediterranean island country, was divided into Turkish
Cypriot-controlled north and Greek Cypriot-controlled south since
1974. The Turkish Cypriots declared a state in 1983, only
recognized by Turkey.
</P>

Hurriyet:

Empire in early 20th century.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of the adoption of the mentioned draft by the U.
S. House of Representatives has increased.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which is carried out by the American-Turkish
Associations Assembly (ATAA) and the Federation of Turkish-American
Associations (FATA), asked particularly the Americans of Turkish
origin to send e-mails, faxes, and telephone messages to the
lawmakers in their districts.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Air Force Commander General Dan Haloutz arrived in
Ankara on Monday for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
He was received by Turkish Air Force Commander General Ergin
Celasin. Speaking at the meetings, Celasin said the Turkish and
Israeli air forces had been carrying out mutual training flights
since 1995, and the Israeli Air Force pilots were physiological
trained at the Air Force Hospital in central Eskisehir province of
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli general said the military cooperation between Turkey
and Israel constituted an example for other countries in the
region, adding that the common values strengthened cooperation
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Online Ads Market Boom in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The online advertising
market in India is booming and all set for a quantum leap with the
drastic increase of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
According to Pankaj Sethi, Chief Executive Officer of
media2india.net, the online advertising market generated around
150 million rupees ( 3.49 million U.S. dollars) in the first year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that revenues from the market are estimated to
jump four-fold by this year, touching an impressive 500 million
rupees (11.63 million dollars) to 600 million rupees (13.95
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
By year 2003, the market will show phenomenal gains at 5
billion rupees 116.28 million dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
With the number of Internet users estimated to reach 23 million
by 2003 in India, the market for the online advertising is seen to
be rapidly growing, said Shvetank Shah, Chief Executive Officer of
ZDNetindia.com.
</P>
<P>
ZDNetindia.com., a media company that provides online
advertising solutions to advertisers and web publishers, estimated
that there are about four million Internet users in India.
</P>
<P>
The total advertising market in India is pegged at 65 billion
rupees (1.51 billion dollars), which is expected to touch 100
billion rupees (2.33 billion dollars) mark in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Since the online advertising market is at a nascent stage in
India, analysts said, the advertising spending by corporations is
minimal. But trends show that in three years' time, about five
percent of the total advertising budget will go to online
advertising.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, advertising experts said that the cost of
developing advertising for other media, such as print and
television, is pretty low, with the high variable cost persisting.
</P>
<P>
This was unlike online advertising where the cost of developing
advertising was high, with the variable cost remaining low, they
added.

SHANGHAI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Results of a research of
Shanghai's population distribution by East China Teachers'

moved out of the city center to the outskirts over the past decade,

A clean environment, convenient transportation and varied

BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Another five new high-tech
industrial parks in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Yangling and

The new parks were the result of a decision of the Chinese
government in 1998 to open five high-tech industrial parks in
Beijing, Suzhou, Xi'an, Hefei and Yantai from among its 53 State-
level ones to expand cooperation with other APEC economies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government made the decision to promote the
cooperation with other APEC economies as advocated by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin at the fourth informal meeting of APEC
leadership in November 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, President Jiang proposed that a science and
technology industrial parks network be set up within the APEC with
a view to promoting exchanges of experience and information and to
"accelerate the momentum of integrating science and technology
with the economy."

BRUSSELS -- Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said Monday
that a cut in excise tax on fuel oil was not the right way to
solve the problem of rising prices.
</P>
<P>
Belga New Agency, Belgium's national news agency, said the
prime minister was speaking in New York during a trade promotion
tour.
</P>
<P>
Belgian truckers demanding tax cuts to drive down the oil price
brought Brussels the capital to a chaos Monday, the second day of
protests by transport workers. Truck drivers vowed to continue
their blockade after storming from a meeting with Transport
Minister Isabelle Durant.
</P>
<P>
The news agency did not say what was the prime minister's
alternative to combat rising oil prices, but quoted him as saying
that the issue should be discussed at Friday's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian protest was launched just as a six-day blockade of
French oil refineries and storage depots came to an end but
protests gathered pace in Britain and Ireland.(Belgium-Fuel)

BANGKOK -- The Thai currency is stronger,following a decision

increase its oil production by 800,000 barrels a day as of October
1, according to a report of the state-run Krung Thai Bank
available here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thai baht moved between 41.43-41.52 baht a U.S. dollar Monday,
stronger than 41.59 baht a dollar on Friday. This was considered a
psychologically positive response to a decision made by the OPEC
at a meeting in Vienna Sunday to raise its overall oil production
by 800,000 barrels a day, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the world's powerful oil cartel, excluding U.N.
sanction-bound Iraq, agreed at a meeting in Vienna, Austria, to
increase overall oil production to 26.2 million barrels a day as
of October 1, an increase of three percent or 800,000 barrels a
day, to reduce soaring world oil prices, being feared to affect
economic recovery and growth of oil importing countries. (

<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- To exploit the advantages as
the hosts, the Australian swimmers are nursing their dreams of
toppling the Americans in the pool, calling for joint forces from
the world.
</P>
<P>
In the Millennium Games, the hosts will field in a 44-member
swimming delegation, including four world record holders to
spearhead the home favorites with Ian Thorpe in particular.
</P>
<P>
Don Talbot, who was in charge of the Australia's swimming team,
said that "this is not just us against the United States, in fact,
it's really the world ganging up against the United States, trying
to knock them off their pedestal."
</P>
<P>
From the Olympic swimming, the Americans are the foremost best
with 177 gold medals, beating Australia to a distant second with
38. And Australia only finish ahead of the Americans once when
they last hosted the Games in Melbourne in 1956 where they
pocketed eight golds.
</P>
<P>
Despite the caution from Talbot, the home fans are harbouring
high expectations as Thorpe holds the world records in the 200 and
400 freestyles, Michael Klim is the reigning world champion and
world record holder for the 100 butterfly, and Kieren Perkins has
won the 1500m freestyle at the past two Olympics and still holds
the world record.
</P>
<P>
In the women's events, Susan O'Neill is virtually unbeatable in
the 200 butterfly as the reigning world and Olympic champion

<HEADLINE> Three Malaysian Hostages Now in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine authorities
confirmed Tuesday that the three Malaysian hostages kidnapped from
Borneo Sunday night have arrived in Jolo island in the southern
Philippine province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview, Intelligence Service of the Armed
Forces of the Philippines chief Jose Calimlim said the Malaysians
arrived in Jolo as early as Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim said the kidnap group were members of the extremist
Abu Sayyaf rebel group, albeit a different one from the rebels'
main faction in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
He said a certain Landatan Umar was identified as the leader of
the rebels who raided the Malaysian resort in Pandanan Island.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim added the group may meet with the Abu Sayyaf's main
faction to turn over the hostages to Abu Sayyaf leader Ghalib
Andang,alias Commander Robot.
</P>
<P>
The three Malaysian hostages are Mohamad Noor Sulaiman, resort
manager; Joseph Jongkinoh, a divemaster; and Ah Kai, a contractor.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf achieved international prominence early this
year after abducting 21 mostly foreign hostages from another
Malaysian resort in Sipadan island on April 23.
</P>
<P>
Twenty of the group's hostages have been freed as of September
9,largely due to foreign mediation from the Libyan and Malaysian
governments.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Government ministers or
presidential secretaries from Latin American countries, Spain and
Portugal, began a two-day meeting here on Monday to prepare for
the forthcoming Ibero-american Summit to be held in Panama in
November.
</P>
<P>
The Ibero-american Summit is an official meeting of Spanish/
Portuguese-speaking Latin American countries, Spain and Portugal.
The first such meeting was held in Guadalajara, Mexico, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The ministers at the gathering, the fifth Plenary Meeting of
the Presidency Ministers Network and Equivalents of the Ibero-
american countries, are exchanging experiences in the
strengthening of administration and democratization in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's President's Private Secretary Lievano Saenz said in
his opening speech that "democracy and freedoms are indispensable
but not sufficient" to answer social problems.
</P>
<P>
"The 21st century will be for our countries the one of
correspondence, justice, and democracy, of coincidence between
effective equity and the freedoms," Saenz said.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which will end on Tuesday, is being attended by
officials from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Cuba, Chile, Ecuador,
El Salvador, Spain, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico Nicaragua, Panama,
Paraguay, Portugal, Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Gymnast Lu Unable to Deliver on Big Occasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top gymnast Lu Yufu
saw his Olympic dreams shattered to pieces here on Tuesday when a
neck injury in the vault training ruled him out of the Sydney
Games men's gymnastics competition.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old sustained the injury Monday afternoon as he
landed on his head after performing a tumbling over the vault,
Zhang Jian, team manager of the Chinese gymnastics delegation told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
It was the second time that Lu quit a major tournament in the
last minute due to injury. In 1998, the all-arounder suffered a
knee tendon injury, also on the vault, just ahead of the Asian
Games and was forced out consequently.
</P>
<P>
Lu will be replaced by teammate Zheng Lihui for the mens' team
event, and that could mean his search for big occasion glory
eventually end up with bitter regrets.
</P>
<P>
Lu used to be the gymnast most talked about in the Chinese
gymnastics, not only for his technically difficult routines but
for his mental weakness on the big competitive stage.
</P>
<P>
He was tipped by the Chinese coach Huang Yubin to take over the
mantle of Li Xiaoshuang, an all-around champion four years ago at
Atlanta. "Lu is the strongest amidst the new generation of the
Chinese men gymnasts," Huang said, "he is the right man to become
the successor to Li Xiaoshuang."
</P>
<P>
But Lu's poor ability to handle himself on the important moment
betrayed Huang's predictions. Up to now, Lu has botched up all his
chances in any major event he has taken part in and as a 22-year-
old veteran, he looks set to end his professional career empty
handed.
</P>
<P>
"If I stuck, I could win," Lu once said after his unique "
handspring sideways 2 1/2 tucked back salto" vaulting which he
originated and displayed for the first time in the Goodwill Games
in New York in the 1998 summer.
</P>
<P>
The courage to perform the most incredible vault touched the
hearts of the entire gymnastic community, especially after Sang
Lang's tragic fall in a practice vault at the Games broke the 17-
year-old's neck and left her paralyzed in hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked and then very much moved. It's a real commitment
for him to stick with the routine," Gao Jian, vice-president of
the Chinese Gymnastics Association (CGA) said.
</P>
<P>
"He has the calibre of skills, but sadly, he does not know how
to prove them when things matter," Gao said.

SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The youngest member of the U.S.
gymnastics team Morgan White pulled out of the Olympics on Tuesday
because of a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old White, the Pan American Games all-around
champion, had been bothered by a stress fracture in her left foot
since last month's Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
White was replaced by Tasha Schwikert, 15, even though she
finished a spot behind first alternate Alyssa Beckerman at the
American national Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
Schwikert was chosen because of more consistent performances at
the pre-Olympic training camp.

NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading Indian Newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times Of India:
</P>
<P>
-- The Delhi cabinet Monday banned the sale of cigarettes to
minors effective from January 1, 2001. Even the sale and storage
of cigarettes within a radius of 100 meters around schools,
colleges and other educational institutions will not be permitted.
</P>
<P>
The Hindustan Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Indian Army said on Monday that there was an "adverse
impact" on day-to-day functioning due to shortage of 12,883
officers in the army this year.
</P>
<P>
The Hindu:
</P>
<P>
-- The Indian government evidently has little option but to
raise the prices of petroleum products since the OPEC decision to
increase output was not likely to bring down world oil prices
significantly.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign institutional investors made record net investments
of 220 million U.S. dollars on September 8, probably the highest

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Targets 100 Mln U.S. Dollars Indian Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is targeting around
100 million U.S. dollars Indian direct investment by the end of
2001, the state owned Daily News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Board of Investment Shehara de Silva was
quoted as saying that Sri Lanka has been an attractive destination
for foreign direct investment due to its geographic location and
the incentives offered since 1977. Over 50 percent of Indian joint
ventures and wholly owned subsidiaries in the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation region are located in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
She said that the recent Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between
India and Sri Lanka will create a springboard for creating greater
mutual understanding about business. Moreover, businesses in
either country could look for opportunities to set up
manufacturing units and capitalize on the rules of the original
criteria of FTA which entails 35 percent of value added factor.
</P>
<P>
The FTA became operative only this year and Sri Lankan
exporters are enthusiastic about their business prospects with
India. The agreement facilitates tariff reduction and abolition of
tariffs in a phased manner.
</P>
<P>
De Silva said that they expected an increase in investment in
all sectors and would like Sri Lanka and India to jointly tap
regional and developed markets.
</P>
<P>
She said that the textile industry in India is well developed
while Sri Lanka is well advanced in the garment industry. Sri
Lanka has know-how and access to global markets with a 2 billion U.
S. dollar export market in value added garments which India may
wish to use by setting up textile industries in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka was keen on tying up with Indian institutions to help
the new generation compete in the information technology, an
emerging sector. Several leading Indian institutions have already
set up branches in Colombo, capital of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has a huge investment potential in the infrastructure
sector that is a key sector for overall industrial development.
The government will soon announce a number of new projects in the
sector, which will be open to both local and foreign companies
with special incentives to be offered by the government, she said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Gets Low Grade in Computer Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A House of Representative
panel on Monday gave the U.S. government a D-minus grade for
computer security, saying that lax computer security poses a
growing threat to a wide range of official operations and data.
</P>
<P>
Security lapses at all 24 federal agencies reviewed "place a
broad array of federal operations and assets at risk of fraud,
misuse and disruption," said the General Accounting Office (GAO),
a nonpartisan investigative arm of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
As authorities rely more and more on computer networks, "there
is a greater likelihood that information attacks will threaten
vital national interests," GAO said.
</P>
<P>
It said that government officials are increasingly concerned
about potential cyber attacks motivated by everything from
juvenile mischievousness to intelligence gathering, crime and
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
Based on the GAO audit and other data, the U.S. House
Subcommittee on Government Management, Information and Technology
handed out a failing F grade to more than one in four of the major
U.S. bureaucracies for lapses in computer security.
</P>
<P>
They include the departments of health and human services,
agriculture, justice, labor and interior as well as the Small
Business Administration and the Office of Personnel Management.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department earned only a D-plus. Shortcomings in
computer security at Pentagon "increase the vulnerability of
various military operations that support the department's
warfighting capability," GAO said.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon-Induced Heavy Rain Causes Three Deaths in Central Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- An approaching powerful typhoon
has dumped heavy rain on various parts of Japan since Monday,
leaving at least three people dead and disrupting road and train
traffic in and around Aichi Prefecture, central Japan, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The downpours caused landslides and flooding in widespread
areas, resulting in the deaths of three men, two buried in
landslides and one drowned, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bullet train services on the Tokaido Shinkansen Line connecting
Tokyo and Osaka in western Japan have been suspended for more than
18 hours since Monday evening, Central Japan Railway said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's three major airlines canceled a combined 76 flights,
mostly to and from Naha in Okinawa, on Tuesday because of Typhoon
Saomai.
</P>
<P>
A total of 180,000 families in Aichi, Gifu and Mie prefectures
have been ordered or advised to evacuate, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,500 houses and buildings in Nagoya, capital of
Aichi Prefecture, were flooded in varying degrees as of 6 a.m. (
local time) Tuesday, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Meteorological Agency issued warnings of flooding
and landslides in central Japan's Tokai region, the Kinki area in
western Japan and Yamanashi and Nagano prefectures.
</P>
<P>
A total of 551 mm of rain fell in the city of Tokai in Aichi
Prefecture in the 24 hours to 4 a.m., while Nagoya got 532 mm,
both the highest figures since the Nagoya observatory began
keeping records in 1891, the weather agency said.
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m. Tuesday, Typhoon Saomai was located about 160
kilometers east-southeast of Naha, the capital of Okinawa
Prefecture, lashing strong winds on Okinawa and moving slowly at
15 km per hour west-northwest over the sea. The season's 14th
typhoon may hit Okinawa's main island later Tuesday, the agency
said.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- IOC president Juan Antonio
Samaranch said on Tuesday that he remained concerned over the
preparation of Greece for the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
After the IOC warning five months ago that the 2004 Olympics
were in jeopardy, Samaranch said he and Jacques Rogge, the IOC
official who oversees the Athens preparations, were "very much
worried regarding the timetables" set for completing the sports
venues.
</P>
<P>
"I have to be very clear," Samaranch said to the Athens
organizers after their report to the IOC general assembly. "You
lost three years. Now you have only four years for the
organization of the games. That is really very difficult."
</P>
<P>
Rogge said that the coming six months will be crucial as the
government must move forward the deadlines and implement the plan.
</P>
<P>
Rogge noted that substantial progress has been made since April
when Samaranch said the Athens Games were in the worst
organizational crisis faced by an Olympic city in his 20-year
tenure.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Hopes for First Olympic Medals in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Cancer hero Lance Armstrong is
battling from his injuries, hoping for his first-ever Olympic
medal in Sydney after retaining his Tour de France title this year.
</P>
<P>
Recovering from injuries, "Lance is planning on being here,
planning on racing and planning on winning," said U.S. cycling
team manager Sean Petty on Tuesday, adding that Armstrong who was
still a little sore, pledged to challenge for two gold medals in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong, who suffered testicular cancer after the Atlanta
Olympics, returned to the world cycling arena by winning back-to-
back titles in the Tour de France in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
However, he suffered an injury two weeks ago by fracturing a
vertebra between his neck and shoulder blade, and was recuperating
in France.
</P>
<P>
"My neck is still fairly tight, especially in the night and the
morning, and it seems to have affected other areas around the C7
as well," said the American rider in his website.
</P>
<P>
"I'm cautiously optimistic about my chances in Sydney, but my
biggest concern is that flight to Australia -- 24 hours," he said.
</P>
<P>
If fully fit, Armstrong would be one of the favourites for the
September 27 road race and the September 30 time trial.

"Then it dies again and the lake is as smooth as glass."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Disarm East Timorese Militias in W. Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
pledged to disarm East Timorese militias in West Timor or the
country's East Nusa Tenggara province after last week's murders of
three U.N. aid workers.
</P>
<P>
"The criminal code will be used as the legal basis for
disarming the militias," the Indonesian Observer daily Tuesday
quoted National Police Chief Rusdiharjo as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Following the incident in Atambua, we will use the penal code
because it allows the confiscation of illegally-kept firearms and
other weapons," Rusdiharjo said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. in a ruling covered by Resolution No. 1319, last week
urged the Indonesian government to disarm and disband the militias
in East Nusa Tenggara province, following the attack on the office
of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) in Atambua last
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Rusdiharjo said the Indonesian Defense Forces and the National
Police have discussed, at both central and regional levels, the
logistics needed to disarm the population, including the West
Timor-based militias.
</P>
<P>
Concrete action includes strengthening troops in west Timor to
restore security, and to confiscate weapons, Rusdiharjo added.
</P>
<P>
The government has sent two battalions, a total of 1,200 men,
consisting of both police and soldiers to Atambua to restore order,
as well as to prevent the violence from spreading to other regions.
</P>
<P>
More troops would be deployed in the near future, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid who just
returned from a trip to the United States to attend a millennium
summit Monday expressed the hope that the international community
should provide aid to help settle the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
Atambua, a city bordering with East Timor, was the center for
international relief efforts for more than 120,000 East Timorese
still living in refugee camps across the border, after their
homeland voted one year ago to secede from Indonesia.

<TEXT>
<P>
Aceh Besar Police Chief Superintendent Sayed Husaini said no
fatalities or significant damage had been reported as a result of
the two incidents.
</P>
<P>
"The first device, a homemade grenade, exploded at the
Baiturrahman police subprecinct office at 3 a.m. (local time),
causing minor damage to the office's terrace. While the second, a
homemade bomb, exploded at the Aceh provincial council building,
blowing in the front door of a room normally occupied by the
council's Commission B," Husaini was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Husaini said the rebel Free Aceh Movement (GAM) was definitely
responsible for the explosion.
</P>
<P>
In separately developments, 10 people were reportedly killed in
different places in Aceh on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government and the GAM have reached an agreement
to extend their three-month cease-fire accord which expired on
September 2.
</P>
<P>
But new Defense Minister Muhamad Mahfud M.D. last week said the
government would not extend the accord beyond December because the
rebels have used it to strengthen their forces.
</P>
<P>
Mahfud said GAM had used the reduced level of violence since
June to stockpile thousands of weapons and build up its combat
forces.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Aceh have been fighting for 25 years for independence,
a greater share of oil profits and the right to impose Islamic
religious laws. Thousands have been killed in decades of fighting
between Indonesian security forces and Aceh rebels.

<HEADLINE> Suspects for Killing Militia Leader in Indonesia's W. Timor Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian investigation team
has the names of the suspects allegedly responsible for the
killing of militia leader Olivio Mendoza Moruk, whose murder was
said to be the trigger for last Wednesday's violence.
</P>
<P>
"We already have the names of the suspects and we are awaiting
the appropriate time to arrest them. They number more than five
people," Police Senior Superintendent T.H.L. Tobing said Monday in
Kupang, capital of East Nusa Tenggara province.
</P>
<P>
Tobing said the suspects in Olivio's murder were henchmen of a
local criminal gang leader Aloysius Bere, who was delivered by
Olivio to the police after he attempted to extort money from
Olivio's driver.
</P>
<P>
Bere's men killed Olivio in revenge for having handed their
leader to the police, Tobing said.
</P>
<P>
"The perpetrators are all local men. There is no indication of
involvement by infiltrators from East Timor or of some sort of
international conspiracy," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Tobing, a total of eight people, including Olivio
and three staff members of the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees (UNHCR), had been killed in the violence in and
around Atambua, a city in East Nusa Tenggara province, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three staff members of the UNHCR were killed when an angry
mob of pro-Jakarta East Timorese or so-called militia launched an
armed attack on the representatives office of the UNHCR in Atambua.
</P>
<P>
Four local people were burned to death in their homes and two
others seriously injured after Olivio's supporters set fire on
around 67 houses in Lorotulus village near Atambua.
</P>
<P>
In the case of the murder of the three U.N. relief workers, the
investigation team had yet to find a suspect.
</P>
<P>
"There is no one arrested yet on suspicion of involvement in
the attack on the UNHCR office in Atambua that left three
international staff members dead," Tobing said.
</P>
<P>
He added the police were currently questioning 15 people over
the attack.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Responds Positively to Rising OPEC Oil Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thai baht moved between 41.43-41.52 baht a U.S. dollar Monday,
stronger than 41.59 baht a dollar on Friday. This was considered a
psychologically positive response to a decision made by the OPEC
at a meeting in Vienna Sunday to raise its overall oil production
by 800,000 barrels a day, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ten members of the world's powerful oil cartel, excluding U.N.
sanction-bound Iraq, agreed at a meeting in Vienna, Austria, to
increase overall oil production to 26.2 million barrels a day as
of October 1, an increase of three percent or 800,000 barrels a
day, to reduce soaring world oil prices, being feared to affect
economic recovery and growth of oil importing countries.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers said the increased oil supply should be enough to
quell anxiety among importing nations and bring prices back down
into the cartel's preferred range of 22-28 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said, however, that it could actually take some months
before world oil prices would fall to around 20-25 dollars a
barrel sought by major oil importers, including the United States
and European countries.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that stronger baht also resulted from stronger
yen to 105.90 yen a U.S. dollar, from 106.28 yen on Friday,
following an announcement of improved gross domestic products (GDP)
by the Japanese government.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese top gymnast Lu Yufu
suffered injury to his neck and was replaced by Zheng Lihui for
the coming the Millennium Olympic Games, said Chinese team manager
of the gymnastics delegation here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lu, 22, sustained the injury Monday afternoon as he hesitated
in his tumbling before heading down to the floor over the vault,
Zhang Jian told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Lu Yufu is an all-around gymnast of world-class calibre. He
has maintained his top form in the past six months, earning his
Olympic berth against rings specialist Dong Zheng," said manager
Zhang.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity for both Lu himself and the Chinese gymnastics
team," said the Chinese top gymnastics official, "Yet it's not
expected to exert too much effects over China's prospect of
winning the men's team title in Sydney as we have another two
substitutes of strong capabilities."
</P>
<P>
Zheng Lihui, replacement of Lu Yufu, was training in New Castle,
some two-hour journey away from Sydney, and was called into the
athletes village through proper procedures, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Zheng, with a height of 1.58 meters, reapt his
first all-around individual title from the 19th Universiade in
Italy in August 1997 before spearheading his provisional teammates
for the national team title in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Started training at the age of nine, Zheng finished fourth in
the Olympic gymnastics trials in May this year.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yufu, who was recruited into the national squad in 1995,
savored his first success in the world arena by reaping the gold
medals in the floor exercise and pommel horse in the East Asia
Games in South Korea in May 1997, where he was also a member of
the championship team.
</P>
<P>
Also a member of the Chinese team that won the World
Championships in Lausanne in August 1997, Lu became national vault
champion in 1998, and helped China retain the team title in the
last World Championships in 1999, besides a fifth place finish in
the individual all-around competitions in Tianjin, China.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Hopes for Best but Medals in Millennium Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- With a 14-athlete delegation,
Singapore is just hoping for the best performances of its
competitors instead of any medal of any color in the Millennium
Olympic Games to be opened two days later.
</P>
<P>
Eric Song, deputy chef de mission, said uppon his arrival in
Sydney on Tuesday that "our expectations are only that they do
their personal best here, only that they try their hardest."
</P>
<P>
Since 1948 when Singapore started competing in the Summer
Olympics, the tiny country of four million population reapt only
one medal, a surprise silver from weightlifter Tan Howe Liang in
the lightweight division in Rome in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The best hope of Singapore in Sydney is pinned upon swimmer
Joscelin Yeo, who is competing in her second Olympics and could be
in five events.
</P>
<P>
"She is our Golden Girl, and we are hoping she makes several
finals," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Yeo, a multiple national record holder, is one of eight
Singaporean swimmers but the only one to reach the "A" qualifying
time for the Games, and Song said he has a simple goal for Yeo,
saying "just to go as fast as she can."
</P>
<P>
Besides swimming, Singapore also have three competitors in
sailing, two in table tennis and one in shooting.
</P>
<P>
Table tennis players Jing Junhong and Li Jiawei, both were born
in China, are the other hopefuls as they tied for third in the
women's doubles at the U.S. Open in July by beating world
champions Wang Nan and Li Ju along the way.

Hui Autonomous Region, will soon be extinguished.
</P>
<P>
Fire fighters have put out flames on a 1.93 million square
meter area or 87 percent of fire at the Rujigou mining area.
</P>
<P>
The mining area is known for producing Taixi coal, dubbed "
black gold" because it is low phosphorus, low sulphur, produces
less dust with intense heat. The region exports 600,000 tons of
Taixi coal each year to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, owing to spontaneous combustion, an estimated 650
million tons of Taixi coal were burned out annually, causing great
loss to the state.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia managed to extinguish the fire as early as 1988 and
curbed the expansion of flames in both northern and southern
directions.

<HEADLINE> Software Tracks Oil Left in Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Like a human being, an
oilfield had its own life expectancy, and a computer simulation of
the field will make it possible for people to know it.
</P>
<P>
After decades of drilling, an oilfield will inevitably start
dying and send its human explorers desperately seeking means for
its life support.
</P>
<P>
One means is a computer simulation of the field where oil and
water movement after drilling blurs people's ability to find the
remaining oil, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
So when the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Software
announced last weekend the release of software to simulate oil
reserve, it livened up the hopes of China's major petroleum
companies amid soaring international oil prices.
</P>
<P>
China's first such software, called PRIS, was developed by the
Research and Development Center for Parallel Software after 10
years of research.
</P>
<P>
It has tested the Daqing and Shengli oilfields and proven
effective in locating what's left.
</P>
<P>
"Years of drilling make the oil reserve shift considerably, and
the situation is further complicated by the interchange of oil and
water," explained Sun Jiachang, chief research scientist."This
software can simulate this shift clearly and therefore predict
where (the remaining oil) is now."
</P>
<P>
The software, for example, has imitated and shown 31 years of
change in Shengli in east China's Shandong Province by processing
data from 1 million units of underground blocks.
</P>
<P>
"The results of the simulation led to a re-consideration of
drilling wells there," Sun said. "That means either less waste or
more profit."
</P>
<P>
He said the software will soon be applied to other old
oilfields in China.

<HEADLINE> Survey Reveals Chinese Optimistic About Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey conducted by
MasterCard International showed that Chinese people are highly
optimistic about their future standards of living and the country'
s economic development.
</P>
<P>
Consumers' confidence in the whole Asia Pacific region has
started to level off after a strong rally last year, today's China
Daily quoted the survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
Carried out twice a year in 13 countries and regions of the
Asian Pacific area, the MasterCard survey aims to find out how
consumers feel about economic trends in the coming six months.
</P>
<P>
Interviewees are asked to give their views on the futures of
five basic economic factors including employment, the economy,
regular income, the stock market, and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
A composite index, called the Masterindex, is then drawn from
the five indexes to give a picture of consumer confidence in the
future economy. It ranges from 0, the most pessimistic, to 100,
the most optimistic.
</P>
<P>
The recent survey was conducted among 5,469 customers in 13
Asia Pacific markets.
</P>
<P>
"China is the only market where the Masterindex has kept rising,
" said Han Weiqiang, vice-president and country manager of
MasterCard China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese consumers are obviously optimistic about the economy
and their standards of living, and upbeat about regular income and
the stock market. Although the employment index has also advanced
slightly, consumers are still cautious about the future in that
sector, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
However, in the whole region, the index eased from the previous
survey results.

<HEADLINE> New Research Reduces Birth Defects (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- At least 20,000 Chinese
babies have escaped major defects in their nervous system in the
last two years, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A new medical research has reduced birth defects, sources with
the National Center for Maternal and Infant Health said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called neural tube defect means the embryo's nerve do
not develop properly and taking vitamin B has been found to be the
best defence available so far.
</P>
<P>
Mothers were told to take supplements of folic acid, a kind of
vitamin B, every day from the time they decided to have a baby
until the third month of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
According to researchers from China and the US, the number of
cases of the disorder was reduced by 70 percent by taking 0.4
milligrams folic acid daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the center show that each year, throughout the
world, 300,000 to 400,000 babies are born with the defect. China
has the highest number of cases, with 80,000 to 100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
Neural tube defects account for one-third of all birth defects
in China. Affected babies are born with no brain or with an
exposed spine. Most are born dead or die within a year and the few
survivors are usually disabled.
</P>
<P>
Conducted by Beijing Medical University (BMU), a study of diets
of pregnant Chinese women found that an average of 30 percent of
them at a reproductive age suffer from folic acid deficiency. (

<HEADLINE> New Research Reduces Birth Defects (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Health researchers found out that an ancient Chinese tradition
of "winter marriage" closely followed by childbirth was factor in
the disorder.
</P>
<P>
They realized the defect occurred during the woman's pregnancy
in the winter when there was a shortage of green vegetables and
fruit rich in folic acid, now known as being essential to an
embryo's healthy development.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to save as many as 80,000 Chinese babies from
being born with fatal birth defects each year, a unique research
project into neural tube defects was started in 1990 by the US
Center for Diseases Control, the Chinese Ministry of Health (MOH)
and BMU.
</P>
<P>
The experts now believe that controlling neural tube defects
with moderate dosages of folic acid is, so far, the best way to
prevent those defect.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, MOH designated the method one of the ten best medical
techniques to be introduced in China's vast rural areas.
</P>
<P>
MOH and the State Family Planning Commission expect to spread
the research results throughout the country as soon as possible so
that more babies are born without defects.
</P>
<P>
To this end, in 1997, MOH approved the production of a special
folic acid supplement called "SCRIANEN". It is being made by the
pharmaceutical factory of BMU.
</P>
<P>
Already more than two million new brides and pregnant women in
411 counties in 27 provinces, municipalities and autonomous
regions have taken such birth defect prevention measures since
1998.
</P>
<P>
To make people more confident in "SCRIANEN," the National
Center for Maternal and Infant Health, the pharmaceutical factory
of BMU and the People's Insurance Company of China will pay
compensation to any woman taking folic acid whose baby is born
with defect.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebels Say Gov't Anti-drug Plan Will Worsen Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's largest rebel force,
the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), claimed on
Monday that the government's anti-drug program, Plan Colombia,
will worsen the country's civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
FARC spokesman Andres Paris said that Colombia is implementing
the plan because of "U.S. pressure." He asked the government to
revise the plan.
</P>
<P>
Although Plan Colombia will not be carried out for some time,
people are already panicking in areas that will be affected. They
fear for their sovereignty and the peace between neighboring
countries, said Andres.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadorian authorities warned that spraying illegal drug fields
with chemicals in Colombia will cause the emigration of Colombian
peasants to their territory.
</P>
<P>
Plan Colombia, which involves 1.3 billion U.S. dollars in aid
to Colombia, comprises a series of projects overseen by President
Andres Pastrana. The projects are intended to fight drug
trafficking, create a peaceful environment, improve development,
and find substitutes for illegal drug cultivation. Plan Colombia
will require a total of 7.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
FARC is the largest and oldest surviving rebel force in Latin
America. It has 15,000 members and controls about 40 percent of
Colombia's territory.
</P>
<P>
The FARC is engaged in slow-moving peace talks with the
government, but no cease-fire deal has been agreed upon as part of
the peace process that aims to end a decade-old conflict in which
35,000 people have died.

<HEADLINE> Canada Reaches Health Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Everyone had to make compromises," said Chretien referring to
the health care agreement, which falls short of the annual 18.7
billion dollars (about 12.7 billion U.S. dollars) demanded by
premiers for health care and education transfer to provinces.
</P>
<P>
But the shortfalls will be compensated by Ottawa's offer of a
guaranteed annual increases of four percent to bring total
transfers to 21 billion (about 14.2 U.S. dollars) in the 2005-2006
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Other federal offers include 1 billion dollars (about 676.9
million U.S. dollars) for health equipment purchases, 500 million(
about 338.5 million U.S. dollars) for information technology and
800 million (about 541.5 million U.S. dollars) for basic primary
care.
</P>
<P>
The federal government also agreed to children's health
programs of up to 2.2 billion dollars (about 1.5 billion U.S.
dollars) over five years.
</P>
<P>
"Now that we are in a better financial position, we have
restored the money to the provinces," Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
In return, the provinces are requested to develop regular
report cards to allow Canadians to compare the quality of health
services across the country.
</P>
<P>
The deal ends months of disputes between the federal and
provincial governments over issues ranging from the amount of
funding to the health system.
</P>
<P>
Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, who previously criticized the
accountability condition attached to the funding as unacceptable,
emerged from the meeting to express "satisfaction that I have
agreed to this accord."
</P>
<P>
Ontario Premier Mike Harris hailed the deal an "important
first step." "We'll be able to afford new technologies and new
treatment," he said.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Protest Against High Oil Prices Enters 3rd Day  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Belgian truckers entered
their third day protest Tuesday against rising fuel prices in an
effort to bring down fuel tax by negotiating with the government.
</P>
<P>
However, Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt said Monday
that a cut in excise tax on fuel oil was not the right way to
solve the problem of rising prices.
</P>
<P>
The issue should be discussed at Friday's cabinet meeting, said
Verhofstadt, who is in New York to promote Belgian trade.
</P>
<P>
Belgian truckers demanding tax cuts to drive down the oil price
brought the capital to a chaos Sunday and Monday. Truck drivers
vowed to continue their blockade after storming from a meeting
with Transport Minister Isabelle Durant Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian protest was launched just as a six-day blockade of
French oil refineries and storage depots came to an end, but
protests gathered pace in Britain and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, truckers, taxi drivers, farmers, tour
operators and others who claim that high oil prices are hurting
their businesses, continue their protests in France, the
Netherlands and Germany.
</P>
<P>
In France, protesters cleared blockades only after the
government made concessions to them. However, protests continued
in scattered French cities, despite government concessions.
</P>
<P>
A wave of protests has moved across Europe after truckers and
farming groups in France won a 15 percent cut in fuel tax
following their blockades.

BRASILIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Singapore's

<HEADLINE> Polls Show Gore Maintains Momentum in U.S. Presidential Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- New polls released Monday
showed that U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore has
maintained his momentum in the presidential race since the
Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
According to new state polls, Gore has been closing the gap in
many states that leaned toward his Republican rival Georgy Bush
for much of the year and has been leading in others that were
close.
</P>
<P>
Gore is even with Bush in Colorado and Missouri, and has surged
ahead in New York and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll of 534 registered voters conducted by
Talmey Drake Research for the local news organizations, Gore had
the support of 43 percent voters while Bush had 40 percent in
Colorado. Bush led by 14 points in July.
</P>
<P>
In New York, Gore was ahead of Bush by 56 percent to 31 percent
among likely voters in a Marist poll. He had an 11 point lead in
April.
</P>
<P>
In Missouri where race has been close in past months, Gore had
45 percent and Bush had 40 percent in a Zogby poll.
</P>
<P>
In Illinois, Gore led Bush by 50 percent to 35 percent in a
Zogby poll of 601 likely voters. Earlier polls showed the race was
close.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gore enjoys an edge in some new national polls,
while others show a close race.
</P>
<P>
A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Monday gave Gore 49
percent and Bush 42 percent among likely voters. The poll of 727
likely voters was taken Friday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An NBC News-Wall Street Journal national poll of registered
voters showed Gore at 45 percent and Bush at 42 percent. The poll
of 2,017 registered voters was taken Thursday through Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Syndey to Auction Remains During Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) is to start auctioning
Olympic items even before the end of the Millennium Games, hoping
to recover 5 million Australian dollars (2.8 million US dollars)
of its costs.
</P>
<P>
Everything from sports equipment, furniture and whitegoods from
the Olympic village, to banners now on Sydney's streets, will be
sold under a program called the Remains of the Games, said The
Australian on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The first auctions will be held by the end of the month and
ahead of the closing ceremony. It is believed to be the first
time an organising committee has included the sale of memorabilia
in its budget.
</P>
<P>
"It is important from an organiser's point of view that we
achieve an effective disposal of the remains of the Games that is
smooth, efficient, and which helps make our budget numbers," SOCOG
chief executive Sandy Hollway said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Hollway said demand for items ranging from office chairs to
baseballs was hard to determine, saying "if I were bidding, I
would be bidding for something for the look of the Games. It's
human nature to go 'I've been working here, I want something', and
that's going to be hard to manage."
</P>
<P>
However, one problem may be trying to get the items from the
sporting arenas to the auctioneers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Since word of the
establishment of Shenzhen's Virtual University Park hit the
streets, 50 Chinese and foreign universities have either become
members or are in the process of applying.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three Chinese universities such as Beijing University,
Qinghua University, Harbin Industry University and Hong Kong
University of Science and Technology have already set up
representative offices in the park, while 17 other overseas
universities, including Bauman Moscow State Technical University,
the Russian Academy of Science Far Eastern Branch, National
Technical University of Ukraine and Tunghai University have
applied for becoming on-line members.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen is the first of China's five special economic zones
and celebrated its 20th founding anniversary in late August. In
the past two decades, Shenzhen has created an economic miracle and
experienced an annual growth rate of over 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the city has only two colleges. The park is meant to
train more qualified workers in a short time for Shenzhen's future
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yingli, deputy secretary-general of the Shenzhen City
People's Government, said the virtual university park is not
simply a place for on-line education, but an educational base for
multi-level training courses and a center where universities,
enterprises, and venture capital groups may come together,
creating opportunities for industrialization of scientific
achievements.
</P>
<P>
A main building for the virtual university park, with a
combined floor space of 15,000 sq m, is under construction in
Shenzhen's high-tech industrial zone and should be completed by
the end of the year. It will include rooms for lectures, reading
and meetings, along with comprehensive service systems,
telecommunications network systems, as well as workshops for
hatching scientific and technological achievements into products.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the Shenzhen City People's Government has
also signed an agreement with Harbin Industry University to set up
the Shenzhen International Technological Innovations Academy in
the Shenzhen High-Tech Industrial Zone.
</P>
<P>
The projected academy will cover an area of 30,000 sq m and
will cost 80 million yuan. On completion, the academy will be used
by Harbin Industry University as a base for advanced technology
research and also as a talent training center.
</P>
<P>
Construction on the infrastructure will start in October and is
expected to be finished in one year.

CANBERRA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Clash occurred again Tuesday
morning as police escorted delegates to the World Economic Forum
Summit at Melbourne's Crown Casino, the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters surrounded the meeting site for the

About 200 delegates were stopped outside of the site and later
sent in by boats.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic basketball
teams fled Melbourne to head for Sydney Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The basketball legends, who were trapped in a hotel, made a
bizarre predawn exit in early morning and got onto buses by 6:45
AM.
</P>
<P>
With protesters besieging their hotel, which also was the site
of the World Economic Forum, the men's and women's teams were
virtual under house arrest in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
About 100 protesters sat in the street and blocked the main
exit near the front entrance of the Crown Casino and Hotel. The
protesters decided by voice vote that they would not move aside to
let the basketball teams leave.
</P>
<P>
The buses then turned around and headed toward a different
exit, where another group of demonstrators had gathered.
</P>
<P>
Not believing that the buses held Olympic athletes,the
protesters initially refused to move. After the police asked them
to come inside the concrete barricades and have a look for
themselves,a 21-year-old with a punk rock haircut volunteered to
do the job.
</P>
<P>
"I looked in the first bus and it didn't look like a
basketball team, but then I looked inside the second bus," said
the mohawk man, Yanni Cotis of Adelaide. "We had a quick
discussion about whether to let them go through and decided to let
them leave."
</P>
<P>
The players' family members had left a few hours earlier,
before most of the protesters arrived at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
The teams had planned to stay in Melbourne until later this
week,but the protests that virtually shut down the hotel forced a
hasty change in plans.
</P>
<P>
The men's team had to cancel practice Monday because of the
protests, while the women's team made it out of the hotel on foot
before being forced to return by boat.

<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Marie-Jose Perec is preparing
to desert her five-star city hotel and flee to the Olympic village
to avoid the pressure around her 400m clash with Australia's Cathy
Freeman.
</P>
<P>
After her arrival in Sydney last Friday, the triple Olympic
champion has maintained her silence and ignored persistent
attempts on her Olympic title defence.
</P>
<P>
But local newspaper The Australia said that Perec was seriously
considering check-out of her hotel in downtown and moving to the
athletes' village where heavy security will fend off media
intrusion.
</P>
<P>
Perec is France's highest-profile Olympian after winning her
second 400m gold medal in 1996 in Atlanta where she also won the
200m title.
</P>
<P>
Perec has so far refused to comment on her form or winning
chances, and is becoming increasingly agitated by the media who
have trailed her around the city.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no sign of the cordon set up around Perec by
her German coach Wolfgang Meier and boy friend Anthuan Maybank.
</P>
<P>
She has since rejected interviews from August 24 on the eve of
the Golden League Grand Prix in Brussels, one of five meetings she
has pulled out of since her last race in Nice in July.
</P>
<P>
"The interview, the press, all that. It's finished," she said,
"I will not talk anymore before Sydney."
</P>
<P>
Before her arrival at Sydney, there had been no sighting of her
since Nice, where she was third in what was her first 400m event
in four years. Her only other race this year was the 200m at
Lausanne in the week before, where she was second.
</P>
<P>
Perec's performance at Nice was impressive as she clocked 50.32
seconds, suggesting that an Olympic gold-medal winning comeback
from a career-threatening bout of Epstein Bar virus was indeed
possible.

system for athletes, labelled unacceptable days ago, had improved
markedly, Australian Olympic Committee president John Coates said.

Two other wrestlers and the team physiotherapist arrived even

the MPC from the media village, which would normally take about 20
minutes.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Muhammad Ali, the greatest
boxing legend who lit the Atlanta Olympic cauldron four years ago,
arrived in Australia Monday to attend Sydney's Olympic Games
opening cermeony.
</P>
<P>
Ali, who suffers from Parkinson's Disease, provided one of the
emotional highlights of the 1996 opening ceremony when he battled
tremors to light the flame.
</P>
<P>
His arrival has ignited speculation he may be more than just a
spectator at the Sydney opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Other high profile arrivals yesterday included the first
gymnast ever to record a perfect 10 at Olympics, Nadia Comaneci,
Spanish tennis star Aranxia Sanchez-Vicario and blind opera star

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Threaten Lawsuit over Dossier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Angry members of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) threatened to sue their
critics as the Australian immigration department revealed it had
detected low-level criminal elements in the Olympic Family, The
Australian reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
IOC director-general Francois Carrard said it was time for the
IOC to attack, saying that "I'm wondering whether it isn't time
for us members, coordinated by the IOC, to condemn the people to
continue to put into question our personal dignity, who question
our honesty."
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we should see if we can do something legally to attack
those who continue to call our dignity into question."
</P>
<P>
Carrard was reacting to the publication of dossiers on IOC
members, prepared for Salt Lake City's disgraced bid to host the
2002 Winter Games. The report released by Salt Lake officials in
May, has the word "gled", the Dutch word for "money", written next
to the names of some IOC members.
</P>
<P>
IOC board member and ethics commission chariman Keba Mbaye, a
former vice-president of the International Court of Justice, said
the IOC members named in the report could sue for libel.
</P>
<P>
"It would have to be done individually by IOC members or a
class action by members of the IOC," he said, "The document calls
into question the ways in which (IOC) voting takes place, how
favours seem to be circulated. It seems to be a kind of list and a
bait for the IOC members."
</P>
<P>
But IOC senior vice-president Dick Pound predicted the IOC
would lose a lawsuit, saying that "suing for libel in the United
States as a member of the IOC these days would be an uphill
struggle. I think the courts would be very unsympathetic."

SYDNEY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sydney Olympic Games beach
volleyball competition may meet a rare protest as Bondi beach
protesters plan to use sun-reflecting mirrors to disrupt
television coverage of the event.
</P>
<P>
Residents are angered by a 10,000-seater stand that has been
driven into the sacred sand of one of the most famous icons of
Australia's outdoor culture. They have called it an eyesore.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't about anti-beach volleyball or anti-Olympics,"said
Bondi Olympic Watch spokesman Kevin Alder. "It's simply about the
planning process...the voice of the many people that hasn't been
heard throughout the whole planning process."
</P>
<P>
The protesters, who plan to reflect a dazzling glare onto the
stand and at television cameras, will launch their campaign on
Thursday when the Olympic torch passes through Bondi Beach.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaign Hit by Ad Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The campaign of U.S.
Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush was hit by an ad
controversy Tuesday as his Democratic rival felt annoyed by the
word "rats" in a Republican ad criticizing Al Gore's Medicare plan.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a disappointing development. I've never seen
anything like it," said Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gore's running mate Joseph Lieberman described the
ad "very disappointing and strange."
</P>
<P>
Bush dismissed as "bizarre and weird" any allegation that the
Republicans want to send a subliminal message by flashing the word
"rats" in the ad.
</P>
<P>
"One frame out of 900 hardly in my judgment makes a conspiracy,
" Bush said Tuesday in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced this is not intentional," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alex Castellanos, who made the ad for the Republican Party,
explained that he flashed the word, part of "bureaucrats," to make
the ad more visually interesting.
</P>
<P>
It was just a coincidence that the letters appearing first
spelled out "rats," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ad, which has run for more than two weeks in several states,
said Gore's prescription drug plan will be run by bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
Bush's communications director Karen Hughes said the ad was
being replaced Tuesday as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Bush campaigned in Florida touting his health care plan Tuesday
while Gore headed across Ohio in a school bus to focus on the
education issue.

WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton remains fully committed to the Middle East peace process
but recognizes the difficulties to narrow the gaps between
Israelis and Palestinians, the White House said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have no illusions here," P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the

extraordinarily difficult process. There are still very hard
decisions that both parties have to make. We continue to review
the situation and formulate ideas that we think can help bring the
parties closer together."
</P>
<P>
Crowley noted that Clinton, who has been trying to broke a
Middle East peace settlement before he leaves office in January, "
remains fully committed to support the parties and is willing to
do everything that he can to help them reach an agreement."
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. envoy Dennis Ross would continue to have contacts
with both sides over the next couple of weeks on the margins of
the United Nations General Assembly.

ATHENS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Greek police in the northern
city of Thessaloniki arrested two Belgians Monday night for being
in possession of 52,300 ecstasy pills.
</P>
<P>
The ecstasy pills were found in a truck en route from the
Netherlands during a search by Thessaloniki police in the
Posidonia region of the city, police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pills were produced in the Netherlands and then transported
to countries throughout Europe. Greek police was notified by the
European Union (EU) police forces that the smugglers used
combinations of four tractor-trailers to avert attention.
</P>
<P>
This is the largest-ever seizure of ecstasy pills in Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greece's Health and Welfare Ministry said Tuesday that ecstasy
pill related deaths were on the rise in Europe as high
concentrations of strychnine were found in the illegally produced
and sold hallucinogen.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Amendments to PNTR Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate on Tuesday
rejected several amendments trying to link the bill granting
permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to China with
prison labor and other issues.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's debate, the Senate voted 68-29 to reject an
amendment by Democrat Paul Wellstone of Minnesota calling on China
to bar the sale of products made by prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Senate also rejected by voice vote an amendment by Democrat
Robert Byrd of West Virginia requiring China to disclose more
information about its subsidies to state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of the PNTR bill are increasingly optimistic that
they would be able to defeat all of the proposed amendments to
ensure final passage of the trade bill possibly by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
Another major hurdle to the passage of the PNTR bill is an
amendment proposed Monday by Republican Senator Fred Thompson and
Democratic Senator Robert Torricelli.
</P>
<P>
The bill demanded the U.S. government impose sanctions on
foreign companies and nations that are involved in weapons
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
The Thompson amendment is strongly opposed by most senators,
the Clinton administration and the business community in the
country eager to do business with China.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Max Baucus, a leading supporter of the PNTR
bill, said approval of the Thompson amendment would be a "grave
mistake" for the nation.
</P>
<P>
"It will seriously damage important American economic interests
and if added to the bill, it will kill PNTR," he said.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman expressed his confidence Tuesday that
the PNTR bill would sail through the Senate as the debate on the
bill entered its seventh day.
</P>
<P>
"We have the votes for the underlying bill to grant China
permanent normal trade relations. There's no doubt about that,"
said White House spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
"We have close to 70 senators, by all counts, who have publicly
expressed their support," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he warned that senators could still choke the historic bill
if they pass any amendment to it.
</P>
<P>
"The key point for us is that any amendment to this bill, any
change to this bill, is a recipe for delay. And delay in an
election year leads to all kinds of uncertainty," said Siewert.

In an interview with German magazine "Stern", published this
week, Prodi said that such an action would also be in the
interests of the United States, because "no one can eternally live
with such a payment deficit".
</P>
<P>
The UN official was referring to the huge trade deficit that
the United States has piled up.
</P>
<P>
However, Prodi admitted that the joint intervention is not easy,
even more difficult shortly before the U.S. general elections.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that Euro exchange course is "disappointing" low. An
important reason for Euro's slide is lack of common European
economic policy and a political equivalent of the European Central
Bank, he added.

UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chile said that
globalization generates both opportunities and challenges and the
United Nations should work hard to make globalization inclusive to

Chilean Foreign Minister Maria Soledad Alvear Valenvuela, who

it can also deepen inequalities which have always characterized

international cooperation, focused especially on broadening access
to the knowledge-based economy," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
On the challenges of globalization, she said, "We recognize
that the question of whether or not to participate in
globalization is no longer relevant today. Isolation is not a
realistic option."
</P>
<P>
"Chile views globalization as a source of opportunities, one
which has brought us significant benefits," she said. "Through the
opening of our economy, we have been able to double the size of
our gross domestic product within 10 years, compared to the 50
years required for the previous duplication."
</P>
<P>
Globalization quickens the flow of goods, services, capital,
information and technology, but also makes many developing
countries further marginalized in the process.
</P>
<P>
"The characteristic of globalization tends to bypass domestic
regulations and the control of governments," she said. "This lack
of regulation is not counterbalanced by other standards or
authorities."
</P>
<P>
"We must fill this vacuum," she said.
</P>
<P>
"As never before in the history of humanity, the solution of
the daily problems faced by people all over the world depends on
collective international decision-making," she said. "The
challenge confronting the United Nations today is to lend a
certain degree of order to globalization."
</P>
<P>
She said effective institutions and rules should be established
so that globalization will serve to advance the development of our
peoples and the fruits of scientific and technological advancement
are employed to improve the lives of all human beings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leads World in E-Commerce Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 12 (Xinhua) -- In 1999, the United
States spent 80.5 billion U.S. dollars on e-commerce, almost six
times as much as Japan, the next biggest spender.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Tuesday by U.S. market
researcher International Data Corporation (IDC), the distant
second Japan spent 13.5 billion U.S. dollars on e-commerce in the
same year, and no other country comes close to spending 10 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for the large discrepancy can be attributed
to the fact that the United States has the most advanced
information technology (IT) structure in the world, IDC said. In
1999, the United States spent close to 385 billion dollars on IT,
accounting for more than 46 percent of worldwide IT spending.
Japan is second in overall IT spending, with close to 90 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
IDC also said that at 43.8 million, more PCs shipped to the
United States than any other country in 1999. In comparison, 4.8
million PC were shipped to China, and 10.6 million shipped in
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Talks Open At U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A new round of so-
called "proximity talks" on Cyprus opened on Tuesday afternoon at
the U.N. headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth round of meetings between President of Cyprus
Glafcos Clerides, attending the meetings as leader of the Greek
Cypriots, and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash since the
current series began in New York last December.
</P>
<P>
Proximity talks mean that the two men do not meet face-to-face
but hold separate talks with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
his Special Advisor on Cyprus Alvaro de Soto.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman office, the U.N. chief first had a
meeting with Clerides, and then with Denktash in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Annan asked them to start the talks with good faith and without
preconditions on all issues before them, the spokesman office said.
</P>
<P>
The talks will continue on Wednesday, the spokesman office
added.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has been trying for decades to reunite
Cyprus as a bizonal, bi-communal federation, as prescribed in U.N.
Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been virtually partitioned since troops from Turkey
took over the north in 1974 in reaction to a coup in Nicosia
engineered by the junta then ruling Greece.

<HEADLINE> Global E-Commerce to Crush Today's Supply Chains, Says Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to Forrester Research, the processes that are barely
able to handle today's 57 billion U.S. dollars in worldwide e-
commerce trade will be paralyzed by global e-commerce expected to
reach 6.8 trillion U.S. dollars by 2004. "The high variability in
global demand will force both manufacturers and shippers to
harness the Internet and create an information pipeline -- weeding
out today's weak supply chain links," Forrester said.
</P>
<P>
The research firm said that manufacturers should let
specialization and networked assets drive the next round of supply
chain upgrades because multinationals will tailor their operations
to e-business manufacturing networks by 2005. Forrester believes
that companies will thrive in the Internet economy by
participating in e-business networks -- resilient structures of
interdependent players cooperating in real time over the Net. The
first step for manufacturers will be to build manufacturing
networks, rather than focusing on supply chains.
</P>
<P>
In five years, the firm said, today's linear manufacturing
value chains will be broken down, replaced by networks of
manufacturing specialists that are all cooperating at Internet
speed to deliver products. Specialization will help firms excel in
core manufacturing and allow them to plug into multiple networks.
</P>
<P>
Forrester foresees an always-on global information pipeline,
which will incorporate an open tracking system, a trader
collaborative engine, and applications and services that enable
traders to adhere to government regulations.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Sanctions Against Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed in February after Austria's
conservative Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel brought members of the
far-right Freedom Party into his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Announcing an end to the sanctions, the French government,
which holds the current EU presidency, said the measures had been
useful and "they can now be lifted." In Vienna, Schuessel hailed
the EU decision as "a great success for Austria."
</P>
<P>
The French government on behalf of the EU members said the EU
would remain "especially vigilant" about the Freedom Party, which
campaigned against immigration and EU expansion in the run-up to
last year's parliamentary elections. Austria's Freedom Party
finished second among the six national political parties.
</P>
<P>
After the announcement, European Commission President Romano
Prodi said in a statement that the executive body of the EU "never
wanted Austria to be isolated."
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to see sanctions lifted," he said. "But the union
must remain vigilant about extremism and xenophobia, wherever they
arise in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Prodi also said the 15-nation bloc as a whole had lessons to
learn from the Austria episode. "I hope we will agree to refine
the instruments we have to deal with such problems. I want to see
improvements to the (EU) treaty, to make it easier to avoid such a
situation arising again," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Mixed Amid Earnings Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the close of session, the technology heavy Nasdaq composite
index fell 46.84 at 3,849.51 points. The index was down 82.06
Monday and 119.94 Friday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 37.74 at 11,233.23 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index fell 7.21 at 1,481.99.
</P>
<P>
The tech stocks moved higher in early trading but gave up all
of the gains later and closed lower as investors were obsessed by
worries about corporate earnings in the third quarters. A number
of companies had warned that their earnings in the third quarter
would not meet expectations and the warnings hit the market
broadly in the previous two sessions.
</P>
<P>
Investors eased worries about further hikes in interest rates
as more data showed that the U.S. economy is slowing and inflation
remains under control after six hikes in rates in the past 15
months. But uncertainty about investment returns arose because the
slowing economy could lower corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index moved higher today mainly because the financial
service companies and retailers performed well. Shares of J.P.
Morgan rose after a news report said the company is in talks with
Chase Manhattan for merging.
</P>
<P>
Shares of Best Buy were also up after the consumer electronics
retailer said it beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter
earnings and sales will continue to increase in the second half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 1.40 at 675.84 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies was down 1.19 at 532.43. But the American
Stock Exchange index rose 0.91 at 970.41.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,422 down, 1,384 up and 552
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 974.40 million shares from 895.71
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Endorses Lifting of Austria Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The EU made the decision after a three-men investigation
committee found clean human rights record in Austria and gave a
green light to the other 14 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that Belgium was
pleased with the role it had played but had agreed with the
proposal by France, the current EU presidency, to lift the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed in February after Austria's
conservative Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel brought members of the
far-right Freedom Party into his coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Announcing an end to the sanctions, the French government said
the measures had been useful and "they can now be lifted." In
Vienna, Schuessel hailed the EU decision as "a great success for
Austria."
</P>
<P>
Belgium, a vocal supporter of the sanctions against Austria,
has proposed that the EU should have an "early warning system" to
allow it to impose sanctions on a country where there was
perceived risk of rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
"Without the position taken by the 14, the entry into a
government of populist and xenophobic parties would have become
commonplace," Belgian said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian government hopes that the sanctions would have a "
dissuasive effect" within the EU as well as in candidate countries
for EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Belgium, like France, has an active far-right party and faces
local elections on October 10.
