<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Condemns NATO's Air Strikes Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Foreign Affairs Ministry
Friday expressed concern at the massive air strikes unleashed by
NATO against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO action, whose avowed justification was the prevention of
a humanitarian tragedy, has spawned a far more gigantic
humanitarian catastrophe than it was intended to prevent," the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the use of military force by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against a country which had
not mounted any aggression against a member state of the alliance,
set a most dangerous precedent and was an affront to international
law.
</P>
<P>
It added that such use of military force against a sovereign
state required authorization by the United Nations Security
Council under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
"Such unilateralism is not only illegal in terms of
international law, but also severely undermines the role of the
United Nations Security Council as the custodian of the
international peace and security," said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
It said that Zimbabwe was appealing to the NATO to put an
immediate end to its campaign of bombing and called for the
resumption of negotiations aimed at peaceful resolution to the
Yugoslavia crisis.

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Banish Poverty From Homesteads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Friday urged the Ugandans to banish poverty from their homesteads.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the appeal when attending Good Friday prayers at
Kashwa Church in Nyabushozi County of Mbarara District, home to
the president, a press release from the President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
He commended the people of the area for their visible
development projects which have enabled them to lay a strong
foundation for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers were encouraged to intensify their activities in
cattle keeping and to utilize their large tracts of land to rear
dairy cows while devoting another portion of the land to rearing
goats and indigenous cows.
</P>
<P>
The president said that sources of income generation should be
diversified, by planting eucalyptus trees and dodo mangoes, and
growing food crops.
</P>
<P>
Museveni also called on parents to observe hygiene and create
better conditions for their children at school.
</P>
<P>
With strenuous efforts by the government, Uganda has decreased
its poverty rate from 56 percent to 46 percent over a period of
two years.
</P>
<P>
However, the government still faces grave challenges. Its
adult illiteracy rate still tops at 38.4 percent and more than
half of its rural population are still living under the one-U.S.
dollar-per-day poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Poor infrastructure and lack of education constitute two key
factors resulting in poverty in most remote areas in the east
African country.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Parliament Condemns NATO Bombing of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' House of Representatives
(parliament) on Friday condemned the air strikes by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution unanimously adopted by all parties, the
parliament calls on the international community to exert pressure
to end the air strikes and seek a political settlement.
</P>
<P>
The resolution stresses that the territorial integrity and
sovereignty of Yugoslavia should be respected.
</P>
<P>
It points out that "not only Yugoslavia, but Europe and
humanity as a whole, will pay the price for a climax of the
crisis."
</P>
<P>
NATO started its air strikes against Serb targets on March 24
after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused to accept a
West-proposed peace agreement with separatist ethnic Albanians in
the Serb province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot legislature considers the use of military force as
unacceptable, noting that innocent people are killed and a new
wave of refugees is created with social, humanitarian and economic
repercussions for Europe.
</P>
<P>
It also believes that the NATO attack constitutes a flagrant
violation of international law and principles and the United
Nations Charter and a disregard of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The resolution expresses the House's conviction that "the
bombing will not solve the Kosovo crisis, but on the contrary it
will create conditions for further conflict, instability and
uncertainty in the sensitive Balkan region."
</P>
<P>
The House expresses solidarity to the people of Yugoslavia and
calls for the respect to the human rights of all citizens of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot parliament is organizing an all-party rally on
Saturday to condemn the ongoing NATO air strikes.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Asia Tour Hailed as Diplomatic Landmark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- President Hosni Mubarak's upcoming
Asia tour marks a landmark in the Egyptian diplomacy, Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This tour is the first step, to be followed by other tours, to
enhance Egyptian relations with Asia's major and important
countries," Moussa told the press prior to Mubarak's visits to
China, South Korea and Japan next week.
</P>
<P>
He lauded Egyptian-Chinese relations as "time-honored,"
pointing to China's key economic and political role in Asia and
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mubarak will discuss with Chinese leaders the
Middle East peace process, the economic turmoil in Southeast Asia,
the global economic scene and the prospective United Nations
reform, the Egyptian official said.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and China share understanding on developing the Suez
zone and launching joint projects. President Mubarak's visit to
Shanghai indicates Egypt's interest in this regard and in forging
effective economic partnership with China," he added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have set up a joint venture for developing an
Egyptian industrial zone in the north of the Gulf of Suez.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also saw "bright prospects for effective cooperation"
between Egypt and Japan in economic, scientific and environmental
areas.
</P>
<P>
"Japan has particular interest in the Middle East as an
energy-exporting region. This emanates its keenness on the
region's stability, the Mideast peace process and the Gulf scene
as well as the Iraq problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expected more prosperous relations between Egypt and
South Korea, saying that Egypt "is interested in peace" in the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt is ready to launch good offices to have the misgivings
between the two Koreas dispelled," he said, stressing that this
should be made upon requests from both countries, and in view of
the good ties maintained between Mubarak and leaders of the two
states.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko said here on Friday that the 12 heads of state of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) are unanimously opposed
to the use of force regarding the crisis in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The CIS state leaders also urged NATO to stop the airstrikes
against Yugoslavia. Lukashenko's comments came following a summit
meeting in Moscow among the 12 CIS heads of state on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin will represent the CIS member
states in elaborating their stand on the Balkan issue. "We insist
on solving the Balkan problem peacefully and justly," Lukashenko
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Both Belarus and Russia, which are coordinating their
operations on the Yugoslav issue, believe that NATO's attacks on
Yugoslavia are an aggression against a sovereign country, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko also pointed out that the recent visit by Russian
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov to Belgrade and Bonn sent a signal
to start negotiations on peacefully settling the current crisis in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, the NATO members, under the pressure of the United
States, "did not accept Russia's signal," he added.
</P>
<P>
During the summit meeting, the participants discussed issues
such as establishing free economic zones, the current situation in
Yugoslavia, and the appointment of a new executive secretary of
the CIS, Lukashenko said.

ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday said in
categorical terms that it reserves the right to raise the Jammu
and Kashmir issue at international forums and that Lahore
Declaration does not preclude this option.
</P>
<P>
"It is well within our right to take up the Kashmir dispute at
the international fora, we have been doing this in the past and
will continue to do so in future as well," Foreign Office
spokesman Tariq Altaf said at a Press briefing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was responding to a question on a recent
interview in an English language daily which quoted Indian Foreign
Minister Jaswant Singh as saying that the reaffirmation of Simla
Agreement in the Lahore Declaration precludes third party
mediation.
</P>
<P>
Altaf referred to the Article 6 of the Simla Agreement signed
by India and Pakistan in 1972 which commits both the countries to
resolving the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the U.N.
conventions and decisions.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the Indian contention that Kashmir was its
integral part.
</P>
<P>
"The entire world knows that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed
territory and it remains a dispute until the Kashmiris get their
right to self-determination and it is resolved according to
article 6 of the Simla Agreement," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has been raising the Kashmir issue at all
international fora, he said, stressing that it will continue to do
so.

WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A study, conducted by

Writing in Nature, the researchers said that if DNA strands
could be made with a switch to turn the current flowing through
them on and off, they could be used to build extremely tiny

Up to now no metallic wires that can be made as small or as

HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Australians kept to shine at the
world short-course swimming championships Friday, second day of
the to urnament as it broke one more wolrd mark and won two more
golds.
</P>
<P>
Australia, however, left as many as two gold medals slip away
as its men's 4x200-meter relay team, heavily favored to break the
world record, was disqualified and world record holder Samantha
Riley missed her first major final in eight years.
</P>
<P>
Grant Hackett set the men's 400 meters freestyle world record
in three minutes 35.01 seconds, cutting 4.8 seconds off the
previous record, to win the race. His countryman Ian Thorpe

Thorpe and I am just going to have to keep maintaining our success,
" Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
Josh Watson took the men's 200 meters backstroke title,
Australia's first ever victory in the event, in 1:54.67.
</P>
<P>
The Australian men's quartet posed a blistering time of 7:04.73
in the morning heats, but was disqualified by FINA as its swimmers
did not follow the proper order. An appeal against the
disqualification from Australia was dismissed lately by the world
swimming governing body.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Riley of Australia failed to qualify for
the women 200 meters breaststroke final after finishing a dismal
10th place overall. Her time of 2:28.63 was far away from her own
record of 2:20.85.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the problem is," Riley said. "I just had
nothing left in the tank."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan joined Australia to snatch two
golds each in the day's competitions.
</P>
<P>
American Olympic champion and holder of three world records
Jennifer Thompson won the women's 100 meters freestyle with a time
of 53.24 seconds before she doubled in the women's 50 meters
Butterfly, timing 26.18 seconds.

of the women's 100 meters medley in 59.35 seconds and became the
first woman ducking the one-minute barrier in the distance in the
world.
</P>
<P>
She broke the previous mark of 1:00.35 created just minutes ago
by Slovakia's Matina Moravcova in the previous heat.
</P>
<P>
"It was very satisfying to go out and get the record so soon
after losing it. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that
before," said the American swimming queen.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Masami Tanaka fulfilled her record-breaking dream as
she took the gold by timing 2:20.22 in the women's 200 meters
breaststroke, while Mai Nakamura won the women's 100 meters
Backstroke with a time of 58.67 seconds.

<HEADLINE> NATO Ambassadors Meet on Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) Spokesman said here Friday that the alliance's
foremost concerns remain the refugee issue in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Jamie Shea, the spokesman, said about 36,500 Kosovars fled on
Thursday compared to 21,000 on Wednesday. "We see a 10
kilometer-queue of people at the border with the former Yugoslav
republic of Mecedonia, that's about 25,000 people" who are waiting
to be able to leave.
</P>
<P>
"The refugee situation in the neighboring countries is
extremely grave and even graver by the hour, we have now 17,500 in
the process of entering the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia,
extra 14,500 in Albania in the last 24 hours, and 7,000 into
Montenegro," Shea said.
</P>
<P>
"This refugee situation means we are no longer facing a
internal Yugoslav crisis, we are facing a crisis in the entire
region with far-reaching consequences. Therefore NATO has to
address the situation alongside the efforts to do what we can to
hold the violence in Kosovo quickly, and thereby create the
conditions for the refugees to turn around and to go back, and try
to rebuild their lives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shea also said the focus of NATO ambassadors' meeting this
morning "was very much on what can we do rapidly, urgently to
mobilize our resources to help deal with this refugee calamity
which is now facing the entire region."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the NATO has any response to Ibrahim Rugova on the
invitation to come to Brussels, Shea said that he is not sure if
the alliance were able to respond freely Mr. Rugova will do so
because he has been invited to Bonn as well. "In fact, it's a
great pity we are not able to hear at the moment, nor are you able
to hear at the moment from most of the 60 members of the Kosovar
Albanian delegation at the Rambouillet talks," he said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at Osiris
Therapeutics in Baltimore wrote in the latest issue of Science
that they have isolated from adult bone marrow a master cell that
can be directed to grow bone or cartilage.
</P>
<P>
This is said to be a major step toward making replacement parts
of ailing or aged bodies.
</P>
<P>
They said that they isolated a single cell called a mesenchymal
stem cell, and grew it into a colony of more than a million cells
that could be induced to produce bone, cartilage or fat.
</P>
<P>
Stem cells are the body's building blocks. Some come only from
embryos and their use in research is opposed by many people. Other
stem cells such as the mesenchymal cells used by Osiris
researchers are produced in adults.
</P>
<P>
Osiris researchers grew a single mesenchymal stem cell through
more than 20 generations to create about a million cells. They
then altered the culture medium and added proteins that caused
the specimens to grow into cell families, or lineages, that
would produce bone, tendon or fat. Other work underway may lead
to the production of muscle cell lines, they said.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Oil Export Controlling Station Bombed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi oil export controlling
station in the southern port city of Baker, Basra province, was
bombed on Friday evening by U.S. and British warplanes, an Iraqi
Oil Ministry spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency (INA)
as saying that the bombing led to the destruction of some systems
of the oil station's control center supervising oil export.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, an Iraqi military spokesman announced that
the U.S. and Britain resumed bombings on Iraqi civilian targets
and military sites Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said that 13 formations of enemy warplanes from Kuwaiti and
Saudi bases violated southern Iraqi airspace and bombed some
civilian installations and military sites, injuring two people.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time after the holy Hajj that U.S. and
British jets bombed Iraqi targets in the no-fly zones. During the
holy pilgrimage period, regular U.S. and British bombings were
halted.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment on Iraqi oil export and controlling stations
will adversely affect the oil-for-food program which allows
sanctions-bound Iraq to export limited amount of oil to buy food
and medicine for its 22 million people, said the Oil Ministry
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as untrue the U.S. and British claims that they
are committed to increasing Iraq's oil export, terming these
claims as "purely false propaganda."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iraqi Southern Oil Company, to which the
bombed oil export controlling station belongs, has taken some
emergency measures to ensure partial oil export.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
After the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes against Iraq,
Baghdad declared that it did not recognize the no-fly zones and
would fire at any allies warplanes violating its airspace.
</P>
<P>
Since then, clashes between U.S., British jets and Iraqi air
defenses have almost become daily occurrence, and only during the
holy Hajj were the clashes suspended.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Friday discussed humanitarian situation in Kosovo with advisers
and private relief officials in White House and vowed to support
international relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed that they (private aid officials)
reported that the refugees coming out strongly support the action
that NATO has taken," Clinton said after the meeting. He added
that he intends "to stick with the NATO allies and provide for the
return of the Kosovars."
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian situation, as all of you know, remains grave
in Kosovo," Clinton said when speaking to reporters in the White
House briefing room.
</P>
<P>
Although some critics said the NATO airstrikes against the
forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic have prompted an
escalation of violence against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Clinton
said reports from the thousands fleeing the province prove such
claims unfounded.
</P>
<P>
The United States has sent 91 million U.S. dollars in
humanitarian aid to the region since last year. On Wednesday,
Clinton authorized another 50 million U.S. dollars in support and
directed the Pentagon to airlift food and other supplies to the
countries neighboring the Kosovo province that are being swamped
with refugees.

<HEADLINE> Scots Arrive in Holland for Lockerbie Due Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Over 100 Scottish police and prison
officers had been sent to and arrived in Holland on Friday to
prepare for the arrival of the two Libyans suspected of blowing up
a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report said it would be ready very soon for the imminent
handover and long-awaited trial of the two Libyans.
</P>
<P>
Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar told reporters earlier that the
handover of the two for trial was "imminent."
</P>
<P>
British officials said they had "strong indications" Libya
would hand over the two former intelligence officers to the United
Nations this weekend, ahead of an April 6 deadline announced by
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
If all goes well, a U.N. official will take the men to the
Netherlands to begin what is expected to be a long, expensive
trial in a makeshift Scottish court there.
</P>
<P>
"There is a strong indication the handover could take place
over the weekend, certainly within the next two or three days,"
Dewar was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
After being handed over and taken to the Netherlands, the two
Libyans will be "extradited" by a Dutch judge to face trial at a
Dutch military base.
</P>
<P>
The trial could take up to six months to start and could last
up to two years, Scottish legal experts say. If convicted, the men
would serve their sentences at Barlinnie prison near Glasgow,
Scotland with U.N. monitors nearby.

<P>
PARIS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- France warned Yugoslavia on Saturday
against ``any attempt at destabilization'' in Montenegro. NATO
said there is growing proof that a coup d'Etat is being prepared
against the republic's pro-West government.
</P>
<P>
One of NATO's military leaders, British general David Wilby,
claimed Saturday that there is ``growing proof that Belgrade is
preparing a coup d'Etat'' against President Milo Djukanovic of
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said in a published
declaration that any attempt to destabilize Montenegro, which
makes up with Serbia what remains of Yugoslavia, could have ``more
serious consequences.''
</P>
<P>
He said he has discussed the issue with his counterparts in
other countries of the Contact Group on former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a poll published on Saturday said that 55 percent of
French people approve of ground intervention in Kosovo by NATO if
air-strikes prove inefficient.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the polling institution on April 1-2
among 967 people, said that 58 percent of the French people also
approve of the country's participation in the NATO air-strikes.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Saturday promised publicly to ensure that all refugees will return
to Kosovo, saying that Serbia must comply with all NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
Speaking a few hours after NATO raids on army and police
buildings in central Belgrade, Blair told Sky News television that
he could not promise an immediate end to the air strikes, which
had for the first time targeted downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"The whole essence of this operation is to keep up pressure on
Milosevic, to intensify it and to carry on with an iron resolve to
see it through. There is no way now that we can stop until the
terms that NATO has set out are fully complied with," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the massive number of refugees, Blair said the
aim was not to repatriate them to the West, but to "get them back
to Kosovo where they want to be."
</P>
<P>
"Our commitment to those people is total, but what they
actually want is to go home and to live there in peace. This time
we have to make sure those people from Kosovo get back to where
they want to live," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our message to Milosevic is very simple." Blair said, "Your
policy of ethnic cleansing is an act of barbarity. We will defeat
you over it."

<P>
CHONGQING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The death sentence has been
handed down on the man held mainly responsible for the deaths of
40 people in the infamous bridge collapsing incident in southwest
China's Qijiang county in January.
</P>
<P>
Today, the Chongqing No.1 Intermediate Court announced that Lin
Shiyuan, former deputy secretary of the Qijiang County Committee
of the Communist Party of China, be sentenced to death for taking
bribes and for dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
The other 12 accused, including the bridge's contractor,
engineer, materials supplier, and several government officials
concerned, each received a fixed-term imprisonment, ranging from
three to 13 years.
</P>
<P>
According to China's law, these are the verdicts of first
instance and the defendants can appeal to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
The 180 meter long by seven meter wide Rainbow Bridge collapsed
at 18:30 (Beijing time) on January 4th and apart from the 40 dead,
14 people were injured and damage was estimated at 6.31 million
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Investigations show that the steel bridge, erected by a private
contractor in February 1996, was of inferior quality, and that the
accident resulted from official dereliction of duty and loopholes
in engineering and construction.

<HEADLINE> Rally in Nicosia Demands Stop of NATO Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Cypriots, Serbs
living in Cyprus, and Kurds Saturday participated in a rally in
Nicosia to demand an end to the air strikes launched by North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The rally at the central Freedom square was organized by all
political parties of the House of Representatives (parliament) of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The participants chanted slogans such as "immediately stop the
bombing of Yugoslavia," "European Union and NATO -- Murderers'
syndicate" and "Down with the new order of death."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the rally, House President Spyros Kyprianou
stressed that the people and politicians of Cyprus will stand by
all those whose human rights are being violated.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cypriot people are very sensitive to violations of
international law, the U.N. Charter and the role of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"The worst of all is that in the name of human rights, human
rights are being violated," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou pointed out that NATO has been transformed from a
defensive alliance to an offensive one.
</P>
<P>
He wondered why NATO did not show the same kind of sensitivity
to violations suffered by the Kurdish people.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou described the new order being created by the U.S. and
NATO as "strange" and stressed that "if the credibility of the
U.N. and Europe is not restored, then Europe will not be able to
survive on economic cooperation alone but should base its
existence on justice and morality."
</P>
<P>
He strongly demanded an end to the bombings and hostilities
and a political solution to the crisis according to the U.N.
Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
The rally ended with a concert and the participants headed for
the U.S. Embassy in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Deny Ejection of People from Bamiyan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
Saturday dismissed as baseless the opposition alliance's claim
that the militia are forcibly driving out civilians from the
central province of Bamiyan.
</P>
<P>
"The Shia population of Bamiyan are happy with the Taliban
because we have not imposed any restriction on them," said
Saveed-ur-Rahman Haqqani, senior representative of the Taliban
based in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
"There is no truth in the opposition claim and it is nothing
but a malicious propaganda by the opposition against the Taliban,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition's spokesman Abdullah on Friday accused the
Taliban of compelling a number of Bamiyan's population to quit
their homes in recent days and threatened to arrest those who stay
behind.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said that the Taliban arrested about 500 elderly
residents of Bamiyan and said such actions were a warning to
civilians to leave their villages.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's aim was to avoid any civilian uprising in support
of the opposition, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban captured Bamiyan in September last year from the
Hezb-i-Wahdat faction. Haqqani said the people in the province
were in fact unhappy with the Shiite Hizb-e-Wahdat faction.
</P>
<P>
A team of the International Red Cross in its recent report
stated that there was calm in Bamiyan and the people of the area
are living in a peaceful atmosphere, Haqqani said.
</P>
<P>
"If the opposition does not trust us, they should trust the Red
Cross," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Will Not Suffer A Financial Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China will not suffer a financial
crisis this year even though it has listed the prevention of
financial risks as a major task, according to Dai Genyou, Director
of Monetary Policy with the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking today at a workshop on China's economic development,
the official admitted that at present China's financial
institutions are enduring relatively serious bad loans problems.
He pointed out that this problem is only a result of the
inadequate fund raising channels, but that this on its own is not
capable of creating a financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that confidence plays an important role in any
financial crisis and China does not lack confidence in its
abilities to handle fiscal and economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the bankruptcy of the Guangzhou Trust Investment
Company, Dai said that in future poorly operated trust investment
companies will be restructured rather than closed down.
</P>
<P>
There are currently over 200 trust investment companies in
China although there were once more than 700.
</P>
<P>
According to Dai, China will take active measures this year to
put more currency in the circulation which will help stimulate
economic growth.

BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Restrictions on overseas

"Overseas investors will be allowed to acquire local
enterprises and merge with small and medium-sized enterprises in
Beijing," Zhang said, adding that this diversification is aimed at
boosting investment.

The non-state sector will also be encouraged to seek overseas
investment and the municipal government is expected to guide more
overseas investment towards the high-tech industry, infrastructure
projects and agriculture.

<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A minor planet has been named after
Kwan-cheng Wong, the late Hong Kong entrepreneur, with the
approval of the International Minor Planet Center and the
International Minor Planet Nomenclature Committee.
</P>
<P>
Minor planet number 4651, discovered by the Purple Mountain
Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), was named
after Mr. Wong to mark his great support for the country's
education and scientific research programs, the CAS vice-president
Bai Chunli announced today in east China's Ningbo City, Wong's
hometown.
</P>
<P>
According to international convention, those who discover minor
planets and have confirmation from the Minor Planet Center have
the right to name them.
</P>
<P>
Kwan-cheng Wong (1907-1986) contributed 100 million U.S.
dollars to establish an education foundation in 1985, which has
funded more than 1,000 Chinese scholars and over 800 students to
go abroad for research or study purposes.
</P>
<P>
The foundation today announced two one-million-dollar donations
to the CAS and Ningbo, as well as financial aid to the Purple
Mountain Observatory and three Chinese universities.

JERUSALEM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon has asked his top aides to prepare a medical team for
immediate dispatch to Albania or Macedonia to help Kosovo
refugees there, Israel Radio reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made following calls from the Albanian
government to help it cope with about 130,000 refugees fleeing
from Kosovo, the radio said. There were some 30,000 refugees in
Macedonia, it said.
</P>
<P>
Israel sent a planeload of medicine, blankets and clothes to
Albania Friday following a cabinet decision early this week to
provide aid to Kosovo refugees.
</P>
<P>
Breaking several days of diplomatic ambiguity, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu came out Tuesday to back the NATO bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia, which began last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's backing came after his government was severely
criticized by opposition blocs and diplomatic experts of its
neutrality on the matter.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Serb assistance to Jews during the
Holocaust in World War II had reportedly played a key role in the
uncertainity of the Israeli stand toward the NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
But Sharon has remained opposed to the ongoing NATO bombardment
on Yugoslavia, for fear that it might set a precedent for the
international community to intervene in a potential conflict
between Israel and its Arab communities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of risk
investment mechanism in China has attracted considerable interest
from both government and business people, according to Dai Genyou,
an official with the People's Bank.
</P>
<P>
At a banking seminar here today, he revealed that guidelines
will be published soon to encourage investment in the relatively
high risk hi-tech sector in order to establish another powerful
aspect of China' growing economic base.
</P>
<P>
Dai said that this is only one of a series of new fiscal
policies which will be introduced this year, in which China will
take further action to prevent financial risk and deflation, so as
to promote a sustained economic development.
</P>
<P>
Last year China introduced a wide range of monetary policies to
support national economic development. "The results of these
policies will emerge gradually," he said, adding that in the
future China will continue to stimulate its economy by monetary
policies.

<HEADLINE> India, Bangladesh, Nepal Meet on Eastern Himalayan Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from India,
Bangladesh and Nepal met here Saturday on regional cooperation in
harnessing the eastern Himalayan rivers.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session of the two-day conference, Dr.
S.A. Malek, political advisor to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, noted that a very large proportion of the 500 million
people living in the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna (GBM) region
lives in absolute poverty.
</P>
<P>
But this region is rich in resources like water, land, minerals
and people, he said. "We have failed to harness them together," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He held that clearly water is the best entry point for
cooperation in the region, but the horizon of cooperation should
be expanded to include trade, economic and social fields as well.
</P>
<P>
"There is thus a need to formulate a framework for water-based
integrated development for this region," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Bangladesh is actively pursuing a policy of
working together with the GBM countries with a view to promoting
collaborative development in the region which would benefit the
peoples of all the regional countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
For years, efforts have been made to exploit the eastern
Himalayan rivers. The Growth Quadrangle comprising Bangladesh,
Bhutan, India and Nepal was initiated in December 1996 for joint
efforts in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Nepali Minister for Water Resources and Health Pradip Nepal
said "we have to conceive harnessing water resources in a holistic
manner and with an integrated approach."
</P>
<P>
"Drinking water, irrigation, electricity, flood control and
waterways transport are some areas which should receive due
priority but most important of all the people should be the
cornerstone of overall development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed cooperation among nations, particularly the
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Dr. V.A. Pai Panandiker, president of the Center for Policy
Research in New Delhi, said that focus should be on harnessing
water resources in the region; unless the countries move forward
together in this regard, they cannot meet the demands in a few
years' time.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Q.K. Ahmad, chairman of the Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad,
stressed the need of political will for cooperation in harnessing
water resources. He said countries should share technologies.
</P>
<P>
The conference is organized by Nepal's Institute for Integrated
Development Studies in cooperation with the Bangladesh Unnayan
Parishad and the Center for Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
It is the final dissemination conference as a part of the joint
study undertaken by the three non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
The participants include politicians, academicians,
journalists, representatives of the private sector and experts
from India, Bangladesh and Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Talks on Sale of Zambia's Mines Concluded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government and the
Anglo-American Corporation have concluded negotiations on the sale
of the remaining major components of Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Mines Minister Syamukayumbu Syamujaye confirmed here
Friday that the two parties had reached an agreement on the sale
of the Nchanga and Nkana mines, the biggest two in the country,
and the development of the Konkola Deep Mining Project, Times of
Zambia newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye said the delay in concluding the final disposal of
the mines was not characterized by the delay of the Anglo-American
Corporation in finding partners.
</P>
<P>
He explained that before everything was disposed off, it needed
extra attention, avoiding problems in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations are over and we are now just working on technical
matters to dispose of everything," he said.
</P>
<P>
Syamujaye reiterated that the March 31 deadline was merely a
guideline in the on-going talks over the disposal of the remaining
major components of the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines.
</P>
<P>
Under a non-legally binding memorandum of understanding over
the sale of Nchanga, Nkana and Konkola mines signed by the two
parties last December, the mines have been sold to the
Anglo-American Corporation at the price of 72 million U.S. dollars
and the new owner was expected to take over by the end of March.

<HEADLINE> Sergeyev Denounces U.S. Sanctions on Russian Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Saturday denounced U.S. sanctions against three
Russian military firms as "sheer blackmail", saying the charges
are groundless.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department announced Friday that it would ban
sales with three Russian firms for allegedly selling missiles to
Syria, which is on the department's list of countries that sponsor
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev told a news briefing that Moscow would continue to
seek a political resolution to the Yugoslavia crisis, adding that
the proposal by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to hold a meeting
of the foreign ministers of the Group of Eight industrialized
nations may be acceptable to both Belgrade and NATO.
</P>
<P>
He said that whether Russia will send more reconnaissance ships
to the Mediterranean depends on the developments in the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
A Russian warship set off for the Mediterranean on Friday to
spy on NATO forces involved in military actions against Yugoslavia.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Saturday lashed out at
NATO's bombing of downtown Belgrade, accusing the U.S.-led
military bloc of staging a war of extermination against the
Yugoslav people.
</P>
<P>
"NATO has committed yet another barbaric act in the Balkans,"
the Foreign Ministry said. "The swelling NATO aggression has
become a ruthless war of extermination against the peoples of
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The statement also expressed anger at the bombs' nearness to
civilian buildings and the Russian embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"Those who planned and gave such a criminal order were not
stopped by the fact that the missiles were targeted at objects in
the direct proximity of a hospital, a kindergarten and apartments,
" it said. "The Russian Embassy was not far from the place of the
explosions."
</P>
<P>
The statement warned that NATO leaders should be aware of "the
grave consequences that any actions that endanger the lives of
Russian citizens may lead to."
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, none of the staff suffered," it said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EU Imposes Fish Ban on E. Africa Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
again banned fish imports from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda on
health grounds.
</P>
<P>
The ban, effective on March 30, has come after reports that
Uganda recently restricted the sales of fresh fish products from
Lake Victoria, the world's second largest fresh-water lake which
borders the three east African countries.
</P>
<P>
Unscrupulous fishermen in the lake region have long been blamed
for using insecticides like thiodan and daiznon, or explosives, to
catch fish. The lake is famous for the fish of Nile Perch,
freshwater sardines and tilapia.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Minister of Natural Resources and Tourism, Zakia
Meghji, however, has said pollution of fish products in the lake
area on her country's side has been controlled after the defense
force, the police and her ministry launched a joint operation
against the illegal fishing practices.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is confident that its fish is fit for human
consumption. We are ready for further tests by the European
Union," The Guardian paper Saturday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
On March 29, a day before the ban was imposed by the EU
headquarters in Brussels, Meghji said, her ministry sent fish
samples from the lake to three laboratories in Dar es Salaam and
Brussels where all tests proved to be poison free.
</P>
<P>
Harko Bhagat, chairman of the Lake Victoria Fish Processing
Association, said Tanzania takes the issue of contamination of
its fish products very seriously.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Tanzania's fish processing plants have
carried out extensive educational and training work among fish
collection supervisory staff to ensure that no poison fishing was
done.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania would not be foolhardy to follow Uganda whose fishing
industry has been shut down, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Early this week, the Kenyan government has prohibited night
fishing in the lake in an effort to stamp out fish poisoning under
cover of darkness.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the EU imposed a ban on fish imports
from east African countries in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In January last year, the EU froze imports of fresh fish
fillets from the three countries following an outbreak of cholera
in east Africa. The ban, which cost the three countries millions
of U.S. dollars in exports, were not lifted until six months
later.
</P>
<P>
Following the 1998 ban, the World Health Organization expressed
its disagreement.
</P>
<P>
The organization said although there is a theoretical risk of
cholera transmission with international food trade, the weight of
evidence suggests that this risk is very small and can normally be
dealt with by means, such as adopting hygienic practices in fish
handling and processing plants, other than an embargo on
importation.
</P>
<P>
Following the first ban, the country had been seeking
alternative markets in Zimbabwe, China, Japan and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania earns some 85.6 million U.S. dollars from the fish
industry along the lake, providing employment to 4,000 people.
The country's annual fish exports to EU market stand at 13,000
tons, including 7,000 tons of fresh fish fillets and 6,000 tons of
frozen fish.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Official with the World Food
Program said the international society has pledged about three
million U.S. dollars in aid to the flood victims in central and
southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Georgia Shaver, representative of the World Food Program in
Mozambique, said Friday that some of the aid has been given to
flood-stricken people in the southern Inhambane Province, where
the food for a total of 25,000 persons has been secured for six
months, the Noticias newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We still have enough food for 25,000 people in the coming two
months. And so long as the traffic situation improves in a week,
we will transport the relief products to those areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique suffered floods this year which is unprecedented in
the past 40 years, with 400,000 people being affected, half of
them in urgent need of food and medicine. The government has
appealed to the international community for 12.4 million U.S.
dollars in aid.

<HEADLINE> China Civil Aviation's Ticket Reservations "Globalized" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's civil aviation sector has
agreed to link its ticket reservation system to INFINI, one of
Japan's two largest networks.
</P>
<P>
Airline reservations in China are now connected with eight of
the world's largest ticketing systems, effectively globalizing the
system.
</P>
<P>
"China's airlines can now sell tickets on the world market,
resulting in more passengers and more profits." said Zhan Yanqi,
an official of the China Civil Aviation Computer Information
Center, which administers the country's the reservation system.
</P>
<P>
This also enables Japanese airlines to make use of China's
reservation network which will help boost income and profits for
both countries.
</P>
<P>
The air route between China and Japan, which opened 20 years
ago, has long been considered by aviation pundits as a "golden
route".
</P>
<P>
So far, six China's airlines, including the Air China Group,
China Eastern Air Group and China Southern Airlines, have opened
36 air routes to 11 Japanese cities, involving 116 flights every
week.

highlights of the game, bringing the total number of countries
covering the tournament to 175.

expected to cover the meet, but due to logistic reasons, 160 of
them have been accredited with print media person.

<HEADLINE> China for Resolving Disputes by Peaceful Means: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China hopes that Pakistan and
India will solve their outstanding issues, including the Kashmir
dispute, through peaceful negotiations, Chinese Ambassador to
Pakistan Lu Shulin said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Associated Press of Pakistan, Lu
stressed that it is China's principle stand that all disputes
between countries should be resolved by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"Disputes between countries should be fairly and rationally
resolved step-by-step through peaceful negotiations and
consultation based on equality, rather than through frequent
resort to force or threat of force on the strength of one's
military advantages," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
There are some tensions in South Asia, especially between
Pakistan and India mainly because of the dispute over Jammu and
Kashmir, he said, adding that the tension between the two South
Asian neighbors was escalated after the respective nuclear tests
by India and Pakistan last May.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir dispute has been the root cause of the tension in
the region, said the Chinese envoy.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to notice that Pakistan has been making positive
efforts for the relaxation of tension in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
China deems the visit to Pakistan in February by Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the invitation of his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif a welcome development, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation
(SAARC), Lu said China enjoys good relations with all SAARC
members, especially with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
China has noticed that the SAARC is holding meetings from time
to time to find out ways to promote regional cooperation, said the
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see SAARC countries' efforts for the
cooperation in the region and hope those efforts will promote
peace and stability in South Asia," Lu added.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question on establishment of a new international
political and economic order, Lu said the new order should be
underpinned by the well known Five Principles of Peaceful
Co-existence and other generally recognized norms governing
international relations.
</P>
<P>
It should be established in the light of the actual conditions
of the world today and should give expressions to the universal
aspirations and common interest of the people of all countries,
reflect the historical development and meet the needs of future
progress, stressed the ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Manila Extends Aid to 538,000 Poor Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- About 538,000 cash-strapped
students in private schools all over the Philippines have received
financial assistance from the government from July 1998 to January
this year, the Philippines News Agency said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The aid, under the program of Government Assistance to Students
in Private Education, is part of the national efforts to expand
the poor's access to quality basic education, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
As of January, tuition subsidies and textbook allowances have
been given to these students in 1,760 private schools, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government is implementing the program for the benefit of
poor students who could no longer be accommodated in
over-populated public schools and were enrolled instead in private
institutions, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
With an outlay of 19 million U.S. dollars for the program under
the country's 1999 budget, the government will extend the same
financial assistance to another 450,000 students in private
schools for the rest of the year.

<HEADLINE> Archaeological Findings Indicate Nature Worship 3,000 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Two pieces of pottery unearthed
recently from an ancient tomb by a group of archaeologists show
that nature worship existed in Hong Kong as early as 3,500 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The round-shaped relics, 16.2 centimeters in diameter, and the
half-moon-shaped pottery, measuring 5 cm long, were discovered in
a one-meter deep tomb in Ha Tsuen township, Yuen Long area in the
northwestern part of Hong Kong's New Territories during a recent
excavation by the Hong Kong Archaeological Society. The relics
were finely carved and undamaged.
</P>
<P>
President of the Hong Kong Archaeological Society Au Ka-fat
said that the two articles, representing the sun and the moon,
were clear evidence that the ancestors of the Chinese in Hong Kong
began to worship nature more than 3,500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
These are regarded as important findings in the pre-historic
archaeology in Hong Kong as well as in southeast Asia. So far,
there hasn't been any document showing such articles being
unearthed in the pre-historic archaeology in Southern China and
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The new findings were the earliest proofs of religious worship
in southern China, said Mr. Au who is also the leader of the
archaeological team.
</P>
<P>
This shows that ancestors of Chinese were already living in
Hong Kong as early as in the Yin and Shang dynasties. This also
shows that ancient Chinese had evolved from totem worship to
primitive religious worship during that period, archaeologists
said.
</P>
<P>
Similar round-shaped pieces of pottery were also found earlier
in pre-historic ruins in Hong Kong and Guangdong, but they were
not from the tomb burials and the biggest piece was only 10
centimeters in diameter.
</P>
<P>
The excavation, conducted by the Hong Kong Archaeological
Society from January to March, 1999, at the ancient tomb area
which is about 100 square meters, unearthed nearly ten thousand
pieces of potteries. Among them 200 pieces are complete and
undamaged ones and the sun-shaped and moon-shaped are the most
valuable pieces.
</P>
<P>
Before the tomb was excavated, the tomb area was a vegetable
garden and the tomb burials were only about one-meter deep down
the vegetable garden. Fortunately, the vegetable growers only
worked the field 30 cm deep and the tomb remained completely
intact and undamaged.
</P>
<P>
The relics unearthed this time have already been sent to
Guangzhou for isotope scanning in order to verify the exact time
of the tomb burials.
</P>
<P>
According to Mr. Au Ka-fat, the Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui
are areas in Hong Kong where historical relics were concentrated.
But since these areas have been developed, no relics can be
excavated any longer.
</P>
<P>
However, in the northern areas of Lantau Island and in the
northwestern part of the New Territories there are still a lot of
relics to be found.

<HEADLINE> Suspended Greenland Bank Says Clients' Money Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's Greenland Bank
branch in Tanzania, which was suspended earlier this week, has
assured its clients of the safety of their money.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for our customers to panic or worry...
Everything will be okay," Azad Dhomun, chief executive of the
Greenland Bank (T) Limited, said here Friday, The Guardian
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dhomun said his bank is in good condition although its parent
company, the Greenland Bank (Uganda) Limited, has run into
trouble. He assured the customers that nothing is going to go
wrong.
</P>
<P>
With a large deposit base from more than 12,000 customers, he
said, the bank would be opened as soon as Tanzania's central bank
officials complete the inventory exercise.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's central bank, the Bank of Tanzania, took over the
administration of the Greenland Bank (T) following suggestions
from the Ugandan central bank.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Tanzania is doing a full check of accounts, assets
and liabilities of the Greenland Bank (T) Limited to find whether
or not it faces liquidity problems like its parent company in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Greenland Bank (Uganda) Limited, suffering from a financial
crisis, was closed down on April 1 by the Central Bank of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Considering the potential effect that the closure may have on
the operations of Greenland Bank (T) Limited, the Bank of Tanzania
has taken over the administration of Greenland Bank (T) Limited
and suspended its operation effective on the same day after a
suggestion to do so was given by the Bank of Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Tanzania said Thursday that all operations of
Greenland Bank (T) Limited shall cease until further notice.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Computer Chip Equipment Falls Drastically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A report released Friday said
that worldwide shipments of equipment and material used to make
computer chips fell 21 percent last year due to the Asian slowdown.
</P>
<P>
"1998 was a tough year," said Stanley T. Myers, president of
Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International (SEMI).
</P>
<P>
SEMI reported that last year, semiconductor equipment shipments
totaled 21.8 billion U.S. dollars, down from the 27.6 billion
dollars in sales posted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Asian markets bore a larger portion of the
industry downturn, reflecting last year's financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Total semiconductor equipment sales in South Korea declined to
1.3 billion dollars, down 51 percent from 1997. Shipments in Japan
reached 4.7 billion dollars, down 31 percent. The rapid growth of
the Taiwan market did carry over some what into 1998, with sales
reaching 3.3 billion, down 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Myers said most segments seemed to hit their low points late in
the third quarter and have been steadily improving since then.

<HEADLINE> EDS-rpt Romanian Press Blasts West's False Reports on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian news media has
condemned NATO and western media for filing false reports against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
An editorial of the news paper Truth asked on Friday: " How
many of the official statements released by NATO headquarters in
Brussels can we believe?"
</P>
<P>
Some ethnic Albanian leaders, whom NATO declared were killed by
Serbs, were dramatically "resurrected" before the Easter. One of
them, Ibrahim Rugova, even met with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic after being reported dead, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
It went on to ask who would believe the words of Wesley K.
Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, who said, " Serbs are
doing ethnic cleansing in Kosovo," "Milosevic slaughtered 200,000
ethnic Albanians," and "the number of Kosovo refugees has exceeded
500,000."
</P>
<P>
The editorial described NATO's false reports as "news bombs"
that not only confused public opinion, but also led to further
instability in Kosovo and fueled the exodus of refugees out of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper, the Evenimentul Zilei, also published an
article on Friday to say that NATO had been embarrassed in the
propaganda war parallel with its air strikes, for many of its
reports had been proved to be false.
</P>
<P>
Many accusations of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) against Yugoslav and Serb governments had been proved to be
baseless, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and NATO did not doubt the KLA's
announcements and U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin
acted just like KLA's spokesman, the article said.

<HEADLINE> NATO Military Attacks Against Yugoslavia Threaten World Security: Vietnamese Army Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese army daily Quan Doi Nhan
Dan (the People's Army) Saturday carried a commentary, saying that
NATO military attacks against Yugoslavia is threatening security
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The commentary with a title of " deterrents of the strategic
considerations" said: "It is really dangerous if the
politico-military technologies currently applied in Yugoslavia
will be used in other parts of the world."
</P>
<P>
"When the most essential issue, namely the national
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of a nation
like Yugoslavia, is overlooked by the United States and NATO, that
attitude is giving encouragement to separatist movements, which
may lead to continuous racial conflicts, and trigger off war,
threatening security in the world," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
Quan Doi Nhan Dan noted in the commentary that "by openly
launching a military attack against Yugoslavia, the United States
and NATO have officially transmitted a message saying that they
have the right to impose their will and viewpoint on others, not
through political initiatives, but by military power, even without
permission from the United Nations' Security Council."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the United States has given itself the right to play
the role of a 'peace keeping force' with its military power and
with NATO as its main tool," the paper added.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that "when the war in Yugoslavia is escalating, no
one can predicts the consequences. With the use of the most
sophisticated weapons and military technologies against
Yugoslavia, the death toll among innocent people will be on the
rise. Under the pretext of rescuing a 'humanitarian disaster', the
United States and NATO are creating a new disaster not only in
Yugoslavia and the Balkan region, but also in Europe and the
world."
</P>
<P>
"The United States and Western countries, far from dissolving
or scaling down NATO, are expanding and modernizing this military
bloc. On the threshold of the new century, the world is facing
dangerous strategic attempts at using force to establish a
unipolarized new world order," the paper concluded.

<HEADLINE> N. Ireland Rules Out Return of Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Mo
Mowlam said on Saturday there was no going back in the province's
peace process despite the deadlock on the disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have come a long, long way. This week we made a
lot of progress, the parties worked very hard," Mowlam was quoted
by BBC as saying at the anniversary of the Good Friday peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
"I now think it's time to move on, the road is clear and we
should move down it," she said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, talks on the decommissioning were suspended
without agreement, but all the parties in the province signed up
to a declaration which British Prime Minister Tony Blair said
would form the basis for a settlement. The talks will resume on
April 13.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Unionists are demanding that the Irish
Republican Army begins decommissioning before its political wing
Sinn Fein can take up seats in the Assembly executive.
</P>
<P>
But Sinn Fein says it cannot compel the IRA to disarm -- and
to try to do so could force a dangerous split in the paramilitary
group. IRA declared a ceasefire in the summer of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clashes Kill Three in Indonesia's Southeast Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were killed
and dozens of others injured Friday in fresh clashes in Kei Besar
Subdistrict, Southeast Maluku district of Indonesia's Maluku
province, Antara News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Calm returned Friday night after security officials, mass
organization and religious figures visited the hotbeds of the
unrest where they persuaded the people involved to stop their
hostilities and acts of violence, the report quoted local
authorities sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The first clashes occurred at the village of Tutrean and
Mertuan which were followed by a retaliatory attack on Larat
village. The fighting at Larat later triggered a siege of Elat
village by people from Wartahait Yamtel, seven kilometers from the
capital of Kei Besar Subdistrict.
</P>
<P>
Local police said that although there was no fighting anymore,
the atmosphere in several places was still tense with people still
seen forming groups and carrying all sorts of self-made weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said the incidents in Kei Besar Subdistrict were a spillover
from the communal riots in Tual, capital of Southeast Maluku.
</P>
<P>
In Tual, where riots broke out on Wednesday (March 31), the
situation was still gripped by tension with some people still seen
in streets holding sharp weapons amidst rumors about this or that
camp intending to begin fighting again.
</P>
<P>
The two-day violent unrest in Tual cost the lives of 14 persons
and caused injuries to dozens of others. four cars were burnt, 90
houses and a number of social and public facilities damaged.
</P>
<P>
A special team of community figures and military officers, led
by Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconina, Saturday morning left Ambon
for Tual to inspect conditions in the district capital and take
other rehabilitative measures, reports said.
</P>
<P>
This was the second ethnic violence within more than two
months. A massive rioting took place in Ambon, capital of Maluku
province in January and lasted till the middle of March, killing
about 200 people.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, many riots have been taken
place in several places in the country. Some political and social
figures said followers of the former president Soeharto were
behind of the riots.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King to Visit Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
will visit Saudi Arabia Sunday for talks with Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz on bilateral ties which have been affected by the 1990
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The two monarchs will exchange views on issues of mutual
concern and discuss ways of improving bilateral ties in all
fields, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah told Jordanian reporters that his visit to Saudi
Arabia will be a very important opportunity for the two countries
to exchange views on both bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
In April, a busy diplomatic schedule will also take Abdullah to
Syria, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and other countries, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has been the largest donor to Jordan before the Gulf
War, in which Jordan was found sympathetic with Iraq after Iraqi
President Saddam's troops stormed into Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh suspended its annual economic aid of nearly 200 million
U.S. dollars and cut its oil supply to Jordan after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Currently Amman depends on Iraq as its only provider of cheap
oil and oil products, and gets some 90,000 barrels of oil per day
from Baghdad under the United Nations "oil for food" program with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Jordan and Kuwait, Iraq's arch Arab foes,
have been warming up since February 7 when Abdullah took the
Jordanian throne hours after his father King Hussein Bin Talal
died of cancer.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian officials complained that Saudi Arabia has
failed to translate into concrete action its financial aid pledges
to the kingdom made during Hussein's funeral.
</P>
<P>
So far, Saudi officials have made no comment on reports that
Riyadh will write off Jordan's debts of some 160 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Newspaper Suspends Publication Due to Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Crusader newspaper, a paper
that is printed three times a week here and mainly circulates in
the capital city of Uganda, has suspended its operations from
Saturday due to the sudden closure of Greenland Bank Limited
(GBL).
</P>
<P>
The paper's Chairman, Onapito Ekomoloit, announced the decision
to stunned staff members at the paper's offices Friday, the New
Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Onapito described this as a tough decision, saying this is only
 temporary because the management is trying to find other
alternatives to restart publishing the paper soon.
</P>
<P>
The paper had to be closed for the time being because the
Greenland Bank is the only bank through which the management of
the paper had made the prior arrangements to finance its printing,
the chairman explained.
</P>
<P>
Staff members have accounts with the bank where their salaries
are sent.
</P>
<P>
Charles Kikonyogo, governor of the Bank of Uganda, announced
closure of the Greenland Bank Thursday, saying it was inevitable
because of the gravity of the unearthed management irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Kikonyogo said Greenland Bank's chairman and former Bank of
Uganda boss Sulaiman Kiggundu was arrested and charged in court
for allegedly causing the bank loss of 75 million shillings
(75,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Kiggundu is also said to have lent out at least 31 billion
shillings (31 million dollars) above the bank's
six-billion-shilling (six-million-dollar) core capital to the
Greenland Group subsidiary companies.
</P>
<P>
Kikonyogo noted that the bank will not be restructured but
completely closed down. An international firm of liquidators will
be appointed to wind up the operations of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The sudden closure of the bank affects about 120,000 depositors
and they reportedly planned demonstrations for next week in
protest against the bank's closure.

-- Egyptian Minister of Petroleum Hamdi Ali Al-Banbi said the
Suez Canal benchmark oil prices jumped to 13.17 U.S. dollars per

Al-Akhbar:

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Strongly Condemns Use of Force Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia voiced its opposition
to the use of force against Yugoslavia on the issue of Kosovo, a
press communique released Saturday by Cambodian Foreign Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia made the condemnation in a letter from Foreign
Minister Hor Namhong dated Thursday to his Russian counterpart
Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Cambodia clarified its official position on the
present situation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The communique said Cambodia strongly condemns the use of force
in international affairs, saying it was a severe violation of the
U.N. Charter and international law.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia urged relevant parties to adhere to the principles of
the U.N. Charter, especially those prohibiting the threat or use
of force against the territorial integrity or political
independence of any state, or in any manner inconsistent with the
purposes of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the very dangerous situation in Yugoslavia, the
Kingdom of Cambodia earnestly calls upon all parties concerned to
give due consideration to the legitimate aspiration of the
population of Kosovo and respect to the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, a
sovereign state and a member of the United Nations," the
communique said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cambodia insisted that "only a political solution
can bring just settlement to the current use of forces and
humanitarian crisis we are now witnessing in Yugoslavia."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Lifts Censorship on Foreign Publications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has scraped a 70-year-old
censorship law imposed on all foreign periodicals and
publications before they hit the newsstands.
</P>
<P>
The step was part of the Jordanian government's efforts to
introduce more press freedom, the semi-official Jordan Times
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, pornographic materials are still barred from sale.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time in Jordan's history to lift censorship
on foreign newspapers and magazines, said Iyad Qattan, head of the
Press and Publications Department (PDD) under the Ministry of
Information.
</P>
<P>
The PDD is in charge of censoring all foreign, Arab and local
periodicals and publications by demanding to see copies of them
before they are distributed.
</P>
<P>
The move has also been viewed as a result of campaigns by human
rights groups and press organizations which have been clamoring for
greater freedom of expression.

<HEADLINE> NATO Missiles Hit Central Belgrade, Streets Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the day broke, black smoke could still be seen billowing
from the buildings, located about 200 meters apart in the Knez
Milosh street and in the proximity of 25 medical facilities.
</P>
<P>
Windows of nearby buildings were shattered. Owners of a beauty
salon and a fashion store could be seen clearing broken glass.
</P>
<P>
The steel-structured Serbian Interior Ministry building
collapsed hours after being engulfed in fire in the wake of the
missile attack.
</P>
<P>
Fragments of window frames, papers, table legs could be seen
scattered over 100 meters away.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether there were any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after being hit by the missiles, explosions could be
heard from the buildings, apparently from ordnance inside.
</P>
<P>
Zoran Mujibegsvich, a 50-year-old artist living in a building
nearby, witnessed the explosions while smoking at his window
facing the buildings.
</P>
<P>
"This is senseless," Mujibegsvich said, pointing nearby medical
facilities such as the Serbian Medical Center, the largest
maternity hospital and a hospital for the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
Another artist, who lives just two blocks from the Serbian
Interior Ministry building, was outraged.
</P>
<P>
"I have two kids in my house and they were screaming and crying,
" said Zoran, 30, referring to his seven-year-old son and an eight-
year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
The streets of Belgrade appeared calm as people were waiting
for bus at the stations and old people lining up before banks to
withdraw their pensions.
</P>
<P>
The air-raid alarm was cleared at 07:30 (05:30GMT) in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
At about the same time early Saturday, NATO missiles also
attacked the areas near Mt. Fruska Gora in Voivodina near Novi Sad,
some 82 kilometers north of Belgrade, the Tanjug news agency
reported.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng's Visit to Further Cement Sino-Pak Ties: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visit to
Pakistan by Chinese leader Li Peng will further promote and deepen
the existing Sino-Pak friendly and cooperation relations.
</P>
<P>
This was stated here Saturday by Lu Shulin, the new Chinese
ambassador to Pakistan, during an interview with the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC) of China, will make a five-day official
and goodwill visit to Pakistan from April 8 to 12 at the

</P>
<P>
The Chinese envoy described Li Peng as the old friend of the
Pakistani people as he toured this south Asian nation 10 years ago
in his capacity of Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the exchange of high-level visits between the two
countries is beneficial to strengthening of the Sino-Pak relations
which enjoy smooth and healthy development in economy, trade and
other fields.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that it has been a tradition for the two

leaders of the two neighbors just like visiting relatives, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The forthcoming visit by Li Peng will give an impetus to the
existing friendly and cooperative relations between China and

"all-weathered" and "time-tested".
</P>

He expressed his belief that no matter changes which may take
place in each others' country and in international situation, the
Sino-Pak relations will further develop as before.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 3 (Xinhua) -- New Chinese Ambassador to
Pakistan Lu Shulin Saturday highly praised the Sino-Pak
relationship, describing it as "all-weathered" and "time-tested".
</P>
<P>
During an interview with the Associated Press of Pakistan, Lu
said that the Sino-Pak friendship is "based on principles", which
has stood the test of history and time, enjoyed immense popular
support and showed great vitality".
</P>
<P>
Calling Pakistan his "second home", Lu, who studied Urdu at
Karachi University 38 years ago, said he witnessed the development
of the Sino-Pak relationship.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations 48 years back,
the relations between China and Pakistan have been developing in a
healthy and smooth way, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"To further consolidate and develop the Sino-Pak
good-neighborly relations of friendship and mutual benefit is in
the fundamental interests of the two countries and the two
peoples, peace and stability in South Asia and even the world at
large," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China and Pakistan have established a partnership
of all-round cooperation oriented towards the 21st century, Lu
expressed his confidence that the forthcoming visit by Li Peng,
chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress of China will "further cement the existing close and
friendly relations between the two countries".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese envoy, who assumed his office in January this year,
stressed that China attaches great importance to enhancing
economic and trade ties with Pakistan and regarded it as one of
the most important aspects of the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, considerable achievements have been scored in
multi-form cooperation between China and Pakistan in the economic,
trade, scientific, technological and other fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has become the second largest trading partner of China
in South Asia with the annual volume of bilateral trade reaching
around one billion U.S. dollars, Lu said, adding that there is
still much room for the development of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
China can provide to Pakistan both applicable technologies,
mechanical and electrical products, and large-sized mechanical
equipment of good quality and cheap price, said Lu.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that Pakistan has in recent years engaged
itself in a large-scale infrastructure construction, taking
advantage of loans provided by international consortium and
financial institutions which, he thought, to be a good chance for
enlarging Sino-Pak economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid economic development in China in the years to
come, "I am confident that enterprises of the two countries will
explore new ways and forms to expand mutually beneficial
cooperation," said the ambassador.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Expands Job Program in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
expanding its employment program to provide jobs to laborers in
the south who were affected by Asian financial flu or the El
Nino-La Nina phenomena, a government news release said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government has provided temporary jobs to 3,300 laborers in
Mindanao, the southern Philippines, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Additional funding for the government's Rural Works Program
(RWP) will soon be released to offer jobs to another 2,500
displaced workers in the south, it said.
</P>
<P>
Government officials were quoted as saying that the Department
of Labor and Employment has released 110,000 U.S. dollars
representing 60 percent share of the 182,500-U.S. dollar fund to
provide temporary work to jobless in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The 40 percent share was shouldered by local government units
and other project partners of the department for the RWP, the news
release said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the jobless in the south were provided with temporary
jobs in infrastructure projects funded by the RWP, it said.
</P>
<P>
These projects have not only helped generate temporary
employment but also contributed to the development of Mindanao,
the news release said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will also expand the RWP to cover
dislocated workers in Luzon, the northern Philippines, and the
Visayas in the middle south of the country, it said.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Welcomes Chinese Investment: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano extended his welcome to Chinese investment in his
country during a meeting Friday night at his home with a trade and
economic delegation from China's southwest Chongqing city.
</P>
<P>
The president believed that more Chinese investment would help
change the structure of foreign investment in the southern African
country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese guests who left here early Saturday morning had
paid visits to Maputo in the south, Sofala Province in central
Mozambique, and Nampula Province in the north.
</P>
<P>
Chissano told the visitors that there are much potential for
the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in these
areas. He hoped that Chongqing city could help develop the
processing industry of agricultural and animal products, so that
Mozambique could be self-sufficient in rice, beef and poultry.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in Mozambique, the 23-member delegation
which arrived here on March 25 had signed a memorandum of
understanding on agricultural and forestry development with the
Mozambican side. A letter of intent on manufacturing medicine,
radio sets and sugar was also signed with Maputo Province.
</P>
<P>
The trade delegation also met with Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi, Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao, and General
Secretary of the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front Manuel Tome.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Pop Star Banned from Entering Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese famous pop singer Najwa
Karam has been banned from entering Egypt and forced back home for
"security reasons," the Daily Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ban came amid reports that Karam, a Christian, had made
offensive remarks on Egypt and Islam, charges she vehemently
denied.
</P>
<P>
The singer, who flew in to Cairo Friday, had a visa stamp on
her passport delivered by the Egyptian Embassy in Beirut but Cairo
airport authorities denied her entry because her name was on a
list of people not welcome in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian government newspaper has said she "scorned Islam
and attacked Egypt during a recent concert in a brotherly Arab
country."
</P>
<P>
Karam was criticized last month by Qatari and Jordanian
politicians who accused her of saying in a television interview
that her dog had been named after a prophet.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has banned her from entering its country, while media
reports compared her to Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic
Verses" against whom the late Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini
issued a death penalty in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Karam has denied having made such comments and has filed a law
suit against a magazine.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, ROK Agree to Lift Double Taxes on Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and the Republic of
Korea have signed an agreement in a bid to refrain from imposing
double taxes on companies that invest in either of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Permanent Secretary of Finance Raphael Mollel and
Korean Director of Finance and Economy T.H. Kim signed the
agreement at a brief ceremony here Thursday, The Daily Mail
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Tanzanian Finance Ministry said the agreement is
expected to reform the existing practice that Korean companies
investing in Tanzania are taxed income tax, revenue stamp and a
number of other taxes by their home government as well as by the
host Tanzanian government.
</P>
<P>
"The practice makes foreign investment unbearable venture,"
they said, adding that extra work is needed by both governments to
insert provisions in their respective taxation regimes to enable
implementation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The agreement followed a three-day meeting on the merits and
demerits of the double taxation on investors between Tanzanian
Treasury officials and a five-man Korean Finance Ministry
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Simeon Ileta, spokesman for the Tanzanian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and International Co-operation, was quoted by the
newspaper as saying that the agreement is a sign of good
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is an indication of interest that Korean investors make use
of available opportunities in Tanzania," he said, adding "We
expect the volume of investment from the Republic of Korea to
Tanzania to increase tremendously soon."
</P>
<P>
This is a second trade and investment delegation from the ROK
since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The last one comprised of 13 government officials and
businessmen from all major Korean companies concluded a visit on
March 28 following a four-day visit to explore business
opportunities in the construction sector.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations have been greatly promoted by Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa's visit to Korea last December.
</P>
<P>
The Korean businessmen have shown great interest in the
country's infrastructure, road and railway and other projects.
</P>
<P>
They have also expressed willingness to invest in the the
sectors of electricity, oil refinery, harbor facilities, water
supply and transport.. So far, there have been some investments
from the ROK, like Hyundai, mostly in telecommunication, mining
and automobile industry.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: ABCs Of The Macao SAR Basic Law (8) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Does the Chinese Constitution apply to Macao?
</P>
<P>
Some people say that capitalism is practiced in Macao under the
Basic Law and that China's constitution is socialist in nature and
therefore does not apply to Macao. This view is one-sided.
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that a constitution defines the fundamental
legal system of a country. It is the fundamental law of the
country and its highest legal authority. All other laws must be
based on the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law was drawn up in accordance with the Chinese
constitution, so, even though there is capitalism in Macao under
the Basic Law, because the MSAR is a Chinese administrative region,
China's constitution applies to Macao.
</P>
<P>
This is also called for by the fundamental need for national
unification. The provisions in the Chinese constitution on state
organizations, defense, foreign affairs, the national flag,
national emblem, the capital, and national sovereignty, unity, and
territorial integrity are all applicable to the MSAR.
</P>
<P>
The people of Macao and the political power in Macao must
observe these constitutional provisions and uphold the sanctity of
the Chinese constitution. But, because of "two systems" principle,
the provisions in the Chinese constitution on the socialist system
and policies do not apply to the MSAR.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Suffer Worst Loss in Franchise History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Without Michael Jordan, the six-
time NBA champion Chicago Bulls suffered the worst loss in
franchise history on Friday, a 115-68 defeat by the Orlando Magic.
</P>
<P>
"We obviously didn't do one thing out there that we were
pleased with," Chicago coach Tim Floyd said. "We had no effort and
no intensity. We gave up easy baskets."
</P>
<P>
The 47-point defeat even beat a 158-114 record loss to the
Detroit Pistons on March 24, 1969, in the team's third season.
Chicago's previous worst home loss was a 121-80 setback to the
Philadelphia 76ers on November 21, 1980, when Jordan was a senior
in high school.
</P>
<P>
The Bulls dropped to 9-23 in the post-Jordan era, which also
saw the exodus of forwards Scottie Pippen, Scott Burrell, Dennis
Rodman and Jud Buechler, guard Steve Kerr and centre Luc Longley.
</P>
<P>
Orlando, which has the best record in the Eastern Conference (
23-10), came within one point of matching its most decisive
victory, a 152-104 romp at Milwaukee in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Penny Hardaway scored 24 points for the Magic, who posted the
lopsided win without leading scorer Nick Anderson and Gerald
Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, Isaiah Rider paced seven players in double figures
with 23 points as the Trail Blazers scored a 107-95 victory over
the slumping Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
Portland (25-6) have won eight of their last nine games and
improved the NBA's best home record to 15-1 and best overall mark
to 25-6.
</P>
<P>
In Minneapolis, Terrell Brandon had 21 points, a season-high 15
assists, eight rebounds and five steals to lead the Timberwolves
to a 107-88 rout of the Denver Nuggets, who remained winless on
the road this season.
</P>
<P>
Kevin Garnett was the main beneficiary of Brandon's pinpoint
passing, scoring 28 points. Sam Mitchell scored a season-high 21
points for Minnesota, which has won four of its last five games.
</P>
<P>
In Philadelphia, the Cleveland Cavaliers scored an 85-80
victory over the 76ers as Allen Iverson was benched for the final
three quarters after he failed to hit one of the seven shots in
the first period.
</P>
<P>
In Phoenix, Glen Rice sank a 17-foot jumper with 7.1 seconds
remaining as the Los Angeles Lakers beat the Suns 91-90 in nearly
two years.
</P>
<P>
Rice scored 23 points and Shaquille O'Neal, who was on the
bench in the final minute, added 21 for the Lakers, who have won
three straight and five of their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
In Charlotte, Reggie Miller scored 18 points and Rik Smits
added 17 as the Indiana Pacers held off the Hornets 87-81 to snap
a three-game losing streak, all by one point.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers held Charlotte to a season-low nine points in the
third quarter, overcoming an eight-point halftime deficit.
</P>
<P>
In Atlanta, Dikembe Mutombo scored a season-high 24 points as
the Hawks overcame the absence of leading scorer Steve Smith and
rallied for an 84-81 victory over the Vancouver Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 24 points for the Grizzlies, who
have lost 20 of their last 22 and are just 1-14 on the road.
</P>
<P>
In Boston, Dell Curry buried the go-ahead 3-pointer with 43
seconds to go as the Milwaukee Bucks edged the Celtics 84-83.
</P>
<P>
Ray Allen scored 19 points and rookie Robert Traylor added 15
for the Bucks, who have won four straight.
</P>
<P>
Antoine Walker led Boston with 23 points and 18 rebounds but
missed a potential game-winning tip in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
At Golden State, Karl Malone scored 14 of his 23 points in the
decisive third quarter as the Utah Jazz beat the Warriors for the
15th time in 16 meetings, 92-85.

<HEADLINE> Japan Offers Funds for Classrooms to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- In support of the Philippine
government's education programs, Japan is donating 173 classrooms
in 47 public schools in Mindanao, the southern Philippines, a
government news release said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government is donating the 11.6-million-U.S.
dollar worth of classrooms in 24 public elementary schools and 23
public high schools in the south, the news release said.
</P>
<P>
This Japanese aid, under the fifth phase of the Educational
Facilities Improvement Project of the Philippines, will benefit an
estimated 8,650 students in Mindanao, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japan International Cooperation Agency and the
World Bank are also implementing the Third Elementary Education
Project of the Philippines, which provides for the construction or
repair of 10,000 classrooms in six provinces, the news release
said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent study, the Philippine government traced the low
achievement levels of public school students to the shortage of
classrooms, saying that overcrowded classrooms made it difficult
for pupils to absorb learning.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Opposition Condemns Assassination Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's United National
Independence Party has condemned the assassination attempt against
its leader, former president Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
The party's spokesman Bwendo Mulengela said here Friday at a
news briefing that all people should condemn the attempted
assassination against Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Kaunda's vehicle was shot at his house here
Thursday evening by about five gunmen but Kaunda was not in the
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper quoted Kaunda's bodyguard Edward Chanda as
saying that after firing, the assassins drove their mini-bus
away, nobody was hurt in the incident.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also condemned the Ndola High Court for declaring
Kaunda stateless.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday Judge Chalendo Sakala declared Kaunda stateless
and ordered the Citizenship Board of Zambia to quash the Zambian
nationality of Kaunda, who was born of Malawian parents.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda had been ruling the country since its independence in
1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by current President
Frederick Chiluba. He was barred from running for the country's
presidency during the 1996 elections, when a constitutional
amendment was adopted under which foreign nationals and those with
foreign parentage are prohibited from contesting the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda has vowed to contest the post in the next elections in
2001.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Army to Help End Cattle Rustling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Army will step in the
law- enforcement field to help eliminate the rampant cattle
rustling in parts of the country, a senior Kenyan army officer
has announced.
</P>
<P>
"Their days are numbered and it is better for cattle-rustlers
to put down their arms and make the country peaceful," said
Lieutenant General Daniel Opande, deputy chief of general staff,
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Cattle rustlers across the country have been warned to
surrender their arms "otherwise they face the wrath of the Kenyan
Army," the Daily Nation newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The military chief said the army would not hesitate to
cooperated whenever they were requested to assist other law
enforcement units such as police.
</P>
<P>
"Our primary role is to defend the country against any external
 aggression but we will not hesitate to intervene in our secondary
roles such as stamping out cattle rustling," Opande said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came under a circumstance where the east
African country faced major problems from banditry incursions and
cattle rustling.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Press Blasts West's False Reports on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Romanian news media has
condemned NATO and western media for filing false reports against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
An editorial of the news paper Truth asked on Friday: " How
many of the official statements released by NATO headquarters in
Brussels can we believe?"
</P>
<P>
Some ethnic Albanian leaders, whom NATO declared were killed by
Serbs, were dramatically "resurrected" before the Easter. One of
them, Ibrahim Rugova, even met with Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic after being reported dead, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
It went on to ask who would believe the words of Wesley K.
Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, who said, " Serbs are
doing ethnic cleansing in Kosovo," "Milosevic slaughtered 200,000
ethnic Albanians," and "the number of Kosovo refugees has exceeded
500,000."
</P>
<P>
The editorial described NATO's false reports as "news bombs"
that not only confused public opinion, but also led to further
instability in Kosovo and fueled the exodus of refugees out of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Another newspaper, the Evenimentul Zilei, also published an
article on Friday to say that NATO had been embarrassed in the
propaganda war parallel with its air strikes, for many of its
reports had been proved to be false.
</P>
<P>
Many accusations of the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) against Yugoslav and Serb governments had been proved to be
baseless, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the United States and NATO did not doubt the KLA's
announcements and U.S. State Department Spokesman James Rubin
acted just like KLA's spokesman, the article said.

<HEADLINE> Suicides Drop Steadily in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The suicide rate in Sri Lanka,
which was viewed among the highest in the world, has dropped
steadily since 1996, according to police statistics.
</P>
<P>
According to the Police Administration Reports for 1986-1996,
the number of suicide cases stood at 6,784 in 1986 and peaked at
8,514 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But there is a definite downward trend in suicide since 1996
when the figure dropped to 7,344.
</P>
<P>
The number of suicides fell further to 6,418 in 1997 and in the
first half of 1998, it stood at only 3,005.
</P>
<P>
The figures for 1997 and 1998 were released by the Statistical
Division of the Police Headquarters, since the Police
Administration Reports for 1997 and 1998 have not been published
yet.
</P>
<P>
Many leading sociologists say the reduction in suicide is due
to a greater degree of mental and emotional stability in the
population.
</P>
<P>
Suicide in Sri Lanka has been largely blamed on joblessness,
failed love affairs and extramarital pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The spread of self employment schemes among youth and their
recent successes are also attributed to the downward path of
suicides.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics about 30 percent of suicide victims
belong to the 20 to 30 year age group.
</P>
<P>
Family counselling and the greater availability of trained
psychiatrists, psychotherapists in hospitals have also contributed
to arresting the suicide rate.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, most suicides in villages are committed by
drinking pesticides and weed killers. Whereas in towns, means
preferred is by hanging, followed by drowning and jumping in front
of trains.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Australians Rally Against NATO Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian community in
Australia's third largest city of Brisbane took to the streets
Saturday in protest against NATO's brutal military campaign in
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people turned out for the march which began at
state Parliament House in Brisbane, capital of Queensland state,
with some hanging targets around their necks similar to protesters
in the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio said there was a smaller rally by Serbians in
Adelaide, the coastal capital city of South Australia.
</P>
<P>
The rallies follow protests by about 13,000 Serbian Australians
in Sydney and Melbourne and other major cities last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police said there were no arrests at the peaceful demonstration
which featured placards likening United States President Bill
Clinton to Adolf Hitler and declaring "Hands off Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
A member of the Brisbane Serbian community, Z'ivko Petru, said
the rally wanted to send a message of peace with an "overwhelming
desire to end the NATO aggression against Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"Stop the war. Find the formula for an honorable peace and stop
dropping the bombs," Petru told the rally.
</P>
<P>
Police Inspector Dudley Orchard said there was a "reasonable"
police presence at the demonstration but the protesters were well
behaved.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Jute Export Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export of raw jute
dropped drastically during the first eight months of the current
1998-99 fiscal year, The Bangladesh Observer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Around 1 million bales of raw jute were exported to 28
countries by 69 jute exporters between July 1998 and February this
year, 37.5 percent down from 1.6 million bales during the same
period of the previous fiscal year. One bale of raw jute is
equivalent to 180 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The export of raw jute to India, however, increased by 300,000
bales during the period.
</P>
<P>
India has become the biggest importer of raw jute from
Bangladesh, followed by Pakistan and China. Pakistan imported
255,000 bales in the July-February period, a 47-percent drop from
481,000 bales during the previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Other raw jute importers include Brazil, Ethiopia, Indonesia
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Acting Chairman of the Bangladesh Jute Association Md. Rezaul
Karim attributed the fall in jute export to the recent worldwide
financial crisis and reduction of jute prices in the world market.
Most of the countries had purchased surplus quantity of jute more
than their requirements last year as they found it at a cheaper
price, he said.
</P>
<P>
But India would have to buy 700,000-800,000 bales from
Bangladesh this year to meet its requirements, due to a heavy
shortfall in its own production of raw jute, he added.

<HEADLINE> Personal Video Recorders to Change U.S. TV Networks: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A latest study shows over the
next decade a new device -- the personal video recorder (PVR) --
will fracture the traditional business model of U.S. television
networks.
</P>
<P>
Television networks in the United States have relied on a
simple business model for the past 50 years: offering a stable
lineup of programming to attract audiences and advertising
revenues.
</P>
<P>
PVR will change this model by letting viewers control what and
when they watch, said Forrester Research, a U.S. research firm
that analyzes the future of technology change and its impact on
businesses, consumers and society.
</P>
<P>
PVR is a consumer device that uses an intelligent interface and
an internal hard drive to digitally record programs in
anticipation of viewer demand. With features like instantaneous
fast-forward and reverse, the ability to pause live broadcasts and
easy-to-create viewer profiles, PVRs will broaden viewer options
by offering, at any given moment, a menu of recorded programs
based on the viewer's preferences.
</P>
<P>
By using PVRs, Forrester said in a report, TV ad show will be
cut nearly in half. The embrace of the device will usher in an era
of ubiquitous pay TV as broadcast, cable and satellite networks
scramble to replace declining advertising revenues.
</P>
<P>
According to Forrester, every major consumer electronics vendor
in the United States has a PVR device in the lab. By 2001,
interface improvements and bigger hard drives will help produce
PVRs costing something around 500 U.S. dollars that can store more
than 24 hours of video.
</P>
<P>
By 2004, Forrester estimates that 14 million Americans will be
watching TV on PVR-enabled sets. In ten years from now, PVRs will
penetrate four fifths of U.S. homes.
</P>
<P>
By creating television portals that enable viewers to surf
their own broadcast libraries, Forrester said, PVRs will change
consumers' viewing habits and TV industry as well. "The impact of
this change will be felt throughout the television industry," the
research report said.

<HEADLINE> Russia-Belarus Union Celebrates Third Anniversary of Founding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Belarus on Friday
celebrated the third anniversary of the founding of their union
with leaders of both countries vowing to strengthen the
consolidation, the Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov said Russia
and Belarus were maintaining close and strong ties in all fields.
</P>
<P>
Both countries had common history going back over the last
century and a common future. The experiences in the past three
years since the union was founded in 1996, indicated that a united
country could be founded while both nations kept their respective
autonomy, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
Belarus President Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko pointed out
that the union had benefited both countries. He called on Russia
to implement all the agreements within the framework of the Russia-
Belarus Union Treaty, signed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the union was a deterrent to NATO in its attack
on Yugoslavia: "Our two countries should stand together to face
the peril not far from our borders. The closer our two countries
join together, the less possible it is for our rivals to increase
the attack on Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said Belarus and Russia should found a new super
state based on the union to confront threats to international
stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed a declaration on December 25, 1998,
which listed an agenda of consolidation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem on Friday reiterated Argentina's sovereignty over the
Malvinas, and hoped to settle the issue with Britain through
diplomatic channel.
</P>
<P>
On the 17th anniversary of the start of the Malvinas war
between Argentina and Britain, Menem said on the national radio,"
the Malvinas archipelago belongs to Argentine, and we will
repeatedly call for the sovereignty over it and solve the problem
through peaceful means instead of bloodshed."
</P>
<P>
The president showed his confidence of having a dialogue with
Britain on the Malvinas issue.
</P>
<P>
On the improving Argentine-British ties in recent years, Menem
said that there exist possibilities for boosting bilateral
relations to the pre-war level and even further.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Menem expressed gratitude to those veterans who
participated in the Malvinas war for their great contribution to
the defense of their motherland.
</P>
<P>
On April 2, 1982, the Argentine troops stepped on the Malvinas
archipelago which had been occupied by Britain for a long time.
But the recovery efforts failed in the end.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's press on Friday came
out strongly against NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia, with
one newspaper claiming war was being waged for economic benefit.
</P>
<P>
El Sol de Mexico claimed NATO was targeting civilians, killing
100 people so far, injuring many more and forcing thousands of
families to abandon their homes.
</P>
<P>
The Novedades newspaper said in an editorial that the NATO
bombing had a negative impact on the members of this aberrant "
defense" organization.
</P>
<P>
If the air attacks failed to show results in a short time, none
of the NATO members would maintain its support for them under the
risk of adversely affecting public opinion, said Novedades.
</P>
<P>
Novedades said in its article, entitled "The NATO dilemma,"
that the air strikes had united the Slav states, like Ukraine and
Belarus, which had already voiced their opposition.
</P>
<P>
The two newspapers claimed the only way to end the conflict
between NATO and Yugoslavia was negotiation.

<HEADLINE> Two Suspected NATO Missiles Fall in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Two missiles fell in Albania's
Durres area and another rural district on the early morning of
Thursday, said a report accompanied by photographs of the sites in
Albania's "Gaze Ta Shqiptare" newspaper Friday.
</P>
<P>
Albanian engineering experts believed the missiles were NATO
anti-tank weapons lost by alliance aircraft crossing Albanian air
space on missions to Yugoslavia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The missiles did not explode because they were controlled and
ignited by electronic systems, noted the experts, although they
landed noisily and embedded themselves two meters deep in the
earth. The experts claimed they could have caused casualties if
they had hit a residential area.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO began its air raids against Yugoslavia on March 24,
two missiles have accidentally exploded in Bulgaria and one in
Macedonia although no injuries have been reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military said Friday
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) launched missile
attacks on the downtown of Yugoslav capital of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that NATO launched attacks on central
Belgrade since it started airstrikes against Yugoslavia on March
24.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm that targets in downtown Belgrade are being hit,
" U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Yugoslavia's civil defense
authorities' crisis center as saying that the blasts appeared to
come from the area of the Yugoslav and Serbian Interior Ministry
buildings in Belgrade. Both buildings are on a main downtown
pedestrian walkway.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses described hearing five explosions that shook the city
like an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"It was like a small earthquake," one Belgrade resident was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another eyewitness said the Interior Ministry had been hit. He
said huge flames were lighting the sky and that police had
cordoned off the area.
</P>
<P>
U.S. cruise missiles can be launched from aircraft, including B-
52 bombers, or from naval vessels. CNN reported that the missiles
had been fired from ships, including a British submarine, but
Pentagon and Navy officials declined to give any details of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Pentagon said NATO, frustrated by cloud cover over
Yugoslavia, had turned to weapons guided by the global positioning
system (GPS), which include the cruise missiles worth 1 million U.
S. dollars each.

<HEADLINE> China Emphasizes Geological Disaster Prevention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China will step up its efforts to
prevent and control geological disasters this year as new
administrative regulations takes effect, the China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the geological disasters in China, including
collapses, landslides, mud-rock flows and earth subsidence events,
are caused by artificial factors, according to Li Lierong,
Director of the Geological Environment Bureau of the Ministry of a
Land and Resources.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has required that geological disaster
prevention work should be based on comprehensive scientific
investigation and planning, the newspaper said, quoting official
regulations as saying that local governments above the county-
level and concerned State departments should map out local and
national prevention and control plans and designate areas
susceptible to geological disasters.
</P>
<P>
A forecasting system required by the regulations will be
strengthened both in the short and long terms, up to five years,
and the public is also encouraged to take part in daily monitoring
work in vulnerable areas, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that successful forecasting has helped 2,400 people
evade death from a reported 48 large landslides and mud-rock flows
that took place in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, an average of more than 1,000 people per year
have been killed or injured by various geological disasters with
related economic losses reaching 27 billion yuan, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The devastating flooding last summer caused many geological
disasters, arousing the attention of the central authorities,
according to Li.
</P>
<P>
Even now more than 400 counties and cities, as well as more
than 10,000 villages are threatened by landslides, collapses and
mud-rock flows, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that serious earth subsidence exists in 46 large-
and medium-sized cities in 16 provinces and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The southwestern and northwestern parts of China are the most
vulnerable to geological disasters, due to special local
geological conditions, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The Three-Gorges Dam area is a special area of concern for
geological-disaster prevention and control, and Li's ministry is
planning to install special monitoring stations in that area, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> 11.5 Bln Dollars in Indonesia Bad Bank Assets Seized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Bank Restructuring
Agency (IBRA) has taken over 100 trillion rupiah (11.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in non-performing loans from seven state banks, the
Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bad loans belong to some 1,200 debtors at Bank Bumi Daya,
Bank Dagang Negara, Bank Pembangunan Indonesia, Bank Tabungan
Negara, Bank Eksport Import Indonesia, Bank Rakyat Indonesia and
Bank Negara Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Bad debts have pushed the state banks into technical
bankruptcy, but they remain in operation because of the
government's deposit guarantee and liquidity support from the
central bank.
</P>
<P>
The financial restructuring would remove bad assets from the
banks' loan portfolios so they could concentrate their resources
on managing their productive assets, IBRA deputy chairman Eko S.
Budianto was quoted by as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that the transfer of the bad assets to the
IBRA would not automatically lead to the liquidation of corporate
debtors.
</P>
<P>
"Debtors who show good faith and still have good business
prospects will be helped to continue their operations through
credit restructuring," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a large number of the biggest debtors at
state banks are politically well-connected business people.
</P>
<P>
Recent media reports listed former president Soeharto's sons
and cronies among the largest debtors at four state banks: Bank
Bumi Daya, Bank Dagang Negara, Bank Eksport Import Indonesia and
Bank Pembangunan Indonesia. These four banks are in the process of
being merged to form Bank Mandiri.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Soeharto's youngest son Hutomo Mandala Putra
owed 400 million U.S. dollars and 1.7 trillion rupiah (195 million
U.S. dollars) to the four banks, and Soeharto's second son Bambang
Trihatmodjo and his associates owed the banks 2.7 billion U.S.
dollars and 1.9 trillion rupiah (218 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Businessman Prajogo Pangestu, a Soeharto crony, owes the banks
2.6 trillion rupiah (299 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Budianto said the IBRA would also take over the bad assets of
the nine private banks which had qualified for the government's
bank recapitalization program.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has issued a travel ban on 172
bankers, almost three weeks after the closure of 38 ailing banks.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Immigration Muhammad Mudakir said the ban
was imposed on Thursday at the request of Minister of Finance
Bambang Subianto, who said he had requested the Ministry of
Justice to ban "more than 170 bankers" from traveling abroad due
to debt problems.

RIO DE JANEIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazil suffers an annual
loss of 280 million U.S. dollars for the forgery of products, the
Brazilian Federal Attorney Office said Friday.

Tax evasion on the manufacture of compact discs amounts to 1.2
million dollars a year. The other most affected sectors are
garment, tobacco, beverage and toy.

industrial products, in a bid to reduce those losses amounting to
twice the annual revenue from the Rural Territorial Tax.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Attorney Office and the Association for Consumer
Protection will have authority to destroy the goods and the
machinery used to produce forgery items, said the law project.
</P>
<P>
The two agencies will be entitled to freeze the bank accounts

<HEADLINE> No Imminent Change in CPO Export Tax: Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has no
immediate plan to reduce export taxes on crude palm oil (CPO) and
its derivatives despite a drop in international prices, Minister
of Industry and Trade Rahardi Ramelan said.
</P>
<P>
"For now, I will not lower the taxes at least for the next two
months," Rahardi was quoted by the Jakarta Post Saturday as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Rahardi said he feared the price of cooking oil, the refined
byproduct of CPO, would rise sharply if the government lowered the
taxes.
</P>
<P>
The government would not reduce the export tax until CPO
production is sufficient to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
"If our CPO production increases sharply, perhaps to 7 million
or 8 million tons, then we do not have to worry about lowering the
export tax," he said, adding that the country's CPO production is
expected to surpass 6 million tons this year.
</P>
<P>
The government imposed an export tax on CPO products last year
to curb the surge in cooking oil prices on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Exporting has become an attractive option for producers since
the rupiah dropped sharply in value against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Most CPO producers export their products, resulting in short
supplies on the domestic market. As a result, the price of cooking
oil has increased sharply.
</P>
<P>
In February, the government slashed the export tax on CPO, palm
oil kernels and crude palm olein, to 40 percent each from 60
percent.

<HEADLINE> China Announces Top 100 Electronics Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China has announced its annual
list of the top 100 electronics enterprises for 1999, with Legend,
the country's largest computer maker, replacing three-year
champion Changhong as the No.1.
</P>
<P>
The list, started in 1987, is based on the companies' sales
volume in the year prior to the announcement.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Legend, with 17.6 billion yuan (2.12
billion US dollars) worth of sales in 1998, takes the lead in the
list.
</P>
<P>
Changhong, China's dominant TV supplier which has been the No.1
for the past three years, takes the second place while seeing its
sales dropping from 16.07 billion yuan (1.94 billion US dollars)
in 1997 to 14.1 billion yuan (1.7 billion US dollars) in 1998.
However, it overshadows all the others in another category:
positioning itself as the largest profit-maker among the top 100
with total profits in 1998 standing at 2.16 billion yuan (260
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shanghai General Electronic Group keeps its third rank, with
sales of 11.82 billion yuan (1.42 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A total of 15 new names have been added to this year's list.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Information Industry show that
sales of the top 100 companies account for 74 percent of the
sector's total. The top 10 gather 33 percent of the sector's sales.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say China's surging demand for computer and
telecommunication products paves the way for expansion of the
companies.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 3 (Xinhua) -- China's Jilin Province has come
up with regulations to protect its rare Changbai Pine, which grows
only in northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
The pine is considered by scientists to be rare and valuable
because it contains a gene not available in other tree species. So,
to protect this gene bank the local government set up a 112-
hectare provincial nature reserve as early as 1985.
</P>
<P>
The reserve will have 3 parts for scientific research and
tourism. A special fund is also expected to be established to
support it.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also say that people who violate the
regulations will be penalized and could be taken to court.
</P>
<P>
Changbai Pines are growing on 4.8 fewer hectares of ground and
745 of the rare pines were damaged by uncontrolled logging and
pollution, according to an official in charge of the nature
reserve.
</P>
<P>
The regulations have been submitted to the provincial People's
Congress for final approval.

<HEADLINE> Reigning Champion Sweden Faces First-Round Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Surprisingly losing two singles
matches, Davis Cup holders Sweden was facing the first-round
defeat at home to Slovakia in its bid to win the coveted trophy
for a third successive time.
</P>
<P>
Italy, runner-up last year, was also shocked with the prospect
of first-round outing as it lost the first two singles to
Switzerland at Neuchatel.
</P>
<P>
In the other hand, the United States, with the absence of top
players, thwarted Britain's ambitions in Birmingham when Jim
Courier and Todd Martin scored victories over Tim Henman and Greg
Rusedski respectively.
</P>
<P>
Australia fought back from the defeat of Mark Philippoussis by
Byron Black in the opening match to stand 1-1 with Zimbabwe in
Harare as Patrick Rafter beat Black's brother Wayne in the second
singles.
</P>
<P>
Other four first-rounders were all level at 1-1, with Germany
fighting Russia, France against the Netherlands, Spain playing
Brazil and Belgium contesting Slovakia.
</P>
<P>
In Trollhattan, 31st-ranked Dominik Hrbaty scored the most
unexpected point for Slovakia through a full-set victory of 7-5, 4-
6, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 over 15th-ranked Thomas Enqvist of Sweden in a
three-and-half-a-hour marathon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Karol Kucera had disposed more easily of Swedish
number two Thomas Johansson 6-1, 7-6 (9-7), 2-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good chance to make it to the second round. I said
to Karol that he should win only one point and I will win the two
other points," Hrbaty said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swedes have not abandoned hope as its captain Carl-
Axel hageskog said "I am always optimistic. I have a very good
team. We are favourites for the doubles and we will have two very
open matches on Sunday."
</P>
<P>
In Neuchatel, veteran Marc Rosset and budding star Roger
Federer gave Switzerland a comfortable 2-0 lead over Italy.
</P>
<P>
Federer, 17, playing in his first Davis Cup match after
finished last season as the number one ranked junior, brushed
aside top-ranked Italian Davide Sanguinetti 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 6-4
after Rosset battled past Gianluca Pozzi 7-6, 6-4, 7-6.
</P>
<P>
In England, Todd Martin swept aside Greg Rusedski 6-4, 6-4, 6-2
to give the United States a 2-0 lead in a historic Davis Cup first
round tie on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Martin, ranked eight in the world, played with clinical
precision throughout as Rusedski's ferocious serve failed to fire
on the indoor carpet surface to the huge disappointment of the 9,
500 crowd.
</P>
<P>
Earlier former world number one Jim Courier used all his
courage and experience to beat Tim Henman 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 7-6 (7-3)
, 6-7 (10-12) and 7-5 in four hours 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Britain has only once come back from 2-0 down to win a Davis
Cup tie, in 1930 against Germany.
</P>
<P>
This world group tie is a repeat of the first Cup match, won 3-
0 by the U.S. in Boston, and is being played in the centenary year
of the men's team competition.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, April 3 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has shown that
the onset of menopause in the women of the capital of China's
Guangdong Province has gone from 45 years of age 20 years ago to
50.3 now.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 900 housewives done by the city's women and
children's health care center found that this is a year later than
the average for China's urban women.
</P>
<P>
A health-care expert at the center says that the delayed
climacteric is the product of the improved standard of living and
diet and that local women have more variety and nutrition in their
food, which helps improve the secretion of female hormones.
</P>
<P>
Women have also become fonder of morning exercise or other
activities like dance, tennis, and use of gymnasiums and swimming
pools.
</P>
<P>
Sex has also become a more open topic in Chinese magazines and
on TV programs and increased information in the mass media has
played an important role in understanding female hormones.

The Federal Police of Traffic (PFC) said Friday that in the
past 24 hours, at least 21 people were killed and 113 others
injured, and economic losses surpassed 300,000 U.S. dollars,

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. military said Friday
it was attacking the downtown of the Yugoslav capital of Belgrade
with cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
"We can confirm that targets in downtown Belgrade are being hit,
" U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted Yugoslavia's civil defense
authorities' crisis center as saying that the blasts appeared to
come from the area of the Interior Ministry in downtown Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"It was like a small earthquake," one Belgrade resident was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another eyewitness said the Interior Ministry had been hit. He
said huge flames were lighting the sky and that police had
cordoned off the area.
</P>
<P>
U.S. cruise missiles can be launched from aircraft, including B-
52 bombers, or from naval vessels.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Pentagon officials declined to give details of the attack,
but spokesman Bacon said U.S. troops were using weapons guided by
the global positioning system to get around the problem of cloud
cover over Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 3 (Xinhua) China will encourage Beijing, Qinghua,
Fudan and other prestigious universities to set up links with
their counterparts in the United States to increase the two
countries' cooperation in education, the China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education will help organize forums between
university presidents from China and the United States and conduct
professional and academic information exchanges, said Zhang Xiuqin,
deputy director of the ministry's Department of International
Cooperation and Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Student and scholar exchange programs will continue, the
English newspaper quoted Zhang as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-US education exchange has become a significant part of
China's education cooperation with the rest of the world,' Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
She said that China has sent 163,100 students and scholars to
the United States over the past two decades, 56 percent of China's
total number of students and scholars sent abroad.
</P>
<P>
To date 43,300 have returned, Zhang said, adding that the rest
are continuing their studies at more than 1,000 universities and
working in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States has sent 859 students to China
over the past 20 years on Chinese Government scholarships, Zhang
said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, increasing numbers of US students are paying
fees on their own to attend courses in Chinese language, culture,
social sciences and the arts, she said.
</P>
<P>
Sino-US education exchanges are generally conducted through non-
governmental channels, according to Zhang, who said that many
Chinese universities have set up solid links with their US
counterparts and collaborated fruitfully in natural sciences,
engineering and the humanities.

MANILA, April 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Philippine newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The release of the abducted Philippine military and police
officers may be delayed further after the National Democratic
Front Friday accused the military of "offensively deploying"
troops in Mindanao, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
-- The non-performing loans of 117 operating thrift banks in
the Philippines reached 16.4 percent of total portfolio or 3.25

1997, the Central Bank of the Philippines said Friday.
</P>

Manila Bulletin:

<HEADLINE> Russia Urges G-8 Emergency Meeting on Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov Friday proposed an emergency meeting of the Group of Eight
(G-8) to seek a negotiated settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Ivanov called on all sides involved to
return to the negotiation table, saying that Russia would
cooperate with any country which wants a political solution to the
Yugoslav crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia believed that the G-8 would play an active role
in solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
He accused NATO of planning ground military actions against
Yugoslavia despite the peace call by all sides.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the NATO air strikes had led to a great influx of
Kosovo refugees which was taken by NATO as an excuse for its
ground military actions.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia sent a reconnaissance ship to the Mediterranean
on Thursday because NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia was
encroaching on Russia's national interests, adding that the move
was in line with the First Stage of the Russia-U.S. Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he denied reports that Russia was offering direct
help to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said the Yugoslav crisis would be solved eventually
through negotiations on a new basis since the results of the
Rambouillet peace talks had been destroyed by NATO's air strikes.

<P>
CARACAS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government called
Friday on the parts involved in the Kosovo conflict to use all
peaceful means provided by international laws.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot hide our concern for the recourse to force in the
Kosovo conflict, without observing what is in articles 53 and 54
of the United Nations Charter, in which it is said that the
Security Council must authorize and be informed about the actions
of military character of some organization of regional nature,"
said a statement of the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The government also reaffirmed its commitment with the U.N. and
called on the parts to cease hostilities and resume political
negotiations, to prevent more blood shedding, more refugees and
higher social cost for the nations involved in the conflict and to
guarantee human rights and world peace.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO missiles hit the
headquarters of the Yugoslav Interior Ministry and the Serbian
Republic Interior Ministry in downtown Belgrade early at 00:45
Saturday (23:45GMT Friday).
</P>
<P>
The buildings, located about 200 meters apart in the Knez
Milosh street and in the proximity of 25 medical facilities, were
still in flames.
</P>
<P>
Access to the buildings was blocked and it was not immediately
known whether there were any casualties.
</P>
<P>
Explosions could be heard from nearby, possibly from the
ordances stored inside the buildings.
</P>
<P>
Zoran Mujibegsvich, a 50-year-old artist living in a building
nearby, witnessed the explosions while smoking at his window
facing the buildings.
</P>
<P>
"This is senseless," Mujibegsvich said, pointing nearby medical
facilities such as the Serbian Medical Center, the largest
maternity hospital and a hospital for the mentally retarded.
</P>
<P>
At about the same time early Saturday, NATO missiles also
attacked the areas near Mt. Fruska Gora in Voivodina near Novi Sad,
some 82 kilometers north of Belgrade, the Tanjug news agency
reported.

<HEADLINE> Villa Held Goalless Draw Against West Ham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Aston Villa and West Ham played to
a goalless draw in a dull match of the English Premier League on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Villa created more chances in a match, but in the end, they had
to settle for a point apiece in this premier league battle.
</P>
<P>
The Birmingham side remain sixth in the standings with 45
points on the back of a disastrous run which has seen them lose
seven of their last nine games.
</P>
<P>
West Ham stay fifth on 47 points.
</P>
<P>
The match began badly for the visitors when England squad
defender Rio Ferdinand was stretchered off in only the sixth
minute with damaged ankle ligaments after being fouled by Mark
Draper.
</P>
<P>
Then, despite gaining better possession before the break, the
Hammers saw Villa three times come close to scoring.
</P>
<P>
A curving long-range shot from striker Dion Dublin was neatly
saved by goalkeeper Shaka Hislop and later Ian Taylor just failed
to slide onto the end of a precision Draper cross.
</P>
<P>
In the 44th minute, Villa enjoyed their best chance of the half
when Dublin out-jumped the West Ham defence only to see his header
bounce back off the left post.
</P>
<P>
Then West Ham, looking for their fifth win in seven league
games, came even closer to going one-up a minute later when
Cameroon signing Mark Vivien Foe split the Villa defence with an
angled through ball.
</P>
<P>
Italian striker Paolo Di Canio was in the box to hammer the
ball home but he was ruled off-side.

<HEADLINE> Players' Wages Hit Club Coffers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Rapidly rising players' wages and
spiralling transfer fees must be kept under control if football
clubs are to survive, the chairman of one of England's premiership
sides says.
</P>
<P>
Leeds Sporting chairman Peter Ridsdale said his club's payroll
costs were up by 6% in its six month reporting period.
</P>
<P>
Wage inflation is one of the key talking points in the industry
as players cash in on lucrative television deals.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 Bosman ruling allowing players in Europe to move on
free transfers when out of contract has further strengthened the
bargaining position of the top stars.
</P>
<P>
The issue was brought into focus on Tuesday when Manchester
United, Europe's biggest club, said it was putting up ticket
prices by as much as 14% to help cover its soaring wage costs.
</P>
<P>
"The future challenge, not only to ourselves but to the sector
as a whole, is to face up to the reality that player transfer fees
and wages must not be allowed to continue to grow at levels that
are unsustainable when compared to the income growth from the
customer base," said Mr Ridsdale, chairman of Leeds Sporting,
owners of Leeds United.
</P>
<P>
Leeds, which reported a pre-tax profit of 1.87m ($3m) in the
six months to 31 December, said its wage bill would grow slightly
more rapidly as new deals for David Batty, Lucas Radebe and Nigel
Martyn kick in.
</P>
<P>
Leeds Managing Director Jeremy Fenn said the club would this
summer seek to negotiate new contracts with Dutch striker Jimmy
Floyd Hasselbaink and a number of the young players who have
helped take the club to fourth place in the English premier league.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- England soccer manager Kevin Keegan
has refused to rule out taking on the England manager's job on a
permanent basis.
</P>
<P>
Keegan began his international career with an encouraging
victory over Sweden last week, but the Swedes 1-0 group five win
in Poland this week leaves England facing the play-offs to qualify
for Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said: "I have never said 100% that I am staying or going.
The prospect of the play-offs does not affect my position.
</P>
<P>
"I struck a deal - that Fulham agreed to - that I would do the
England job until the end of the season. It is not right for me to
start working on anything else, not just yet.
</P>
<P>
"There will be time to talk things through. Certainly on the
plane home from Bulgaria in June we will have a clearer idea of
what is going to happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Freddie Ljungberg, who scored for Sweden against
Poland, reckons England's hopes of qualification have increased
following the departure of Glenn Hoddle as coach.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal midfielder said: "We are lucky Kevin Keegan did not
take over before. I doubt whether we would be five points ahead at
this stage."

play, respect towards the opponent, respect towards the referee
and behaviour of the team officials, according to the director.
</P>
<P>
As a general rule, maximum points shall only be awarded if the
team concerned displays a positive attitude, Cooper said, adding
that the assessment stresses the positve rather than the negative
aspects.
</P>
<P>
In addition to being presented with a symbolic honour in the
form of a trophy, he noted, the winning team will receive a
voucher valued at 10,000 U.S. dollars, which may be exchanged for
Adidas equipment.
</P>
<P>
At the last FIFA WYC held in Malaysia in 1997, this honour went
to the reigning champions of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
In keeping with tradition, the FIFA will present the Golden
Shoe Award to the player scoring the highest number of goals and
Golden Ball Award to the outstanding player of the competition as
voted by the media present at the championship.
</P>
<P>
Cooper told the press conference that FIFA will rely on a
Technical Study Group (TSG) to provide statistics and studies into
various aspects of the game.
</P>
<P>
The TSG is mainly responsible for the production and
publication of an official report of the event as well as of
various videos to use at development courses, he added.

WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Two of three Romanian gymnasts
who disappeared from a Virginia hotel last weekend have been found
in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
Viorel Popescu and Marian Malita told Wesh-TV in Orlando on
Thursday that they traveled by bus to Orlando because they wanted
to see the United States despite their coaches' objections.
</P>
<P>
Their teammate, Vasile Cioana, is in New York, the television
station reported today.
</P>
<P>
The three gymnasts left their team in Virginia after completing
a competition in Richmond Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Their visas to remain in the United States will be expired in
three months.
</P>
<P>
Popescu and Malita said they have not decided if they will try
to stay in the United States or return to Romania. They currently
are staying in Orlando in a two-bedroom apartment with three other
people.
</P>
<P>
The three young gymnastes are among the top six in the Romanian
men's team. If they do not return home, it could weaken the team's
chances of qualifying for the 2000 Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says No Intention of Sending Ground Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said again Friday that he has no intention of introducing American
ground forces into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I still believe that we have a good possibility of achieving
our mission with the means that we have deployed," he said,
referring to the air and sea power now involved.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with officials of relief
agencies in White House, Clinton said that there's still a "good
possibility" of returning the ethnic Albanians to Kosovo using the
present strategy of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"I was very impressed that they (private aid officials)
reported that the refugees coming out strongly support the action
that NATO has taken," Clinton said, adding that he intends "to
stick with the NATO allies and provide for the return of the
Kosovars."
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian situation, as all of you know, remains grave
in Kosovo," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Although some critics said the NATO airstrikes against the
forces of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic have prompted an
escalation of violence against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Clinton
said reports from the thousands fleeing the province prove such
claims unfounded.
</P>
<P>
The United States has sent 91 million U.S. dollars in
humanitarian aid to the region since last year. On Wednesday,
Clinton authorized another 50 million U.S. dollars in support and
directed the Pentagon to airlift food and other supplies to the
countries neighboring the Kosovo province that are being swamped
with refugees.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- David L. Smith has been
arrested and charged with authorizing the e-mail virus
"Melissa", according to Friday's Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
Melissa appeared last Friday and spread rapidly around the
world by Monday. The virus caused infected computers to fire off
dozens of messages to friends and colleagues, temporarily
clogging e-mail systems. It led to worldwide e-mail disruption,
threatening the security of government and business documents.
</P>
<P>
The suspect was tracked down with the help of America Online
technicians, and a computer task force of federal and state
agents. He was arrested Thursday night at his brother's
house in nearby Eatontown, and he originated the virus from his
apartment in Aberdeen, said a spokeswoman for the New Jersey
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
30-year-old Smith is charged with interfering with public
communication, which carries a sentence of 5 to 10 years in
prison and up to a 150,000 U.S.Dollar fine.

<HEADLINE> Feature: We'll Build a Better Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Mihailo Davidovic
watched his granddaughter Christine and grandson Nenad placing a
bundle of daffodil on the body of the broken bridge, known as the
Old Novi Sad Bridge.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old retiree recalled that the bridge was there
connecting the city of Novi Sad and the town of Petrovaradin when
he was of the age of his grandson, now six.
</P>
<P>
The bridge now rested inside instead of above the Danube River
that meanders its way through the capital city of the Voivodina
province of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
It was hit by two NATO cruise missiles on Thursday while a
third missile missed the target, according to telephone technician
Sreckovic Tibor who lives just above the southern bank of the
river by the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old technician just could not figure out why NATO
chose the bridge for a target. The bridge had been one used by
civilians of the two cities to its two ends.
</P>
<P>
He himself used to run across the bridge everyday as his daily
exercise but now he felt the void left by the broken bridge in his
daily life.
</P>
<P>
Tibor went up the ancient castle by the bridge over the past
two days to think over the whole development of NATO air strikes
against his country.
</P>
<P>
"What did my country do wrong? Who gave NATO the right to bomb
others as it wishes? Who will be able to stop NATO from
continuing?" he asked the sky high up on the terrace of the castle
facing north toward the broken bridge.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, hundreds of Novi Sad dwellers gathered at the
bridge head of the Old Novi Sad Bridge to protest against the
aggression by NATO and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Some women protesters could not help weeping when they saw the
broken bridge being washed by the swift water of the Danube while
others placed yellow flowers near the bridge head, wrote slogans
on the body of the broken bridge and tied national colors onto the
rails of the broken bridge.
</P>
<P>
One protester wrote in clean capital letters:
We'll build a better bridge.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder: Germany to Receive Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, April 3 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
Saturday announced in Bonn that his country would admit Kosovo
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference on Kosovo crisis with
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and Defense Minister Rudolf
Scharping, Schroeder said Bonn expected other members of the
European Union (EU) to take the same kind action.
</P>
<P>
"You can not allow the little countries Macedonia and Albania
to alone deal with the problem," Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed that to end NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia Belgrade should at first stop what he termed "ethnic
expulsion policy in Kosovo, withdraw military and para-military
forces from the region and let the refugees return homeland under
international protection.
</P>
<P>
Fischer and Scharping said that the NATO at present had no
reason to change its air raid strategy.
</P>
<P>
A political solution is possible only after the Yugoslav side
stop its fighting actions (in Kosovo), and the refugees return
home without any danger, the two ministers said.
</P>
<P>
Scharping also announced that German forces had started actions
to provide emergency aid for Kosovo refugees in Macedonia,
Albania, and Greece.
</P>
<P>
The German military planes on Saturday carried totally 50 tons
of food, medicine, and other articles for the refugees, and German
doctors will be sent to the region, Scharping said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, a Defense Ministry spokesman said that German
forces in Macedonia had begun setting up a camp for up to 1,000
Kosovo refugees.

<HEADLINE> Britons and Serbs Keep on Protests Against NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 3 (Xinhua) - Some 2,000 Serbs and Britons on
Saturday continued to protest in front of the British prime
minister's office here, demanding an end to NATO's air strikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"NATO is the problem not the solution," a poster said among the
crowd, many of them waving Serbian flags and other slogans
condemning NATO's bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration outside Downing Street reached the 11th day
on Saturday. Some of the protesters have been there day and night
ever since NATO started its air strikes on Yugoslavia 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
NATO's action is a violation of Article 2 of the U.N. Charter
that prohibits the use of force against a sovereign state, where
it has not committed aggression on other states, one of the
protesters told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
It is also a violation of NATO's own charter which claims it is
a defensive organization and is only committed to force if one of
its members is attacked, he said.
</P>
<P>
The protesters also accused NATO of adopting double standards
for conflicts elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration would go on until NATO stops its action in
Yugoslavia, one of the organizers, Mick Elbhlim said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Saturday
that NATO would continue the air strikes "until the terms that
NATO has set out are fully complied with."
</P>
<P>
NATO is demanding that Yugoslavia sign the "peace treaty"
initiated by the West, which guarantees "substantial autonomy" to
Kosovo Albanians and "invites" NATO troops to Kosovo to monitor
the implementation of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia refused to sign the treaty, repeatedly saying that
it strongly violated its territorial integrity and sovereignty.
Russia said recently that the peace agreement was "dead" after
NATO's military action.
