EDITORIAL: THE JUDICIARY STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 4th graf, That means ..., to DROP reference to
threatened Democratic boycott) 
(af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Nov. 18: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats on the House Judiciary
Committee convene Thursday under the uncertain leadership of the
committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde, the partisan interests will
be easy enough to discern. Republicans will be trying to determine
if recommending impeachment hearings to the full House will damage
them politically. Democrats will be trying to defend a president
whose conduct they find distasteful and shift criticism to an
independent counsel they will depict as dangerous. The question for
the rest of us _ and especially the next House Speaker, Bob
Livingston _ is what outcome would serve the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   This question must be addressed against the backdrop of current
political realities. There is still a mood of national revulsion
about President Clinton's conduct, his public lies to the American
people, his sworn misrepresentations in court and grand jury
proceedings and his use of others to lie for him, both in public
and in legal statements. But that mood is moderated by the
widespread belief, based on troubling evidence, that Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel, used improper tactics to catch him.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there is little public backing for removing Clinton
from office by resignation or impeachment on the present evidence.
Yet it is imperative, as a matter of orderly governance in the
future, for Congress to find a way to condemn Clinton for his
signal failing in one of the core duties of his office _ to uphold
the rule of law. It must also find a way to air the arguments on
whether Starr has abused fairness or due process in investigating
the president.
</P>
<P>
   That means at a minimum that Hyde must allow Starr's tactics, as
well as the president's conduct, to be a full part of these
hearings. The matters with which Starr has been entrusted are too
important and his charges against Clinton too profound for him to
dodge a public accounting. Hyde cannot function as Starr's
bodyguard. Nor should he, or committee Democrats, rush ahead with
plans to call other witnesses until the import of Starr's testimony
can be digested. What will make this already polarized committee
into a shambles is Hyde's decision to suddenly call witnesses like
John Huang, the campaign finance figure, without establishing an
orderly context for working through the entire case.
</P>
<P>
   The first priority Thursday is to give the Democrats and the
White House a fair chance and ample time to test Starr, just as he
must be given a fair chance to argue that his evidence warrants
impeachment. This page is eager to see Starr's response to the
accumulation of troubling disclosures about his methods. In the
past, we have defended the independent counsel against a White
House campaign of vilification that ignored his status as a duly
appointed government prosecutor. But the standard we set for him on
Jan. 22, when the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, still applies:
``The burden on him in this case is to prove he had reason to
pursue this line of inquiry. He must also show that he did not
exceed his mandate or abuse his prosecutorial powers through
entrapment or the use of biased or delusional witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation needs to hear Starr's answers to important questions
that the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee have every right to
raise. Starr said in his referral to Congress that he first learned
of the Lewinsky affair from Linda Tripp on Jan. 12. But the office
may have been tipped on or by Jan. 9. That is the same day Ms.
Tripp suggested to Ms. Lewinsky that she refuse to sign her
affidavit in the Paula Jones case until Vernon Jordan guaranteed
her a job. Starr needs to react to the Democratic charge that the
alleged jobs-for-silence deal involving Jordan originated with his
witness, Ms. Tripp, or his prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Another area that needs an airing is whether there was collusion
between Starr's office and the attorneys for Paula Jones that could
have been designed to catch Clinton in a perjury trap. On Jan. 16
Starr's deputies confronted Ms. Lewinsky about filing a false
affidavit in the Jones case. Yet, at that moment, the judge in the
case had not yet received the document. How did Starr's staff know
about it? The question whether Starr knowingly allowed Ms. Tripp to
feed data about Ms. Lewinsky and her dealings with the prosecutors
to Ms. Jones' attorneys on Jan. 16 also looms large. Another
question is whether Starr's staff violated Ms. Lewinsky's rights
and Justice Department rules during their initial meeting by
threats designed to prevent her from calling her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the verdict on Starr, it will not solve the
overriding question of what Congress and the public can do to
protect the institution of the presidency from the recklessness and
disrespect inflicted on it by Clinton. The legal aphorism that
questions whether a miscreant should go free just because the
constable stumbles is useful here. Clinton's lawyers learned last
Dec. 5 that Ms. Jones' lawyers knew about Monica Lewinsky. That
means he presumably had more than a month before his Jan. 17
deposition to figure out a way to avoid lying. No matter how badly
the Republicans behave or Starr overreached, Congress has to take
notice when the possibility of perjury, subornation of perjury and
tampering with witnesses touches on the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to the lively debate among politicians and
constitutional scholars, we are more firmly convinced that
congressional censure is not only allowable but essential to the
health of the Republic. Clinton has apologized only for behaving
badly. Congress will have failed in its duty as a guardian of the
American future if it does not formally condemn his failure to
respect and uphold the rule of law. Starr's blunders, Clinton's
recklessness and the tawdriness of the Lewinsky-Tripp tapes
released Tuesday all contribute to an atmosphere that will make it
difficult to reach a balanced, carefully considered conclusion. But
Richard Gephardt, the House minority leader, is right to say that
Congress must go on record. At the conclusion of the Republican
leadership election Wednesday, Livingston, as the presumptive
Speaker, assumes the burden of guiding his fractious party and the
erratic Hyde toward that resolution. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ They want a 32-hour week, a national health service
and the right to work to be made a legal requirement. Welcome to
New Labor.
</P>
<P>
   The significant letter there is the missing ``u.'' The Labor
Party in question is a new arrival on the American political scene,
one that takes inspiration from Britain's Labour Party but which
looks more to the union-based party of the 1970s than the glossy
new creation of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party has been meeting for the past two days in
blue-collar Pittsburgh, and has decided that for the first time it
will actually start fielding candidates in elections.
</P>
<P>
   So far the party, the creation of 72-year-old union official
Anthony Mazzocchi, has concentrated on sparking debate rather than
winning power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of people being turned off by the two
political parties,'' a jubilant Mazzocchi told the 1,200 delegates.
``We're convinced there's going to be an alternative party. It's
either going to come from us or from the right.''
</P>
<P>
   The party draws heavily on support from the unions. Mazzocchi
himself is an assistant to the President of the Oil, Chemical and
Atomic Workers' Union. Most unions are aligned with the Democrats,
and are not happy about Mazzocchi. But as the T-shirts in
Pittsburgh read, ``The Bosses Have Two Parties. Now We Have One Of
Our Own.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party exploits the growing sense in the Democrats that
the party under Bill Clinton has shifted away from the needs of
working men and women.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years it has collected signatures for a
constitutional amendment guaranteeing the right to work for a
living wage. It backs a Canadian-style health service, and it wants
to limit the working week to 32 hours.
</P>
<P>
   It also wants to give every American four weeks of vacation a
year, in a country where paid vacations are still much lower than
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   America has an even more heavily entrenched two-party system
than Britain. But independents have done well in America over the
past few years, with Ross Perot running for president, an
independent member of Congress (Bernie Sanders from Vermont), and
now two independent governors: Angus King in Maine and Jesse ``the
Body'' Ventura, the former wrestler, in Minnesota. &QL;

 c.1998 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a new and prestigious symbol listed on the
New York Stock Exchange Tuesday. It was ``DSX'' and it stands for
DaimlerChrysler, the new combination of two of the world's most
venerable car-makers _ corporations with both track records and
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares, when you have TGLO to invest in? Now, TGLO is the
ticker symbol for a tiny New York outfit that calls itself
theglobe.com. This is a company with almost no track record and,
worse, no profits at all.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it has a history only of losses and its founders cannot
even tell when they might make a profit. But theglobe.com is an
Internet company so, naturally, you are going to shower it with
your hard-earned money anyway. It stands to reason _ or not.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the company, which offers help in creating
personalized websites, made history with an initial public
offering, or IPO, of shares in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Priced the night before at a modest $9 each, the shares at one
point reached $97 during trading on Friday before finally settling
at the market's close at $63.50.
</P>
<P>
   That still meant an increase on the day of sevenfold, or a
breathtaking 606 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO, engineered by the Bear Stearns brokerage house, thus
became the most successful, in value-gain terms, ever seen on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during Friday, shares in theglobe.com each changed hands
no fewer than five times, such was the frenzy among investors, many
of them single individuals buying and selling the fledgling shares
over their home computers.
</P>
<P>
   What happened on Friday, however, was not an isolated incident
of collective investor lunacy. Rather, it was just another
illustration of the stunning clamor in the U.S., and also in
Britain, for anything that is moving these days in the Internet
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seems to be harboring the same dream _ somewhere out
there is the new Microsoft. If theglobe.com is it, they want to
make sure that they have a slice.
</P>
<P>
   What we have, in fact, is a contemporary version of the American
gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is the new Wild West. Just as in the days of the
old frontier, there are dangers around every corner. But, for now,
caution is taking second place to greed.
</P>
<P>
   Already, however, a few are getting insanely rich. Take Michael
Egan, 58, the former chairman of the Alamo rent-a-car company, who
is now chairman of the New York-based theglobe.com.
</P>
<P>
   With 6.01 million shares in his pocket, by Friday night he had
seen his stake in the company take on a value of $381.6 million.
That is not bad for a single day's work.
</P>
<P>
   Theglobe.com, in fact, came on the heels of another company that
also went public last week. Earth Web, also based in New York's
aptly named Silicon Alley, offers Internet professionals a forum to
chat on line about problems and new software products.
</P>
<P>
   It debuted last Wednesday with an IPO share price of $14. By
Friday's close it had risen fivefold to $48.69.
</P>
<P>
   Its suddenly wealthy president and the chief executive is Jack
Hidary, who founded the company in 1994 with his brother, Murray
Hidary.
</P>
<P>
   True, there has been a slight cooling in the enthusiasm for
theglobe.com and Earth Web since last week. As some investors saw
the chance for profit taking, theglobe.com saw its market value
slip 23 percent on Monday. Earth Web also suffered some slippage
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the ability of Internet stocks to defy gravity is a
phenomenon that is shocking even to many of the professional
analysts. ``The valuations being ascribed to these very young
companies makes almost no sense,'' said Lise Buyer, an analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this, for example _ theglobe.com had a market value on
Friday night of $622 million, while in the first nine months of the
year it made a loss of $11.5 million on revenue of $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   That means it was trading at a market capitalization that was at
357 times revenue. The average U.S. company trades at five times
its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the IPO by theglobe.com ``would never have
happened if you did not have the Internet feeding frenzy,'' said
David Menlow, the president of the IPO Financial Network news
service.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not just the latest start-ups that are sucking
cash. According to Goldman Sachs, Internet stocks as a whole shot
up no less than 11.5 percent just in the first 10 days of this
month.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than double other sectors in a market which,
admittedly, has been having an unexpectedly strong run since the
downturn of early October. Among the star performers is Bay Inc.,
an on-line auctioneer, which also recently listed and is now worth
almost $5 billion _ about 733 times its expected 1999 revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month's market lows, Yahoo!, the browser engine, has
seen its value soar by 72 percent, while Amazon.com, the on-line
bookseller, is up 139 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, who is also its chief executive,
was skyrocketing again yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, all about expectations. More specifically,
it is about the expectation that doing business on the Internet,
and especially retail commerce, is about to boom.
</P>
<P>
   Proof may come as soon as this Christmas season. Recent studies
show that consumers in the U.S. are poised to spend $2.3 billion
buying products via cyberspace, up from $1.1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the polling company Louis Harris, 43 percent of all
Americans who own computers will do some of their Christmas
shopping on the Internet, compared with just 10 percent a year
ago. &QL;

companies makes almost no sense,'' said Lise Buyer, an analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this, for example _ theglobe.com had a market value on
Friday night of $622 million, while in the first nine months of the
year it made a loss of $11.5 million on revenue of $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   That means it was trading at a market capitalization that was at
357 times revenue. The average U.S. company trades at five times
its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the IPO by theglobe.com ``would never have
happened if you did not have the Internet feeding frenzy,'' said
David Menlow, the president of the IPO Financial Network news
service.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not just the latest start-ups that are sucking
cash. According to Goldman Sachs, Internet stocks as a whole shot
up no less than 11.5 percent just in the first 10 days of this
month.
</P>
<P>
   That is more than double other sectors in a market which,
admittedly, has been having an unexpectedly strong run since the
downturn of early October. Among the star performers is Bay Inc.,
an on-line auctioneer, which also recently listed and is now worth
almost $5 billion _ about 733 times its expected 1999 revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month's market lows, Yahoo!, the browser engine, has
seen its value soar by 72 percent, while Amazon.com, the on-line
bookseller, is up 139 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, founded by Jeff Bezos, who is also its chief executive,
was skyrocketing again yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, all about expectations. More specifically,
it is about the expectation that doing business on the Internet,
and especially retail commerce, is about to boom.
</P>
<P>
   Proof may come as soon as this Christmas season. Recent studies
show that consumers in the U.S. are poised to spend $2.3 billion
buying products via cyberspace, up from $1.1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the polling company Louis Harris, 43 percent of all
Americans who own computers will do some of their Christmas
shopping on the Internet, compared with just 10 percent a year
ago. &QL;

CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR OFFERS PATRIOTS A STADIUM IN HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Gov. John Rowland has offered to build a
stadium for the New England Patriots as part of a $350 million
development project in downtown Hartford. The team's owner, Robert
Kraft, who has failed to win a stadium deal from Massachusetts,
flew to Hartford this week and spent five hours discussing the deal
with Connecticut officials.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft and the governor ate lunch at the executive mansion on
Monday and then, in an extraordinary scene, the two traveled to the
Legislative Office Building and went door to door to answer
questions from legislative leaders, according to people who were
there.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft has expressed exasperation with his inability to make a
deal with the Massachusetts Legislature to replace the 27-year-old
Foxboro Stadium, about 30 miles south of Boston. And Rowland has
said his main goal for his second term, which begins in January, is
to revitalize the state's largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials said they were very concerned that their
proposal could be used as leverage by Kraft to win concessions from
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be the bridesmaid at a wedding consummated by
someone else,'' said one legislative leader who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. But state officials said that they saw hope
in the length of the talks, and in Kraft's stated desire to keep
the team in New England despite his apparent stalemate with
Massachusetts officials.
</P>
<P>
   Officials involved in the negotiations cautioned that the
specifics of the deal were not yet set. The $350 million price tag
could include a convention center and possibly other projects,
including a hotel, retail stores and parking.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms being discussed, the Patriots would not have to
pay any money upfront. The state would finance the construction
costs by selling bonds, and the Patriots would use the stadium
rent-free. In return, the Patriots would give the state 10 percent
of all revenue from tickets, parking and concessions. Legislative
and administration officials said that if an agreement were
reached, a special session of the state Legislature would likely be
held in December to vote on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle for Connecticut is that Hartford, which is 110 miles
from Boston, is a much smaller media market. Boston is the nation's
sixth-largest television market, with 2.2 million households, while
Hartford is 27th, with 910,000, according to Nielsen Media
Research. But state officials who have talked with Kraft said that
because many Patriots season ticketholders live in the suburbs, he
believes that the team would retain a significant part of its fan
base despite the move.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unlike the National Football League's many mobile franchises,
the Patriots have remained closely identified with the Boston area,
where the team began in 1960 as an original member of the American
Football League. The team's logo is a minuteman _ one of the
Colonial soldiers who once drilled on Boston Common _ and the team
was called the Boston Patriots for its first 11 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials said the state is demanding an unusually
long commitment from the Patriots, perhaps as long as 30 years. The
planned open-air stadium would seat about 65,000 and sit at the
intersection of Interstates 84 and 91 in the heart of the state
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The site, Adriaen's Landing, on the Connecticut River, was the
planned home of a development project that would include a
convention center and a smaller stadium, for the University of
Connecticut. The university's Huskies would be expected to play in
the Patriots' stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate president pro tem, Kevin Sullivan, who has not
committed to the stadium deal, said a selling point is that it
would be part of a larger plan for Hartford. ``Taken alone, it
would be a gamble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the cost of any needed road improvements
were not included in the package offered to Kraft and would have to
be considered separately.
</P>
<P>
   One official who has discussed the matter with Kraft and spoke
on the condition of anonymity said the discussions appear to be
``on a very fast track'' and are likely to be resolved one way or
the other in a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
   Because several other big projects Rowland has championed have
fallen through, he has been deliberately playing down the
possibility of landing the Patriots until the deal is sealed,
according to officials who have talked to him.
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday morning on a Hartford radio station, Rowland said
of the possibility of luring the team: ``I'm not sure that it's
hope. It's a longshot.''

HUARD HASN'T RULED OUT LONGSHOT RETURN TO HUSKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The 50-pound weight could have landed anywhere, but it
fell on Lester Towns' foot. Same with Arizona quarterback Ortege
Jenkins, who did his best Kerri Strug rendition to vault into the
Washington end zone in early October. People since have braced
themselves for another gravity-defying occurrence _ the possibility
of the first Husky losing record in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   In a UW football season full of unexplained phenomena, what's
next? Brock Huard shunning early NFL entry and returning for his
senior year?
</P>
<P>
   Well?
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Lambright and his junior quarterback will huddle this
week to discuss that matter alone. They will repeat a conversation
shared 12 months ago, when Huard made the surprising decision to
stick with the college game one more year. This time, farewells are
fully expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty much a conclusion most people have drawn,
considering that a year ago he went through this and he has a
marriage coming,'' Lambright said. ``He's got a few things on his
schedule that would leave us thinking he would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard, as is his custom, would not discuss his future prospects
with the season in progress, other than to confirm that his wedding
to UW basketball player Molly Hills is set for May.
</P>
<P>
   ``You probably don't want to hear this, but it's something I'll
think about after we win the bowl game,'' the quarterback said
Tuesday, counting on a victory Saturday over WSU. ``I've not
thought about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet teammates, left equally in the dark on this matter, wonder
if their three-year starter might actually be tussling with this
decision.
</P>
<P>
   For one, Huard isn't exactly closing out his Husky career on an
upbeat note, especially if a season-ending defeat to WSU and the
uncomfortable 5-6 ledger emerges.
</P>
<P>
   Second, some have inferred Huard would have been the third
quarterback drafted last April, behind Peyton Manning and Ryan
Leaf. There could be as many as a half-dozen players rated ahead of
him at the position now in what could be the best group of
quarterback prospects since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   And third, everyone _ his team, fans and media _ has assumed
he's out of here, practically making the decision for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I joke with him and say, `Are you leaving us,
Brock?''' said Towns, a junior linebacker whose play has been
severely curtailed since his offseason weightroom accident. ``He
just says, `No, no, no.' I wouldn't be surprised if he stayed, or
mad at him if he left. But why not use that extra year and become a
more dominant player?''
</P>
<P>
   Said junior defensive tackle Mac Tuiaea: ``To me, it's still a
mystery. He's a good friend, and it's his decision. But I think
Brock is thinking about those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Added junior flanker/kicker Joe Jarzynka: ``I wouldn't be
shocked if he stayed because I know what kind of competitor he is
and how bad it hurts him to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The matter is slightly more complicated this time. Whereas last
year there was a unanimous desire for Huard to return, some fans
have suggested publicly in letters to the editor and calls to the
talk shows that they have grown tired of him. Let the Marques
Tuiasosopo era begin, they say. Time for a different look, they
insist.
</P>
<P>
   Former Husky quarterback Chris Chandler felt this backlash, with
people clamoring for Cary Conklin when Rose Bowls didn't emerge.
Conklin, now the UW tight ends coach, also felt this, his once
loyal followers pining for more of Mark Brunell as Conklin finished
up. It's sort of like becoming enamored with a song when you first
hear it, then listening to it 100 more times and growing weary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel that _ that's some fans,'' Huard said. ``The
opinions I care about are my coaches' opinions and teammates'
opinions; they're around here every day. That's what I'm worried
about.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Huard has his in-house backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marques is capable of leading this team, but I never get tired
of Brock with the dedication and leadership qualities he has,''
Tuiaea said. ``I'd welcome him back with open arms.''
</P>
<P>
   What about Tuiasosopo? If Huard came back, wouldn't that limit
the No. 2 quarterback, a big-play guy and the ultimate team player,
to just one year as a starter when his just reward should be more?
</P>
<P>
   Lambright has thought this over. He has a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You end up looking at: Do you redshirt him?'' Lambright said
of Tuiasosopo. ``He has that year. There's a way of getting your
cake and eating it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Huskies plan for a weekend in Pullman, Huard can't be
faulted if he ponders other destinations. Is it time to move on? Or
should he show his newfound Husky critics that he can help right
this slumping football program? He never forgot the abuse heaped on
that other Husky quarterback in the family, older brother Damon,
when his college career wound down. Should he silence them one last
time or simply wave goodbye?
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't go out on the winning kind of note he hoped; I know
for me, I'd like to come back,'' senior cornerback Nigel Burton
said. ``I wouldn't be surprised at either decision. It's a tough
one and nice one. Do I want to make a million dollars next year or
a couple million a few years from now?''
</P>
<P>
   Jersey No. 7 is still spoken for. His locker remains full. His
name tops the depth chart. But for how much longer?
</P>
<P>
   Lambright offers a weak smile when considering another year of
Huard at quarterback, as if to say he doesn't think it's possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything like that would be a tremendous bonus,'' the coach
said, ``and a big surprise.''

DESPITE NUMBERS, HISPANICS LACK POLITICAL PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The absence of leadership was glaring.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Latinos turned out to celebrate Dia de la Raza and
call attention to what they saw as rising anti-Hispanic sentiment
sweeping the country _ anti-immigration legislation,
affirmative-action bans, assaults on bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   But among them, not a single Latino elected official was present
_ even though one event was held at Wesley Bolin Plaza, across from
the state Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing happened when thousands of immigrants spent three
days gathered outside the federal building in downtown Phoenix last
year to force lawmakers to extend an immigration provision that
would allow them to remain in the United States while seeking legal
residency.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds spilled into the streets. Still no officials came to
address them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't they come?'' asked Doreen Vegas, who joined the
protest one day and was facing deportation. ``Can't they see that
we need them?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a scene that Valley Latinos say happens again and again.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the region has a growing Hispanic population, the
outlook for Latino leadership is bleak. Without proper
representation, Latinos worry that their voices won't be heard.
They fear the quality of their lives could be damaged by a lack of
input into decisions involving schools, justice and employment.
What makes this even more alarming is that Hispanics in other
states made great strides during the election two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for instance, Latinos picked up six new seats in
the Assembly and helped make history by electing as lieutenant
governor Cruz Bustamante, the first Latino elected to a statewide
office since 1871.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Garza in Texas snagged a seat on the powerful Railroad
Commission, which oversees the state's oil and gas industry.
Hispanics in New Mexico took four statewide offices. &QL; 
STRIKING COMPARISON
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the scene in Arizona:
</P>
<P>
   There are no Latinos on the Phoenix City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents, which governs the state's three public
universities, has no Hispanic member. Art Chapa, who had been the
only Hispanic on the board, was replaced after his term expired in
1997, leaving the Regents without any minority representation.
</P>
<P>
   No Latino holds statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   There were no Latino contenders for statewide offices in the
1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic representation in the state Senate has slipped from
seven seats to three. Next January, that number will increase to
four with the election of Linda Aguirre, the first Latina to win a
Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Hispanic directs a state agency, Department of Public
Safety Director Joe Albo.
</P>
<P>
   Among Phoenix's deputy city managers there is but one Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of Phoenix's 24 department heads are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Latino leadership in the Valley is so stark that the Mexican
American Legal Defense Fund established a Hispanic leadership
development school earlier this year to boost the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There is a severe underrepresentation of Hispanics in government
roles, said Rodolfo Perez, director of the five-year legal defense
fund program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's alarming. How can you properly serve a community without
proper leadership and representation?'' he asked. &QL; 
COMMUNITY SUFFERS
</P>
<P>
   The people who suffer the most from the lack of leadership are
members of the Latino community, observed Juanita Encinas, who has
had a firsthand view of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler community activist noticed the leadership dearth
shortly after Chandler police conducted a five-day immigration
sweep in July 1997, in which many U.S.-born Hispanics were pulled
aside and asked to prove their citizenship. Two children reported
being stopped on their way home from school and warned to carry
birth certificates. A professional golfer complained of being
barred from leaving a grocery store in an upper-middle-class
neighborhood. Teenagers said they were hauled out of a restaurant
by officers who demanded they produce proof of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the raids, rallies were held. Community forums, too.
Calls were &UR; made for public apologies and police reprimands. But
Encinas says with the exception of Chandler City Councilman Martin
Sepulveda, no elected officials initially lent their support.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she says, national organizations, such as the National
Council for LaRaza and the legal defense fund, offered assistance
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge disappointment,'' says Encinas of Servicios para
la Comunidad, a non-profit social-services group in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for such disappointments. &QL; 
NUMBERS AREN'T THERE
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there simply aren't enough Latino elected
officials. Many place the blame on the high costs of campaigning,
low voter turnout in the Hispanic community and fragmentated voting
districts.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Joe Eddie Lopez, D-Phoenix, who is an advocate for
getting more Latinos in both political parties, acknowledged that
convincing Latinos to run for office is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Hispanics don't have the money to run for office or to
provide a living on the $15,000 a year salary we get,'' Lopez said.
``Campaign reform should help because money often is the deciding
factor in elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters this month approved measures that will bring about
campaign reforms in Arizona and will raise legislators' salaries to
$24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of unfavorable districts and low voter
turnout. Lopez contends that there are still too many districts
that divide the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   El Mirage and Surprise, two towns with dominant Latino
populations, are in Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Stump's district.
Another Latino haven is in Tempe, also situated in a primarily
Republican district. &QL; 
VOTER APATHY
</P>
<P>
   But even if those issues were addressed, Hispanic voter apathy
hinders the chances of increased representation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, for instance, Phoenix City Council boundaries were
redrawn to increase the chances of Hispanic representation. But
partly because of low voter turnout among Latinos in 1995, an Anglo
candidate won the seat traditionally held by Hispanics. Court
decisions that led to the redistricting were based on the premise
that Hispanics and Blacks needed to be elected to government posts
or the minority groups would lose their political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is competition among ``old guard'' Latinos, the
newcomers and those who have fallen out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   Old guard politicos consist of those who broke open the Latino
political scene in Arizona &UR; _ people such as Alfredo Gutierrez, one
of the first Latinos to win a state Senate seat; U.S. Rep. Ed
Pastor; Al Pena and Tommy Espinoza, who are now with the National
Council for LaRaza, and others.
</P>
<P>
   They were the trailblazers, many community activists say. But
now, they are accused of failing to mentor new leaders and
obstructing those entering the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the rift between Hispanics during Jane Hull's campaign
for the governor's seat earlier this year. When entrepreneur Gary
Trujillo and business owner Ray Arvizu offered to stage a Democrat
Hispanic fund-raiser for Hull, some Hispanics tried to thwart their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Pena, who ran for Phoenix City Council in 1996,
issued a letter to party officials warning them that Hull was
betraying fellow Republicans by accepting their help.
</P>
<P>
   Arvizu said it's those types of actions that discourage Latinos
from getting active in the political scene. &QL; 
MORE PLAYERS SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more people getting involved. Not the same people over
and over again,'' says Arvizu, who recently started taking a more
active role in politics. ``What's wrong with a bigger pool?''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre was another person who fought the Latino power brokers
and won. She didn't get their blessing to run for state Senate, but
she made history by winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I have no idea why they wouldn't give me their
support,'' confesses Aguirre, adding that she has no time to ponder
the issue extensively. ``There's so much work for us to do. The
Latino community is grappling with so many issues. There's just no
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the need for more Hispanic representation in
government is the belief that members of other groups simply
haven't fought as hard to meet the needs of Latino citizens. Good
jobs, lower dropout rates, better approaches to immigration _ the
Hispanic community needs strong voices to seek those and other
goals, Latinos say.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To be more effective, Hispanics need to find a way to put on a
united front like other groups do, said John Garcia, an expert on
Hispanic politics at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lack of Hispanic representation has hurt Hispanics. You just
need to look at the numbers to see that no one's looking out for
the Latino community,'' he said. &QL;

   Tony Garza in Texas snagged a seat on the powerful Railroad
Commission, which oversees the state's oil and gas industry.
Hispanics in New Mexico took four statewide offices. &QL; 
STRIKING COMPARISON
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the scene in Arizona:
</P>
<P>
   There are no Latinos on the Phoenix City Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Regents, which governs the state's three public
universities, has no Hispanic member. Art Chapa, who had been the
only Hispanic on the board, was replaced after his term expired in
1997, leaving the Regents without any minority representation.
</P>
<P>
   No Latino holds statewide office.
</P>
<P>
   There were no Latino contenders for statewide offices in the
1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic representation in the state Senate has slipped from
seven seats to three. Next January, that number will increase to
four with the election of Linda Aguirre, the first Latina to win a
Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Hispanic directs a state agency, Department of Public
Safety Director Joe Albo.
</P>
<P>
   Among Phoenix's deputy city managers there is but one Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of Phoenix's 24 department heads are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Latino leadership in the Valley is so stark that the Mexican
American Legal Defense Fund established a Hispanic leadership
development school earlier this year to boost the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There is a severe underrepresentation of Hispanics in government
roles, said Rodolfo Perez, director of the five-year legal defense
fund program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's alarming. How can you properly serve a community without
proper leadership and representation?'' he asked. &QL; 
COMMUNITY SUFFERS
</P>
<P>
   The people who suffer the most from the lack of leadership are
members of the Latino community, observed Juanita Encinas, who has
had a firsthand view of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler community activist noticed the leadership dearth
shortly after Chandler police conducted a five-day immigration
sweep in July 1997, in which many U.S.-born Hispanics were pulled
aside and asked to prove their citizenship. Two children reported
being stopped on their way home from school and warned to carry
birth certificates. A professional golfer complained of being
barred from leaving a grocery store in an upper-middle-class
neighborhood. Teenagers said they were hauled out of a restaurant
by officers who demanded they produce proof of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the raids, rallies were held. Community forums, too.
Calls were &UR; made for public apologies and police reprimands. But
Encinas says with the exception of Chandler City Councilman Martin
Sepulveda, no elected officials initially lent their support.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, she says, national organizations, such as the National
Council for LaRaza and the legal defense fund, offered assistance
first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a huge disappointment,'' says Encinas of Servicios para
la Comunidad, a non-profit social-services group in Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for such disappointments. &QL; 
NUMBERS AREN'T THERE
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there simply aren't enough Latino elected
officials. Many place the blame on the high costs of campaigning,
low voter turnout in the Hispanic community and fragmentated voting
districts.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Joe Eddie Lopez, D-Phoenix, who is an advocate for
getting more Latinos in both political parties, acknowledged that
convincing Latinos to run for office is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Hispanics don't have the money to run for office or to
provide a living on the $15,000 a year salary we get,'' Lopez said.
``Campaign reform should help because money often is the deciding
factor in elections.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters this month approved measures that will bring about
campaign reforms in Arizona and will raise legislators' salaries to
$24,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of unfavorable districts and low voter
turnout. Lopez contends that there are still too many districts
that divide the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   El Mirage and Surprise, two towns with dominant Latino
populations, are in Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Stump's district.
Another Latino haven is in Tempe, also situated in a primarily
Republican district. &QL; 
VOTER APATHY
</P>
<P>
   But even if those issues were addressed, Hispanic voter apathy
hinders the chances of increased representation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, for instance, Phoenix City Council boundaries were
redrawn to increase the chances of Hispanic representation. But
partly because of low voter turnout among Latinos in 1995, an Anglo
candidate won the seat traditionally held by Hispanics. Court
decisions that led to the redistricting were based on the premise
that Hispanics and Blacks needed to be elected to government posts
or the minority groups would lose their political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is competition among ``old guard'' Latinos, the
newcomers and those who have fallen out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   Old guard politicos consist of those who broke open the Latino
political scene in Arizona &UR; _ people such as Alfredo Gutierrez, one
of the first Latinos to win a state Senate seat; U.S. Rep. Ed
Pastor; Al Pena and Tommy Espinoza, who are now with the National
Council for LaRaza, and others.
</P>
<P>
   They were the trailblazers, many community activists say. But
now, they are accused of failing to mentor new leaders and
obstructing those entering the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the rift between Hispanics during Jane Hull's campaign
for the governor's seat earlier this year. When entrepreneur Gary
Trujillo and business owner Ray Arvizu offered to stage a Democrat
Hispanic fund-raiser for Hull, some Hispanics tried to thwart their
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Pena, who ran for Phoenix City Council in 1996,
issued a letter to party officials warning them that Hull was
betraying fellow Republicans by accepting their help.
</P>
<P>
   Arvizu said it's those types of actions that discourage Latinos
from getting active in the political scene. &QL; 
MORE PLAYERS SOUGHT
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more people getting involved. Not the same people over
and over again,'' says Arvizu, who recently started taking a more
active role in politics. ``What's wrong with a bigger pool?''
</P>
<P>
   Aguirre was another person who fought the Latino power brokers
and won. She didn't get their blessing to run for state Senate, but
she made history by winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, I have no idea why they wouldn't give me their
support,'' confesses Aguirre, adding that she has no time to ponder
the issue extensively. ``There's so much work for us to do. The
Latino community is grappling with so many issues. There's just no
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the need for more Hispanic representation in
government is the belief that members of other groups simply
haven't fought as hard to meet the needs of Latino citizens. Good
jobs, lower dropout rates, better approaches to immigration _ the
Hispanic community needs strong voices to seek those and other
goals, Latinos say.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To be more effective, Hispanics need to find a way to put on a
united front like other groups do, said John Garcia, an expert on
Hispanic politics at the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lack of Hispanic representation has hurt Hispanics. You just
need to look at the numbers to see that no one's looking out for
the Latino community,'' he said. &QL;

JESSE VENTURA BACK ON BOULEVARD

   LOS ANGELES _ It used to be simple covering politicians on the
run.
</P>
<P>
   You'd wait until their bodyguards jumped out of the dark
government sedans, then look for the shortest, frailest guy. That
was the politician.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura, the governor-elect of Minnesota, jumped out of
the back seat of his sedan in front of Jerry's Famous Deli on the
boulevard in suburban Studio City on Tuesday afternoon and stood
head and shoulders over his bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Which explains why the most popular bumper sticker in Minnesota
these days is ``Our Governor Can Beat Up Your Governor.''
</P>
<P>
   On an invite from the Daily News, the former pro wrestler swung
by his old stomping grounds and namesake _ Ventura Boulevard _ on
his way over to taping ``The Tonight Show'' with Jay Leno in
Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for Jesse and me to take a walk down the boulevard
and see what transpired when people saw him. But this being L.A.
and all, by the time Jesse and his bodyguards showed up at Jerry's,
the word had leaked and there were enough media types on hand to
kick off a national political convention.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, though, Jesse slipped loose of the pack for a
few minutes, and we took a short walk down the Valley's most famous
boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this street,'' he said, waving to a group of young
women who came out of a nearby office building to see the country's
most famous bald politician up close and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to hang out on the boulevard all the time, do a lot of
work out here,'' Jesse said. ``I know the Valley real well. Nice
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he had a chance to talk any further, the crush of TV
cameras descended upon him, with four Minnesota state trooper
bodyguards in hot pursuit, trying to get their charge back in the
car because they were running late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said to me, looking over at the front door of
Jerry's deli like a guy who would love not to be himself for a few
hours, and just hang out anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   No chance anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura, of course, is not his real name. James George
Janos is. That name bit the dust the first time he laid eyes on
California's golden Ventura coastline after moving out here in 1975
to kick off his wrestling career.
</P>
<P>
   James Janos faded away, and Jesse Ventura was born. The rest, as
they say, is history. Weird history, but history nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what'd you think?'' I asked the group of young office
workers watching Jesse's bodyguards whisk him away in a sedan down
Ventura Boulevard to the ``Tonight Show'' studios in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   They all agreed he was big, cute and bald _ and could definitely
beat up our governor-elect.

INTERCEPTIONS THE BANE OF WSU'S TWO QUARTERBACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years have passed since Ryan Leaf emerged in the Apple Cup
as the quarterback who would eventually lead Washington State to
the promised land of the Rose Bowl and anoint Cougar coach Mike
Price as one of the top quarterback coaches in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf left for the NFL this year, and WSU has spent an entire
season trying to find its old quarterback magic.
</P>
<P>
   Junior Steve Birnbaum and sophomore Paul Mencke have alternated
series _ even plays _ this season, and neither had a coming-out
party like Leaf did in 1995. Leaf, the season-long backup to Chad
Davis, got his first start in Husky Stadium and completed 23 of 33
passes for 273 yards and three touchdowns in a 33-30 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum and Mencke have looked good in spurts, but both have
been prone to interceptions, fumbled snaps and an inability to
produce scoring plays inside an opponent's red zone. Together, they
have combined for 16 touchdowns but have thrown 24 interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they have done is they both have started really well,''
Price said. ``Their finish is what is killing us. They are
finishing poorly in the second half when we need to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The two quarterback system, which Price said was designed to
maximize the best abilities of both quarterbacks, began when Mencke
replaced Birnbaum in the contest vs. California, the fourth game of
the season. Mencke seemed to energize the team, throwing a 29-yard
TD pass. But both quarterbacks also threw interceptions that were
returned for touchdowns in that game.
</P>
<P>
   The next week against UCLA, Birnbaum started again, but the
Cougar offense failed to mount a scoring drive until late in the
first half in what turned into a 49-17 Bruin rout. For the next
five games, all losses, the quarterbacks were shuffled in starting
roles, in alternating series, and sometimes on alternating plays.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the passing production has improved, but
interceptions and mistakes reached critical proportions. Last week
against Stanford, Birnbaum and Mencke were a combined 17-of-40 for
372 yards and three touchdowns, but Birnbaum had two interceptions
and Mencke three as the Cardinal came back for a 38-28 win.
</P>
<P>
   The two-headed quarterback beast is not Price's brainchild
alone. In fact, this is the first season that Price has turned over
the quarterback coaching duties to an assistant _ in this case, his
son, Eric Price, who is in his first year as Cougar quarterbacks
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two weeks we have been more productive on offense,
but we continue to turn the ball over, which killed us,'' said Eric
Price, who previously served as an assistant coach at Northern
Arizona and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, and as a graduate assistant
at Miami and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Price admits his abilities have been taxed trying to figure
out which quarterback to use in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both different types of quarterbacks, and they both
do things well that are different,'' he said. ``We are trying to
match what they do best.''
</P>
<P>
   Mencke is seen as more of a scrambling quarterback who will try
to make something happen when things break down on the offense,
while Birnbaum is considered more of the classic pocket passer who
excels when the entire offense is clicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just pressing and trying to make things happen,''
Eric Price said. ``It's been pretty frustrating. It's not always
their fault, but they have just pushed it a little bit too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their troubles, both quarterbacks have accepted their
dual roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever coach says ... I'm just excited to go out there,''
Mencke said. ``Whatever we can do to win is what I want to do. If
that means me starting or Steve, or going to the two-quarterback
system, let's do that and get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, both have shown improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing fine in practice, but things are different in
the game,'' Birnbaum said. ``Things are faster, and the receivers
don't get jammed as hard in practice, and that all makes a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Stanford, the offense racked up more yards, more time of
possession and more first downs than the Cardinal, but failed to
score every time it entered the red zone, and was only 4-of-16 on
third-down conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistics are for losers, and we need to concentrate on one
statistic, and that's the scoreboard statistic,'' Mike Price said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Price hopes this year's experience will help both
quarterbacks in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run it's made them both pretty tough,'' he said.
``They're both winners, they're both good kids, and they have kept
a great attitude throughout the whole season. But those two have
been taking a lot of heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just have to stay positive because they want it so bad
that I think eventually it's going to happen for one of them. After
the season we'll have to evaluate where we are and go into spring
ball with a good attitude and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Price doesn't believe that Leaf's shadow has played a big
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the season for Birnbaum, he was pretty confident,
then things unfolded and it didn't work out for him,'' Eric Price
said. ``But he has stayed positive and each week he's right back in
the offense and he's just so eager to have a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the interceptions have been Birnbaum's fault,
according to Eric Price.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the most unlucky quarterback I've ever seen in my life.
Every time a ball is tipped, it seems like it is picked off or run
back for a touchdown,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With both quarterbacks suffering, Eric Price also has taken his
lumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a rough first year for me,'' he said. ``I'm kind
of taking it right along with Mencke and Birnbaum. We're in the
same boat. We're all trying to get the monkeys off our back here.''

   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft trial is not all fireworks by any
means. There are long stretches of tedium and droning testimony on
the technical details of computing.
</P>
<P>
   To lighten things up, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson began the afternoon session Tuesday by saying that the
court is on ``some e-mail humor list.'' He then read the computer
entry he thought amusing.
</P>
<P>
   Both women and men, it seems, were asked what gender would be
most appropriate for computers.
</P>
<P>
   The women, the e-mail message said, agreed that computers should
be masculine for the following four reasons:
</P>
<P>
   1. In order to get their attention, you have to turn them on.
</P>
<P>
   2. They have a lot of data, but they are still clueless.
</P>
<P>
   3. Most of the time, they are the problem.
</P>
<P>
   4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that if you waited
a little longer you could have had a better model.
</P>
<P>
   The men, according to the e-mail message, agreed that computers
should be feminine for the following four reasons:
</P>
<P>
   1. No one but the Creator understands their internal logic.
</P>
<P>
   2. The native language they use to communicate with other
computers is incomprehensible to everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   3. Even your smallest mistakes are stored in long-term memory
for later retrieval.
</P>
<P>
   4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you find yourself
spending half your paycheck on accessories.

PERRY YOUNG JR.,   FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMERCIAL PILOT 
</HEADLINE>
  ( rl ) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perry H. Young Jr., an aviator whose career spanned more than 50
years and who was the first African-American pilot for a commercial
airline in the United States, died on Nov. 8 at the Horton Medical
Center in Middletown, N.Y. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Young, who lived in Pine Bush, N.Y., had cancer, said his wife,
Shakeh Young.
</P>
<P>
   The historic flight occurred on Feb. 5, 1957. With Young as the
co-pilot, a 12-passenger New York Airways helicopter rose 3 feet,
hovered gently for a moment, then soared straight up from La
Guardia Airport. Nine minutes later, the snub-nose helicopter
landed at Idlewild Airport _ now Kennedy International Airport _
ending the racist notion ``that blacks could not fly,'' said Perry
Jones, former chairman of the Organization of Black Airline Pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Up to that point, commercial airlines had refused to hire blacks
in any on-board capacity, even though African Americans had
distinguished themselves as capable aviators during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, Young had also been one of the first black
flight instructors in the U.S. Army Air Corps. Assigned to the 99th
Pursuit Squadron, a black unit, he taught more than 150 pilots,
many of whom saw action during the war. The squadron was highly
decorated and went on to become known as the Tuskegee Airmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few of us knew anything about flying _ few blacks did _
and we thought our instructors were going to be white,'' said Lee
A. Archer, 77, who is the only African-American fighter ace, having
shot down five enemy planes during combat. ``When I saw men like
Perry Young, I was surprised and proud. They were like minor gods
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, when the commercial industry was unwilling to
open its doors, Young went to the Caribbean to fly. Over the next
10 years, he was in Haiti, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands,
operating his own commercial flight service and working as a
contract pilot and flight mechanic. During that time he earned his
helicopter pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1956, 17 years after he had earned his first pilot's
license, Young was hired by New York Airways in an aggressive
campaign to break the color barrier in the commercial airline
business. Within months, he rose to captain and flew with the
company for 23 years until it declared bankruptcy in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was both an airplane and helicopter pilot,'' said Jones,
63. ``He would have preferred to fly planes. But at that time, if
your skin was dark, so were your chances of becoming a pilot of any
kind.''
</P>
<P>
   After Young was hired by New York Airways, other men became
emboldened to challenge the status quo. Marlon Green, a former Air
Force captain, took Continental Airlines all the way to the Supreme
Court in 1963, winning a landmark judgment that opened interstate
commercial airlines to black pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Young took his first airplane ride in July 1937 in his hometown
of Oberlin, Ohio, just days after Amelia Earhart had disappeared on
her flight around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   After that first ride, Young began taking flying lessons. He
worked odd jobs while attending courses at Oberlin College, earning
$9 a week to pay for flying lessons that cost $5.25 for 20 minutes.
He earned his private pilot's license in 1939 and dropped out of
college a year later to pursue a career in aviation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not easy,'' Mrs. Young said. ``There was a lot of hurt
but he never wore it on his sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Young is survived by a son, Perry H. Young III
of New York City; a daughter, Linda Young Ribeiro of Accra, Ghana,
and three grandchildren.

WASHINGTON BASKETBALL TEAM SHOWS NO. 14 RANKING WARRANTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is not every day you wake up and read that the
Washington Huskies are ranked No. 14 in the nation in men's
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been days like this in Seattle since, oh, about
1984, when ethnic food in Ballard was strictly Swedish pancakes and
a good cup of coffee did not come with a decorative dollop of
steamed-milk foam.
</P>
<P>
   Some new trends are worth getting hooked on. Lattes at $2.70 a
pop, but especially a Division I basketball program that finally is
where its determined and talented coach wants it to be, five years
after 5-22.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998-99 Huskies, who opened their season Monday night at Hec
Ed with a win over a scrappy North Carolina-Wilmington team, have
with one win confirmed one important thing:
</P>
<P>
   The sweet taste of last spring's intrepid foray into the heart
of the NCAA tournament has not evaporated from the lips of these
now even deeper, better Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a context clue that tells you the Huskies just might be
aching to make another appearance in at least the Sweet 16 (a tough
task, but let's keep the dream alive). Junior guard Deon Luton says
he spent a good part of his offseason doing dribbling drills.
</P>
<P>
   Luton is the high-flying and explosive scorer who has the
spread-eagle Michael Jordan ``Air'' logo tattooed on his arm. The
fella likes to shake the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to have to handle the ball in the press and
I had some things to work on, so I just incorporated some drills
into my workout routine,'' Luton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me wrong. I worked on the drives and the dunks. But
I did the dribbling and ball-handling stuff, too.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of dedication to the basics by key guys like Luton,
Donald Watts, Thalo Green, Dan Dickau, Chris Walcott and big man
Todd MacCulloch (in the best shape of his life) has these Huskies
looking and acting poised and mature.
</P>
<P>
   That is not a bad tangible to throw out there at the likes of
UCLA, Arizona and Stanford _ all Pac-10 opponents with higher
rankings than the Huskies. But maturity, along with talent and
depth, define this No. 14 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we were doing,'' MacCulloch said about the
Huskies' gritty 70-63 win over the NC-Wilmington Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Seahawks were hanging on MacCulloch like Lilliputians
on Gulliver, the Huskies found a way to win, mostly with emphatic
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased,'' Husky coach Bob Bender said Tuesday. ``We're
still a team with a lot to prove. We're not going to go out there
and blow people away. We're a team that will have to find something
within ourselves to pull out games. Like (Monday) night, we shoot
only 36 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one thing this Husky team needs to embrace is complete
dedication to getting the ball inside to MacCulloch. Alone, he can
improve any team's scoring percentage, since MacCulloch has been
the NCAA's leader in scoring percentage the past two seasons. And
MacCulloch seems more than happy to fight off any number of pesky
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to it,'' the 7-footer said after his 20-point effort
Monday left him raked with bloody welts and scratches.
</P>
<P>
   ``In high school, they'd yell in to me, `They're doubling.' I
didn't even notice. They'd yell, `They're tripling.' I didn't care.
I'm used to it. I'm confident I can make my shot even with two or
three on me, or I can just kick the ball back out,'' MacCulloch
calmly explained.
</P>
<P>
   While depth might be the Huskies' saving grace on nights when
key guys such as Watts or Luton struggle or there is foul trouble,
that same depth has the potential to take the Huskies away from
their ultimate strength _ the big guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be a priority. When we get into our half-court
set, there has to be better recognition to get the ball in to
Todd,'' Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it is more a sign of the Huskies' strength and depth that
MacCulloch only got six shots from the floor when 14 of his 20
points came from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies have added solid freshman point guard Senque Carey
to their lineup, along with a defensive stopper in transfer forward
Greg Clark. Ballard sophomore Michael Johnson got 13 minutes, too.
All of these new bodies added up to a deeper Husky rotation, which
meant the ball was being reversed around the perimeter by a lot of
new combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the line, Bender will pare down his rotations
and lean heavily on the group that can best recognize the exact
moment when MacCulloch has positioned himself for the feed.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the season opener was a good win. As early
season polls and predictions go, the ``W'' solidified the Huskies'
presence in the top 25. Although the coach refuses to get caught up
in the hoopla of being ranked up there with the Blue Devils, Tar
Heels, Terrapins, Jayhawks, Bruins and Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except I will say this,'' Bender said. ``I went home (after
the game) and watched ESPN. That was the first time I've ever seen
our highlights on, without it being because we were playing someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   For No. 14 Washington, it's definitely welcome to the big time.

MARION DONOVAN, INVENTOR, SOLVED DIAPER PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marion Donovan, a onetime Connecticut housewife who
helped spearhead an industrial and domestic revolution by inventing
the forerunner of the disposable diaper, died on Nov. 4 at Lenox
Hill Hospital near her home in Manhattan. She was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Her family said the cause was heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Disposable was not what Mrs. Donovan had in mind in 1946 when
her second daughter came along and proved as maddeningly reliable
as the first: Put her down for a nap and by the time the light was
out her diaper would be wet, and her clothes and crib sheet would
soon be soaked and in need of changing.
</P>
<P>
   With cloth diapers serving more as wick than sponge, and with
rubber baby pants virtually assuring a nasty case of diaper rash,
Mrs. Donovan started looking for a way to hold the dampness in
without keeping the air out.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Donovan, who would eventually obtain more than a dozen
patents, had a genetic aptitude for invention. As students at
Purdue, her Irish-born father, Miles O'Brien, and his identical
twin brother, Richard, had invented the South Bend lathe, a device
that proved so useful for grinding automobile gears and the like
that the brothers made a fortune turning them out in a factory in
South Bend, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother died when she was 7, so The Fort Wayne Lathe Works
became little Marion O'Brien's after-school home and she grew up
absorbed by complicated machinery.
</P>
<P>
   At college, she majored in English literature, an interest that
had no doubt been sharpened when her father and uncle produced a
little book, ``How to Operate a Lathe,'' in 1930 that sold 1.5
million copies in 78 countries.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying James Donovan, a leather importer, and starting a
family, Mrs. Donovan, a 1939 graduate of Rosemont College near
Philadelphia, gave up her job as an assistant beauty editor at
Vogue magazine in New York and moved to Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In her quest for a dampless diaper, Mrs. Donovan was in the
bathroom one day when the shower curtain caught her eye and a
lightbulb went off in her head. Before you could say waterproof
material, the curtain was missing a panel and Mrs. Donovan was up
in the attic at her sewing machine. Three years and many shower
curtains later she came up with the Boater, a reusable diaper cover
made of surplus nylon parachute cloth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to solving the soak-through diaper problem, Mrs.
Donovan made another major advance in diaper technology: replacing
safety pins with plastic snaps.
</P>
<P>
   The moisture-proof diaper covers were an immediate sensation
when they went on sale at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1949. By the time
her patents came through in 1951, she had sold their rights for $1
million and moved on to her next brainstorm: replacing cloth
diapers with disposable absorbent paper.
</P>
<P>
   As a striking woman who was forever being likened to Myrna Loy
when she wasn't being likened to Rosalind Russell, Mrs. Donovan had
no trouble getting in to see top executives of leading paper
companies. But when they heard her idea, they laughed. As a result,
it was a decade before a grandfather named Victor Mills perfected
Pampers, the first mass-produced disposable diaper.
</P>
<P>
   By then Mrs. Donovan's diaper days were over, but her inventing
days were just beginning. When it came to finding inspired
solutions to mundane problems, she was incorrigible. She reacted to
an overstuffed closet, for example, by inventing the Big Hangup, a
hanger that could accommodate 30 skirts or slacks in a compact
space. She solved the affront of rancid, semi-congealed soap
festering in the bottom of a soap dish by inventing a wire soap
holder that attached to the overflow opening and drained directly
into the basin.
</P>
<P>
   She even reinvented herself, obtaining an architecture degree
from Yale at 41 in 1958. Then, after working with a Fairfield firm
and designing her own house in Greenwich, she returned to
inventions, including Zippity-Do, an elasticized zipper pull that
allowed a woman to zip up the back of a dress by pulling down from
the front.
</P>
<P>
   When she saw her second husband, John F. Butler, flossing his
teeth one day, she realized how painful and ungainly it was to wrap
the ends of a length of dental floss tightly around one's index
fingers to pull it taut. She solved the purple finger problem by
inventing Dentaloop, individual pre-cut circles of two-ply dental
floss that could be manipulated like a cat's cradle without cutting
off digital circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Butler died in July.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Donovan is survived by two daughters, Christine Donovan of
Manhattan and Sharon Dodd of New Orleans; a son, Dr. James F.
Donovan Jr. of Oklahoma City, and three grandchildren.

NO LOGIC TO BCS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (set ital) Streams of unconsciousness while wondering if eight
is enough for UCLA: (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The last thing UCLA needs during USC week is another BCS-related
distraction. But here comes one anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins currently rank second in the BCS (Bowl Championship
Series) poll, and logic says wins over the Trojans and Miami should
get them to the national title game at the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Logic is not, however, a facet of the BCS system. When the rules
were drawn, BCS made preseason classics, like Florida State-Texas
A&AMP;M, exempt from some ranking criteria. It did not, however, add
any kind of qualifier for teams that play a postseason conference
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 BCS team Tennessee (9-0) and No. 3 Kansas State (10-0)
both will play conference title games that will contribute to its
BCS ranking (assuming both teams win out). The biggest impact will
be seen in the strength of schedule component.
</P>
<P>
   That's where UCLA enjoys its current edge. This week's BCS
ranking has UCLA with a 2.24 point edge on K-State in strength of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins' margin was 2.76 a week earlier, before K-State
beat Nebraska. This week, K-State meets Missouri (No. 19 in the BCS
poll), which has the fifth toughest schedule in the nation. If the
Wildcats beat Mizzou, they then advance to the Big XII Title game
against 10-1 Texas A&AMP;M. The Aggies have won 10 straight, are ranked
sixth by the BCS, and have the 15th toughest schedule in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   If K-State wins both of those games, it conceivably could close
the schedule gap with UCLA enough and use its higher rankings in
the human and computer polls to vault into the title game.
</P>
<P>
   There is literally nothing UCLA can do about it, either. It
can't rush out and challenge someone to an extra game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an upside and a downside from a 12th game,'' said BCS
spokesman Charles Bloom. ``Should Tennessee and Kansas State lose
that game, they'll drop in the standings. The upside is that it can
improve their strength of schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA has two tough games left, Saturday against USC (20th in the
BCS) and Dec. 5 versus Miami (24th). But wins will not give the
Bruins as much of a boost as K-State wins versus Mizzou and Texas
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Both USC and Miami also have one other games left, and losses
could indirectly impact UCLA's numbers. On Nov. 28, USC meets Notre
Dame and Miami plays Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   (Paranoid aside: In other words, UCLA's fate may lie in the
hands of USC, since a Trojan win over Notre Dame would be of value;
former USC head coach Larry Smith, now the coach at Mizzou; and
Texas A&AMP;M head coach R.C. Slocum, who once fired Bob Toledo.)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has regular season games left with Kentucky and
Vanderbilt, and is likely to face a rematch with Arkansas (No. 9 in
the BCS rankings) in the SEC title game.
</P>
<P>
   What all this does most is remind one and all that you can't
spell playoff without B-C-S. ...
</P>
<P>
   USC's chances against UCLA this week will likely swing on the
presence and ability of its wide receivers. USC's deep game matured
once Carson Palmer became the starter, and the Bruins have little
pass rush. If Palmer can beat the blitz, USC can beat UCLA. ...
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that Bruinscoach Bob Toledo will undoubtedly
pull another psychological edge out of his trick bag. Toledo
doesn't like just trick plays; he likes to find ways to stimulate
his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, a simple pregame meeting turned into an
emotional catharsis for the Bruins, who went out and throttled
Arizona the next day. Just last week, Toledo dumped all of the
team's troubles on defensive coordinator Nick Aliotti, leading to
one of the better defensive efforts Saturday at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he had the scout team wear purple pants and helmets
with the Washington logo before the Husky game. Before the Arizona
game, amid criticism that the Bruins weren't physically tough
enough, he drew a line in tape on the floor of the locker room and
had players go head-to-head, giving the team an adrenalin rush no
one else could see.
</P>
<P>
   Extra emotional edges aren't necessary this week, but I won't be
surprised if Toledo comes up with one anyway. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to spruce up the job resume if you'd like to be
a NFL head coach. There could be 14 openings between now and the
start of next season. In order of reassignment: Sure to go: 1. Dick
Vermeil, St. Louis. He never should have left the comfort of a TV
job. 2. Ray Rhodes, Philadelphia. He won't be unemployed long. 3.
Norv Turner, Washington. It's a wonder he's lasted this long. 4.
Ted Marchibroda, Baltimore. Art Modell's honeymoon in Baltimore is
over. 5. Dave Wannstedt, Chicago. The team is improved, but there's
still no long-term answers here.
</P>
<P>
   On the bubble: 6. Pete Carroll, New England, and 7. Dennis
Erickson, Seattle. It's playoffs or ta-ta. 8. Vince Tobin,
Cardinals. There's talent here, but it's poorly coached. 9. Bruce
Coslet, Cincinnati. Name a big win in his career. 10. Bobby Ross,
Detroit. Wayne Fontes, all is forgiven. 11. June Jones, San Diego.
He's just the interim guy for now.
</P>
<P>
   File for future reference: 12. Mike Holmgren, Green Bay. He may
leave for full-power elsewhere. 13. Steve Mariucci, San Francisco.
The front office chaos may drift to the field. 14. Marty
Schottenheimer, Kansas City. Things in K.C. are starting to look
the way they did in Marty's last days in Cleveland. ...
</P>
<P>
   All of this extended basketball-less time has led me to suggest
Donald Sterling reconsider hiring a head coach for his Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clips have sucked with a variety of head coaches. Could they
suck worse if they didn't have one? Maybe that's the answer to
their woes. Just hire a team chaperone, designate a tram captain,
and draw straws for starting spots and sub rotation. ...
</P>
<P>
   I can't wait to see the honeymoon pay-per-view video
extravaganza from those crazy kids, Dennis Rodman and Carmen
Electra. . ...

SURVEY FINDS COLLEGE GROWING LESS AFFORDABLE FOR THE POOR
</HEADLINE>
 (See also COLLEGE-SMOKING) 
(rl) 
By WILLIAM H. HONAN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As college costs have risen and federal grants to needy students
have declined over the last two decades, higher education has
become significantly less affordable for students from poor
families, a new national survey shows.
</P>
<P>
   Some academicians who took part in the survey blamed the
higher-education lobby in Washington for the predicament,
maintaining that the lobbyists exercised political triage by
throwing most of their weight behind winning a lower interest rate
on federally backed college loans rather than more money for
federal Pell grants. Loans serve primarily the middle class, while
Pell grants help low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 and 1977, the average Pell grant covered 19 percent of
the annual price of a private four-year institution and 39 percent
of a public four-year institution. But in 1996 and 1997, it covered
only 9 percent of a private college and 22 percent of a public
college, the survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, over the same period, the maximum Pell grant declined
to 13 percent of the price of a private college, from 35 percent,
and to 34 percent of the price of a public institution, from 72
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The last Congress raised maximum Pell grants to $3,125, from
$3,000, and reduced the interest rate on college loans to 7.46
percent, from 8.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The continuing erosion of Pell grants is partly a result of the
priorities of the higher-education lobby facing the realities of
Congress, said Thomas D. Parker, a senior vice president of the
Educational Resources Institute. The Boston-based institute, a
nonprofit educational research organization, cosponsored the survey
with the Institute for Higher Education Policy, whose headquarters
are in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did get a small expansion of the Pell grants last year,''
Parker said, ``but the higher-education lobbyists in Washington
decided that it's better to accept the fact that it won't be
possible to get much of an increase in Pell grants than to make a
stink about it. They decided to put most of their effort behind
federal college loans, which have a much bigger constituency: the
middle class. The result is that many low-income people can't even
begin to think about going to a four-year college.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Hartle, a spokesman for the American Council on Education,
an organization based in Washington that represents 1,600 colleges
and universities, called Parker ``woefully misinformed'' and said
the Pell grant program had been ``the most important federal policy
objective of colleges and universities for the past 25 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last two years, the value of the maximum Pell grant
has increased by $425, or 14 percent,'' Hartle said. ``Increasing
the Pell grant by $100 costs $350 million, which is a lot even by
Washington standards, especially when it competes directly with
Head Start, biomedical research and job training.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, entitled ``Do Grants Matter? Student Grant Aid and
College Affordability,'' found that in the six years ending in the
1995-96 academic year, the average net cost of a public four-year
institution rose 28 percent, to $7,829 from $6,140, for
undergraduates whose annual family incomes were $20,000 to $39,999.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found an overall disparity between the
college enrollment of low-income and high-income students.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Overall enrollments are up and federal funding has modestly
increased,'' said Jamie P. Merisotis, president of the Institute
for Higher Education Policy, ``but these trends mask the fact that
there is a gap of almost 30 percentage points in enrollment between
low-income and high-income students.''
</P>
<P>
   Merisotis said colleges deserved credit for having invested
heavily in financial aid based on need, but added, ``The fact
remains that the prices are still increasing, and the lower-income
students and parents bear the brunt of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a possible solution, Merisotis replied, ``It's not
just more federal money that's needed, but a different political
attitude about how and why we should be investing in student aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition, the schools must keep prices down by improved
cost-management strategies,'' he said. ``For example, some colleges
might consider eliminating a program in electrical engineering that
is high-cost and has very few graduates.''

CITY OF BURBANK WINS ROUND OVER AIRPORT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. _ City representatives should get a chance to
prove in court that projected noise increases at an expanded
Burbank Airport would violate state law, the state Court of Appeal
decided in a ruling made public on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by a three-judge panel sends the case back for Los
Angeles Superior Court to consider the issue of whether the airport
would unlawfully increase noise levels beyond the current limit of
370 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank City Manager Bud Ovrom said the appellate court decision
might push airport officials to cut a deal with the city and end
protracted legal battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're capable of protracting this legal fight for a long time.
It demonstrates that the airport will have to overcome these legal
hurdles unless they deal with us,'' Ovrom said. ``We want a new
airport, too, but they're not going to jam it down our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was a victory for the city bordering Los Angeles
because the lower court earlier refused to consider whether an
expansion would violate a state law limiting the area where the
airport can affect noise levels. Burbank officials said the
decision means the airport must now show that its expansion and
growth plans will not exceed the cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to prove at court that they (would be) violating
the cap, but we think the facts are very clear on that,'' said
Peter Kirsch, a lawyer for Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study commissioned by the airport projected that the
noise-impact area will increase to 500 acres by 2010. But Victor
Gill, a spokesman for the airport, said the expansion will not
cause increased noise beyond the 370-acre limit. He said the
projection for increased noise in homes near the airport was based
on computer models that do not take new noise-control measures into
account.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the airport will pay to insulate many
homes in which noise levels otherwise would rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2010 we will have insulated hundreds and hundreds of
homes,'' Gill said.

UTILITY TO OFFER CLEAN-SOURCE OR `GREEN' ELECTRICITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles: The city of designer clothes,
designer cars and designer watches is considering a new option _
designer power.
</P>
<P>
   Under a program recommended by a city panel Tuesday, customers
of the Department of Water and Power soon could choose between
power generated by oil and coal or ``green power,'' created by the
sun, wind, water and other renewable sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to clean this town up _ clean power and more
trees,'' said DWP General Manager David Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   The green power program recommended by the Commerce, Energy and
Natural Resources Committee to the City Council will allow DWP
customers over the next year to say whether they want to buy power
from a renewable source. The council will consider the proposal
next Tuesday and is expected to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said it will take about a year for customers to start
getting green power because the DWP needs time to sign up customers
and make sure there is a market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there is a market out there,'' Freeman said. ``People
tell us they want to buy clean energy, and we want to tap into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The DWP will buy electricity from companies that specialize in
green power and charge the customers for it.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said green power rates will be higher than those now
charged, about $3 more for every $50 of electricity. But
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter predicted the total bills will remain
about the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think with energy conservation and other programs, the
bills won't go up,'' Galanter said. ``People don't really care what
their rates are. They care about how big a check they have to sign
at the end of the month.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said he believes the program could attract more than
10percent of the utility's 1million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Freeman said, he would like every house to be
equipped with new solar shingles, which look like conventional
shingles but generate electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where people see a roof, I see a power-generating station,''
Freeman said. ``What we have in Los Angeles is a perfect
combination of dirty air and a lot of sun. We can use the sun to
clean up the environment and also create some jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman said he believes the program also will give the DWP a
competitive edge in 2003 when it has to open its market to
competition from private firms.
</P>
<P>
   Automobile companies such as General Motors and Toyota, involved
with electric vehicles, are interested in getting cleanly generated
electricity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have invested a lot of money in electric vehicles, and
sales have not been going well,'' Freeman said. ``They want to get
out the message that they aren't transferring the benefits of clean
vehicles to using more dirty electricity.''

MIXED RESULTS FOR CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION
</HEADLINE>
   ( nk ) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Buyers kept their feet firmly planted on the ground
Tuesday night at Sotheby's auction of contemporary art. While six
or seven people were often seen bidding on a work at once, buying
seemed carefully controlled throughout the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some pieces drew high prices, and records were set for
artists including Richard Diebenkorn, Jeff Koons, Brice Marden and
Martin Puryear. The sale totaled $42.2 million, less than Sotheby's
estimate of $47 million to $65 million. Of the 83 works, 67 were
sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers were selective,'' said Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief
executive. ``They knew what they wanted. But the evening proved
this market is alive and well.''
</P>
<P>
   The salesroom was far more lively than it had been on Monday
night, when the auction house sold Impressionist and modern art
that included 37 works from the Reader's Digest collection.
</P>
<P>
   The highest price paid Tuesday night was for Picasso's ``Nude''
(1909), which shows the artist's mistress, Fernande Olivier,
wrapped in a cloth. Estimated at $10 million to $15 million, it
sold for $11 million to an unidentified buyer. Although a Picasso
would normally have gone into a sale of Impressionist and modern
art, Sotheby's placed it in the contemporary sale because Monday's
auction, which included the Reader's Digest property, was already
too large.
</P>
<P>
   The Picasso was one of 27 works from the Morton G. Neumann
family collection. Neumann, a Chicago industrialist who died in
1985, and his wife, Rose, began buying art in the 1940s. Over the
years, they amassed works by artists including Picasso, Miro,
Dubuffet, Klee and Giacometti. When Mrs. Neumann died this year,
the works went to the their children, who chose to sell a group of
them to help pay estate taxes. Many, including the Picasso, had
been on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Another painting from the Neumann collection that brought a
strong price was Miro's ``Head of a Smoker'' (1925), one of the
artist's ``dream paintings,'' which shows a head and pipe merging
into a single abstract form. The buyer was David Nahmad, a
Manhattan dealer, who paid $1 million, just at the painting's low
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   After the the Neumann collection, the sale progressed to
contemporary art from various owners. One of the evening's
liveliest moments came when Richard Diebenkorn's ``Horizon: Ocean
View'' (1992-93) was up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The one contemporary work from the Reader's Digest collection,
the glorious painting of sea and sky incited more excitement than
Monday night's entire sale. Estimated at $1.5 million to $2
million, it sold for a whopping $3.9 million to an unidentified
telephone buyer, leaving seven other serious bidders disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every case, works that didn't sell carried estimates
that were too high. One of the problems, Sotheby's officials said,
was those estimates were placed in July, when both the art market
and the financial market felt more buoyant.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some of the evening's biggest-ticket items went unsold,
regardless of quality. Among them was Jasper Johns's ``White
Numbers'' (1958), an important encaustic-on-linen painting of
numerals in a progression from 0 to 9 repeated horizontally and
vertically in thick, gestural strokes. Sotheby's estimated it would
sell for $7 million to $9 million, but a collective gasp was heard
in the salesroom when bidding failed to go above $6 million. Just a
year ago, a larger version of ``White Numbers,'' from the
collection of Victor and Sally Ganz, fetched $7.9 million at
Christie's, and before Tuesday night's sale, collectors and dealers
said they thought this one should have been priced at $5 million to
$7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Johns was being sold by the Boston collectors Mildred and
Herbert Lee. In the 1960s, Mrs. Lee began buying what were then
considered adventurous works, which are now highly desirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``White Numbers'' wasn't the only Johns owned by the Lees, who
also were selling a 1959 ``Flag,'' a pencil-and-graphite wash on
paper estimated at $500,000 to $700,000. Unlike ``White Numbers,''
it had three serious bidders who wanted to take it home. It finally
sold for $992,500, a record for a Johns work on paper, to Simon de
Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, who now runs an
art investment and advisory business.
</P>
<P>
   Also from the Lee collection was Robert Rauschenberg's ``Dry
Run'' (1963), one of the artist's early silkscreens with overlays
of photographic images. Several bidders showed interest in the
work, which finally went to a representative of Eli Broad, the Los
Angeles collector, for $992,500, a little more than its low
estimate of $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the sale felt very solid,'' said Tobias Meyer, head of
contemporary art for Sotheby's worldwide, who was the evening's
auctioneer. ``For works like the Diebenkorn, we had six or seven
people bidding at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Marden's ``Yellows,'' (1972), a triptych, had lots of bidders
waving paddles. Estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million, it went to
Robert Mnuchin, chairman of the Manhattan gallery C&AMP;M Arts, for
$992,500. Mr. Mnuchin also bought Andy Warhol's ``Four Marilyns''
for $2.3 million, just below its low estimate of $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought some splendid things,'' said a beaming Mnuchin as he
left the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts expressed relief that the market felt more solid
than it had on Monday night. ``There was better property tonight,''
said Diane Upright, a private New York dealer. ``Some of the
estimates were daunting. And buyers were very careful.''

HOUSTON TOPS TEXAS IN DREXLER'S DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The first 6,000 fans to enter sold-out Hofheinz
Pavilion for the Houston-Texas basketball opener last night
received T-shirts commemorating the debut of Cougars coach Clyde
Drexler.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the 8,452 in attendance went away feeling as if they
were part of the rebirth of what once was one of college hoops'
most successful programs. Many more may one day say they witnessed
Drexler's first coaching victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gee Gervin, son of former NBA great George Gervin, led Houston
to a historic 71-69 victory against the Longhorns _ who also
happened to be making their debut with coach Rick Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure had a great time tonight,'' said Drexler, who retired
from the Houston Rockets after last season and took the UH job.
``We really wanted to get off to a good start by winning this game.
I was really proud of the players. They played together and stuck
to the game plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin, a transfer guard from San Jacinto College, scored a
game-high 25 points, including seven of his team's last eight
points as the Cougars held off a Texas rally from 12 down to 70-69
on Ivan Wagner's 3-pointer with 44 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Kris Clack and Gabe Muoneke led Texas with 16 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed with the way we played in the first
half, but we played our way back, and did have a chance at the
end,'' Barnes said. ``We got frustrated at times, but we stayed
together, and I'm proud of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The game might not have rivaled some of the titanic battles in
Hofheinz 20 years ago when former Houston coach Guy V. Lewis
matched wits with Abe Lemons at Texas and Eddie Sutton at Arkansas
during the height of Southwest Conference basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis said he relishes the rebirth of the program. Last
night's crowd recalled days when Hofheinz regularly sold out when
the Longhorns and Razorbacks visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only thing is we'll be rocking every game this year rather
than just a couple,'' said Lewis, whose teams won 592 games and
played in five Final Fours during his 30-year tenure (1956-86).
``These new (luxury) boxes have really dressed the place up. And on
top of that, it's one more thing that's going to keep the noise
inside. The low ceiling used to keep the noise right on top of us.
Now there's no place for it to go. It's just great.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Houston continued to win after Lewis retired a dozen
years ago, the program never came close to generating Phi Slama
Jama-type enthusiasm that reached its peak when Drexler and Hakeem
Olajuwon helped lead the Cougars to Final Fours in 1982 and '83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basketball enthusiasm here had dropped to almost nil,''
Lewis said. ``Now, it's amazing. We sold out Hofheinz on a season
ticket basis for the first time in history. And I'm not talking
about padded. People bought the tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The game dominated local early-evening sports talk shows. The
manager of a popular South Main oyster bar patiently explained to a
patron that it was against policy to turn up the sound on the
restaurant's television _ but that they could punch up closed
captioning. Satisfied, the customer said he and some friends would
return _ and this was three hours before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is on a high,'' Lewis said. ``I don't think it's all
that they feel like we're going to win that many games this year,
although they think we'll be improved. But people just feel like
the future is now. We just signed three great players \Rduring the
fall signing period\S and we have our hooks into two or three more.
To go with what we've got, we're going to have top-notch teams.
It's all about enthusiasm for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we could have hired anyone else other than Clyde
who would have brought the enthusiasm back. The guy just wows them.
I've never seen anything like it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has. But it has been awhile.

TRIAL ORDERED FOR PARENTS IN 50-POUND TEEN'S DEATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The parents of a severely handicapped 15-year-old
girl who died weighing just 50 pounds have been ordered to stand
trial on charges that they deliberately starved her to death.
</P>
<P>
   Michael and Kathleen Gentry of Lake Los Angeles are scheduled to
be arraigned Dec. 1 on charges of murder, child abuse and
conspiracy in the February 1996 death of their daughter, Lindsay,
who was born with several mental and physical handicaps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. and Mrs. Gentry aided and abetted and actively and
intentionally starved their child to death,'' Los Angeles Municipal
Court Judge Glenette Blackwell said Tuesday at the culmination of
the two-day hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell also reduced Kathleen Gentry's bail from $1 million to
$500,000 on the condition that she not contact any trial witnesses.
Her husband's bail remained at $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Gentrys have received widespread support from the residents
of Lake Los Angeles, a close-knit community in the Antelope Valley
north of Los Angeles. Supporters have raised money for the couple's
defense and have created an Internet site with news of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicolai, 54, a second cousin of Michael Gentry, said he was
shocked at Blackwell's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it,'' said Nicolai, who attended the hearing. ``I
know they're innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Gentry's attorney, Dave Houchin, said he wasn't
surprised by the ruling because defendants are rarely released
after a preliminary hearing. He said he is prepared to try the case
before a jury.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, the Gentrys have said they cherished their
daughter and tried everything to get her to eat. Despite their best
efforts, they said, the 4-feet-8 teen weighed only 50 pounds when
she died. Lindsay's death certificate lists pneumonia and marasmus,
a progressive emaciation, as contributing factors.
</P>
<P>
   But a teacher's aide who befriended Lindsay testified Tuesday
that the 15-year-old had a voracious appetite during weekend visits
at her house and was always hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave her eggs, pancakes, oatmeal _ anything soft,'' said
Paula Elrod, who invited Lindsay to her house because she was
concerned the girl was so thin. ``She would eat more than I
would.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked by the judge how she was able to get Lindsay to eat,
Elrod replied: ``I just loved her. Her favorite food was green
burritos.''
</P>
<P>
   Elrod also recounted an instance when Kathleen Gentry
interrupted a telephone conversation between her daughter and the
teacher's aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindsay became angry (and said): Get off the phone, Mommy. I'm
talking to my other mommy and she doesn't want me to die,'' Elrod
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay's death was attributed to natural causes until
authorities received a tip from a family friend that the teen had
been mistreated by her parents. Detectives launched a two-year
investigation that culminated with the Gentrys' arrests in July.

ADELPHI, OUSTED PRESIDENT SETTLE SUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: RECASTS lede, ADDS optional material) 
 (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Adelphi University agreed Tuesday to pay a
settlement with its ousted president, Peter Diamandopoulos, that
leaves him with $1.4 million before taxes and resolves all the
suits and countersuits over his removal last year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also yields $3.5 million for Adelphi from several
sources, which the university said it would use to hire professors
and begin to refurbish its campus here.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos, whose unusually high pay and benefits led to his
highly publicized downfall in 1997, had sought more than $4.5
million but settled for less than a third of that after refunding
part of his salary and paying rent owed on a luxury condominium in
Manhattan that the university had bought for him, and reimbursing
Adelphi for legal fees and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Adelphi's chairman, Steven Isenberg, said the settlement
``closes the books on what was a difficult and sad chapter in the
life of this university.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and professors expressed relief. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``We just need to get over it,'' said Diane Malinauskas, 21, a
speech pathology major from Glen Cove, N.Y. ``It got to the point
where it was kind of embarrassing to say you went to Adelphi. But
things have turned around. Morale's definitely up.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos, who was named president in 1985, had sought to
transform Adelphi from a commuter college into one with an
international reputation, with advertisements that called Harvard
``the Adelphi of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   But as tuition soared, enrollment dropped and financial troubles
forced layoffs and cuts in programs &UR; .  &LR; Growing dissatisfaction with
Diamandopoulos' personality and policies erupted into an
out-and-out battle three years ago after it was reported that his
$523,000 a year in pay and benefits ranked among the highest for
the nation's college presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by a coalition of critics _ including faculty leaders,
former trustees and administrators, alumni, parents and students _
the state Board of Regents held 27 days of hearings before removing
18 of the 19 trustees for neglect of duty and misconduct in
February 1997. The Regents cited the trustees for granting
excessive compensation to Diamandopoulos, failing to review his
performance and allowing some trustees to engage in private
business with the university.
</P>
<P>
   The Regents appointed a new board, headed by Isenberg, which
dismissed Diamandopoulos. After he sought to stay on as a tenured
professor, the new board went to court to cancel his contract
rights, and he countersued. State Attorney General Dennis Vacco
sued the former trustees for restitution of misspent money, and
they sued the Regents.
</P>
<P>
   The deal announced Tuesday, in which neither Diamandopoulos nor
the former trustees admitted wrongdoing, settled all the
litigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under the complicated agreement, which was executed on Monday,
the former trustees paid Adelphi $1.23 &UR;  &LR; million and assumed more
than $400,000 in legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Tuesday how the former trustees would divide
their share of the payments to Adelphi. In the group is Hilton
Kramer, an art critic, as well as several wealthy executives,
including Leonard Riggio, chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   Adelphi received an additional $1.45 million from National
Union, the insurance company that indemnified the former trustees
and officers. Diamandopoulos refunded nearly $650,000 to Adelphi,
paid more than $100,000 in rent on the Manhattan apartment and
dropped claims worth an additional $767,000.
</P>
<P>
   All told, after paying $500,000 in legal bills that it still
owes, the university's balance sheet will be improved by about $3.5
million, Isenberg confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos was permitted to keep $1.8 million in deferred
compensation and interest, and he received nearly $400,000 more as
a settlement of his counterclaim against Adelphi for breach of
contract. After his reimbursements to Adelphi, he walked away with
about $1.4 million, Isenberg said. But after taxes were withheld,
Diamandopoulos received only about $650,000 in cash, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diamandopoulos, 70, also agreed to vacate the Manhattan
condominium, on East 72nd Street, by the end of the month, Isenberg
said. A broker has been hired to sell it, with an asking price of
$1.45 million. Adelphi had spent a total of $1.3 million to buy,
renovate and furnish the high-rise apartment. Diamandopoulos had
sought to exercise an option to buy it for $905,000.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general and other critics of Diamandopoulos had
attacked his lavish life style as president, and some had
speculated that he used Adelphi's money to amass an art collection
while on frequent trips to Europe paid for by the university. But
Matthew D. Sansverie, chief of the attorney general's Charities
Bureau, said Diamandopoulos had sworn in an affidavit that he, not
Adelphi, had paid for his art collection.
</P>
<P>
   Both Michael N. Rosen, a lawyer for Diamandopoulos, and Stanley
Arkin, who represented the former trustees, said their clients were
pleased with the settlement and remained loyal to Adelphi.
</P>
<P>
   Isenberg noted that since Adelphi named a new president, Matthew
Goldstein, in June, enrollment, which fell 62 percent during
Diamandopoulos's administration, has surged. The freshman class is
nearly twice last year's in number, and total enrollment is up 5
percent, to 4,275.
</P>
<P>
   Adelphi, which has an operating budget of about $76 million,
will use the $3.5 million it received under the settlement to
continue a buyout of tenured professors that has enabled it to hire
13 professors this year and which could result in 40 new hirings
over the next three years, Isenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The money will also allow Adelphi to speed up plans to borrow
$15 million to rehabilitate its five residence halls, add a
computer center to its library and overhaul the interior of its
business school, said a spokesman, Vince Passaro.

ISLES LOSE JONSSON, THEN THE GAME, 5-2, TO COLORADO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DENVER _ The Islanders lost defenseman Kenny Jonsson to a
concussion Tuesday night, then lost to the Colorado Avalanche by
5-2 at McNichols Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson, the Islanders' top defenseman, was injured in the
second period when he was cross-checked in the head by the
Avalanche's Cam Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Russell delivered the blow behind Jonsson's right ear,
Peter Forsberg of the Avalanche elbowed the left side of Jonsson's
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a headache,'' said Jonsson, who has had five
concussions in his career, two in the National Hockey League. ``I
don't think it was a cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the 6-foot-3-inch, 195-pound Jonsson
would miss any games, but the loss to Colorado was an indication of
how indispensable Jonsson is to the Islanders. When Jonsson left
the game, the score was tied at 1-1. His presence in the defensive
zone was immediately missed as the Islanders gave up many quality
scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we missed him,'' said Mike Milbury, the Islanders'
coach and general manager. ``Any time he misses is going to be
tough to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonsson, who missed just one game last season because of the
flu, will be re-evaluated here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to lose him,'' said goalie Tommy Salo, who made
23 saves. ``He's our best defenseman. We need him in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Miller ended his streak of 31 games without a goal at 1
minute 8 seconds of the third period, scoring over a sprawled Salo
to give the Avalanche a 4-2 lead. Claude Lemieux scored Colorado's
fifth goal in the final minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders, who got off to another slow start, were outshot
by 9-3 in the first period but played to a 1-1 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche scored first, on a goal by Forsberg at 6:33.
Forsberg, who was fed the puck by Valery Kamensky after winning a
draw, beat Salo with a wrist shot from the slot. The Avalanche is
20-0-7 when Forsberg scores a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mariusz Czerkawski, who scored twice for the Islanders, tied the
score at 16:43. On a two-on-one break, Claude Lapointe made a
cross-ice pass to Czerkawski, who fired wide of the Avalanche net.
The puck rebounded off the back boards and back out to Czerkawski,
who poked it in.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche gained a 2-1 advantage a few minutes after the
injury to Jonsson. Kamensky scored on the power play at 10:45 on
blast from the middle of the right circle. His shot deflected off
Scott Lachance's stick.
</P>
<P>
   The teams exchanged goals late in the second period. Czerkawski
scored for the second time at 14:01 on the power play to tie the
score at 2-2. But Joe Sakic, the Avalanche captain, restored
Colorado's lead 25 seconds later, ricocheting the puck off an
unsuspecting Salo. Sakic was behind the goal line when the puck
went in.

TROJANS' RECRUITS LEAD ROUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If their first game is any indication, USC's
newcomers won't need any transition period to catch up with the
veterans. Four members of the Trojans' incoming recruiting class
scored in double figures Tuesday as USC rolled to a 101-54 victory
over San Diego State before 2,381 at the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Junior college transfer Brian Scalabrine, a 6-foot-9 forward,
lived up to his advance billing with 14 points and nine rebounds in
only 18 minutes. Nearly as impressive was freshman point guard
Brandon Granville, who had 10 points and five assists in his first
college start.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman forward Sam Clancy had 11 points and 10 rebounds and
guard Quincy Wilder added 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, an impressive debut for the youngsters. And a solid
start for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the new guys played well,'' USC coach Henry Bibby
said. ``The new guys are from winning programs and they showed that
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite playing an outclassed Aztecs team, there were some
jitters among those Trojans making their first college appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' Scalabrine said. ``As good a shape as I'm in,
it was hard to catch my wind. It took me like two or three minutes
once I went to the bench to catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Granville didn't feel any different than when he led
Westchester to the Division I state title, a pretty heady feeling
for someone who wasn't expected to start before the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I wasn't nervous,'' Granville said. ``Coach asked me
before the game if I would be and I told him no. I just tried to go
out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   The 47-point victory was USC's largest in a season opener and
matched the worst loss in San Diego State history. Even with the
Aztecs coming off a surprising loss to Nevada at home last
Saturday, Bibby was just happy to get a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last year, I'll take it any way I can get it,'' Bibby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Junior forward Jarvis Turner was bothered by back spasms
but scored nine points in 20 minutes.... Point guard Kevin
Augustine played three minutes, despite missing nearly two weeks of
practice after being suspended when he left the team because of
burnout. ``I didn't think I would play at all,'' Augustine said.
``The main thing I talked to coach about was that I need to
continue to work on my conditioning. I'm a ways away as far as
conditioning.''... USC's 22 steals tied a school record.

NOT DONE YET: GRAF UPSETS A HOBBLED NOVOTNA
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: UPDATES with 2nd round results, Graf beating Novotna; no
pickup) 
 (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jana Novotna may be the defending champion of the
Chase Championships, not to mention the reigning champion of
Wimbledon, but Steffi Graf is the undisputed champion of the
comeback, and Tuesday night at Madison Square Garden, a cramping
Novotna became the latest victim of Graf's latest take-no-prisoners
return to the women's tennis tour.
</P>
<P>
   Now on a two-tournament winning streak since her return from
September wrist surgery, Graf wore her poker face and brandished
her forehand like a bullwhip in the course of a 6-7 (5-7), 6-4, 6-1
victory that improved her record against the third-seeded Novotna
to 28-4. With her defeats of top-ranked Lindsay Davenport and
second-ranked Martina Hingis last week at Philadelphia, the
29-year-old Graf became the first unseeded player to dispose of the
world's top two players in the same event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I played up to my potential, but I've been
wearing down some players and that speaks for itself,'' Graf said.
</P>
<P>
   After scrambling into the final slot at this invitation-only
event for the top 16 women in 1998, Graf turned her attention to
Novotna, who limped into the tournament on a four-match losing
streak and limped away from this match barely able to work her
legs. The first defending champion to falter in the first round
here, Novotna was initially overcome by an onslaught of cramping in
both calves just after winning the first point of her first service
game in the final set. As Graf waited impatiently to put the
finishing touches on the turnaround she had begun in the second
set, Novotna sought treatment from a trainer. Although she returned
to the court and held serve for a 1-0 lead, that was the last game
she would win.
</P>
<P>
   Grimacing and bending and stretching to no avail, Novotna was
merely a pawn for Graf's latest performance in a remarkable
11-match unbeaten streak: At triple match point of this
2-hour-4-minute confrontation between the grande dames of the WTA
Tour, Novotna decided not to waste further time delaying the
inevitable. She simply let Graf's sliced backhand return waft past
her uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   After an unfriendly playing experience in which she was nearly
beheaded by a body-jamming ace from Graf midway through the second
set, getting out of the Garden without terminal injury was probably
Novotna's priority by the end of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, another recent victim of Graf's, has had a disconcerting
week. First she had to cope with the fact that, no matter what she
accomplishes at this year-ending tournament, it will not be enough
to wrest the No. 1 ranking from Lindsay Davenport. So like it or
not, and she doesn't, the record will show she was second best in
1998. And then, as if she didn't have enough pecking-order problems
last night, she had to cope with Patty Schnyder, the Swiss-born
player who had obediently played second fiddle to her until last
month at Munich.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they met, the fuzzy-haired Schnyder, whose five
titles for 1998 earned her the WTA's most improved player award,
dealt Hingis a defeat and a case of leg cramps. This time the
19-year-old Schnyder seemed intent on toppling Hingis again, but
after powering herself to a 6-4 lead, the left-handed Schnyder
wilted just long enough to allow Hingis to regroup and reassert
herself as the steadier playmaker. True, they ran each other
ragged. ``You just have to play and run,'' Hingis said. But in the
end it was Hingis, with a determined glare giving impetus to every
shot she launched, who advanced to the quarterfinal round with a
4-6, 6-0, 6-3 comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was strange how the second set was over, 6-0, in like 10
minutes, but then you have to fight for every point in the third
set; it was a little bit nerve-racking to have someone like her on
the other side of the net,'' said Hingis, referring to the pressure
inherent in playing her understudy. ``I was, like, nervous in the
first set. My concentration went up and down like a roller
coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Hingis's black headband felt as tight as a noose in
the opening set, when she went up a break only to instantly
surrender it with a double fault that leveled matters at 3-3. And
after holding for 5-4, Schnyderagain poured on the pressure and
broke Hingis for the set with a rambunctious inside-out forehand
that Hingis somehow dug out of the corner but managed to send only
as far as the net.
</P>
<P>
   But the momentum switched to Hingis's side in the virtually
one-sided middle set, when Schnyder forgot how to aim her missiles
within the boundaries. In the third set, the pair traded breaks in
the second and third games, but once Schnyder allowed Hingis to
wriggle out of a 0-40 deficit as she served in the fourth game, it
was the more famous Swiss player, not the homegrown one, who took
control.
</P>
<P>
   A pragmatist at heart, Hingis said she has already replaced her
chase for the No. 1 ranking with her pursuit of a first Chase
title. ``If you win this tournament, you go better into next
year,'' she said.

HYDE REJECTS WHITE HOUSE REQUEST FOR MORE TIME TO QUESTION STARR
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: ADDS comments from Hyde in new 4th graf, In a letter ...;
Pickup 4th graf pvs, House Republicans ...) 
(fb) 
By ERIC SCHMITT and LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans on the Judiciary Committee decided
Tuesday to call more witnesses in the inquiry into President
Clinton, and rejected a White House bid for more time to question
the independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr at the committee's first
hearing on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers said they wanted 90 minutes to cross-examine
Starr, instead of the half-hour that Republicans had offered. Starr
will have two hours to make an opening statement before any
questioning begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything less than 90 minutes would unfairly constrain our
ability to explore the basis for Starr's testimony, and for any
conclusions he may proffer,'' Charles F.C. Ruff, the White House
counsel, said in a letter to Rep. Henry J. Hyde, who heads the
committee. Tuesday night, Hyde rejected the request and gave
Clinton's lawyers until midday Wednesday to accept the original
offer.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, Hyde warned White House lawyers that he would
restrict questioning specifically to the impeachment charges.
``Efforts to utilize these proceedings as a forum to inquire about
nongermane matters, such as investigations into the conduct of the
investigation, that are pending before other bodies, shall not be
permitted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans may announce their additional witnesses as
early as Wednesday but were waiting in part for Clinton to respond
to 81 questions from the committee, on whether he lied under oath,
obstructed justice or tampered with witnesses. The Republicans had
said that if he agreed to certain facts in the inquiry, that would
speed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting until we get the stipulations,'' said Rep. Mary
Bono, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said Clinton's lawyers were working on
the responses.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering came just two days before the committee is to
hold its first public hearing in the inquiry, showcasing the
prosecutor who investigated Clinton in a forum where full coverage
is planned by at least three television networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fair to say we don't have a clear process in mind, but
we're going to go forward to get the facts,'' said Rep. Christopher
B. Cannon, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for Thursday's hearing, Starr delivered four more
boxes of documents to Capitol Hill on Tuesday. The material,
requested by Democrats, relates to Starr's investigation of Webster
Hubbell, a former No. 3 official in the Justice Department who
became embroiled in the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   The documents were delivered after Democrats demanded to know
how Starr's investigation leaped from his original Whitewater
mandate into the Lewinsky scandal. Republicans said the documents,
which include grand-jury testimony and recordings of Hubbell's jail
house telephone calls, could help bolster the assertion in Starr's
report to Congress that the president obstructed justice by
concealing his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At a hourlong meeting Tuesday, committee Republicans debated the
merits of calling additional witnesses, including Ms. Lewinsky,
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., the president's confidant who helped her find
a job, and Betty Currie, Clinton's secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans may also call or take a deposition from
John Huang, a former Democratic party fund-raiser who would testify
about his dealings with Hubbell. Starr indicted Hubbell last week
for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has sought to determine whether Huang might have steered
money to Hubbell to keep him quiet about what he knew of Clinton's
involvement in the Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said they would try to show that many of the same
people who they say helped buy Hubbell's silence also tried to keep
Ms. Lewinsky quiet about her affair with the president by lining up
a job for her in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a clear possibility simply because we know from
published reports that Huang has cooperated with Starr,'' said Rep.
Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``That could make him a relevant witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats reacted with fury Tuesday over the inquiry's sudden
reach into Whitewater and procedures governing Thursday's hearing.
Democrats initially threatened to boycott the hearing but later
dropped the idea as Hyde expressed a willingness to accommodate
them.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, the Democratic leader, said Tuesday that
``if at this moment, we are launching into material that has never
been sent to the committee as part of a referral, and there is
going to be some oral presentation about matters that are not in
his referral, this is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Republicans on the committee are facing pressure from
their own colleagues and weary citizens who want to see the inquiry
wrapped up. A number of Republicans, including moderates from the
Northeast, say they will not support articles of impeachment on the
House floor, a move that would surely doom the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there's enough evidence to warrant
impeachment,'' said Rep. Peter T. King, R-N.Y. ``I'm confident a
good number of Republicans feel the same way. Right now, the trick
is to end it and declare victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., said, ``Assuming there's no new
information, I'd vote against it.''
</P>
<P>
   To counter that sentiment, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member of the
Judiciary Committee and one of Clinton's fiercest critics, held a
news conference with members of 10 conservative groups to shore up
support for the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   One day before House Republicans elect their leaders, many
conservative groups conditioned their future support for the
Republican leaders on a commitment to pursue impeachment
proceedings vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has stalled on impeachment during
its entire four-year tenure,'' said Howard Phillips, chairman of
the Conservative Caucus, who demanded that Republican leadership
candidates ``make known now where he or she stands on this
historically crucial issue.''

UCONN WOMEN DEFEAT UCLA

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's part of being an up-and-comer, trying to
knock off the queens of college basketball. It allows one to smile
and take quasi-delight even if the result goes in the wrong column.
</P>
<P>
   So while No.14 UCLA wasn't ecstatic over its 113-102 foul-filled
loss to No.2 UConn in front of 5,221 Tuesday at Pauley Pavilion,
there was some reserved pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what we did,'' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said.
``This game shows we can play with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems warped, but in the world of women's basketball, if the
outcome is in doubt in the final five minutes against UConn or
Tennessee or Louisiana Tech, it means your program is close to
arriving at the big time.
</P>
<P>
   And this one was in doubt with four minutes left as UConn's
83-70 lead was cut to 93-89 with 4:40 to play. But the Huskies
(3-0), on the West Coast for the sixth day in a row, scored eight
of the next points to ice the game.
</P>
<P>
   However, UCLA's ability to remain close, and even mount a late
comeback, does validate the preseason prognostications and ease
some of the pain from a 17-point loss to Notre Dame in its season
opener. The Bruins (0-2) were ranked sixth in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   However, just how much is eased will be determined by what the
Bruins do later this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a chance to redeem ourselves after the loss at Notre
Dame,'' UCLA forward Maylana Martin said. ``It wasn't a chance to
get over Notre Dame and make up for that loss, but a chance to get
something back. We expected a lot out of our team and so did other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But before UCLA can jump to elite status it must improve a
defense that was decimated by the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   While the foul-infested game (53 fouls) took away much of the
rhythm and pace, it was UCLA's lack of defense that allowed UConn
to shoot 58 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that damage was done by sophomore Svetlana Abrosimova,
who chimed in with a career-high 39 points on 14 of 17 shooting.
Shea Ralph, who missed last season with a knee injury, added a
career-best 28.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were led by Janae Hubbard's career-best 29 points
while Marie Philman, Michelle Greco and LaCresha Flannigan each
added 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our (lack of) depth and foul trouble really hurt us,'' Olivier
said. ``We have to do some things different defensively, get a hand
up in the shooter's face.''
</P>
<P>
   What will sit poorly with the Bruins are the missed
opportunities. After UConn pushed a 60-54 halftime lead to 83-70
with 11:29 left, the Bruins pulled within 93-89 with 4:40 left on
Philman's lay-in.
</P>
<P>
   But the Huskies answered with more open shots and scored eight
of the next 10 points to go ahead 101-91 with 3:12 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I though UCLA played really, really well on offense,'' UConn
coach Geno Auriemma said. ``Obviously, it's important to have our
two best players in a game (late) as crazy as this, where whoever
has the ball last and scores last wins the game.''

 By JERRY WIZIG  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Clyde Drexler got everything he wanted in his University of Houston
coaching debut Tuesday night _ a tight game, a huge crowd and,
finally, a win for his long-suffering alma mater.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After leading from the first three minutes, the Cougars survived
three missed shots by Texas in the closing seconds and escaped with
a 71-69 victory before a sellout Hofheinz Pavilion crowd of 8,452
in the teams' season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler's coaching debut was almost spoiled. Texas, struggling
with 32.4-percent shooting, saw potential game-winning shots by
William Clay, Kris Clack and Chris Mihm miss before Gee Gervin
added the final point of the game for the Cougars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty anxious for this night. I'd been waiting for it
the last two months,'' Drexler admitted. ``I live for pressure, and
this game had it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gervin, the son of former NBA great George Gervin, looked like a
chip off the old ``Ice'' block. A 6-3 junior guard playing his
first major-college game, Gervin coolly led the Cougars with 25
points, including their final eight.
</P>
<P>
   Gervin was 4-of-6 from 3-point range and credited a Drexler
suggestion in helping him reverse a 1-of-9 showing in an 88-80
exhibition loss to the Australian All-Stars last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to just relax and let the game come,'' said Gervin,
who also had three assists and only two turnovers in 36 minutes.
``I took my time, and I was a lot more relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Hendrick scored 17 points for the Cougars, with Kenny
Younger adding 15 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Muoneke of Cypress Falls and Clack scored 16 each for
Texas, playing its first game with Rick Barnes as coach. Clay added
12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Only 9-of-18 shooting from 3-point range enabled UH to win. The
Cougars hit only 40.6 percent of their field-goal attempts, missed
half of their 20 free throws and committed 18 turnovers. Texas had
a 52-39 rebounding margin, with Mihm (14) and Clack (12) combining
for 26. But the Longhorns also suffered 18 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot play offense any worse than we did,'' said Barnes,
whose team hit only 24.1 percent (7-of-29) of its first-half shots.
``Our offense just didn't get the shots and execute like we needed
to. We needed to penetrate in the middle, and we didn't get the
kind of ball movement we needed. But as bad as we played, we had
three shots to win it at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Drexler liked the way his inside players clustered their zone
defense around Mihm, UT's 7-foot sophomore who blocked seven shots
but missed six of his eight field-goal attempts. The Cougars also
limited Clack to 5-of-19 shooting from the floor but very nearly
let several 12-point leads slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big guys fronted Mihm every opportunity they had to push
him out farther from the basket, and that was a big part of our
game plan,'' Drexler said. ``I'm proud of the way we adjusted when
we lost our big guy, Early Smith.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, charged with much of the job of defending Mihm, suffered
possible torn knee cartilage in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Clay's 3-pointer off the backboard capped an 11-2 UT run that
reduced UH's 61-49 lead to 63-60 with 4:07 remaining. After a
Cougars timeout, Gervin was fouled by Muoneke and made both free
throws, then canned a jumper with one second left on the shot clock
to put Houston up by seven.
</P>
<P>
   After Muoneke sank a 15-footer and two free throws to draw Texas
within 67-64, Gervin answered again, sinking a jumper from the wing
to make it 69-64.
</P>
<P>
   Clay responded with a jumper before Gervin's free throw
presented UH with a 70-66 lead with 1:10 left. But the Longhorns'
Ivan Wagner sank a 3-pointer, his only field goal of the night, to
cut the margin to 70-69 with 44 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   An almost-fatal UH turnover against UT's pressing defense gave
the 'Horns their game-winning chance, but they couldn't get the
ball to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stuck with our game plan, and I was proud of the guys for
sticking together when things got tight and pulling it out,''
Drexler said. ``We're going to have a lot of tight games, and
winning one like this has to help us.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FROM strictly a basketball standpoint, it was hardly Phi Slama
Junior.
</P>
<P>
   No backboard-shaking. No elevating along the baseline. No slam
dunks.
</P>
<P>
   The only Dream player in the house was the locked-out-of-the-NBA
wealthy alumnus relaxing in a front-row seat under the north
basket.
</P>
<P>
   And rather than wearing a red-and-white game uniform, the only
Cougar who could really glide was the head coach in the natty
charcoal pinstriped suit standing in front of the bench.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind any of that. The details can come later.
</P>
<P>
   On the night the Clyde Drexler Era debuted at the University of
Houston, only one thing mattered: The feeling was back.
</P>
<P>
   It was like walking through the door at Hofheinz Pavilion and
stepping into a time machine. Suddenly, it was the '80s again.
</P>
<P>
   You could practically hear the music of Michael Jackson, Cyndi
Lauper and Madonna echoing inside your head. Everybody wore a
Rolex, the price of oil was climbing toward $30 a barrel, the
mechanical bull was bucking at Gilley's, and the most scandalous
thing happening in the White House was a septuagenarian president
who occasionally took a nap in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   And the Coogs won a basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   This is, of course, the way it always used to be and the way the
enthusiastic sellout crowd of 8,452 believes it can become again as
Drexler's mere presence and the hustling effort of a young Cougars
team sorted through the ashes of old memories and took a tentative
first step toward relighting the flame Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is euphoria,'' said Drexler as he stood amid a throng of
students and supporters who rushed onto the floor as if the
Cougars' 71-69 victory over Texas had earned them an invitation to
the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive them their overindulgence. When you have been down for
so long and are coming off a dismal 9-20 season, even the first
baby step of progress looks like The Great Wallenda doing a
somersault on the high wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team worked hard and prepared a long time to be ready for
this game and for this night,'' Drexler said. ``We had enough drive
and continued to work hard even when things got tight and they came
back on us at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a young team, and we had to call some timeouts down
the stretch to get them settled down and back into a rhythm that
would keep them into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars almost blew several leads of a dozen points. They
watched Texas snipe away from the outside and slowly climb back.
They saw Ivan Wagner toss in a 3-point prayer from deep in the left
corner that closed the gap to 70-69 with 44 seconds to go. And they
saw a freshman, Jake Ballis, walk with the ball after receiving an
inbounds pass and turn the ball back over to the Longhorns for a
final shot.
</P>
<P>
   William Clay took a jumper for Texas, then Kris Clack tried a
follow from the baseline and Chris Mihm put up a desperate
six-footer that never reached the rim as the Cougars fought and
scrapped and hustled to play those final frenetic seconds of
defense.
</P>
<P>
   It turned into a rugby scrum with William Stringfellow and Kenny
Younger on the floor, and the Cougars managed to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will get better,'' said Clyde's former teammate Hakeem
Olajuwon. ``They are all young players who are still learning about
the game and how to play it. But what I like watching is the way
they are playing so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   That was what mattered to the crowd even more than the 25 points
from Gee Gervin, the 17 points by Chad Hendrick or the 15 points by
Younger.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers are numbers, and there will be higher ones and lower
ones as this season progresses. There will be weeks and months and
years ahead to find out if the former NBA All-Star can make the
successful transition to head coach with no experience. There will
be plenty of time to see if he can manage all the tight situations
when the stakes are higher.
</P>
<P>
   There will be tougher games and bigger hurdles to clear than
this opener against Rick Barnes' first Texas team that is fortunate
to have enough warm bodies to fill the uniforms. The three guys
playing H-O-R-S-E on that Nike commercial with Samuel L. Jackson
could have shot better than the Longhorns. Texas shot 24 percent in
the first half and 32 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
   But what mattered wasn't the level of competition, but the fact
that for the first time in a long time, the Cougars were competing.
Hustling, diving, working. Even if they never did dunk the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure had a great time tonight,'' the new head coach said.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling was back.

LONG BEACH STATE WINS IN OT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a good while Tuesday night at Loyola Marymount's Gersten
Pavilion, Long Beach State's men's basketball team appeared headed
for a second successive loss to start the new season. That wouldn't
have looked good at all, especially since that 0-2 would have come
against two teams that were a combined 19-36 last season.
</P>
<P>
   But the 49ers rallied from a 14-point deficit, catching LMU at
the end of regulation on D'Cean Bryant's 3-pointer, then winning in
overtime, 98-92.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most points a Wayne Morgan-coached 49er team has ever
scored, and Long Beach needed just about every one of them to gain
the school's 700th basketball victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we'd lost,'' Morgan said, ``it would have been awfully
tough ... guys would be asking themselves, `can we win?' At least
we know we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it wasn't until roughly the midway point of the second
half that the 49ers appeared to get the idea they could, indeed,
win. After a sloppy first half, in which Loyola Marymount (0-1)
opened a 37-29 lead at intermission, the 49ers fell deeper in
trouble, trailing by 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wasn't worried that much, because it was still
early,'' Morgan said, noting the time: 18:25 still to go. ``They
were shooting a lot of 3s, and if they aren't hitting them, it
gives you a chance to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile, but the 49ers crept back, getting to within five
a couple of times, then three, then two ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept fighting,'' Bryant said afterward. ``We'd get a 3,
they'd get a 3 ... and we were making our free throws. That was the
big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   LMU still led by three with 10.5 seconds remaining, when the
Lions' Willie Allen missed a free throw, and Bryant tied up Allen
for the rebound, the ball going to the 49ers on the alternate
possession.
</P>
<P>
   So, who to shoot the 3?
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they'd be looking for Rock (Lloyd) or Mate (Milisa) to
take the 3,'' Bryant said, ``so I kind of lagged back, hoping Ron
(Johnson, the 49ers' freshman guard) would see me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did, and Bryant launched a long 3-pointer (Morgan said
it was a 30-footer) and he connected, dramatically tying the score,
80-80, to force the overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had more work to do,'' Bryant said afterward, ``and
with Tommie (Davis) and Antrone (Lee) fouled out, we all knew we
had to step it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who hadn't had a lead since the first two minutes of
the game, never trailed in the overtime, out-scoring LMU, 18-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got better as the game went along,'' said Morgan,
explaining that in the raggedy first half ``we just didn't run our
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers shot only 36 percent in the first half but 47 in the
second and 43 for the game. Lloyd led with 25 points, including
seven free throws. Bryant, who was 4-for-6 shooting 3-pointers, and
Milisa each had 21.
</P>
<P>
   LMU's little Haywood Eaddy led everybody with 27 points, but he
was hounded all evening by Davis or at least until he fouled out
who restricted the 5-4 guard to just five points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers out-rebounded LMU, 46-38, with Richie Smalls grabbing
11. But they also turned the ball over 24 times in all.
</P>
<P>
   After missing 14 free throws in their season-opening 83-65 loss
to Cal State Northridge, the 49ers this time missed only seven of
28.
</P>
<P>
   And, the 49ers already have as many road wins as they did all
last season: one.

this their headquarters for duck hunting or sailing, and the old
aristocratic families, fewer still, some of whom have lived in
their fine old houses since Colonial times. But the truck farms,
orchards, marshes and coastal waters of this isolated domain have
always provided the raw materials for a rich and singular regional
cuisine, known far and wide for dishes based on oysters and crabs
and game birds. By R.W. Apple Jr. With recipes.

   PUMPKIN (Undated) _ The pumpkin, during its brief season, lives,
literally, for the holidays. Most people know it as pie _ flaky
pastry with a dark, miraculously heavy filling of spices, cream,
pumpkin and sugar. Traditional, yes. But the pumpkin has much more
to offer. The pumpkin is, next to the potato, the most malleable
and perhaps the most dynamic of autumn foods. By Amanda Hesser.

   TURKEY-STUFFING (New York) _ The great American gift for
invention meets its match in the turkey, the great American bird.
The turkey itself is not the problem, it's the yawning chasm
within, a black hole in the culinary universe that somehow manages
to absorb and deaden anything that wanders near its force-field,
making ``stuffing'' a synonym for ``dry, volumetric bore, often
tricked out with oysters in a hopeless search for personality.'' An
unlikely solution to the stuffing crisis has emerged in an unlikely
place _ the cafe at Jean Georges, where a savory, steaming square
of bread pudding rounds out a dish of baked poussin and roasted
carrots. By William Grimes. With recipe.

   WINE-TALK (Undated) _ The Dean of Westminster Cathedral in
London wants to eliminate the Christmas tree. It's a pagan symbol,
he says, and shouldn't be part of the holiday. I have something
equally subversive in mind: getting rid of the Thanksgiving turkey.
Yes, that sacred symbol of holiday plentitude and culinary
ineptitude. It's time for it to go. Trouble is, I forget about this
annual outrage until a day or two before it's on us once again,
when it's too late to drum up any support. So since I have to have
turkey, I'd like to have good wine with it. But which one? By Frank
Prial.

DANGER GROWS FROM BIOLOGICAL, CHEMICAL ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    PALO ALTO, Calif. _ As U.N. inspectors returned to Iraq Tuesday
to resume their search for biological and chemical weapons,
American scientists and intelligence experts weighed the threat
posed by the continued global spread of such weapons of mass
destruction.
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 100 specialists from the Central Intelligence Agency,
the departments of State and Justice and the nation's leading
research universities gathered at Stanford University's Hoover
Institution this week to discuss such problems as how to detect new
versions of biological and chemical weapons, how to counter attacks
by these weapons, and how to protect the public against them.
</P>
<P>
   In a world largely freed from the nuclear brinkmanship of the
Cold War, the threat of chemical warfare and biological agents
capable of spawning deadly epidemics now dominates the concerns of
arms controllers.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence is growing that at least a dozen nations _ including
Iraq, Iran, Syria, Libya, Sudan and North Korea _ are capable of
producing chemical and biological arsenals, according to Michael
Moodie of the Chemical and Biological Arms Control Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, networks of international terrorist groups _ and
even small bands of right-wing revolutionaries within the United
States _ are determined to use chemical and biological weapons to
attain their goals, other experts said.
</P>
<P>
   John Gannon, chairman of the National Intelligence Council,
warned that the threat of spreading biological and chemical weapons
``is real and growing.'' Deadly incidents, he noted, are
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of perpetrators is increasing, particularly
nonstate actors,'' he said. ``Agents of increasing lethality are
being developed that have the potential to cause massive
casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   New weapons are under development everywhere, Gannon warned.
``To add to the threat,'' he said, ''there is a widening array of
new agents and new delivery systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapid advances in biotechnology will yield new toxins or live
agents, such as rare animal viruses, that will require new
detection methods and vaccines as well as other preventive
measures.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the problem known as ``dual use'' _ legitimate
disease-fighting drugs that can be diverted to cause the very
diseases that they are designed to fight, or pesticides that can
kill humans when ``weaponized'' inside explosive warheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overlap between BW (biological weapons) agents and
vaccines and between nerve agents and pesticides is, as you know,
considerable,'' Gannon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battlefield of the future could be Main Street, USA,'' he
added. ``Our enemies _ be they states launching BCW-tipped missiles
or terrorists concealing small vials of virus _ can bring the BCW
(biological and chemical weapons) threat to our own shores and
heartland. Warning time may be all but eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   Of great concern, said John Lauder, director of the CIA's
Non-Proliferation Center, are the ambiguities that plague
intelligence agents hunting for evidence of illicit weapons in more
than a dozen rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turn of a single valve makes a difference, whether it's a
fertilizer plant or a chemical weapons plant,'' he said. ``And a
plant making vaccines can become a biowarfare plant.''
</P>
<P>
   It's already possible for genetic engineers to combine varying
strains of lethal bacteria or viruses that would defeat any
vaccines designed against only a single strain, said Steven M.
Block, a molecular biologist and physicist from Princeton
University.
</P>
<P>
   In view of the growing threat, said Dr. Lucy Shapiro, a Stanford
developmental biologist, scientists in government agencies,
universities and the pharmaceutical industry must work together
quickly to develop new antibiotics, new vaccines and new sensors
that can be deployed to quickly detect new pathogens that might be
used by terrorists or attacking nations.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Shapiro said, nations seeking a world free of
biological and chemical threats need a far more effective worldwide
network of medical experts tracking unexplained outbreaks of new
diseases. ``If something happens in Kenya today,'' she noted, ``it
will be in Chicago tomorrow.''

 &HT;    Flashes of firepower can't rescue Bengals from awful season
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When it comes to X's and O's, the Cincinnati
offense is a virtual mirror image of the offense used by Denver,
Green Bay, Minnesota and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to W's and L's, the Bengals are in a class by
themselves, a class woefully short of star pupils.
</P>
<P>
   While the leading proponents of the West Coast offense are
gearing up for the playoffs, Cincinnati, 2-8 heading into Sunday's
home game with Baltimore, is gearing down for an eighth straight
losing season.
</P>
<P>
   A rebuilding defense that starts three rookies was expected to
struggle, but the offense has been a year-long disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals are averaging 16.7 points a game and have scored 14
points or less six times, including last Sunday's 24-3 loss at
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Bruce Coslet and offensive coordinator Ken Anderson
have been twin lightning rods for criticism, but Coslet defended
the offensive philosophy and play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We examine what we're doing every week and the plays are there
to be made,'' Coslet said. ``There is no continuity on offense,
there is no rhythm to it. It's hunt and peck, it's all over the
lot. It's not in synch. The plays are there to be made, but for
whatever reason, we're not making the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals will show flashes of firepower, but the flash is
soon darkened by inevitable errors of commission and omission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (potentially successful) plays are there,'' Coslet said.
``We have guys (receivers) open, we have big holes (for backs to
run through), then we have guys breaking down _ missing blocks,
dropping passes, failing to run precise routes and quarterbacks
making some wrong decisions. That's what's plaguing us.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet said he's not trying to put square pegs into round holes,
that the Bengals have the personnel to make the offense work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing the same things that Minnesota, Denver and San
Francisco are doing. If we were doing things differently than
they're doing because I was hard-headed and stubborn, then we'd
have a problem. But we're doing the same things they are, we're
just not executing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those teams do the same things over and over because they're
good at it. We're not good at it. We've been good at in in the past
and we'll be good at it in the future, but we're not good at it
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati's play-calling has been criticized and Coslet
understands the frustration. ``It's all in the eye of the beholder
and it's all because we're losing. And I can accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet said the talent disparity between the Bengals and their
opponents also has an impact on the play-calling.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are (defensive) players you have to account for on every
play,'' Coslet said. ``There were certain things we just couldn't
do against Minnesota because of (All-Pro lineman) John Randle.
There are certain things we won't be able to do against Baltimore
because of (pass-rushing specialist) Michael McCrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just calling these plays out of thin air. It's
tendencies, it's opponents' personnel, it's what we can do. There's
a lot more to it than calling the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end John Copeland, out since rupturing the Achilles'
tendon in his left leg on April 15, was added to the active roster
on Tuesday and is expected to get some playing time against
Baltimore. To make room for Copeland, the Bengals cut offensive
lineman Brock Guttierrez for the second time.

 &HT;    WeeeeeeEEEEEE! `Today' show host up for 4 a.m. siren
 &HT;    By Loretta Grantham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It stinks when you oversleep and have to
suck up to the boss. But it would really stink if you had to grovel
in front of the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
   Behold the Bose Wave clock radio.
</P>
<P>
   The $349 machine, shaped like a cheese wedge, supposedly has
symphonic oomph. At THAT price, it should come with a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wake up right before it goes off,'' says Matt Lauer,
who leaps from the sack at 4 a.m. so that he can arrive at NBC
about an hour later to gear up for Today with co-host Katie Couric.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts out really soft _ weeeeeee _ then gets louder and
louder and louder _ weeeeeEEEEEEEEEEE.''
</P>
<P>
   Folks glance over curiously (he's imitating an alarm clock,
OK?!) as Lauer and I chat at Atlantis Country Club, where he and
Bryant Gumbel, who split Today last year, are playing in the Jay
Robert Lauer Golf Tournament to benefit Hospice of Palm Beach
County. Hospice workers cared for Matt's dad, who died of lung
cancer at his PGA National home in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lauer, 40, is as gracious as they come. A giddy senior sporting
a golf visor and an ``I LUV MATT'' T-shirt jogs up, and he puts his
arm around her for a photo. He still isn't used to gushing females,
and besides, he just married J. Crew model Annette Roque, 32, last
month.
</P>
<P>
   No, the clock is NEVER on her side of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly wed to a TV producer, Lauer says he didn't collapse
with passion the first time he saw Roque, whom he met on a blind
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those slow-developing things,'' recalls Lauer, a
New York native who says he's ready for kids. ``I don't think I
kissed her for two months.'' (A 7-handicapper and a gentleman!)
</P>
<P>
   What's his secret to wooing so many women?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's because we're on so early, and people are in
their underwear or pajamas, and they're just comfortable with us.
We're family.''
</P>
<P>
   And you're free to drop by anytime for a Pop-Tart, dear. I have
some fluffy slippers just for you.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: operation in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of ``Uncle Sam''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The term is believed to date to the era of the War of 1812.
According to the story, Samuel Wilson, a meat packer in Troy, N.Y.,
was jokingly referred to by his employees as ``Uncle Sam,''
apparently because his company stamped the letters U.S. on food
containers intended for the armed services. The first picture of
``Uncle Sam'' as we know him today appeared in Harper's magazine in
1869. It looked forward to the first of the America's Cup races
between Britain and the United States, which took place the
following year. The cartoon showed Uncle Sam _ top hat, striped
trousers and all _ holding the America's Cup aloft and smiling
confidently while the British symbol, John Bull, glowers menacingly
from across the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, I read that Pope John Paul II would visit
St. Louis in January. I haven't seen anything since then. Do you
have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pope will be in St. Louis Jan. 26-27, following a visit
to Mexico City, Bill Ryan of the U.S. Catholic Conference said.
Plans call for the pope to participate in a prayer service at a
youth rally Jan. 26 in Kiel Center. The next morning, he will
celebrate Mass at the Trans World Dome, and later that day will
take part in a prayer service at the Cathedral Basilica of St.
Louis. After that, he'll fly back to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Joe DiMaggio is reported to be seriously ill and in the
hospital. Where can fans send get-well cards?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's at Memorial Regional Hospital, 3501 Johnson St.,
Hollywood, FL 33021. The New York Yankees great, 83, was first
hospitalized Oct. 12 and has been fighting since then to recover
from pneumonia and a lung infection. His condition was described at
first as life-threatening, but then made a brief recovery before
suffering another setback. Earlier this month, Morris Engelberg,
DiMaggio's lawyer and friend, said the Hall of Famer would be in
intensive care for six to eight weeks, then would need
rehabilitation to get over the lengthy hospitalization. DiMaggio's
84th birthday will be Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that an Indiana man, George Bauer,
is suing Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. over tactics the company uses to
collect credit-card debts from bankrupt customers. I'm in that same
situation. The article mentions that Bauer and his attorneys are
asking that the suit become a class-action case. How can I contact
the attorneys involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: The lead lawyer is Daniel Edelman of Edelman and Combs, 135
S. LaSalle St., Suite 2040, Chicago, IL 60603 (312-739-4200).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jesse Ventura, who ran for governor of Minnesota as a Reform
Party candidate, got lots of publicity after his recent victory. Is
he the first Reform Party candidate ever to win an election?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ventura isn't the first Reform candidate ever to win an
election, but he's the party's first candidate to win a statewide
election, said party chairman Russell Verney in Dallas. The first
Reform candidate to win an election was David Bieler, who in 1997
ran for a county supervisor position in Stafford County, Va. There
have been other municipal and county officials who ran in
nonpartisan races but are aligned with the Reform Party, Verney
said. Reform candidates running in statewide elections across the
United States received more than 2 million votes in the Nov. 3
election, he added. The Reform Party's Mae Schunk was elected
Minnesota's lieutenant governor, by the way, to serve with Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened in connection with Pierre Salinger's
allegation that the Navy was involved in the crash of TWA 800? I
never heard about any final resolution.
</P>
<P>
   A: The whole matter appears to have been dropped after Ian
Goddard, the man who used the Internet to accuse the Navy of
shooting TWA 800 down in July 1996, told CNN that his actions were
``reckless and a mistake.'' Goddard had used the Internet to
release a report, cowritten by Salinger and Mike Sommer, identified
as a former investigative reporter and ABC news executive, claiming
the government was covering up the fact that a Navy missile brought
the plane down. As news reports said at the time, the report
contained few documented facts and was packed with unattributed
quotes, technical jargon and rambling speculation. Salinger never
actually admitted that he was wrong, but he suddenly fell silent
about the claim. He did admit to calling FBI boss James Kallstrom
in October 1996 to say he no longer was investigating the crash.
The FBI confirmed Salinger's call to Kallstrom, but didn't provide
any details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV program about unsanitary conditions at hotels and motels
reminded me that many people died after attending a convention some
years ago at a Philadelphia hotel. Can you refresh my memory about
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in July 1976 when an epidemic struck 221 people
attending an American Legion convention at Philadelphia's Bellevue
Stratford Hotel. The mysterious illness came to be known as
Legionnaires' disease. In 1977, scientists discovered the cause of
the pneumonia, a bacterium they named Legionella pneumophila.
Research showed that it commonly occurs in water supplies, and in
the case of the hotel was believed to have occurred when victims
breathed contaminated air coming through the air-conditioning
system. It's now known that the disease can be treated with such
antibiotics as erythromycin and rifampin. In the Philadelphia
outbreak, 34 of those stricken with the disease died.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former President George Bush and wife Barbara have two sons,
George, governor of Texas, and Jeb, governor-elect of Florida. Do
they have any other children? What do they do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bushes had four sons and two daughters. George W. was
born in 1946. Robin, born in 1949, died of leukemia in 1953. John
(Jeb) was born in 1953. Other than George W. and Jeb, none of the
others has shown an interest in politics, and basically they stay
out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Neil, born in 1955, was embroiled in controversy for a time when
he was a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association in Colorado, which failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an
estimated $1 billion. Although he never was charged with criminal
wrongdoing, he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil
lawsuit lodged two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. Since moving to Houston in 1992, he has established a new
career in international business with Interlink Management Corp.,
consulting on behalf of U.S. and foreign companies working mostly
on overseas ventures. He keeps what a friend called ``a very low
profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin, born in 1956, maintains an even lower profile. Reports
published earlier said he lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington,
is a partner in an investment advisory firm and a franchisee in a
video rental business.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy, born in 1959, was in the news most recently in 1992
when she married Bobby Koch, formerly a top aide to House
Democratic leader Richard Gephardt. It was her second marriage. At
last report, she was working in fund-raising at the National
Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard something around Veterans Day about fund-raising
efforts for the construction of a World War II memorial in
Washington. Do you have any information about it? How can I
contribute?
</P>
<P>
   A: Former Sen. Bob Dole announced a drive in March 1997 to raise
$100 million to build the memorial on a 7.4-acre site between the
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Private funds will
pay for most of the construction and upkeep for the memorial, which
sponsors hope to open on Veterans Day 2000.
</P>

   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported that four U.S. presidents have been
assassinated while in office. How many assassination attempts have
been made on U.S. presidents while in office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Attempts were made against the lives of Presidents Andrew
Jackson (Jan. 30, 1835); Harry Truman (Nov. 1, 1950); Gerald Ford
(twice: Sept. 5, 1975, and Sept. 22, 1975;) and Ronald Reagan
(March 30, 1981). Attempts also were made against Abraham Lincoln
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt when they were presidents-elect, and
against former President Theodore Roosevelt three years after he
left office, when he was campaigning for election again.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Aug. 28, 1965, that Congress enacted a law
making it a federal crime to kill, kidnap or assault the president,
vice president, or president-elect, or to threaten these officials
with bodily harm or death. Before then, it was a state matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between a stepbrother and a half
brother?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Step'' is the combining form related through the remarriage
of a parent. Your stepbrother, then, is the son of your stepmother
or stepfather by his or her former marriage. A half brother is a
brother through one parent only. In other words, a half brother is
a male offspring having only one parent in common with another
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm aware of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but I'm
told that a list has been made of the Seven Wonders of the Modern
World. If that's so, what are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to the septet chosen by the American
Society of Civil Engineers in conjunction with Popular Mechanics
magazine. Here's the group's list of modern wonders, released in
March 1996: the 5-mile-wide, $18 billion Itaipu Dam on the Parana
River on the Brazil-Paraguay border; Toronto's 1,815-foot CN Tower,
the world's tallest free-standing structure; the 51-mile-long
Panama Canal; San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge; the 31-mile-long
Channel Tunnel, between England and France; the Netherlands North
Sea Protection Works, a network of dams, sluices, canals and dikes
built to protect southwest Holland from flooding on the delta of
the Meuse and Rhine rivers; and the 1,248-foot Empire State
Building, for four decades the tallest building in the United
States.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: operation in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of ``Uncle Sam''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The term is believed to date to the era of the War of 1812.
According to the story, Samuel Wilson, a meat packer in Troy, N.Y.,
was jokingly referred to by his employees as ``Uncle Sam,''
apparently because his company stamped the letters U.S. on food
containers intended for the armed services. The first picture of
``Uncle Sam'' as we know him today appeared in Harper's magazine in
1869. It looked forward to the first of the America's Cup races
between Britain and the United States, which took place the
following year. The cartoon showed Uncle Sam _ top hat, striped
trousers and all _ holding the America's Cup aloft and smiling
confidently while the British symbol, John Bull, glowers menacingly
from across the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, I read that Pope John Paul II would visit
St. Louis in January. I haven't seen anything since then. Do you
have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pope will be in St. Louis Jan. 26-27, following a visit
to Mexico City, Bill Ryan of the U.S. Catholic Conference said.
Plans call for the pope to participate in a prayer service at a
youth rally Jan. 26 in Kiel Center. The next morning, he will
celebrate Mass at the Trans World Dome, and later that day will
take part in a prayer service at the Cathedral Basilica of St.
Louis. After that, he'll fly back to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Joe DiMaggio is reported to be seriously ill and in the
hospital. Where can fans send get-well cards?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's at Memorial Regional Hospital, 3501 Johnson St.,
Hollywood, FL 33021. The New York Yankees great, 83, was first
hospitalized Oct. 12 and has been fighting since then to recover
from pneumonia and a lung infection. His condition was described at
first as life-threatening, but then made a brief recovery before
suffering another setback. Earlier this month, Morris Engelberg,
DiMaggio's lawyer and friend, said the Hall of Famer would be in
intensive care for six to eight weeks, then would need
rehabilitation to get over the lengthy hospitalization. DiMaggio's
84th birthday will be Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that an Indiana man, George Bauer,
is suing Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. over tactics the company uses to
collect credit-card debts from bankrupt customers. I'm in that same
situation. The article mentions that Bauer and his attorneys are
asking that the suit become a class-action case. How can I contact
the attorneys involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: The lead lawyer is Daniel Edelman of Edelman and Combs, 135
S. LaSalle St., Suite 2040, Chicago, IL 60603 (312-739-4200).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jesse Ventura, who ran for governor of Minnesota as a Reform
Party candidate, got lots of publicity after his recent victory. Is
he the first Reform Party candidate ever to win an election?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ventura isn't the first Reform candidate ever to win an
election, but he's the party's first candidate to win a statewide
election, said party chairman Russell Verney in Dallas. The first
Reform candidate to win an election was David Bieler, who in 1997
ran for a county supervisor position in Stafford County, Va. There
have been other municipal and county officials who ran in
nonpartisan races but are aligned with the Reform Party, Verney
said. Reform candidates running in statewide elections across the
United States received more than 2 million votes in the Nov. 3
election, he added. The Reform Party's Mae Schunk was elected
Minnesota's lieutenant governor, by the way, to serve with Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened in connection with Pierre Salinger's
allegation that the Navy was involved in the crash of TWA 800? I
never heard about any final resolution.
</P>
<P>
   A: The whole matter appears to have been dropped after Ian
Goddard, the man who used the Internet to accuse the Navy of
shooting TWA 800 down in July 1996, told CNN that his actions were
``reckless and a mistake.'' Goddard had used the Internet to
release a report, cowritten by Salinger and Mike Sommer, identified
as a former investigative reporter and ABC news executive, claiming
the government was covering up the fact that a Navy missile brought
the plane down. As news reports said at the time, the report
contained few documented facts and was packed with unattributed
quotes, technical jargon and rambling speculation. Salinger never
actually admitted that he was wrong, but he suddenly fell silent
about the claim. He did admit to calling FBI boss James Kallstrom
in October 1996 to say he no longer was investigating the crash.
The FBI confirmed Salinger's call to Kallstrom, but didn't provide
any details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV program about unsanitary conditions at hotels and motels
reminded me that many people died after attending a convention some
years ago at a Philadelphia hotel. Can you refresh my memory about
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in July 1976 when an epidemic struck 221 people
attending an American Legion convention at Philadelphia's Bellevue
Stratford Hotel. The mysterious illness came to be known as
Legionnaires' disease. In 1977, scientists discovered the cause of
the pneumonia, a bacterium they named Legionella pneumophila.
Research showed that it commonly occurs in water supplies, and in
the case of the hotel was believed to have occurred when victims
breathed contaminated air coming through the air-conditioning
system. It's now known that the disease can be treated with such
antibiotics as erythromycin and rifampin. In the Philadelphia
outbreak, 34 of those stricken with the disease died.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former President George Bush and wife Barbara have two sons,
George, governor of Texas, and Jeb, governor-elect of Florida. Do
they have any other children? What do they do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bushes had four sons and two daughters. George W. was
born in 1946. Robin, born in 1949, died of leukemia in 1953. John
(Jeb) was born in 1953. Other than George W. and Jeb, none of the
others has shown an interest in politics, and basically they stay
out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Neil, born in 1955, was embroiled in controversy for a time when
he was a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association in Colorado, which failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an
estimated $1 billion. Although he never was charged with criminal
wrongdoing, he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil
lawsuit lodged two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. Since moving to Houston in 1992, he has established a new
career in international business with Interlink Management Corp.,
consulting on behalf of U.S. and foreign companies working mostly
on overseas ventures. He keeps what a friend called ``a very low
profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin, born in 1956, maintains an even lower profile. Reports
published earlier said he lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington,
is a partner in an investment advisory firm and a franchisee in a
video rental business.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy, born in 1959, was in the news most recently in 1992
when she married Bobby Koch, formerly a top aide to House
Democratic leader Richard Gephardt. It was her second marriage. At
last report, she was working in fund-raising at the National
Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard something around Veterans Day about fund-raising
efforts for the construction of a World War II memorial in
Washington. Do you have any information about it? How can I
contribute?
</P>
<P>
   A: Former Sen. Bob Dole announced a drive in March 1997 to raise
$100 million to build the memorial on a 7.4-acre site between the
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Private funds will
pay for most of the construction and upkeep for the memorial, which
sponsors hope to open on Veterans Day 2000.
</P>

of Remembrance, and how you can contribute, call 1-800-639-4992.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com x
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that Paula Jones has settled her sexual harassment
lawsuit against President Clinton for $850,000, does that mean she
also will keep the $1 million check presented to her by Abe
Hirschfeld? How does her acceptance of Hirschfeld's million-dollar
offer affect the deal with Clinton, considering that Hirschfeld is
under indictment for income tax evasion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although there was a splash of publicity surrounding the
transfer Oct. 31 of what appeared to be a $1 million check to Jones
from Hirschfeld, a New York real estate magnate, there was no
actual transfer of funds. In a separate agreement, not made a part
of the filing of the Clinton agreement to pay $850,000 announced
Nov. 13, Jones' lawyers said she renounced any intention to accept
any money from Hirschfeld. In a letter to Clinton lawyer Robert
Bennett, as reported by The New York Times, Jones' lead negotiator,
William McMillan, wrote: ``I further represent to you that the
money from Mr. Abe Hirschfeld is no longer on the table, and that
there will be no payment from Mr. Hirschfeld as a part of the
settlement with Mr. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was concerned over any appearance that
Hirschfeld, who is under indictment on tax fraud charges, was
bailing out the president, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many (U.S.) World War I veterans are still living?
</P>
<P>
   A: The number is dwindling steadily, but as of mid-November was
about 3,200, according to Tom Thomas of the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are U.S. Supreme Court sessions open to spectators?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The public is welcome to attend when the court is
sitting for oral arguments (the next dates are Nov. 30; and Dec. 1,
2, 7, 8 and 9). However, seating is limited and is on a first-come,
first-served basis. Two lines form outside the building, which is
at First Street and Maryland Avenue NE in Washington, across from
the U.S. Capitol. One line is for those wishing to hear an entire
argument; the other for those who want to hear an argument only
briefly. Even when the court is not sitting for oral arguments,
people can visit the Supreme Court building. It's open from 9 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday (closed on holidays).
</P>
<P>
   When the court is not in session, lectures are conducted in the
first floor courtroom, every hour on the half-hour between 9:30
a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Information: 202-479-3211 (press 4).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few days ago, a newspaper item reported the birthday of
Hedy Lamarr, saying she was 85. She was listed as an actress and an
electronic genius. What makes her an electronic genius?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Austrian-born actress, promoted by Hollywood in the 1940s
as ``the world's most beautiful woman,'' is remembered by most
people of a certain age for her scandalous nude run through the
woods in the 1932 Czech film ``Ecstasy''; her six marriages; and
her American debut in the 1938 movie ``Algiers.'' But electrical
engineers also know her as an inventor who, in 1942, patented a
wireless broadcast technology.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, granted to Lamarr and composer George Antheil,
outlined a procedure for shielding radio-controlled torpedoes from
German signal jamming in World War II. The technique called for the
use of devices similar to player piano rolls installed shipboard
and inside the torpedoes. The idea was simple: use the piano rolls
to skip from one frequency to the next in random order, much as a
piano performance moves from one note to the next. The enemy
doesn't know which frequency will come up next.
</P>
<P>
   This concept came to be called frequency hopping and was turned
over to the military during the war. But it didn't make its debut
until the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when it was used for radio
communications. It led to the modern-day notion of spread spectrum,
or the spreading of a signal among many frequencies to prevent
interference, eavesdropping or jamming.
</P>
<P>
   Lamarr, born in Vienna in 1913 as Hedwig Eva Maria Keisler, at
last report was living in seclusion in Altamonte Springs, Fla. She
was last in the news in April when she sued a Canadian company for
using her name and image on its Internet site without her
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Around 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency unveiled a
sculpture called ``Kryptos'' in the courtyard of its headquarters
in Langley, Va. The sculpture, by James Sanborn, includes a coded
message. Has it ever been decoded? Is it possible to get a copy of
the message?
</P>
<P>
   A: A CIA analyst working on his own time has solved ``the lion's
share'' of it, but it hasn't been completely decoded, CIA spokesman
Mark Mansfield told Q&AMP;A. He said the best way to describe the
sculpture is to say it incorporates natural building materials
native to America and includes an encoded copper screen. When and
if someone completely solves the message, a decision will be made
about releasing it to the public, ``but we're not at that point
yet,'' Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptor Sanborn, of Washington, has created another work with
an encoded message for the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte. ``The Cyrillic Projector,'' an 8-foot-tall bronze
cylinder, was installed in April 1997 in a plaza between two
university buildings. The sculpture is perforated with Cyrillic
letters, the alphabet used in the Russian language. After it was
installed, Sanborn told a reporter that he had given Charlotte ``a
mystery, a puzzle.'' But in that case, he also gave observers a
head start on solving the puzzle by providing a chart to help
decode the message. He described the Charlotte sculpture as ``not
very difficult,'' adding that the work he created for the CIA
headquarters is so hard to break that the CIA ``will never figure
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the excavation of the tombs of the sons of
Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II? I recall that work was to begin about
four years ago. Was anything ever discovered? Is excavation still
going on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Egyptologists are continuing their excavations of the royal
tomb known as KV 5 (the fifth tomb beyond the entrance to KV, the
King's Valley). The latest mapping study and excavation project on
KV 5 began in 1989, because the roadway at the entrance to the
valley was being widened and experts didn't want any damage to
occur to the tomb in its path.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed account of the project is in the September issue of
National Geographic. It reports that before 1989, no one had
ventured inside KV 5 since 1825. The tomb has turned out to be the
largest ever found in the Valley of the Kings, according to
National Geographic. The burial place of many of the sons of Ramses
II, it contains at least 110 chambers, with many artifacts and
hieroglyphics promising to captivate excavation officials for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the Wal-Mart heiress who was in the news
some months ago on a drunk-driving charge?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alice Walton, 49, was cited Jan. 27 in Arkansas with DWI
(driving while intoxicated) and other traffic violations after her
Toyota 4-Runner careened off a road and destroyed a gas meter and
telephone box. When she was taken to a hospital for treatment of a
broken nose, she refused a blood alcohol test. One of four children
of the late Sam Walton and his wife, Helen, and owner of the
investment banking firm Llama Co., she reportedly became
belligerent, telling one Springdale, Ark., officer: ``You know who
I am, don't you? You know my last name?''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than accepting a conventional plea offer to settle the
case, their heiress chose to fight the charges in court, and in May
she was convicted on four counts: driving while intoxicated,
violation of Arkansas' implied consent law, driving without a seat
belt, and failing to maintain proper control of her vehicle.
Although she faced as much as a year in jail and $1,025 in fines,
she got off easier when she was sentenced June 17 in Springdale
Municipal Court: $350 fine, $300 court costs, and 24 hours of
public service. ``She paid up and completed her public service, so
everything's taken care of,'' court spokeswoman Betty Lee told Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Walton stepped down as chief executive of Llama Co.
She apparently has moved her legal residence to Texas, which would
enable her to shield her $11 billion in net worth from state income
taxes in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When is Take Our Daughters to Work day scheduled for 1999?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be April 22. Take Our Daughters to Work day is always
the fourth Thursday each April, said Kelly Parisi of the Ms.
Foundation for Women in New York, the organization that founded the
special day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently mentioned that Toronto's CN Tower is the world's
tallest free-standing structure. Is there a taller structure that
is not free-standing?
</P>
<P>
   A: CN Tower rises to 1,815 feet and 5 inches, according to The
Guinness Book of World Records (1998). It's not a mast with guy
wires to steady or support it, in other words. The world's tallest
structure is a stayed television transmitting tower between Fargo
and Blanchard in North Dakota. Built for KTHI-TV, it is 2,063 feet
tall. Before it fell during renovation work in 1991, the guyed
Warszawa Radio mast in Konstantynow, Poland, held the record of
tallest-ever structure in the world at 2,120 feet tall. It was
first put into operation in 1974.

 &HT;    Where do children find their courage?
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There's something about the courage of children.
Something bold, unapologetic and unself-conscious about it.
</P>
<P>
   The day I met Belynda Denney, then 7, she did something no adult
I know would have the guts to do. She handed Hillary Clinton a
scrawled ``I love you'' note and invited herself to the White
House, just like that.
</P>
<P>
   And just like that, The first lady said, ``Come on down.'' Mrs.
Clinton met Belynda, a child ambassador for Children's Medical
Center, while making a campaign stop at the hospital in September
1996. A month later, The first lady gave Belynda, a fourth-grader
at Timberlane Elementary School in Northridge, Ohio, a private tour
of the White House. Belynda made fast friends with Socks the cat,
sat behind the president's desk, and pronounced the White House
``cool.'' Her parents, Bob and Sue, were scared to death by their
brush with greatness; Belynda was unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton thought it was funny that a bald 7-year-old would
just speak her mind and say what she wanted. But that's Belynda,''
said Vicki Giambrone, vice president of marketing and development
for Children's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Belynda died Monday night, just a week shy of her 10th birthday.
She was at home, surrounded by everyone she loved _ and had
commanded to her bedside. She chose the belongings she wanted in
her casket with her: her Tweetie blanket, her teddy bear, her
favorite clothes. Even in her last days, she maintained her
trademark joie de vivre, not to mention her ability to give orders.
</P>
<P>
   During her last hospital visit, her oncologist tried to explain
the results to her parents in the hallway. ``You come in here and
you talk in front of me,'' Belynda said. ``What are my options?''
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was dying Monday, she told us 'I feel fine','' said
her father, Bob. ``There was never a bad day for her. She had a
wonderful time. In her mind she wasn't different; she just had this
pesty little thing called cancer that made her take a few trips to
the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not surprising Belynda wasn't intimidated by the
White House. What were a few famous folks compared with what she
had been up against? At the age of 6, she was diagnosed with Ewing
sarcoma, a form of bone cancer. At 7 _ the dawning of the age of
self-consciousness _ she became one of two 1996-1997 ambassadors
for Children's Medical Center. She would pose for photos and greet
the public without a trace of embarrassment. ``Belynda wanted to be
the way she was, and she didn't have a problem showing her bald
head,'' Giambrone said.
</P>
<P>
   A little boy came up to her on the playground once, her father
recalled, and asked, ``Are you a girl or a boy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A girl,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why don't you have hair?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a gene in my body called cancer, and it makes my hair
fall out,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, OK,'' the boy said, and went back to his play.
</P>
<P>
   She was a child who showed more courage in nine years than most
of us muster in a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belynda wanted to be a teacher, and she fulfilled that dream
because she taught us all so many things,'' Giambrone said. ``She
taught me to speak your mind, to always be looking for the miracles
in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it wasn't only her courage in the face of cancer that struck
me when I met her. It was her joy in the face of life.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to meet the first lady. She wanted to go to the White
House. She giggled. She hugged strangers liberally.
</P>
<P>
   What makes children so curious, so full of life, in the face of
things so frightening.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about that a few weeks ago when 5-year-old Emma
Russell came back to my husband's church for the first time in
seven months. Her hair cropped fashionably short, Emma wore a
black-and-white two-piece vest suit with a panache that put all of
us grown-up women to shame. ``She likes to wear big girl clothes _
nothing frilly,'' explains her mother, Kathleen Russell.
</P>
<P>
   Emma runs around with the other kids at the coffee hour at Grace
United Methodist Church. She comes back for seconds on cookies. She
is, in other words, a full-fledged kid.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, Emma was diagnosed with a rare, cancerous
kidney tumor and given less than a 50 percent chance to live.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has endured radiation treatments, intermittent
fevers, platelet and blood transfusions, and nearly seven months of
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   She never stopped jumping on the bed. She never stopped begging
to play outside. She cracked up the hospital staff _ and the doctor
himself _ by mimicking her oncologist's accent. The only time she
felt really put out was when she found out she couldn't get her
kidney back. She peppered her father, Steve, with a lot of
questions about that.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she didn't understand what was happening to her. While
making crafts during chemotherapy once, she made her mother a
beaded bracelet. As she placed it on her mother's wrist she said,
``I want you to wear this to remember me in case I die.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma's resilience gave her parents a resilience they never knew
they had. They were rewarded recently with good news: a battery of
tests that all came back clean. If Emma stays cancer-free for two
years, she will be considered cured.
</P>
<P>
   Now they face medical bills exceeding $100,000. Kathleen and
Steve Russell are ``overwhelmed'' _ not by their debts, but by the
generosity of co-workers and friends who have rallied to help. This
Saturday, a garage sale _ children's clothes, books and toys _ will
be held from 8 a.m. to 3:30 in the gym at Grace United Methodist
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Emma's parents never gave up because Emma never gave up.
</P>
<P>
   Belynda Denney never did either. Her last words to her
oncologist, as she was leaving Children's Medical Center for the
last time: ``I'm going to hold out for that miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something about the courage of children.

 &HT;    Perjury becomes passe
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Since Republicans know they will not impeach
President Clinton, they should drop the pretense and join Democrats
in attacking independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   It's silly for Republicans to hold impeachment hearings on the
Democratic president when they are in the middle of punishing
themselves for making a national issue of Clinton's lies and
cover-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has an affair with a White House intern, lies about it
to everybody on earth, both face to face and under oath, and
Republicans want to throw only their leaders out of office. Odd.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's approval ratings and the Nov. 3 mid-term elections
prove to Republicans that Americans don't care how many women
Clinton propositions, gropes or has affairs with.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Republicans believe voters will punish them if
they attempt to punish Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It's an Alice in Wonderland world when the Democratic president
can engage in condemnable immoral behavior, commit both civil and
criminal perjury and leave Republicans shaking in their boots.
</P>
<P>
   All the Republicans want to do now is get rid of their
impeachment tar baby as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A vote to censure Clinton would have no meaning because it would
carry no consequences. Besides, a censure might cause a voter
backlash, which is what Republicans fear most.
</P>
<P>
   Since that's how Republicans think, the only safe course for
them during the ill-fated impeachment hearings is to join Democrats
in blaming Ken Starr for embarrassing Clinton and the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans should call for Starr's prosecution and ask for
Clinton's forgiveness for the trouble caused by this overly moral,
straight-arrow special prosecutor so out of touch with prevailing
American values.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment hearings behind them and Starr thrown so
far back into federal prison that jailers have to shoot biscuits to
him, Republicans could return to whatever they were doing before
Starr came along.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Republicans need to join with Clinton and the
Democrats in a bipartisan effort to ensure that no American suffers
the legal harassment endured by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step, Clinton needs to pardon Dr. Barbara Battalino,
the former Veterans Affairs psychiatrist who lost her medical
license after she was convicted of perjury for lying about having
sex with a veteran patient.
</P>
<P>
   She lied to keep an embarrassing sexual relationship private.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must order the military to pin the wings back on Lt.
Kelly Flinn, who was kicked out of the Air Force for lying about a
sexual affair.
</P>
<P>
   While he's at it, Clinton should order the military to eliminate
adultery as an offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should withhold federal aid from states that list
adultery as a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Dr. Battalino, Clinton needs to pardon all 115 convicts
now serving sentences for perjury in federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Tuesday New York Times story by William
Glaberson, in California alone last year, there were 4,318 felony
perjury cases. Thousands of Americans are prosecuted annually for
lying under oath, in both civil and criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida postal supervisor, according to Glaberson, now is in
prison for denying in a civil deposition that she had a sexual
relationship with a subordinate. Sound familiar? She needs an
immediate pardon.
</P>
<P>
   By working with Democrats to pardon convicted perjurers and
eliminate perjury and adultery laws, Republicans can move safely
back into the mainstream and join Clinton in going about the
nation's important business.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;(at)ajc.com x
</P>
<P>
   Q: Now that Paula Jones has settled her sexual harassment
lawsuit against President Clinton for $850,000, does that mean she
also will keep the $1 million check presented to her by Abe
Hirschfeld? How does her acceptance of Hirschfeld's million-dollar
offer affect the deal with Clinton, considering that Hirschfeld is
under indictment for income tax evasion?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although there was a splash of publicity surrounding the
transfer Oct. 31 of what appeared to be a $1 million check to Jones
from Hirschfeld, a New York real estate magnate, there was no
actual transfer of funds. In a separate agreement, not made a part
of the filing of the Clinton agreement to pay $850,000 announced
Nov. 13, Jones' lawyers said she renounced any intention to accept
any money from Hirschfeld. In a letter to Clinton lawyer Robert
Bennett, as reported by The New York Times, Jones' lead negotiator,
William McMillan, wrote: ``I further represent to you that the
money from Mr. Abe Hirschfeld is no longer on the table, and that
there will be no payment from Mr. Hirschfeld as a part of the
settlement with Mr. Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House was concerned over any appearance that
Hirschfeld, who is under indictment on tax fraud charges, was
bailing out the president, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many (U.S.) World War I veterans are still living?
</P>
<P>
   A: The number is dwindling steadily, but as of mid-November was
about 3,200, according to Tom Thomas of the Department of Veterans
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are U.S. Supreme Court sessions open to spectators?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The public is welcome to attend when the court is
sitting for oral arguments (the next dates are Nov. 30; and Dec. 1,
2, 7, 8 and 9). However, seating is limited and is on a first-come,
first-served basis. Two lines form outside the building, which is
at First Street and Maryland Avenue NE in Washington, across from
the U.S. Capitol. One line is for those wishing to hear an entire
argument; the other for those who want to hear an argument only
briefly. Even when the court is not sitting for oral arguments,
people can visit the Supreme Court building. It's open from 9 a.m.
to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday (closed on holidays).
</P>
<P>
   When the court is not in session, lectures are conducted in the
first floor courtroom, every hour on the half-hour between 9:30
a.m. and 3:30 p.m. Information: 202-479-3211 (press 4).
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few days ago, a newspaper item reported the birthday of
Hedy Lamarr, saying she was 85. She was listed as an actress and an
electronic genius. What makes her an electronic genius?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Austrian-born actress, promoted by Hollywood in the 1940s
as ``the world's most beautiful woman,'' is remembered by most
people of a certain age for her scandalous nude run through the
woods in the 1932 Czech film ``Ecstasy''; her six marriages; and
her American debut in the 1938 movie ``Algiers.'' But electrical
engineers also know her as an inventor who, in 1942, patented a
wireless broadcast technology.
</P>
<P>
   The patent, granted to Lamarr and composer George Antheil,
outlined a procedure for shielding radio-controlled torpedoes from
German signal jamming in World War II. The technique called for the
use of devices similar to player piano rolls installed shipboard
and inside the torpedoes. The idea was simple: use the piano rolls
to skip from one frequency to the next in random order, much as a
piano performance moves from one note to the next. The enemy
doesn't know which frequency will come up next.
</P>
<P>
   This concept came to be called frequency hopping and was turned
over to the military during the war. But it didn't make its debut
until the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, when it was used for radio
communications. It led to the modern-day notion of spread spectrum,
or the spreading of a signal among many frequencies to prevent
interference, eavesdropping or jamming.
</P>
<P>
   Lamarr, born in Vienna in 1913 as Hedwig Eva Maria Keisler, at
last report was living in seclusion in Altamonte Springs, Fla. She
was last in the news in April when she sued a Canadian company for
using her name and image on its Internet site without her
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Around 1991, the Central Intelligence Agency unveiled a
sculpture called ``Kryptos'' in the courtyard of its headquarters
in Langley, Va. The sculpture, by James Sanborn, includes a coded
message. Has it ever been decoded? Is it possible to get a copy of
the message?
</P>
<P>
   A: A CIA analyst working on his own time has solved ``the lion's
share'' of it, but it hasn't been completely decoded, CIA spokesman
Mark Mansfield told Q&AMP;A. He said the best way to describe the
sculpture is to say it incorporates natural building materials
native to America and includes an encoded copper screen. When and
if someone completely solves the message, a decision will be made
about releasing it to the public, ``but we're not at that point
yet,'' Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Sculptor Sanborn, of Washington, has created another work with
an encoded message for the University of North Carolina at
Charlotte. ``The Cyrillic Projector,'' an 8-foot-tall bronze
cylinder, was installed in April 1997 in a plaza between two
university buildings. The sculpture is perforated with Cyrillic
letters, the alphabet used in the Russian language. After it was
installed, Sanborn told a reporter that he had given Charlotte ``a
mystery, a puzzle.'' But in that case, he also gave observers a
head start on solving the puzzle by providing a chart to help
decode the message. He described the Charlotte sculpture as ``not
very difficult,'' adding that the work he created for the CIA
headquarters is so hard to break that the CIA ``will never figure
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the excavation of the tombs of the sons of
Egyptian Pharaoh Ramses II? I recall that work was to begin about
four years ago. Was anything ever discovered? Is excavation still
going on?
</P>
<P>
   A: Egyptologists are continuing their excavations of the royal
tomb known as KV 5 (the fifth tomb beyond the entrance to KV, the
King's Valley). The latest mapping study and excavation project on
KV 5 began in 1989, because the roadway at the entrance to the
valley was being widened and experts didn't want any damage to
occur to the tomb in its path.
</P>
<P>
   A detailed account of the project is in the September issue of
National Geographic. It reports that before 1989, no one had
ventured inside KV 5 since 1825. The tomb has turned out to be the
largest ever found in the Valley of the Kings, according to
National Geographic. The burial place of many of the sons of Ramses
II, it contains at least 110 chambers, with many artifacts and
hieroglyphics promising to captivate excavation officials for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happened to the Wal-Mart heiress who was in the news
some months ago on a drunk-driving charge?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alice Walton, 49, was cited Jan. 27 in Arkansas with DWI
(driving while intoxicated) and other traffic violations after her
Toyota 4-Runner careened off a road and destroyed a gas meter and
telephone box. When she was taken to a hospital for treatment of a
broken nose, she refused a blood alcohol test. One of four children
of the late Sam Walton and his wife, Helen, and owner of the
investment banking firm Llama Co., she reportedly became
belligerent, telling one Springdale, Ark., officer: ``You know who
I am, don't you? You know my last name?''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than accepting a conventional plea offer to settle the
case, their heiress chose to fight the charges in court, and in May
she was convicted on four counts: driving while intoxicated,
violation of Arkansas' implied consent law, driving without a seat
belt, and failing to maintain proper control of her vehicle.
Although she faced as much as a year in jail and $1,025 in fines,
she got off easier when she was sentenced June 17 in Springdale
Municipal Court: $350 fine, $300 court costs, and 24 hours of
public service. ``She paid up and completed her public service, so
everything's taken care of,'' court spokeswoman Betty Lee told Q&AMP;A.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Walton stepped down as chief executive of Llama Co.
She apparently has moved her legal residence to Texas, which would
enable her to shield her $11 billion in net worth from state income
taxes in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When is Take Our Daughters to Work day scheduled for 1999?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be April 22. Take Our Daughters to Work day is always
the fourth Thursday each April, said Kelly Parisi of the Ms.
Foundation for Women in New York, the organization that founded the
special day.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently mentioned that Toronto's CN Tower is the world's
tallest free-standing structure. Is there a taller structure that
is not free-standing?
</P>
<P>
   A: CN Tower rises to 1,815 feet and 5 inches, according to The
Guinness Book of World Records (1998). It's not a mast with guy
wires to steady or support it, in other words. The world's tallest
structure is a stayed television transmitting tower between Fargo
and Blanchard in North Dakota. Built for KTHI-TV, it is 2,063 feet
tall. Before it fell during renovation work in 1991, the guyed
Warszawa Radio mast in Konstantynow, Poland, held the record of
tallest-ever structure in the world at 2,120 feet tall. It was
first put into operation in 1974.

<P>
   UNDATED: operation in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of ``Uncle Sam''?
</P>
<P>
   A: The term is believed to date to the era of the War of 1812.
According to the story, Samuel Wilson, a meat packer in Troy, N.Y.,
was jokingly referred to by his employees as ``Uncle Sam,''
apparently because his company stamped the letters U.S. on food
containers intended for the armed services. The first picture of
``Uncle Sam'' as we know him today appeared in Harper's magazine in
1869. It looked forward to the first of the America's Cup races
between Britain and the United States, which took place the
following year. The cartoon showed Uncle Sam _ top hat, striped
trousers and all _ holding the America's Cup aloft and smiling
confidently while the British symbol, John Bull, glowers menacingly
from across the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, I read that Pope John Paul II would visit
St. Louis in January. I haven't seen anything since then. Do you
have any information?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pope will be in St. Louis Jan. 26-27, following a visit
to Mexico City, Bill Ryan of the U.S. Catholic Conference said.
Plans call for the pope to participate in a prayer service at a
youth rally Jan. 26 in Kiel Center. The next morning, he will
celebrate Mass at the Trans World Dome, and later that day will
take part in a prayer service at the Cathedral Basilica of St.
Louis. After that, he'll fly back to Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Joe DiMaggio is reported to be seriously ill and in the
hospital. Where can fans send get-well cards?
</P>
<P>
   A: He's at Memorial Regional Hospital, 3501 Johnson St.,
Hollywood, FL 33021. The New York Yankees great, 83, was first
hospitalized Oct. 12 and has been fighting since then to recover
from pneumonia and a lung infection. His condition was described at
first as life-threatening, but then made a brief recovery before
suffering another setback. Earlier this month, Morris Engelberg,
DiMaggio's lawyer and friend, said the Hall of Famer would be in
intensive care for six to eight weeks, then would need
rehabilitation to get over the lengthy hospitalization. DiMaggio's
84th birthday will be Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article reported that an Indiana man, George Bauer,
is suing Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. over tactics the company uses to
collect credit-card debts from bankrupt customers. I'm in that same
situation. The article mentions that Bauer and his attorneys are
asking that the suit become a class-action case. How can I contact
the attorneys involved?
</P>
<P>
   A: The lead lawyer is Daniel Edelman of Edelman and Combs, 135
S. LaSalle St., Suite 2040, Chicago, IL 60603 (312-739-4200).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jesse Ventura, who ran for governor of Minnesota as a Reform
Party candidate, got lots of publicity after his recent victory. Is
he the first Reform Party candidate ever to win an election?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ventura isn't the first Reform candidate ever to win an
election, but he's the party's first candidate to win a statewide
election, said party chairman Russell Verney in Dallas. The first
Reform candidate to win an election was David Bieler, who in 1997
ran for a county supervisor position in Stafford County, Va. There
have been other municipal and county officials who ran in
nonpartisan races but are aligned with the Reform Party, Verney
said. Reform candidates running in statewide elections across the
United States received more than 2 million votes in the Nov. 3
election, he added. The Reform Party's Mae Schunk was elected
Minnesota's lieutenant governor, by the way, to serve with Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened in connection with Pierre Salinger's
allegation that the Navy was involved in the crash of TWA 800? I
never heard about any final resolution.
</P>
<P>
   A: The whole matter appears to have been dropped after Ian
Goddard, the man who used the Internet to accuse the Navy of
shooting TWA 800 down in July 1996, told CNN that his actions were
``reckless and a mistake.'' Goddard had used the Internet to
release a report, cowritten by Salinger and Mike Sommer, identified
as a former investigative reporter and ABC news executive, claiming
the government was covering up the fact that a Navy missile brought
the plane down. As news reports said at the time, the report
contained few documented facts and was packed with unattributed
quotes, technical jargon and rambling speculation. Salinger never
actually admitted that he was wrong, but he suddenly fell silent
about the claim. He did admit to calling FBI boss James Kallstrom
in October 1996 to say he no longer was investigating the crash.
The FBI confirmed Salinger's call to Kallstrom, but didn't provide
any details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A TV program about unsanitary conditions at hotels and motels
reminded me that many people died after attending a convention some
years ago at a Philadelphia hotel. Can you refresh my memory about
that?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was in July 1976 when an epidemic struck 221 people
attending an American Legion convention at Philadelphia's Bellevue
Stratford Hotel. The mysterious illness came to be known as
Legionnaires' disease. In 1977, scientists discovered the cause of
the pneumonia, a bacterium they named Legionella pneumophila.
Research showed that it commonly occurs in water supplies, and in
the case of the hotel was believed to have occurred when victims
breathed contaminated air coming through the air-conditioning
system. It's now known that the disease can be treated with such
antibiotics as erythromycin and rifampin. In the Philadelphia
outbreak, 34 of those stricken with the disease died.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Former President George Bush and wife Barbara have two sons,
George, governor of Texas, and Jeb, governor-elect of Florida. Do
they have any other children? What do they do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bushes had four sons and two daughters. George W. was
born in 1946. Robin, born in 1949, died of leukemia in 1953. John
(Jeb) was born in 1953. Other than George W. and Jeb, none of the
others has shown an interest in politics, and basically they stay
out of the news.
</P>
<P>
   Neil, born in 1955, was embroiled in controversy for a time when
he was a director of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association in Colorado, which failed in 1988, costing taxpayers an
estimated $1 billion. Although he never was charged with criminal
wrongdoing, he agreed to pay $50,000 in 1992 to settle a civil
lawsuit lodged two years earlier by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. Since moving to Houston in 1992, he has established a new
career in international business with Interlink Management Corp.,
consulting on behalf of U.S. and foreign companies working mostly
on overseas ventures. He keeps what a friend called ``a very low
profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin, born in 1956, maintains an even lower profile. Reports
published earlier said he lives in a Virginia suburb of Washington,
is a partner in an investment advisory firm and a franchisee in a
video rental business.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy, born in 1959, was in the news most recently in 1992
when she married Bobby Koch, formerly a top aide to House
Democratic leader Richard Gephardt. It was her second marriage. At
last report, she was working in fund-raising at the National
Rehabilitation Hospital in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard something around Veterans Day about fund-raising
efforts for the construction of a World War II memorial in
Washington. Do you have any information about it? How can I
contribute?
</P>
<P>
   A: Former Sen. Bob Dole announced a drive in March 1997 to raise
$100 million to build the memorial on a 7.4-acre site between the
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. Private funds will
pay for most of the construction and upkeep for the memorial, which
sponsors hope to open on Veterans Day 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For information about the memorial's site, design and Registry
of Remembrance, and how you can contribute, call 1-800-639-4992.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported that four U.S. presidents have been
assassinated while in office. How many assassination attempts have
been made on U.S. presidents while in office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Attempts were made against the lives of Presidents Andrew
Jackson (Jan. 30, 1835); Harry Truman (Nov. 1, 1950); Gerald Ford
(twice: Sept. 5, 1975, and Sept. 22, 1975;) and Ronald Reagan
(March 30, 1981). Attempts also were made against Abraham Lincoln
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt when they were presidents-elect, and
against former President Theodore Roosevelt three years after he
left office, when he was campaigning for election again.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until Aug. 28, 1965, that Congress enacted a law
making it a federal crime to kill, kidnap or assault the president,
vice president, or president-elect, or to threaten these officials
with bodily harm or death. Before then, it was a state matter.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's the difference between a stepbrother and a half
brother?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Step'' is the combining form related through the remarriage
of a parent. Your stepbrother, then, is the son of your stepmother
or stepfather by his or her former marriage. A half brother is a
brother through one parent only. In other words, a half brother is
a male offspring having only one parent in common with another
offspring.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm aware of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, but I'm
told that a list has been made of the Seven Wonders of the Modern
World. If that's so, what are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: You may be referring to the septet chosen by the American
Society of Civil Engineers in conjunction with Popular Mechanics
magazine. Here's the group's list of modern wonders, released in
March 1996: the 5-mile-wide, $18 billion Itaipu Dam on the Parana
River on the Brazil-Paraguay border; Toronto's 1,815-foot CN Tower,
the world's tallest free-standing structure; the 51-mile-long
Panama Canal; San Francisco's Golden Gate Bridge; the 31-mile-long
Channel Tunnel, between England and France; the Netherlands North
Sea Protection Works, a network of dams, sluices, canals and dikes
built to protect southwest Holland from flooding on the delta of
the Meuse and Rhine rivers; and the 1,248-foot Empire State
Building, for four decades the tallest building in the United
States.

 &HT;    Hold the phone! A once-easy decision is now almost overwhelming
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Just 20 years ago the choices for a telephone for
your house were simple.
</P>
<P>
   Console, wall, princess. Black, white, pink. Maybe avocado for
the truly adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   But when Linn Hughes and Jim Leonard visited a Beavercreek, Ohio
Best Buy store last week, they found a selection of about 50
cordless phones, 30 corded phones, at least a dozen cellular phone
models and a separate display rack full of telephone/answering
machine combinations.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, of Huber Heights, Ohio, wanted a cordless phone with a
caller ID screen in the handset. ``We've already got a cordless
phone I bought about six months ago,'' he said. ``I want another
one so my wife can have her own.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, of Beavercreek, also was looking for his second
cordless phone. ``I want a two-line phone with a switch to turn off
the ringer on the second line,'' he said. ``I use the second line
for my home computer most of the time, and I don't need that line
to ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that deregulation has loosened Ma Bell's control of
telephones, the options open to phone users have exploded. And as
the competition grows, the prices plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard settled on a 25-channel cordless phone for about $100,
which he said would have cost about twice as much only a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in the market for a new phone for your home, you can
get one that fits your needs and lifestyle almost perfectly for a
reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   But because the selection is so vast and confusing, you need to
understand what's out there or you're likely to spend more than you
need to or get less than you want.
</P>
<P>
   CORDLESS PHONES
</P>
<P>
   Until about 10 years ago, almost all home telephones had a cord
that attached the handset to a base.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, however, cordless phones that use radio signals to
connect the handset to the base outsold conventional corded phones
for the first time, according to Jim Barry, a spokesman for the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Americans bought 28.2 million cordless phones last year compared
with 27.8 corded phones, and the gap is likely to widen this year
as people buy second cordless phones for themselves or as gifts.
About 45 percent of all Ameritech phones sold are purchased in
November in December, the heaviest Christmas shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're getting with a cordless phone is convenience,''
Barry said. ``And the technology of cordless phones is getting
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The first cordless phones on the market allowed users to walk
from one room to the next without dragging a phone cord behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   However, the first phones were prone to interference, had
limited range and lacked security.
</P>
<P>
   They used a simple analog signal to transmit sound from the
handset to the base, and it was common for neighbors to overhear
cordless phone conversations from other homes. Baby monitors also
broadcast across cordless phone lines occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is you should never say anything over a cordless
phone or a cellular phone that you don't want to see on the front
page of the newspaper,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   Newer phones broadcast on frequencies that are not as crowded,
and they offer clearer signals. Plus many of them use digital
signals: They convert sounds into computer code and transmit the
code between the base and the handset.
</P>
<P>
   Because the transmissions are coded the chance of having
conversations intercepted is lower, but your conversations still
aren't 100 percent secure.
</P>
<P>
   CORDED PHONES
</P>
<P>
   Despite the popularity of cordless phones, corded phones still
have the edge in dependability and security, Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   Corded phones also are usually significantly cheaper than
cordless models, with many basic models selling for less than $10.
Of course, you can't expect perfect, consistent sound quality from
an $8 phone. Still, a person buying a cordless phone just to reach
several rooms might save money buying two or three moderately
priced corded phones and spreading them around the house.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you prefer cordless phones, you should probably have an
inexpensive corded phone for use during power outages, when the
base unit of a cordless phone won't work. Corded phones get all the
power they need from the phone line, which uses backup power
systems to stay in operation.
</P>
<P>
   Corded phones also offer the most variation in style. While
cordless phones tend to have a streamlined, businesslike look,
corded phones are available in most colors and in novelty shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Also available are headset phones, according to Jeff Small, a
marketing official for Ameritech's consumer division.
</P>
<P>
   Small said people who use headsets at work often like the
convenience of a phone that clips to their belts and has an
earpiece and microphone held in place by a flexible head strap.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past the corded-cordless division, most phones
operate about the same.
</P>
<P>
   A few phones with old-style rotary dials are being manufactured
as nostalgia items, Barry said, but the tone-producing push button
is the heart of the modern phone.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all cordless phones have number buttons in the handset,
though some have buttons on the handset and the base.
</P>
<P>
   Corded phones often have buttons in the handset as well, but
it's easy to find corded phones with buttons on the base. That
allows you to punch in a number without taking the phone away from
your ear. It also allows larger number keys.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER PHONE FEATURES
</P>
<P>
   According to Small, the most popular extra features for
telephones are call waiting, caller ID and voice mail, in that
order.
</P>
<P>
   Any telephone is compatible with call-waiting service. When
you're on the phone and someone calls, you hear an audible signal.
You may click the receiver button or push ``flash'' to answer the
second call.
</P>
<P>
   You pay extra for call-waiting service, but you don't need
special equipment to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Caller ID, on the other hand, requires an LCD screen for
displaying information about incoming calls.
</P>
<P>
   Both cordless and corded phones can be purchased with caller ID
screens included, or you can buy separate caller ID boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Having the caller ID screen in the handset may be the most
convenient option. Some phones store numbers from caller ID in the
phone's memory for later use.
</P>
<P>
   However, built-in caller ID features raise the costs of
telephones and having a separate caller ID box might be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Also, what do you do if a built-in caller ID feature stops
working while the rest of the phone is fine? Do you throw the whole
phone away? With separate units, replacing broken components might
be cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   You can have voice mail on any push-button phone, according to
Small. But phones designed to work with voice mail often have
lights that tell you at a glance when you have a message waiting,
and the lights make them much more convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Voice mail is particularly useful if you have only one phone
line and have a computer linked to the Internet. Voice mail
automatically ships incoming calls to your mailbox when the
computer is online.
</P>
<P>
   Another feature that is increasingly popular is the two-line
phone, Small said. Many people have added a second line to their
homes, primarily for their computers.
</P>
<P>
   A two-line phone makes it convenient to use the computer line as
a second voice line when the computer is offline.
</P>
<P>
   Other features you might want to consider are storage for
frequently dialed numbers, speakers for hands-free conversation or
an answering machine if you don't want voice mail.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   GLANCE BOX
</P>
<P>
   Types of cordless phones:
</P>
<P>
   _ STANDARD CORDLESS PHONES: The first cordless home phones
operated on frequencies of about 43 to 49 MHz and were susceptible
to interference from fluorescent lights, computers and other
devices. Also transmissions at those frequencies usually can't
penetrate walls or other obstructions. Most of the earliest phones
operated on 10 channels _ if they found a lot of interference on
one channel they would automatically switch to the next. Some
discounters still offer 10-channel phones at low prices, but newer
models are superior.
</P>
<P>
   _ 25-CHANNEL ANALOG PHONES: The next step up from the 10-channel
phones offers generally clearer sound quality because it has more
channels to avoid interference. Also 25-channel phones often come
with popular features such as caller ID.
</P>
<P>
   _ 900MHZ ANALOG PHONES: These phones operate at high frequencies
and are less likely to get interference from baby monitors and
similar devices. Their range is also better than older models, and
their signals penetrate obstructions better. You probably will be
able to use a 900MHz analog phone from your yard or even from the
sidewalk a few houses away. Jim Barry of the Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers Association said some phones operate reliably at
three-quarters of a mile. The signal still is broadcast uncoded,
however, so security might be a concern.
</P>
<P>
   _ 900MHZ DIGITAL PHONES: In addition to operating at high
frequency, 900MHz digital phones communicate with their base
through digital signals, which is more secure. The sound quality
may be a little clearer than 900MHz analog phones, but sound varies
from brand to brand. The ranges of 900MHz analog and digital phones
are fairly comparable. Be careful when shopping for 900MHz phones;
it's easy to mistake an analog phone for a digital one if you don't
read the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   _ 900MHZ DIGITAL SPREAD SPECTRUM PHONES: Like all cordless
phones, spread spectrum units can operate on several frequencies.
But when a spread spectrum phone encounters interference on one
channel it doesn't just switch to an adjacent channel: It tries to
find the channel farthest away from the blocked channel. Spread
spectrum technology increases the phone's clarity and range.
</P>
<P>
   _ 2.4GHZ DIGITAL PHONES: Barry said only Panasonic, so far, is
marketing phones that operate at frequencies in the 2.4GHz range,
which is even higher than 900MHz. Panasonic claims its 2.4GHz
phones experience less interference and have twice the range of
spread spectrum phones. At about $250, they're fairly expensive,
however

courage of children. Something bold, unapologetic and
unself-conscious about it. The day I met Belynda Denney, then 7,
she did something no adult I know would have the guts to do. She
handed Hillary Clinton a scrawled ``I love you'' note and invited
herself to the White House, just like that. And just like that, The

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ There's something about the
courage of children. Something bold, unapologetic and
unself-conscious about it. The day I met Belynda Denney, then 7,
she did something no adult I know would have the guts to do. She
handed Hillary Clinton a scrawled ``I love you'' note and invited
herself to the White House, just like that. And just like that, The
first lady said, ``Come on down.'' Belynda died Monday night, just
a week shy of her 10th birthday. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News)

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
Silicon Valley tech museum is living laboratory 
By Lori Hawkins  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Tech Museum, the new $96 million
interactive monument to Silicon Valley, doesn't feel like a museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a hands-on classroom that informs and
entertains and inspires,'' says Regis McKenna, a leading Silicon
Valley consultant and an early board member of the Tech Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of debate in the beginning about whether it
should even be called a museum. The Tech isn't about yesterday,
it's about tomorrow,'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   The 132,000-square-foot museum in downtown San Jose is less a
record of what Silicon Valley has achieved _ including inventing
the many of the technologies that are part of everyday life
(microprocessor, semiconductor and the personal computer) and
putting them just about everywhere in the world _ than a living
laboratory where mind-bending exhibits illustrate how today's
technology works and where it's headed.
</P>
<P>
   You can don a bunnysuit and build a microchip in a
mini-cleanroom, take an ultrasound picture of your hand, and design
and ride in your own virtual roller-coaster simulator.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which opened Oct. 31, plays several roles in Silicon
Valley: It shows off the technology developed in the Valley, it
provides a sense of place amidst the sprawl of glass and concrete
office buildings and it shows that tech companies _ which
cooperated to create the museum _ really can work together.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to take the mystery out of technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want people who thought 'Oh, that's over my head' to walk
away saying 'Now I get it,''' says Peter Giles, chief executive of
The Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, museum designers kept it as simple as possible.
Text descriptions are kept to fewer than 40 words so that visitors
spend little time reading.
</P>
<P>
   The feel of the place is young and hip _ walls are curved and
painted with blinding hot pinks, purples and yellows. Neon strips
zig-zag like lightning across high ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Computers are kept to a minimum because of their intimidation
factor. In fact, exhibits explaining how computers work were
postponed because museum organizers couldn't figure out how to
explain binary mathematics in a way that was open and easy to
understand. (The plan is to add exhibits showing the inner workings
of computers in the next two years.)
</P>
<P>
   The galleries hands-on experiments are the heart and soul of the
Tech, which is divided into four galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The Innovation gallery focuses on cutting-edge inventions and
innovators who helped the area earn its high-tech reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Here you can create a laser-scanned 3-D image of your head, or
watch as grains of sand are transformed into silicon wafers. A
electron microscope lets you test a batch of real microchips.
</P>
<P>
   The Life Tech gallery looks at new ways to save lives and
enhance human performance. An ultrasound machine lets you see the
inside of your hand, and you can take a virtual tour of the human
body via an image database of a human body sliced in quarter-inch
sections.
</P>
<P>
   The Exploration gallery takes visitors to the surface of Mars,
the bottom of the ocean and back to the 1906 San Francisco
earthquake; and the Communication gallery explores how technology
helps humans create, harness and share information.
</P>
<P>
   Before building the 200 interactive exhibits, creators
interviewed area non-techies about what they already knew, what
they wanted to learn and how that could be achieved. Before
roll-out, people of all ages and backgrounds tested the interactive
controls, games and activities.
</P>
<P>
   The Tech also includes a 12,000-square-foot IMAX theater and a
learning center named after Robert N. Noyce, the late co-founder of
Intel Corp. and the first chief executive of Sematech Corp. in
Austin. The center will offer science and math activities for
teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to take the very coolest stuff in high-tech and make
it accessible,'' says Wayne LaBar, who oversees exhibit creation.
</P>
<P>
   The concept works, visitors say.
</P>
<P>
   On opening night, nine9-year-old Vincent Woo is hanging out at
an electronic cafe, where tables are embedded with laptop computers
that let you create a personal avatar, or cartoon identity. The
avatar travels through a 3-D graphical environment to chat with
characters created by other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the coolest place I've been,'' says Woo, whose named
his avatar Bubba. ``A lot of kids still don't have computers, so
this is a way for them to learn how they work.''
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Helen Woo, a systems analyst at Chevron, says that
even though many families have PCs, the Tech goes far beyond what a
desktop computer can do. ``We have your basic PC in the den, but
what you can do on it is pretty limited,'' she says. ``Here kids
can be an astronauts on Mars or doctors doing genetic testing. It
opens up a lot of possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a place The Tech, its organizers hope, will provide an
anchor to Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The Valley's engineers work inside glass and steel buildings
full of floors of cubicles. There's little to tour, short of
sneaking into Netscape or Sun Microsystems. And even then,
computers and cubicles are about all you'd see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is intrigued by Silicon Valley, and they want to
explore it. But the problem is, there's nothere there,'' Leonard
Hoops of the San Jose Convention and Visitors Bureau says,
borrowing Virginia Woolf's remark about Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do you go when you get here?'' asks the man who's in the
business of selling San Jose as a destination for business
travellers and tourists. ``You can't just show up to Intel or Apple
and knock on the door. There's really nowhere to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tech is changing that. When it opened last weekmonth, the
eye-walloping electric mango and blue domed building became an
instant downtown landmark. Now the hope is that the Tech, as it's
called, will give some definition to the region that has spawned an
ongoing technological revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a fascination with technology and those who create it,
science centers and technology museums are flourishing. More than
400 science museums exist in 43 countries, according to the
Washington, D.C.-based Association of Science-Technology Centers.
Last year they attracted more than 40 million visitors.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose has long regarded itself the capital of Silicon Valley,
which, loosely defined, is a collection of towns arrayed along the
west side of San Francisco Bay south of San Francisco. They include
San Jose, Cupertino, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Menlo Park,
Sunnyvale and Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, the area was best known for its orchards, and
San Jose boasted of being the prune capital of the world. Over the
past few decades, fruit trees have since given way to Apple, Intel,
Sun, AMD, Hewlett-Packard, Netscape and other high-tech companies,
and Silicon Valley has become known as the world's high-tech
capital.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the museum had been bouncing around the Valley for
more than 20 years, with much of the time devoted to deciding on a
site (San Jose, of course) and raising money.
</P>
<P>
   The Tech is also an example of how high-tech companies that
compete fiercely for products, patents and personnel can come
together to create a cultural institution. All in all, the Tech
raised $30 million in private contributions and another $25 million
in in-kind gifts of equipment. It also received $40 million in city
redevelopment funds. Its board is made up of executives from
companies including Hewlett-Packard Co., the Kleiner Perkins
Caulfield &AMP; Beyers venture capital firm, Applied Materials and
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose boosters are hoping the Tech is the draw it needs to
attract out-of-towners. Other than business, there has never been
much reason for visitors to go downtown. Even business travelers
tend to skip out as soon as their work is done.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges in turning that around has been
that the city has lacked an easily marketable identity. The Tech,
designed by reknowned Mexico City architect Ricardo Legorreta, who
designed the eye-popping enchilada-red San Antonio library, could
be San Jose's solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tech is one more sign that San Jose has arrived,'' says
Kim Polese, chief executive of hot Silicon Valley startup Marimba,
who attended opening festivities. ``It's more proof that San Jose
is a serious city that knows how to have fun.''
</P>
<P>

`DUMMIES' SERIES SMART FOR NEOPHYTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Among the many computer books out there,
``Windows for Dummies'' has been recommended. I am keeping in mind
that this comes from my ex-boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wisdom Seeker
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SEEKER: Well, he was wrong about everything else, wasn't
he? No, wait! That's what my ex says about me. Your situation is
probably very different from the shrill, shrieking horror of my
life.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those ``Dummies'' books are a great place to start if
you're totally in the dark. Just make sure they're not too
fundamental for you. Go to the bookstore, plop down with a latte
and a laptop and do some ``browsing.'' Or go to www.dummies.com and
read sample chapters before you shell out 20 bucks for something
you may not even need.
</P>
<P>
   You know, those people have a book for just about everything.
There's even ``Sex for Dummies.'' Hmmmm. I should have bought that
one for that shrew of a ... Sorry! Didn't mean to let my personal
life intrude. It won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have some questions about your collum first
are you a hacker and if you are not how do you know so much about
it.i mean i know your a profeeser or something like that.but you
must know how to hack.By the way please send alot more info on the
hacker stuff.because i am very intrested.thanks
</P>
<P>
   _ AntiUser1
</P>
<P>
   DEAR ANTI: Your teachers must be mighty proud of you.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there a scanner available that will transmit
text intact? Will a single scanner do both text and graphics?
</P>
<P>
   _ Word for Word
</P>
<P>
   DEAR WORD: In case some brain-dead salesclerk can't give you a
straight answer, just about any scanner you buy can do both. The
scanner simply takes a picture of the page. Character-recognition
software, which ought to come with the scanner, does its best to
recognize letters in that picture and turn them into text in a new
file. A blurry or smudged original means lots of typos, so try to
keep from spilling your tropical drink all over the page before
scanning.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Almost every week you tell us some new ``stupid
software trick'' the Microsoft engineers have put in their
products. Is this why their programs are so ridiculously large?
</P>
<P>
   _ Size Matters
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SIZE: Those little Easter eggs only take up a fraction of
the space in the programs. Microsoft applications are so
ridiculously large because they do about 700 times the number of
things most casual users need. For instance, Microsoft has been
adding on to Word since Bill Gates' acne cleared up, making it
bigger and bigger.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all Microsoft setup programs, there is an option for
``custom'' installation. Use that, and you can pick and choose
exactly how much stuff to install.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of software tricks, you guys aren't playing fair.
You're supposed to be sending me stuff. I'm tired of just giving
and giving and giving. But it was always about you, wasn't it? I
should have seen how selfish you were, but, no, I let you walk all
over me. Well, not anymore. You're not the boss of ... Whoops! Did
it again, didn't I?
</P>
<P>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Lawrence Ellison, chairman of Oracle Corp. and
longtime foe of Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, failed in his
first effort to undermine the dominance of the Windows family of
operating systems with a concept called the network computer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has struck upon a new strategy that would do away with
the operating system almost entirely on the powerful computers
known as servers that act as the control centers of large networks.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's Comdex computer industry trade show, which opened
here Sunday, Ellison plans to introduce a new version of his Oracle
database program, code-named ``raw iron,'' that he hopes will be
sold by companies that make network servers, including Compaq, Sun
Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Dell Computer.
</P>
<P>
   Because the new database program will require only a small stub
of an operating system, known as a kernel, the system will be
faster and more reliable, Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   His network computer, or NC, was an earlier attempt at
simplifying the task of corporate PC managers by offering them
simple and inexpensive hardware that would run a World Wide Web
browser program. NCs failed to catch on, however, largely because
of the rapidly falling cost of the personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Refusing to give up, he is now arguing that the NC is any device
that incorporates a Web browser. These can range from something as
simple as a cellular phone to a television set or a personal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing what he calls the Oracle Data Base Server
Appliance, Ellison will be trying to open a back door to realizing
the NC and laying out a new strategy in his three-year-long war for
the high ground in the increasingly bitter software marketing wars.
</P>
<P>
   The Oracle Data Base Server Appliance is a refrigerator-sized
computer that will store all of a company's data, including e-mail,
text files and accounting information. Such a server, he maintains,
will require much less management and be simpler to use than a
standard server, which often has to run dozens of different
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry executives said Ellison's server appliance
might prove more difficult for Microsoft to defuse than the network
computer was.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a large market for dedicated appliances on computer
networks,'' said Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Novell Corp.,
which sells network server systems. ``It is a real revenue
opportunity, and it minimizes the role of the operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Ellison has criticized Microsoft's strategy to
place millions of servers running Windows 2000 _ the new name for
Windows NT _ in small businesses and large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison says the strategy will prove costly and unmanageable for
businesses. And he accuses Microsoft of worsening the shortage of
high-technology workers in the United States because its systems
require so many people to administer.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative vision of computing, Ellison's system would
centralize the storage of information.
</P>
<P>
   His critics call it a look backward toward the era of the
mainframe computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave the files where they are,'' said Janet Perna, general
manager of IBM's database business. IBM's rival DB2 system, she
said, employs pointers on the central server that lead people to
data distributed among many computers in a corporation.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over the database market is crucial because these
enormous electronic filing cabinets are the increasingly essential
software programs that permit large and small corporations to track
and control all aspects of their business. Applications can range
from running a corporation accounting system to e-mail servers that
act as electronic post offices.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for market share in the $8.6 billion database
industry has become a crucial beachhead for software companies that
offer one-stop shopping for the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, says Dataquest, a market research firm, almost 53
percent of the market for corporate databases has been controlled
by Oracle and IBM, which created the most popular format, the
relational database. However, Microsoft, which has only a 4.5
percent market share, is preparing to enter the business.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellison, who has taunted Microsoft and Gates for years with
barbed, often humorous attacks, may have found a way to confound
his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   By dispensing with all but a tiny portion of the operating
system, Ellison argues, he will be able to offer a faster, cheaper
and more stable product than Microsoft's SQL Server 7, a database
for Windows 2000 that will be announced at Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting with reporters at his home in San Francisco, Ellison
said, ``I don't know why Microsoft should be threatened; we're just
saying that you don't need an operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Oracle's strategy could offer direct competition
to Windows. The Oracle 8i database can run multiple Java programs,
and it includes its own file system for storing and retrieving
documents _ functions typically performed by an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle is still negotiating with computer companies about
bundling the new 8i database program with powerful server hardware,
Ellison said.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing details have yet to be worked out, but he said he
expected the appliance databases to be on the market by the end of
the first quarter of next year.

AMERICA ONLINE HAS NEW PORTAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When America Online bought the small Israeli start-up company
Mirabilis in June for $287 million, people in the industry
scratched their heads and wondered what the buyer was getting.
Mirabilis makes a software program called ICQ for chat and instant
messaging that has been distributed free to Internet users, who
give it a cultish dedication that one executive likened to fans'
devotion to the Grateful Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts wondered how America Online would recoup its investment
in Mirabilis, which had yet to make a profit from its grass-roots
chatters, without offending them. Many ICQ members wrote notes of
protest on the company's Web site (www.icq.com) after the sale,
expressing fears of commercialization.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sale, America Online has publicly kept its distance
from ICQ, although it is managing the business closely and has
installed a senior America Online executive, Fred Singer, as chief
operating officer of the Mirabilis unit, now called ICQ.
</P>
<P>
   With ICQ's latest version a few weeks away from public release,
there are now some clues to a possible strategy. The new software
contains all the features of a Web gateway, or portal, built right
into its control panel, and to accommodate the large international
audience of the product, translates information it finds into any
language.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of search engines, like Alta Vista and Excite, as well
as news, financial and weather sites and a dictionary are among the
features provided _ though, at least initially, they are not paying
to be included.
</P>
<P>
   This means that an ICQ user need not open a separate Web-browser
program to find some information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a communication tool with a sophisticated search
integrated into it,'' said Anya Sacharow of Jupiter communications.
``It's redefining search and navigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Through ICQ, America Online appears to be seeking to go beyond
the so-called portals in keeping Web users within its own confines
_ all the better to present advertisers with a semicaptive
audience. But there may be limits to America Online's ability to
promote ICQ directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL can't really put its brand near ICQ, because ICQ users
will become totally alienated by that,'' Ms. Sacharow said.
</P>
<P>
   Singer said the ICQ user base had grown by 60 percent since the
acquisition, to 21 million users. That compares with America
Online's subscriber base of 13 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Is the new strategy the first step toward introducing
advertising into the ICQ community? Singer's answer to that
question was cryptic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the community is so large and powerful, and usage is
so high, what we're trying to do is make it better, build an
audience,'' he said. ``The good news is if you have a community
like this one, and we can continue to provide for them and make
them happy, the other issues will solve themselves.''

WHEN YOUR CHILD STEALS FOR ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.) 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: My 10-year-old son is bringing home all sorts of
goodies from school. I don't think they're his, but I don't want to
accuse him of stealing. How common is stealing with kids, and if I
ignore it, are banks next? _ Chattanooga, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: It's not unusual for kids to steal, but it's not
something you want to encourage as a way to garner attention. Don't
condone or ignore his stealing, but shift the emphasis from
negative to positive. Make sure he is not stealing to get
attention. You don't need your kid to be the first jailbird in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   If your son is stealing, ask yourself why he is doing this. Who
sees his booty? If no one, he probably wants it for its own sake.
If he shows his friends, he wants their approval. If he shows you,
he's most likely asking for help. He's figured out how to get your
attention, and unfortunately punishing him will only emphasize the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Does he have an older sibling who gets a lot of attention for
sports or grades? Or a new baby in the house? Then he needs
reinforcement from you, including gold stars on the forehead, pats
on the back for positive behavior and help in making purchases.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to accuse him of stealing. Just explain you're
uncomfortable with his trading efforts and to cut it out before
other parents object. Suggest he takes no goodies to school and
brings no goodies home. If he doesn't already have an allowance or
job to pay for his own ``must-haves,'' institute a series of chores
to earn money that you will match.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I've been going with a woman 20 years my junior for a
little over a year. She's been divorced for a little under a year.
While she was married, she had numerous affairs. When I asked her
about them, she gave me sketchy details. Later I found out she'd
lied about the number and length of affairs. I want to leave her,
but I'm supporting her and her two children, ages 5 and 9, since
she doesn't work and doesn't receive sufficient alimony. What
should I do? _ Toronto
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Heavens! So many red flares shot up as I read your
letter my office is on fire. Despite your noble intentions, you've
stumbled into nearly every relationship pitfall there is.
</P>
<P>
   What she did before is none of your business. What matter is
what's going on between the two of you today. Stop supporting this
woman, so both of you can evaluate your feelings for each other.
She needs to grow up, get a job and realize that a romance is not a
rescue. Stop being ``Wally the Wallet'' and take a breather from
this troubled relationship for six months.
</P>
<P>
   After that your head should be clear enough to see who this
woman is as a person _ not a project. If at that time, you still
want to pursue a relationship, proceed with caution. You never know
when a booby trap might spring up and bop you on the shins again.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm a guy trying to save money to buy a car, so I'm
living at home while I attend college. But my parents wait up for
me every night and want to know everything that goes on in my life.
Aren't I entitled to any privacy? _ Milwaukee
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Of course, but you may have to get it the old-fashioned
way _ earn it by moving out. Everything in this life has a price
tag. You're finding the price tag for free room and board is
expensive in terms of personal privacy and independence.
</P>
<P>
   Live under your parents' roof and I guarantee you're going to be
treated like a child whether you're 14 or 114. If you're unwilling
to change your living arrangements, compromise. Volunteer
information if they promise not to ask. Tell them you'll be home by
a certain time and say goodnight when you get in. Your parents are
always going to be interested in your life even after you move out.
It doesn't mean they're nosy, just that they're your parents and
they love you.
</P>
<P>
   Your best long-term solution is to earn more independence, which
may mean finding less luxurious housing with a friend, foregoing
the car temporarily, getting a job or finding campus housing in
exchange for some work. Not only will your parents drive you less
crazy, but you'll also feel a lot more grown up.

   Haven't we seen this screen before?
</P>
<P>
   The latest Internet initiative from Microsoft Corp. is an
all-in-one service that combines news, information, shopping,
bulletin boards and electronic mail. Even its name sounds familiar:
MSN.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, MSN was originally the banner for one of Microsoft's
most embarrassing missteps, a subscription-based online service
meant to crush America Online. But that service, introduced three
years ago, was slow, full of bugs and hard to use, and it fell far
behind the competition _ on one side from America Online and on the
other from the emerging World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting its focus to the Internet, Microsoft then poured money
into elaborate entertainment offerings, but few people looked at
them. After canceling those, the company built a series of Internet
services meant to be useful, like the Sidewalk local-entertainment
guide and the Expedia travel agency.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, there's no page like home.
</P>
<P>
   The company has realized that on the Web, the power and the
money are going to search engines like Yahoo, which have added so
many features that they are beginning to look like just the sort of
online service MSN was three years ago. So Microsoft has reversed
itself again and is stitching its disparate Internet services back
into a unified network, which it reintroduced in September under
the name MSN.
</P>
<P>
   The service has hardly taken the world by storm, and it may face
additional questions. Last week, Pete Higgins, the top Microsoft
executive who looked after the company's online efforts, announced
that he would take a six-month leave of absence beginning in
January and would return in an unspecified capacity.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the online business will report to Steve Ballmer,
Microsoft's president, who is widely seen as more hard charging and
confrontational than Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins says that his departure reflects no more than a desire
to take a break to spend time with his family and tend his salmon
farm. But in a sign that Microsoft may see the need for a more
significant change, Ballmer said the company was searching for an
outsider to replace Higgins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete has us on a nice trajectory,'' Ballmer said. ``All we're
trying to do is pump up the volume as we move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's trouble in gaining traction for its Web effort
stands in sharp contrast to the speed with which its Internet
Explorer Web-browsing software has been able to surge past its main
competitor, the browsers offered by Netscape Communications Corp.
The Justice Department, of course, has been arguing that Microsoft
improperly used the market power of its Windows operating system to
extend its domination into the browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But while the new MSN has the seeming advantage of being
reachable by a single mouse click from the Internet Explorer
browser that comes loaded on every new Windows PC, it remains
uncertain how many Web surfers will choose to make that click.
After all, the initial MSN online service also had the enviable
asset of a start button on the main screen of Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's biggest advantage in its Web effort, however, may be
the popularity of some of its individual Web sites. Most notably,
the Hotmail e-mail service that Microsoft bought last year signs up
150,000 new users a day. Taken together, the Microsoft sites
constitute the third-most-popular network on the Internet after
America Online and Yahoo, according to Media Metrix, the rating
service based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all this was planned. Microsoft is the master of the
so-called ready-fire-aim business model. The company introduces a
hastily conceived product and then, through a war of attrition
affordable perhaps only to a company with a stock-market value of
$274 billion, methodically hunts down the bugs until a version of
the product finally wins the minds, if not the hearts, of the
computing masses.
</P>
<P>
   This trial-and-error approach has convinced Microsoft that Web
sites are in fact mainly another form of software. That is a sharp
contrast to the approach taken by Yahoo, Disney and most other
purveyors of what are called ``portals'' _ a media-network approach
to the business that is based on gathering and retaining as large
an audience as possible to sell to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it hired many media types but learned, for
example, that what brings people back to Sidewalk is not witty
reviews or flashy graphics but sophisticated programs that help
people find the events they are looking for and then display a map
of nearby restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The other sites that have worked well for the company allow
customers to use software to search for airplane tickets, cars,
home mortgages and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft sees MSN as closer to an extension of its Office suite
of programs than as a magazine or an online television channel.
This plays into its current thinking about how it will turn MSN's
losses _ which it declines to quantify _ into profits. First, all
those programs that help people find things to buy, like Expedia
and so on, put Microsoft in a position to earn fees from each
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   And second, it sees a host of new computerized services that can
be delivered over the Internet as part of what the chairman, Bill
Gates, calls the company's megaserver strategy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, customers could connect to MSN to automatically
back up the information stored on their hard drives. They may pay a
fee for this _ or, more likely, Ballmer says, they will have to
watch advertising as the service is performed.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest mistake Microsoft made as its strategy evolved was
to miss the power of portals. But it has now focused its prodigious
product development organization on building a better portal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's research department regularly surveys hundreds of
Internet users. It has discovered that so far only one-third of the
users of the so-called ``portal'' sites exhibit what it defines as
``portal behavior'' _ using at least three services within the same
name-brand portal site. But that proportion is growing rapidly,
meaning that while the market remains open, it may not stay so as
consumers develop Web brand loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   As the center of its portal strategy, Microsoft created a new
home page, called MSN.com, meant to be a jumping-off point for its
other services. This page is the first thing that many users of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer now see. So do users of the old MSN
online service, which has been transformed into what amounts to a
basic Internet-access service provider.
</P>
<P>
   As at other portals like Yahoo and Excite, the MSN.com home page
lets users select certain information _ like local weather, sports,
and news on certain topics _ that they want to see first thing
every day.
</P>
<P>
   During the initial planning earlier this year, this portal page
was going to be called ``Start,'' a name that echoes the button on
the Windows desktop. But upon further review, the name struck
Microsoft executives as too transient and too oriented toward
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it chose MSN to emphasize this network theme and
redesigned its other services to appear more consistent and to
feature the MSN logo. Thus Hotmail became MSN Hotmail, Expedia is
MSN Expedia, and so on. Each of these has a series of links that
direct users to other sites in the network.
</P>
<P>
   The result, since the September rollout, has been an immediate
jump in traffic. Before the new design, for example, only 13
percent of the visitors to Expedia came from other Microsoft sites,
the company says. Now it is 54 percent. Even Hotmail, which has
demonstrable momentum on its own, now gets about one-third of its
new-member referrals from other MSN sites.
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult for Microsoft's evolving online strategy
to maintain credibility with advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategic direction changed so often that every time you
worked with them it didn't go anywhere,'' said Michael Golden, the
head of media at Organic Online, an interactive advertising agency.
Organic, he said, spent a lot of time with Avis Rent A Car on a
sponsorship of the Microsoft travel site, now defunct, called Mungo
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he allows, several of his clients have been finding
vigorous sales on the MSN Shopping site.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months, Microsoft has more than doubled its
ad-sales force to 40 people from 20. And it has discovered what
America Online realized about a year ago _ that there is a lot of
money available to offer online ``distribution'' to other Web
services as well as traditional marketers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, for example, took in a total of $60 million from
four search engines _ Alta Vista, Infoseek, Lycos and Snap _ to be
featured on the MSN home page. It signed a $90 million advertising
deal with First USA, the credit-card unit of Bank One. And it has
sold $26 million worth of local advertisements on its redesigned
Sidewalk service, which is moving to be more of a national yellow
pages than an entertainment guide.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the strategic direction may have shifted, people who
deal with MSN say that its executives move with a hard nose in
whatever direction they are pointed.
</P>
<P>
   One marketing official of an online store that has a
multimillion-dollar contract for Microsoft to send shoppers to its
site was flabbergasted when MSN officials asked the advertiser to
put links on its site to send surfers back to MSN after shopping.
``They are much more hard driving and bottom-line oriented than
other Internet companies,'' said the marketer, who rebuffed the
demand.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, MSN's new consistent-brand approach glosses over
the many incompatibilities between the sites that resulted from the
various product groups that did not coordinate design of their
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Because each of the originally separate services posted a
slightly different privacy policy, they cannot share data about
users with other parts of the network.
</P>
<P>
   Such exchanges, however, would be difficult anyway, because each
site has a separate user-registration database. One person can sign
up for the user code name Bsmith on Hotmail. A second Bsmith could
use that name on Expedia and a third person could sign up
separately on Investor. Or all three accounts could be the same
person, and Microsoft would have no way of knowing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it is working on a way to have a single unified
registration account, of the sort that Yahoo and Excite have. But
it will be complicated to retroactively change customers' account
information.
</P>
<P>
   And even over the last year, as the strategy was changed to
merge the separate sites into the unified portal, it was up to the
separate teams to work out the details of the integration among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The process, especially to newcomers, was excruciating.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a start-up, I spent less than 1 percent of my time
communicating what we were doing,'' said Sabeer Bhatia, the chief
executive of Hotmail, who was with the company when Microsoft
bought it.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Microsoft, the overhead of having meetings and building a
consensus among a group of people is so high, I had to hire people
just to manage the communication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All that is now in the past, Microsoft executives assert. Their
strategy is set and they are all working to flesh out this new
vision of a utilitarian portal.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Microsoft is working to improve MSN by expanding the
Internet search capability and adding instant messaging and other
features that let users communicate with one another and form
virtual communities.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be much more emphasis on shopping services, to
complement the new design of Sidewalk, and offerings for small
businesses and Web publishers provided by the Link Exchange
advertising network of 400,000 Web sites that Microsoft recently
acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Of course with all the changes, many wonder how long Microsoft
will be willing to continue to lose money on its online efforts.
But Ballmer insists the company will not pull out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a company that makes long-term investments,'' he said
last week. ``MSN can be a great business. The largest unanswered
question is how quickly will this happen.''

CHRISTOPHER REEVE: MAN OF ACTION ONCE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  World rights except Great Britain and Australia 
 Color slides and black and white photos of Christopher Reeve and
Daryl Hannah in ``Rear Window.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For the first time since the horseriding accident in l995 that
left him paralyzed and unable to walk, Christopher Reeve is back in
the starring spot in a movie- ABC's ``Rear Window,'' airing Nov.
22.
 &HT;    In this remake of Alfred Hitchcock's classic l954 thriller,
Reeve plays architect Jason Kemp who has been left a quadriplegic
after a catastrophic car crash. He shares the spotlight with
gorgeous Daryl Hannah, (reprising the role made famous by Grace
Kelly) as a man who, though confined to his room, witnesses what he
believes is a brutal murder.
 &HT;    Last year Reeve went behind the camera to direct the HBO movie
``In the Gloaming,'' a gem that brought him an Emmy nomination for
best director.
 &HT;    In the l997 TV film, ``Snakes and Ladders,'' he played a small
role as a quadriplegic who becomes a mentor to young man paralyzed
in a diving accident.
 &HT;    But this time he's back as the star, above the title, the
position he occupied before a balking horse changed his life
forever. Reeve was Superman on and off screen. The man who could
leap tall buildings in a single bound was in real life a real man
of action, flying gliders as well as jets, sky diving, sailing and
skiing, until, in the cruelest of ironies, he fell during a
relatively simple horse show, breaking the top two vertebrae of his
spinal column.
 &HT;    His courage has been challenged as never before. And ``Rear
Window,'' he says, allowed him to incorporate into the character
many of the terrifying things he himself has experienced. ``I
wanted to do this film because many times disabled people are shown
in a somewhat pathetic light or they're bitter or angry,'' he
explains. ``But this character is really more positive _ a
resourceful man who has been through the ringer. This movie shows
how far someone can come in reclaiming his life.''
 &HT;    Speaking from his home amid the woods of Bedford, N.Y., Reeve
has made incredible progress since the accident. Many thought he
wouldn't live out the year let alone have a career.
 &HT;    Now as an actor he has a unique opportunity to show an audience
at least a small part of what being a quadriplegic really entails.
For him this is not just acting.
 &HT;    ``Jason's experiences are very close to mine,'' he says. ``For
example, he experiences a 'pop off.' This means that some part of
the hose he depends on for breathing becomes separated from the
vent, or a hole develops in the hose. That's happened to me a
number of times. I stopped getting air and had absolutely no
breath.
 &HT;    ``And when we did that scene in the movie we did it for real.
The poor actor playing the nurse was terrified, but I told her it
was perfectly safe. There were actually nurses around and others
who could reconnect the vent in a second. I can also breathe off
the vent for short periods of time, so there was no real danger.
But when you see the pop-off on the screen, it's real. I'm actually
not breathing.''
 &HT;    It certainly takes Hitchcock's concept of the thriller a step
beyond. ``I think audiences will see what it's really like to go
through some of these very anxious moments,'' says Reeve. ``They
will see how those moments can be lonely and frustrating when
someone is just learning to cope with the situation.''
 &HT;    In the original film James Stewart played a photographer who was
sidelined with a broken leg. ``Our movie updates the story. The
idea is to raise the stakes,'' says Reeve. ``To do the same story
but with a ... quadriplegic puts the lead character in so much more
jeopardy. We wanted to create something exciting that forges new
ground.''
 &HT;    Hannah says Reeve was a joy to work with. ``He has a sparkle in
his eye that is sort of hypnotic and it kind of shoots out across
the room and tantalizes and hypnotizes you. He's got so much energy
and life it's just intoxicating.''
 &HT;    In his own life of course, Reeve has become a hero to millions
around the world since his accident. Besides directing, he has
narrated the film ``Without Pity,'' a plea for the disabled to
enjoy more rights in society. He's also penned a best-selling
autobiography, ``Still Me,'' which has helped ease his huge medical
bills.
 &HT;    In between he crisscrosses the country campaigning for a
national spinal cord registry and other legislation to help further
rights for the handicapped. His 37 year old wife Dana, (``my
rock'') is now rehearsing for a Broadway show, ``More to Love,''
and their son Will, 6, is at school. He also sees a lot of his
children from a previous relationship, Matthew l8, and Alexandra
15.
 &HT;    Reeve says of his wife: ``We're very much in love. Whether I
have zero recovery or full recovery our relationship will
survive.''
 &HT;    Progress, he says, is slow but perceptible. When he turned 43,
just four months after the accident, he couldn't blow out his
candles. Now when they wheeled in a cake for his 46th birthday he
proudly blew out the lot.
 &HT;    Through practice, he can now breathe without the ventilator for
up to 30 minutes a day. He exercises for three hours daily and is
now able to sneeze _ something he couldn't do a couple of years
ago.
 &HT;    But he still loses his cool when people, some of them doctors,
describe his quest as futile. And he insists he doesn't worry about
his medical insurance running out. ``By that time,'' he says,
``I'll be up and walking.''

WHY BUY BOSE?

<P>
   You've seen the ads. ``The Bose Wave Radio is no ordinary
radio.'' It's ``a sonic marvel,'' a ``genuine breakthrough.'' Such
a little thing _ barely the size of a shoe box _ yet it puts out
the ``full, rich sound'' of a ``primary music system.'' It costs
$349, startlingly high for a clock radio but not unreasonable if
the claims are not overstated. Are the claims overstated? Come on.
How could they not be?
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Bose is bad. In fact, it may be the second-best
tabletop radio out there. But just this month, what may be the best
tabletop radio hit the market. It's the Cambridge SoundWorks Model
88 and, at $199, it's very nearly everything the Bose Wave claims
to be _ at a little over half the price. The Cambridge delivers a
smoother, more coherent, more rhythmic, more dynamic, more tonally
true picture of the music.
</P>
<P>
   For example, on a Vladimir Horowitz piano solo, the keys sounded
clangy, a bit metallic, on the Bose; they were warmer, but no less
hammered, on the Cambridge. When the quartet Anonymous 4 sang a
medieval chant, I wasn't sure on the Bose if there were four
singers (were there three? five?) _ there was no doubt at all on
the Cambridge. When the Heath Brothers played a hard-bop jazz tune,
the hi-hat cymbal sounded smeared on the Bose. I couldn't hear the
accent on the beat. On the Cambridge, I got the percussive thwack
as well as the shimmering whoosh all around it. And though the Bose
hit the low octaves of the acoustic bass, the Cambridge caught the
finger-pluckings of the bass strings.
</P>
<P>
   The differences weren't night and day. But they were of the sort
that, over time, make you feel at ease or slightly tense _ and
which, in a moment of leisure, make you want to stop and really
listen or move on to something else.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, I hooked up each unit to a compact disc player.
(Both radios sport input jacks in the back for plugging in a CD
player, computer, tape deck, television, or VCR.) I used not some
humdrum portable but the Discovery/Pentagon CD-70, a
top-of-the-line machine that retails for $5,000. And I pulled out
two of my most sonically demanding discs _ Henryk Gorecki's Third
Symphony, by the London Symphony Orchestra, on Nonesuch; and Kendra
Shank's Afterglow, a chanteuse-plus-jazz-trio session, on
Mapleshade.
</P>
<P>
   Those familiar with the Gorecki know that, on some full-size (if
not very good) stereo systems, the first minute or so _ bass
violins growling quietly _ comes off as a vague rumble, its melody
barely audible. Both the Bose and the Cambridge navigate this
passage clearly. However, the Cambridge gets more of the bowing on
the basses, more of their rhythmic inflections. When a second,
louder bass line starts in about a minute into the piece, the Bose
cracks up for a second. The Cambridge doesn't exactly keep
everything straight (teeny speakers and teenier amplifiers can do
only so much), but it keeps going _ it doesn't lose the thread.
</P>
<P>
   On the Shank disc, when she modulates her voice, accenting a
certain word or dipping another to a whisper, the Bose makes it
sound as if the engineer is sharply turning up or down the volume.
The Cambridge gets the subtleties right. How do these radios eke
such relatively big sounds out of such small boxes? The Bose isn't
exactly a technical ``breakthrough,'' but it is clever. In the back
of the speakers is a 7 foot tube that has been folded into a thin,
tight maze to fit inside the radio box. The frequency of a sound
wave is defined by its length: The longer the wave, the deeper the
bass. Such a long tube gives sound waves lots of room to enlarge.
Each speaker is also powered by an amplifier equipped with circuits
that boost the bass as you turn up the volume. However, once the
speakers get to the middle and upper octaves, their limitations
become more apparent; hence, the steely pianos, smeared cymbals,
ungainly dynamics, and the rest. The Cambridge SoundWorks 88, half
an inch taller but otherwise the same size as the Bose, takes a
different approach. Its bass comes from a 4 1/2 inch woofer cone,
which takes up two-thirds of the radio's internal space and is
powered by its own amplifier. The two smaller main speakers, each
of which has its own amp, are freed up to focus their energies on
the less burdensome middle and treble octaves. (The 88 also has a
separate volume knob for the woofer, so you can adjust the bass
level, which would otherwise depend greatly on room placement.)
</P>
<P>
   The 88 is designed by Henry Kloss, a hi-fi legend who made his
mark (with the KLH speakers of the 1950's and the Advents of the
'60s) by figuring out how to manipulate electronics so that a
speaker sounds smooth from octave to octave. He applied 47 years of
experience with this art to the rather skimpy components of the
Model 88, which explains how he gets such a smooth, coherent sound
from not only a small box but also a cheap one.
</P>
<P>
   Bose is the property of Amar Bose, a man long regarded as
hi-fi's most brilliant marketer but whose products tend to be built
around a technical fad. His Bose 901 loudspeakers, the company's
premium line for 30 years, have nine speaker cones, positioned all
over the cabinet, so that the sound bounces around your room ``just
like in a concert hall.'' One problem, among many, is that most
people's living rooms aren't Carnegie Hall; as a result, the music
just sounds muddy. His methods also encourage high prices: The 901s
cost $1,400 a pair (some companies make $300 speakers that sound
better) because nine cones cost more than two or three; the Wave
radio costs $350 because that 7 foot tube was a bear to design. The
Wave is one of Bose's better devices. But he stretched too far, in
his price tag and his claims, and now Kloss' Cambridge has
delivered his comeuppance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you noticed how everyone wants to get their hands on your
new baby?
</P>
<P>
   Of course the attention and affection showered on the baby are
nice, but what's nice isn't always the same as what's needed, and
what new moms need is a no-holds-barred buddy who wades into the
trenches, rolls up her sleeves and asks, ``How can I help?''
</P>
<P>
   For the times when you're moved to ask others this question (and
the times when you wish someone would ask it of you), consider this
a ``clip- and-save'' guide to making life a little easier for a new
mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring (real) food.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping off a home-cooked meal (or great take-out) is an act of
friendship every new mom and dad dream of. A devoted friend might
even cook the meal, bring it over, serve it (holding the baby so
the new parents can actually eat it), and clean up afterward,
leaving nothing but happy, full bellies in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   Milk, juice, bread, fruit, and other staples are always
appreciated. After all, food is love.
</P>
<P>
   2. Come bearing brooms.
</P>
<P>
   A baby creates an avalanche of chores. After baths, diapering,
spit-up removal and laundry, there's no time (or energy) for much
else. Like many a new parent you shudder as the constant stream of
well-wishers wades through unread newspapers and dust balls in what
used to be a tidy home.
</P>
<P>
   New parents fantasize about buddies showing up, bucket and mop
in hand, cheerfully tackling the kitchen, shower, living room and
cluttered corners until they sparkle.
</P>
<P>
   For loving friends who live too far away for the do-it-yourself
approach and want to give a baby shower gift that will really make
a difference, how about three months of prepaid cleaning service?
It's guaranteed to earn the sponsor a spot in the Helper's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   3. Hold a crier (and don't complain).
</P>
<P>
   No matter how deeply a new mother adores her baby, she needs a
break sometimes (yes, even when the little sweetie is screaming for
all she's worth). In this ultimate test of friendship, people fall
into one of two categories: heroes who are willing to hold a crying
child and wimps who sing out ``Here, Mom!'' at the first squawk a
newborn makes, holding her at arm's length as if she were about to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   So the baby is crying. It's only a little voice, after all, and
a new mom will be eternally grateful if she can finish going to the
bathroom, just this once. Giving Mom time away from baby (crying or
not) is a necessity, not a luxury. It means she can have a minute
to herself to relax in a hot bath, take a walk or catch a nap.
</P>
<P>
   4. Offer on-the-spot childcare.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how a new mom ``runs out'' to pick up a quart of milk:
Feed the baby; change the baby; pack the diaper bag; feed the baby;
change the baby; change the mom; feed the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Two hours later you're finally on your way, but
the minute you enter the store, the little guy begins to wail.
</P>
<P>
   The probability of task completion increases tenfold with the
help of another adult who can hold the baby, change a diaper or
finish errands while Mom nurses. For new parents who don't get out
much, walking into a store with free hands, knowing that the baby
is nearby, safe in the care of a trusted friend, is liberating.
Moms might even complete two errands in one outing!
</P>
<P>
   5. Polish your penmanship.
</P>
<P>
   New mothers who send out thank-you notes for all the baby
presents before their child is 3 months old are either developing
an obsessive-compulsive disorder, getting a head start on the
supermom complex or lucky enough to have family and friends who
help them organize a mass mailing in between feedings and diaper
changes or during the baby's naps.
</P>
<P>
   New moms need buddies who seize the
thank-you-for-your-lovely-gift mission as their own, bringing over
stamps and addressing envelopes while Mom writes the notes, or
putting their best penmanship forward as Mom dictates.
</P>
<P>
   With all the other intense emotions of new parenthood, you can
at least keep guilt over unwritten thank-you notes out of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   6. Roll up your sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   The visitors whom dads and moms love most are those who stop by
not just to shoot the breeze or offer unsolicited advice but also
to fix the banging screen door. Or hang new curtains, recycle the
newspapers, take the dog for a walk, rake leaves, water the
houseplants, brush the cat and clean out the litter box.
</P>
<P>
   These little extras are acts of love in their best form:
hands-on care.
</P>
<P>
   7. Be a ``big sister'' to the new big sister.
</P>
<P>
   When a second child is born, mothers are confronted with a
knife-in-the-heart feeling, certain that in showering attention on
the new arrival they are ruining their firstborn's childhood
forever. Fortunate are those who have family and friends to push
big sister on the swings, take her to the park or library, build
block towers, play tag and hang around for the sole purpose of
helping with her bedtime routine.
</P>
<P>
   It's the people who show up at the door with barely a glance in
the new infant's direction, calling out, ``Where's my big girl?''
with their arms flung wide, who show they know what real help is
about.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, new moms need encouragement and congratulations as well,
but when it comes to changing diapers, running errands, cleaning
up, or finding a moment to themselves, kind words can't do the job.
But friends and family can, by showering new moms with love in the
form of tangible help.

RHYTHM AND IRON

<P>
   If you like to exercise with a group, you've probably attended
more than a few aerobic classes over the years, from dance to
hip-hop to high energy to low impact.
</P>
<P>
   You may also have tried the popular ``step'' classes offered at
health clubs, where exercisers step up on a plastic bench in a
series of choreographed movements.
</P>
<P>
   But what about weight-lifting? Does the thought of heaving
barbells put you off? What if you were able to do that in a class
where the atmosphere was fun and high energy, and the whole routine
was set to music?
</P>
<P>
   That's the concept of BodyPUMP, an increasingly popular new
exercise program that was developed in New Zealand in 1990 and
introduced in U.S. fitness clubs this year.
</P>
<P>
   BodyPUMP will ``breathe new life into the group fitness
market,'' says Rich Boggs, president of the Step Co. in Marietta,
Ga., which brought the step aerobic program to health clubs in the
early '90s and is marketing the new BodyPUMP program.
</P>
<P>
   Instructors can become certified in the method after attending
three-day workshops, then going through quarterly workshops to
learn new choreography and ensure their workouts are being taught
safely and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Classes are often held in fitness centers' aerobics rooms.
Participants use a specially designed barbell system that allows
them to adjust weights for intensity and fitness levels. They lift
the barbells through a set of choreographed routines that are
designed to work every major muscle group, Boggs said, including
squats, presses, lifts and curls. The bar ranges from 3 pounds
without weights to a maximum of 91 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The focus: correct lifting using light to moderate weights with
high repetitions. ``You don't get big,'' Boggs says. ``Just toned
and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The user-friendly format is attracting females, who
traditionally shy away from free weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``BodyPUMP is the first opportunity for women to strength train
to music,'' says Debbie Lee, general manager at the Fitness
Connection for Women in Gainesville, Fla. ``You don't have to be a
body builder to do it. It's attractive to all groups, from novices
to advanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Classes on average can accommodate 50 participants and last from
45 to 60 minutes. While the routine is not aerobic, the
weight-lifting helps build lean muscle mass, reversing bone loss,
which is increasingly important to women with concerns of
osteoporosis, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Boggs recommends using BodyPUMP as part of a balanced exercise
program, two to three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, see Bogg's company Web site at
www.bodypump.com, or call the Step Co. at (770) 859-9292.

GET A LIFE TO GO WITH YOUR JOB
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Dr. Joy Browne, a licensed psychologist, has joined the New
York Times Syndicate to give your readers the warm, friendly _ and
professional _ advice that she supplies to 9 million listeners in
the United States and Canada through the WOR Radio Network. Her
weekly Q&AMP;A column, ``Dr.Joy,'' will answer readers' questions about
personal relationships that are key in having happy and productive
lives.) 
 By DR. JOY BROWNE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUESTION: I am a 57-year-old bachelor, and have a demanding job
that I enjoy although it leaves me too exhausted to do anything at
night. My company is offering an early retirement package. I'm
thinking of accepting it, but I worry about not having enough to do
with my time and becoming bored and morose. _ Detroit
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Look, if you've been in that job all those years, you
know how to do it. Your exhaustion at the end of the day is most
likely psychological, not physiological.
</P>
<P>
   What I want you to do before making a decision is get yourself a
life. Join a club, work on a political campaign, take dancing
lessons. Get out of the house and see if you can make a life WITH
your job.
</P>
<P>
   My concern is that you have been completely defined by your
work. Take the work away and you may have nothing left. But if you
can define a life for yourself, you'll have the best of all worlds.
You'll likely find your work isn't as time-consuming as you
thought. And if your life outside of work feels just too fabulous,
you can opt for early retirement. Just don't retire from life by
hiding behind work.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My mother died when I was 16, and my father moved out
shortly later. Now 10 years later he lives in South America with a
new wife and three stepdaughters. He never calls, writes or tries
to help me or my sister here in the States. Should I write him out
of my life or call and tell him off? I'm too angry to forgive and
forget, but holding onto this anger is not good. My sister wants
nothing to do with him. What should I do? _ Jersey City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: I would have never guessed that what you're talking
about happened 10 years ago. Clearly you are keeping this anger
alive. Admittedly it is hard to lose your mom. I'm sure you feel
you lost your dad at the same time, but you didn't. Your father
went on with his life, which is a perfectly legitimate thing to do.
My guess is that your behavior was not above reproach, so there may
need to be a little forgiving on both sides. I'd absolutely get in
touch with him. Not for his sake, but for yours.
</P>
<P>
   Beware, however: If you're getting in touch to say, ``Please
send money,'' he's not going to have much to do with you. But say,
``Gee, Dad, I'm now a little older, a little more grown-up. I'd
love to meet your children and your wife and have you as part of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin slowly building a bridge to him. You and your sister don't
have to act in concert. You can act on your own on this.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My closest friend has been involved with a married man
for almost two years. I firmly believe he will never leave his
wife. In fact, he still lives with her! I'm uncomfortable hanging
out with my friend and this man. I disapprove of her affair, but at
the same time I won't turn my back on her. Should I stay out of it
or tell her exactly how I feel? _ Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: You are right when it comes to disapproving of your
friend's adultery, but take care not to lecture her about it.
Sermons and friendships are an unpalatable combination.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bad news. The good news is that you don't have to
listen to her talk about the dude. Tell your friend: ``I will
listen to you talk about anything in your life except George. And I
will hang out with you, but not with George. I'm not against him,
just the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, some months or years from now when it all hits the
fan and she ends up in tears, do her and yourself a favor by NOT
saying ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My ex-husband and his new wife, our former baby
sitter, just had a baby and now he's miffed at ME.
</P>
<P>
   She answered the phone when I called to discuss important
questions about our children's college expenses. I was polite but
businesslike, identifying myself and why I was calling, and
immediately asked to be passed on to her husband. He thinks I
should have chatted, asked about the baby, offered congratulations
_ and sent a baby gift.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's throwing up roadblocks whenever there's a decision
about our children. I've moved ahead with my life and don't want
him and his new family in it. Acting as though we are one big happy
extended family turns my stomach. Is this a question of my bad
manners? _ Lansing, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Good manners are always a worthwhile investment,
especially since this woman is going to be part of your life. You
can minimize wear and tear by contacting your ex at work or through
e-mail. And if your kids are in college they are old enough to make
money-calls to dad on their own.
</P>
<P>
   I know it's tough to be on your best behavior but if you can
behave it will make everyone's life much easier. And your families
are interwoven whether you like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have to send a baby gift? Nah!

Apollo 18 lets you take off for moon 
By Mark Clothier  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If seeing the first senior in space got your
rocket-blood pumping all over again, there's a chance to sustain
the surge with a new interactive software program that simulates an
Apollo moon mission.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 18 was developed by AIM Software with help from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. It's called Apollo
18, the Moon Mission, even though Apollo 18 never went to the moon.
The later Apollo trips were scrapped for lack of money. The 1975
voyage that docked with the Soviet Soyuz spaceship is sometimes
called Apollo 18.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM was developed with technical assistance from NASA,
which includes an authentic Apollo 18 training manual and
realistic, ``Houston, we have a problem'' type radio transmission
audio. The program also includes several landing site choices, an
unlimited number of missions and full flight simulation.
</P>
<P>
   The software program has been released in Europe. An American
release is set for January.
</P>
<P>
   The system requires Windows 95, a Pentium processor, 16
megabytes of RAM, 60 megabytes of hard disk space and a video and a
sound card. AIM has not decided what it will charge for the
software but said it will be moderately priced.
</P>
<P>
   Download time still slow
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered why, even with faster and faster Internet hookups
Web site load time still seems to drag?
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of Yahoo! Internet Life compares load times
among some of the more active Web sites, divided into three sample
searches. The download speed was divided into ``obese,''
``regular'' and ``slim.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sample search was the newsy,
check-your-stocks-while-on-hold search. Included were
http://www.msnbc.com, http://www.cnn.com and http://usatoday
</P>
<P>
   .com.
</P>
<P>
   The MSNBC site was called the ``ultimate porker'' _ very little
text with lots of graphics that cause the articles ``to lumber onto
your screen like Marlon Brando crawling to the summit of Machu
Picchu (a remote, steep site in Peru).'' USA Today's site was
considered the quickest download of the three.
</P>
<P>
   The writer offers tips on how Web designers can speed up their
sites, including avoiding the use of moving images, and offering a
text-only option for those who want just the facts and not the
graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The article also lists a few ways for those downloading the
sites to do it more quickly. You can turn off your browser's
ability to handle the heavy, time-draining graphics. This can be
done under the ``preferences'' option on your browser's tool bar.
It also suggests making your voice heard by sending e-mail to the
sluggish sites, asking them to trim the fat.
</P>
<P>
   A Barbie just for you
</P>
<P>
   Mattel Media has come out with the perfect online diversion for
the controlling but creative mind: design-your-own Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   The site, off of http://www.barbie.com, is sort of Dr.
Frankenstein meets Isaac Mizrahi. It lets you name your Barbie,
give it a personality and a hairstyle, pick its hair and eye color
and decide whether it will smile open- or close-mouthed.
</P>
<P>
   Then it lets you choose the wardrobe. Optional clothing includes
a few pieces from Barbie's denim-heavy cool-and-casual collection,
and a couple of evening selections, a lime-green suit and a purple
and gold ball gown.
</P>
<P>
   The finished product is yours to buy, but kids will need their
parents' approval and a major credit card. Mattel tosses in a
certificate to prove the authenticity of your creation.
</P>
<P>
   My Design Barbie will cost about $40, plus $8 for shipping,
which will take at least six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy group online
</P>
<P>
   A local improvisational comedy group is broadcasting its
one-hour show over the Internet, starting this month.
</P>
<P>
   Whole World Theatre, on Spring Street in Midtown, has been
operating as an improv comedy club since 1994. This month, it
started airing the Saturday night show on the Internet, calling it
``Last Hour Live.''
</P>
<P>
   The Webcast is available from http://
</P>
<P>
   www.ibtv.com. Go there and click on the Whole World Theatre
icon. The Saturday shows start at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Site devoted to books
</P>
<P>
   Oprah made them more popular and Amazon.com made them easier to
buy. Now http://thebookreport.com, a Web site devoted to all things
books, is making it easier to read up on your favorite books and
authors.
</P>
<P>
   The site, an extension of a popular AOL feature, will offer
author interviews, commentary, book reviews and message boards.
</P>
<P>
   Sites devoted to books for kids and teens are expected soon.
They'll be at http://kidsreads.com and http://teenreads.com.

Of mice and merchants 
By Frances Katz  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Let your fingers do the walking this holiday season.
Why not join the millions of shoppers doing their holiday shopping
online? Remember, in cyberspace there are no crowds, no lines, you
can shop at 4 in the morning or 11 at night, and you never have to
worry about finding a place to park.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce _ known to most consumers as online shopping
_ is rapidly becoming a booming business. Whether you're looking
for books, blue jeans, CDs or chocolates, there's a retailer online
to take your order, ring up the purchase and drop the goods at your
door.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll never have to pick up the telephone or see the inside
of a mall.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, online shopping has grown to meet the
needs of Web surfers who increasingly see the Internet as a
utility. The same users who turn to the Web for quick doses of
breaking news or financial information have come to see it as a
place to shop quickly. Purchasing a book on a site like Amazon.com
takes about 10 minutes or less for returning shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Web sites offer ``one click ordering'' that lets you buy an
item, pay for it and log off in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Latour Kadison, a senior online research analyst with
Forrester Research who tracks online retailing trends, says a
handful of savvy retailers were responsible for moving Web shopping
into the mainstream. ``It took the minds of people like Jeff Bezos
at Amazon (http://
</P>
<P>
   www.amazon.com), Michael Dell at Dell Computer
(http://www.dell.com) and the two guys who started CDnow
(http://www.cdnow.com) (brothers Jason and Matthew Olim) to see the
Web is much more than just an information conduit.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest report from Jupiter Communications,
shoppers are expected to spend $2.3 billion online during the 1998
holiday shopping season, more than double the $1.1 billion spent in
1997. However, Jupiter also points out only 16 percent of online
purchases during this period are gift-related, leaving a largely
untapped revenue stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailing got off to a very slow start because it was
these anonymous retailers (online-only stores unfamiliar to
consumers) trying to create a market. But when traditional
marketers like Tower Records (http://www.towerrecords.com), J. Crew
(http://www.jcrew.com) and Barnes &AMP; Noble (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .barnesandnoble.com) saw the value and the volume that could be
generated from online sales, it gave the industry a huge boost
forward,'' says Kadison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon was the leader,'' she says, ``and still is in terms of
online market share. But as access explodes in the next several
years and as all these newbies come online, they are going to look
for brands they know in their offline world.''
</P>
<P>
   Kadison predicts Amazon, CDnow/N2K and other Web-only retailers
will have to work twice as hard to establish their brands offline
as traditional names set up shop on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Kadison says Web retailing has introduced a need for increased
speed and convenience. Surfers no longer want to wait for long
downloads or fumble through badly designed Web sites. They expect
slick, easy-to-use sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The utility that consumers are finding is convenience,'' she
says. ``That's the most important factor to online consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, group director of Jupiter's digital commerce
group, says as the online shopping market matures, retailers will
shift their strategy from acquiring shoppers to building online
loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   She says the gift-giving season is an excellent time to foster
loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online retailers have been successful in capturing dollars
consumers spend on themselves,'' she says. ``But they have been
unsuccessful in getting those same customers to spend gift dollars
online.'' She thinks services such as gift registries and other
holiday services such as gift wrapping might do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winners from the losers online will be separated by
excellent technology backing up your brand strategy,'' Kadison
says. ``The top three things shoppers want are convenience, ease of
research and competitive prices. As more and more familiar
retailers such as Land's End and Nordstrom come online, it becomes
more convenient for users, and the security fears go down because
of the reputations of these established brands.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though the Web is a way to do almost anything quickly
and efficiently, it's still a lot of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Web is fun and utilitarian,'' says Kadison. ``You
can do your grocery shopping online and log off right away. But you
can also play games and do other things. It's absolutely both.
That's why the Internet is going to become such a huge part of our
lives in the next century, because it serves such a variety of
needs.''

 &HT;    RUSSIA TO LAUNCH FIRST COMPONENT OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION
 &HT;    EDs: Optional add begins at 780 words.
 &HT;    With SPACE-MIR-1119; SPACE-STATION-1119.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Considering Russia's deep economic troubles, it will be
the shot the world never quite expected to hear.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday(Nov. 20), a Russian Proton rocket is scheduled to
blast off carrying the first component of the world's grandest
peacetime project, the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The space complex, to be assembled in earth's orbit, will take
nearly six years to complete by a consortium of 16 nations.
Although the greatest burden -- both technically and financially --
is being carried by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The unmanned Zarya module will be launched from Russia's version
of Cape Canaveral, the launch site at Baikonur, in the former
Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. Zarya, which will provide power for
the fledgling station, was built in Russia with American assistance
and financed with $190 million from NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Like the first piece in a giant erector set, Zarya (Russian for
``sunrise'') will be added to in coming years with components
brought by U.S. shuttles and Russian rockets. The result in 2004
will be a 460-ton station stretching the length of two football
fields. The final construction costs could top $40 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's scheduled launch is a milestone that did not come
easily. Russia's economic crisis forced delays. NASA was compelled
to pledge a face-saving bailout of $660 million to complete Russian
construction of a living-quarters service module to be launched
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics fear it is merely the first of many problems to come and
the result of a space policy based on international politics rather
than American scientific aims. Already the space station is 18
months behind schedule, largely due to Russia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certainly more problems involved in doing it this
way. But it is worth it. International cooperation succeeds because
we share the burdens and we share the benefits. It's a small
planet, and it is getting smaller,'' said Mike Baker, a shuttle
astronaut and head of NASA's human space flight program office in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Russia has been the leader in space endurance
flights, beginning in 1971? with its Salyut series of space
stations and since 1986 with Mir. With the country's economy a
wreck and future funding for their space program in doubt, the
Russians are sensitive about their role playing second fiddle to
NASA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a year or even less, three modules will be in orbit and
then few people will recall these problems,'' said Alexei Krasnov
of the Russian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, America's efforts toward a space station began in
1984, when it was proposed by President Reagan not long after he
branded the Soviet Union the ``evil empire'' and initiated research
on Star Wars, the high-tech plan for an orbital defense against
nuclear missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cold War ended with the collapse of the Soviet Union in
1991, and America and Russia became co-dependent partners -- the
United States had the money and space shuttle; the Russians had
space-station experience aboard Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems that have bedeviled the 12-year-old Mir, or
perhaps because they have been overcome, space remains one of the
few arenas in which Russians can proudly point out their
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the field of manned space missions, they are at the very
top because of their experience with Mir and the previous space
stations. It is experience that nobody else in this world has,''
said Alain Fournier-Sicro, director of the Moscow office of the
European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the International Space Station actually
began in 1995, when American astronauts started living aboard Mir.
Seven U.S. astronauts spent almost 27 months on the station,
gaining technical and operational experience.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more importantly, they learned how the Russians worked
-- desperately mending the problem-plagued station and taking risks
that some American officials felt were too high.
</P>
<P>
   James Oberg, a former space engineer and author, claims America
is playing ``Russian roulette'' by committing itself to cooperation
at a time when the Russian space program is crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the Russian civilian space budget was $3.2 billion,
according to the Russian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now our state budget is like that of a Third World country,''
said Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency. ``Not in a
single year have we got the money we were promised. We're getting
one-fourteenth of what we got in 1989.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is not good, obviously,'' NASA's Baker said in
an interview with Cox News Service. ``They keep telling us they
will keep up their commitments. Time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Finances aside, multinational cooperation has generated
world-class headaches. There are myriad details and construction
schedules to coordinate in America, Russia and other countries,
astronaut training to conduct and shuttle and rocket launches to
plan. And cumbersome language barriers to contend with as engineers
and astronauts often must work via interpreters.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Space Agency and NASA even had difficulty deciding
when and whether to hold a pre-launch press conference this week.
</P>
<P>
   But on a grand scale, the International Space Station is the
stuff of pre-Space Age fantasy. The result will be a maze-like
station circling the globe and inhabited by an international team
of astronauts and scientists working for the welfare of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials suggest it will pave the way for a manned mission
to Mars later in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Four space station crews are now in training, spending about 60
percent of their time at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and
the rest at the Russian space training facilities at Star City,
near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is irrational to duplicate efforts, senseless not to unite
our experience and resources,'' said German Titov, Russia's second
man in space and now a member of parliament. ``Space is there for
everybody. Let's make one international system for everyone's
use.''

 &HT;    TROUBLED MIR TO COME DOWN TO EARTH AS NEW SPACE STATION GOES UP
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-SPACE-1119; SPACE-STATION-1119.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As the new International Space Station goes up, Russian
space officials are trying to decide just when to bring down their
battered but beloved Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities have announced that they intend to bring the
12-year-old Mir station to earth in mid-1999, concluding its
service with a fiery re-entry into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But some Russian officials believe Mir should remain aloft, as a
symbol of Russian autonomy in space, and as a hedge against delays
in completion of the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at Mir's history:
</P>
<P>
   1986 -- Mir's 20-ton central module is launched into orbit; with
an estimated life-span of five years, Mir replaces the series of
smaller Salyut space stations operated by the Soviet Union in the
1970s and '80s
</P>
<P>
   1987 -- The 11-ton Kvant-1 module, with astrophysics and
life-support equipment, is launched and added to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   1989 -- A biological research station, the 20-ton Kvant-2
module, is attached to Mir.
</P>
<P>
   1990 -- The 20-ton Kristall research module is launched and
added to Mir; Soviet authorities shelve plans to launch a Mir-2
space station as talks proceed with international partners on
building an international space station.
</P>
<P>
   1991 -- The Soviet Union collapses; ensuing economic problems
prompt Russia to begin talks with United States on sharing Mir.
</P>
<P>
   1994 -- Russia and the U.S. agree to joint missions aboard Mir,
with NASA paying $500 million to subsidize the Russian program; a
docking module is added to Mir to allow link-up with American space
shuttles.
</P>
<P>
   1995 -- In February, the shuttle Discovery docks with Mir; In
May, Mir expands with the 20-ton Spektr module, carrying Russian
and American research equipment
</P>
<P>
   1996 -- Launch of the 20-ton Priroda research module.
</P>
<P>
   1997 -- On Feb. 23, a flash-fire occurs aboard Mir, the first in
a series of mishaps culminating on June 25, when the unmanned
Progress cargo ship collides with Spektr, nearly forcing the crew
of two Russian cosmonauts and American astronaut Michael Foale to
evacuate Mir.
</P>
<P>
   June 1998 -- The final U.S. mission to Mir as the shuttle
Discovery picks up the seventh and last American astronaut to serve
on Mir, Andrew Thomas, on board since January.
</P>
<P>
   1999 -- Sometime in the summer or fall, after 13 years of
service and clocking more than 2 billion miles, Mir is scheduled to
be pushed into a lower orbit and then disintegrate as it falls into
earth's atmosphere.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The world's most ambitious construction project begins
Friday(Nov. 20), more than 200 miles above the earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   The International Space Station is scheduled to be assembled
over the next five years at an ultimate cost that could run $40
billion to $90 billion. More than 100 components will be launched
on dozens of flights by and American space shuttles and Russian
booster rockets.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a 460-ton space research station will take shape --
five times larger than the Russian space station Mir. It will be
the third brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and
Venus.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in 2004, as scheduled, the complex will include a
dozen interlocking modules providing living quarters, research
laboratories and support equipment -- interior space equivalent to
two 747 jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   THE CONSTRUCTION PLAN:
</P>
<P>
   Friday -- The first space station component, Zarya, (Russian for
``sunrise'') is to be launched aboard a Russian Proton rocket from
Russia's version of Cape Canaveral, the launch site at Baikonur, in
the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan. Zarya will provide
initial propulsion and power for the station. It was built by a
Russian company under contract to Boeing and financed by NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Early December -- The space shuttle Endeavour will ferry the
Unity module to link it with Zarya. Two astronauts will perform
three spacewalks over five days to connect data and power lines.
Unity, built by Boeing, is a hub unit that will interlock with six
other station components.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-1999 -- Russia is scheduled to launch the main service
module, though the country's economic problems have put the target
date in jeopardy. The module will contain living quarters,
navigation and life-support systems, and rocket boosters to
periodically nudge the station back into its proper orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Through early 2000 -- Shuttle missions and Russian rockets will
transport components to expand the station, including labs, solar
energy-collecting panels, a Soyuz return vehicle, communications
systems and a robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   March 2000-January 2004 -- Labs from Japan and the European
Space Agency will be added, along with U.S.-built living quarters
big enough for a permanent crew of seven.
</P>
<P>
   THE PRICETAG:
</P>
<P>
   Latest estimates put the cost at about $40 billion, more than
half to be paid by the United States. As Russia struggles in its
current economic crisis, Americans may well pay more. If the cost
of operating and servicing the shuttle fleet is included, the total
estimate rises to over $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Also joining the project are Japan, Canada, Brazil and 11
nations of the European Space Agency: Italy, Germany, France,
Britain, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden
and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   NASA said earlier this year that American costs would likely be
about $21.3 billion and an independent study commissioned by the
agency suggested in April that United States costs could climb as
high as $24.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The original Russian contribution to the program was expected to
be $8 billion to $10 billion before the current economic crisis.
The other partners' shares amount to about $3.1 billion from Japan;
$850 million from Canada; and $3.8 billion from the European group,
with a separate $550 million from Italy.

DON'T TAKE THAT $20 BILL TO THE LAUNDRY  
 BIOGRAPHICAL ENHANCEMENT  
 BONDING IN CALIFORNIA

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   When the Treasury Department issued a redesigned $20 bill in
September, officials said the new notes would help thwart
counterfeiting by keeping ahead of digital printing technology. But
are they also thwarting digital automation?
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no vending machines that accept twenties accept the
new bills. And it will be well into next year before they do, said
Thomas McMahon, vice president of Washington relations for the
National Automatic Machines Association, a trade group representing
vending-machine manufacturers and owners.
</P>
<P>
   About 100,000 merchandise vending machines accept $20 bills, as
do many change makers and digital vending machines, which dispense
so-called smart cards _ debit cards that can be used to do laundry,
pay highway tolls and use mass transit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm told by members they were not given samples early
enough,'' McMahon said. As a result, vending machine manufacturers
are scrambling to refit their machines, which can require fixes
from a simple software patch to an upgrade of the optical device
that reads the bills. Vending-machine manufacturers would have used
the samples to test their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, the Treasury Department invited vending-machine
manufacturers to bring sample machines to Washington to test the
new bills. About 100 companies participated in three sessions held
over the summer, said Edward Sheehan, a spokesman for the
Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've given the bill-acceptor industry plenty of notice,''
Sheehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury, he said, insists on maintaining control and would
never have agreed to send out samples of the new twenties before
Sept. 24, when the bills were released to the public. ``If we're
missing one note, there's an investigation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said that it would take two to six months for
manufacturers to upgrade the machines. On average, the cost for
each machine is $50. He added that he hoped the industry and the
Treasury could work out a compromise before redesigned $1 and $5
bills come out in a few years. ``This is a major issue for us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, just be sure to carry plenty of change.

   The Name Was Doctored, and So Were the Credentials
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the name isn't the only thing made up about Robert
X. Cringely, the writer and television personality whose newest
series, ``Nerds 2.0.1: A Brief History of the Internet,'' begins on
PBS next week.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle reported last week that Mark
Stephens, who writes under the Cringely name, had not been a
professor at Stanford University and had not earned a doctorate
there, as he had claimed. He responded in a statement: ``The fact
is I never did finish those final touches on my dissertation and
therefore do not technically have a Ph.D. from Stanford. A new fact
has now become painfully clear to me: You don't say you have the
Ph.D. unless you really have the Ph.D.''
</P>
<P>
   Cringely is often identified as a former Stanford professor in
biographical materials and was described that way on the jacket of
his 1993 book, ``Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley
Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition, and Still Can't
Get a Date.''
</P>
<P>
   But a university spokeswoman said that Stephens had worked as a
teaching assistant and earned only a master's degree.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for PBS, which runs a column by the writer and
promotes his television work, has now revised his online biography
(www.pbs.org/cringely).
</P>
<P>
   ``As everyone knows, Cringely is a vital part of the Silicon
Valley scene,'' a spokesman for PBS said. ``We feel that the extent
to which he completed his doctoral requirements at Stanford and his
teaching status there do not affect the stature of his television
work.''
</P>
<P>
   A gossip column in the computer trade magazine InfoWorld gave
birth to the pseudonym Robert X. Cringely. Stephens inherited the
job as writer of the column in the mid-'80s.
</P>
<P>
   The Cringely name was originally added to the magazine's
masthead as a joke earlier in the decade, ``to see how much mail we
got,'' said Sandy Reed, the editor-in-chief. It then became a
byline for the column.
</P>
<P>
   After Stephens was dismissed from the job in 1995, the magazine
sued him for trademark infringement for continuing to use the
Cringely name. He countersued, and in a settlement agreement he was
allowed to continue using the name as long as it was not used in a
competing publication.
</P>
<P>
   The column continues under the Cringely name, but with a
different author. Ms. Reed said the column would spoof the
revelations about Stephens in the upcoming issue.

   Reporters Get the Story on Silicon Real Estate
</P>
<P>
   In what could be the start of a new trend among
computer-industry chiefs, both Cisco's John Chambers and Oracle's
Larry Ellison have invited reporters to their homes for private
tete-a-tetes in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first, held on Nov. 6 for some California-style bonding
at Chambers' rambling mansion in the foothills overlooking the
Silicon Valley, the high point was a series of contests.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two dozen reporters were divided into a half-dozen teams,
and each was joined by an executive from Cisco. One task was for
each team to design an egg package that would allow the egg to
withstand being dropped from the roof of Chambers' garage. Two of
the teams flunked this engineering test.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison, for his part, invited some 15 reporters to gather last
Wednesday at one of his two houses. (A third home, a palatial
estate in Woodside, Calif., is still under construction.) For this
event, the venue was Ellison's high-tech four-story pied-a-terre in
San Francisco's posh Pacific Heights neighborhood, overlooking the
Golden Gate Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ellison, known for an almost obsessive rivalry with
Bill Gates of Microsoft, conceded that he could not match the
38-car-garage expansiveness of Gates' legendary digital manse on
Lake Washington outside Seattle, the Ellison house does have
noteworthy electronic features.
</P>
<P>
   For example, visitors are greeted at a glass front door that is
made opaque by liquid crystal display technology. At a command from
inside, however, the opacity gives way to a clear pane that reveals
an interior courtyard that has been designed in the style of a
Japanese rock garden.

Online shopping becomes practical 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Opening day of trout season, the first football game
of the year and the start of school are all major occasions. But
none of them touch _ for both excitement and panic _ the beginning
of the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us will end up spending Christmas Eve, elbow-to-elbow,
with other members of the last-minute club. There have always been
alternatives, including using catalogs to order gifts by mail.
Within the past few years, shopping online has become a practical
option.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a veteran online shopper, then you already have a
long list of favorite sites. But if this is the year you will make
your first tentative steps into the world of online commerce, then
may we suggest a cautious entry. Let's take a look today at some
stores you already know, along with an online merchant known for
fast and efficient service. If these first steps prove helpful,
you'll soon be recommending sites of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop, L.L. Bean, didn't invent catalog shopping but
for many years it has been a favorite stop for holiday shoppers.
You'll find the Bean site at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .llbean.com/. Once you are there, you'll be able to view any
product in the catalog and, if you like what you see, you can place
your order online.
</P>
<P>
   The Bean site is worthwhile even if you feel more comfortable
ordering from a catalog and dealing with a customer service
representative by telephone. You can get a quick look at what's
available and then, if you like what you see, order a catalog at
the click of a mouse button.
</P>
<P>
   If you live in a metro area, you have undoubtedly shopped at
Macy's. You can have most of that shopping experience online. All
that's missing from the electronic version of the store are the
escalators and the canned holiday music. If you drop in at
http://www.macys.com you'll find the familiar departments of the
store, everything from the jewelry counter to the men's department.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, while browsing the men's department, the Claiborne
Menswear Three-Button ``Bedford'' Sportcoat with Cord Effect at
$152 catches your eye. The next step would be to select a size from
36 to 46 and then click on a button to add the item to your virtual
shopping cart. Then when you're ready to place the order, simply
fill in the charge card information, and your shopping trip is
done.
</P>
<P>
   While you have never gone shopping in a brick-and-stone version
of Amazon.com, this online bookstore is worth a stop. Not
surprisingly, you'll find it at http://www.amazon.com. But you may
be surprised at the massive selection of books and music available
here, along with the speed your order is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   One advantage to this online version of the store is it is a lot
easier to find things than in a regular bookstore. You can search
by author, title or keyword. The savvy folks at Amazon.com know the
holiday business amounts to a disproportionate amount of the year's
revenues. Another nice touch is, once your order is shipped, you'll
get an e-mail telling you to watch for it. Delivery times vary, but
some books arrive in as little as two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, for those of you with the budget of a newspaperman,
there's Wal-Mart. The excellent site at http://www.wal-mart
</P>
<P>
   .com/ does a good job of duplicating the stock you'd find at a
typical Wal-Mart store. And you'll be able to find the closest
Wal-Mart store to your home, or you can send in your resume to work
for the massive retailer.
</P>
<P>
   And Wal-Mart, taking into account the fear some shoppers have of
online shopping, guarantees the store will pay for any fraudulent
credit card charges not covered by the company that issues your
card.

GET READY FOR E-BILLING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DIGICOM-COLUMN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prepare for the next Internet feeding frenzy. Sharks from
several industries are already circling the nascent market for
products and services that will enable consumers to receive and pay
their monthly bills online.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic billing systems are expected not only to save
merchants and banks billions of dollars in printing, paper and
postage costs, but also to save time and deliver a new level of
convenience for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And the customer base is already a captive audience. By some
reports, 60 percent of the 62 billion pieces of first-class mail
delivered annually by the U.S. Postal Service are bills.
</P>
<P>
   Calculating, verifying, creating, mailing, collecting and
processing those 37 billion statements have been estimated to cost
$370 billion _ an average of $10 a bill, according to the report
``On Bills, Banks and Bill (Gates),'' published by Diamond
Technology Partners (www.diamtech.com), a Chicago-based consulting
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond estimates that presenting and paying bills
electronically could save 10 percent of that amount _ a huge
incentive for large companies, in particular, to embrace e-billing.
Merchants have already said they would be willing to pay as much as
40 cents a bill for such a service, instantly creating a market
with a $15 billion potential.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Netscape Communications Corp. announced plans to
offer Web-based e-billing software for online sellers. Transpoint,
a joint venture of Microsoft Corp., First Data Corp. and Citigroup,
plans to introduce its e-bill service this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And the Integrion Financial Network, a consortium of banks,
financial services and technology companies including Checkfree,
IBM, RSA Data Security and Visa USA, is preparing to start an
e-bill pilot with one of its owners, Bank One, in January.
</P>
<P>
   One version of an e-bill system would allow merchants to send
monthly bills in an e-mail format that could be forwarded directly
to a customer running bill-payment software like Quicken from
Intuit. Another would allow consumers to view all their bills from
one Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But the potential impact of e-bills could be much more
significant than cost savings and simple convenience.
</P>
<P>
   William Fenimore, chief executive and managing director of
Integrion, says that although e-bills are inevitable, such sweeping
change comes slowly to big financial institutions. ``The biller
community is further ahead than the banking community in terms of
distributing these bills and getting them paid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And that disparity presents an opportunity for the law of
unintended consequences to kick in.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the Internet has given many different kinds of
companies _ from Microsoft and Intuit, to brokerage firms and
insurance companies _ the ability to offer financial services more
cheaply and without the regulations, including those governing
consumer privacy, that banks and other financial institutions must
obey.
</P>
<P>
   Because merchants and financial institutions are unlikely to
build e-bill technology themselves, many will be forced to yield
their precious customer data to a technology or service provider _
Microsoft's Transpoint venture, for example _ to run the system for
them.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, companies like Integrion, with owners that are almost
all banks, are a hedge against that. But that hedge may not hold.
Once companies start delivering digital bills, says Gordon Bell, a
senior researcher for Microsoft, other opportunities present
themselves rather quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bell says he has for years encouraged Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, to create a version of the Checkfree service. ``The other
thing is to give WebTV away to do just this kind of thing, with a
bank account or whatever,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say that such opportunities will forever change
the balance of power between customers and merchants. Referring to
software applications, Chunka Mui, a partner in Diamond Technology,
said, ``The real reason this is a killer app is because the
technology provides a platform for doing other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Mui predicts that e-bill systems will start a new ``aggregator''
business that enables people to pay all their bills online in one
place, rather than with individual merchants all over the Web _ as
well as allowing those merchants to deliver precisely aimed junk
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these folks are talking about how this becomes the
marketing machine from heaven,'' he said. ``What they don't
understand is that once these bills are in digital form, they are
infinitely controllable by the customer. It won't take 25 seconds
for someone to realize, `I could make a lot of money selling a
filter for this junk.'''
</P>
<P>
   What is more, he said, ``It would only take another 25 seconds
to say, `Hey, if I work for the customer and not for the merchants,
maybe I can create an alliance of consumers.'''
</P>
<P>
   To date, there are few consumer bill aggregators. One new
start-up, Cyberbills.com in Santa Clara, Calif., recently began a
consumer service that sends customers all their bills
electronically.
</P>
<P>
   Mui says that such a service _ started as a cost-saver for
merchants _ is actually ``stealth technology,'' a first step in
returning the power over personal information to consumers who are
tired of being bombarded with e-mail spam and junk advertising in
all media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about aggregating power,'' says Mui. ``It's not about
selling information to merchants. It's about going to the people
and saying, `I know what you've bought _ let's do price comparisons
for shopping, let's provide a direct connection to the seller when
you have problems, things like that. This bill becomes the
interface for so much _ it's a tremendous window onto the
electronic world.''

Netscape top browser _ for now 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's been a neck-and-neck race between Microsoft's
Internet Explorer and Netscape's Communicator for the title of best
browser for the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   For the past six months, Internet Explorer held the title but
now Netscape has regained the technology lead. That's the opinion
of several Mac reviewers and Walter Mossberg, the esteemed personal
computing columnist for The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   All note, though, Netscape's lead is small and Microsoft has
already said it plans to copy many of the new features added by
Netscape in its next Mac version of Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   However fleeting, Communicator version 4.5 leads for now.
Communicator is really a suite of applications that includes an
e-mail program, newsgroup reader and, of course, the Navigator
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The big reason Communicator has momentarily edged out Microsoft
is a new technology called Smart Browsing. In essence, Smart
Browsing lets you find Web sites and information without typing in
complex Internet addresses. There are two primary parts of Smart
Browsing.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the ability to find sites by typing in common
names. For example, in the narrow location window, type in Apple
Computer and Navigator will take you to the company's home page.
There's no longer any need to type http://www.apple.com.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Browsing isn't perfect by a long shot, but it worked for
me most of the time. When stumped, Smart Browsing will bring up a
search results page.
</P>
<P>
   The other big part of Smart Browsing is a new button at the far
right-hand corner of the title bar. It's called What's Related.
Click on it and the Navigator will present you with a list of
similar sites.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while at the Macsurfer site, I clicked What's
Related. In a split second, it compiled a list of such sites as
MacIntouch, MacFixit and MacCentral.
</P>
<P>
   All of these sites were truly related and worthwhile. They are
presented in a pop-up list when you click on the What's Related
button. You can jump to any site listed by highlighting and
releasing.
</P>
<P>
   Navigator is now part of a large suite of software, which
includes an e-mail program called Messenger. This program too has
been improved. It now lets you quickly view messages without
opening them. The program will also automatically fill in e-mail
addresses from your address book after you type in the first few
letters.
</P>
<P>
   You can check all this out for yourself, for Navigator and its
fuller Communications suite remain free. You can download them from
Netscape's home page at http://www.netscape.com.

THE MICROSOFT-INTEL CHRONICLES: RIFT AND RECONCILIATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft trial is not merely a legal prizefight. With its
parade of witnesses and mountains of documents, it has opened a
window to the inner workings of Microsoft Corp. and how it deals
with the rest of the computer industry, raw material for a
digital-age ``Dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week's episode: Family Feud.
</P>
<P>
   The story told in a federal courtroom in Washington was how,
from the spring of 1995 to the summer of 1996, an extraordinary
rift developed between Microsoft and Intel Corp. _ partners in the
most lucrative business relationship in modern capitalism _ and how
it was patched up.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, people in the computer industry knew about the
Microsoft-Intel split over multimedia software developed by Intel,
called ``native signal processing,'' or NSP.
</P>
<P>
   But the depth of the rift, its significance and the personal
animosities involved were not really apparent until last week with
the testimony of an executive of Intel and internal e-mail and
documents from both companies that were submitted as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The crack in the partnership was repaired personally by the
chief executives of the two companies, Bill Gates of Microsoft and
Andrew Grove of Intel, over lengthy dinners, which included
shouting matches and frequent e-mail dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Intel backed down from a technology initiative that
Grove once described in an e-mail to Gates as ``key to the growth
of the PC industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust issue in the case is: Why did that happen? The
government argues that the Intel episode demonstrates how Microsoft
unfairly uses its market muscle to bend the industry to its will _
in this case even Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing so sinister, Microsoft scoffs. Intel, Microsoft says,
was eventually persuaded to stop pushing a misguided technology
effort that could have hobbled the rollout of new personal
computers running Windows 95, the operating system Microsoft
released in August 1995. It was a decision that assuredly helped
Microsoft, the company admits, but it was also in Intel's
enlightened self-interest because the giant chip maker's main
business is selling new computers powered by Intel microprocessors,
and the increased demands of each new iteration of Windows sends
buyers scurrying to buy more powerful computers.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Microsoft and Intel often debate which technology
standards to champion. But the debate over NSP became a more public
and a more significant issue than most. Intel's senior executives
had declared at industry conferences that NSP could help encourage
more households to buy personal computers because improving audio
and video performance would make ``the PC sing and dance.''
</P>
<P>
   And as a software effort, NSP was clearly seen by Microsoft as
an unwelcome foray into its domain. ``The main issue was that it
was crucial software that Microsoft did not control,'' said Richard
Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm in Seaford,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail submitted in court sheds light on the ambivalence in
the Microsoft-Intel relationship, painting an environment in which
they circle each other warily. There is mutual distrust and
personal sniping on both sides. Yet ultimately, the benefits to
both sides of the sometimes bumpy ``Wintel'' partnership led them
back to a pragmatic accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   By April 1995, Microsoft had awakened to the potential
significance of Intel's NSP effort. After a meeting with Microsoft
executives, Gerald Holzhammer, an Intel executive, wrote in an
e-mail to his colleagues on April 13, 1995, that Microsoft was
``upset with us being in `their' operating system space _ no
surprise there.''
</P>
<P>
   By May, Gates decided to protest directly to Grove. In an e-mail
on May 25, 1995, Gates called NSP ``a significant problem here that
is on a path to get a lot worse.'' Clearly upset by software being
developed at the Intel Architecture Labs in Hillsboro, Ore., he
complained to Grove, ``I don't understand why Intel funds a group
that is against Windows 95.'' Later, he added, ``In software you
have a group that won't allow us to lead and has all the prestige
and profits of Intel to drive them forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Gates' e-mail, Paul Maritz, a senior Microsoft
executive, noted on the same day that there was ``a strong faction
within Intel'' that wanted to use NSP as a step toward expanding
Intel's intellectual property claims in the industry. ``We have to
be very careful about this,'' Maritz wrote in his e-mail to Gates
and others, ``given our recent discussions about needing balance to
Intel in the market'' _ an apparent reference to Microsoft's work
with other chip makers to keep Intel from becoming more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, 1995, Grove made his appeal for NSP to Gates. Terming
it ``key to the growth of the PC industry,'' Grove added that while
Microsoft and Intel had ``differences of opinion on the detailed
approach,'' he was confident that the two companies could resolve
them.
</P>
<P>
   In a philosophical digression, Grove wrote, ``I think Microsoft
and Intel have special responsibilities toward the PC industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he added: ``If you believe that what we are trying to do
is good for the industry, please help us (plural us: Intel and
Microsoft and whoever else needs to participate) achieve it. Merely
being critical of what we have undertaken is not helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 22, 1995, Maritz wrote to Ron Whittier, an Intel
executive, to inform Intel of Microsoft's stance on NSP in no
uncertain terms. Microsoft, he wrote, had told personal computer
makers that ``we have major issues with NSP and our advice to them
is NOT to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   On July 7, 1995, Gates sent an e-mail to a group of Microsoft
executives briefing them on a three-hour dinner with Grove two days
earlier in San Jose, Calif. ``Fundamentally,'' Gates began, ``Intel
and Microsoft have not been doing a very good job of working with
each other in most areas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The main problem between us right now is NSP,'' Gates wrote.
``We are trying to convince them to basically not ship NSP.''
</P>
<P>
   Not known for being awed by the intelligence of others, Gates
included an aside about Grove: ``Although Andy is super-smart in
software-related areas and in some aspects of the PC market, it is
amazing what he doesn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   By August 1995, when Windows 95 was released, Microsoft's
pressure on Intel and personal computer makers to step back from
NSP had succeeded, Steven McGeady, an Intel vice president
testified last week. By then, McGeady said, he believed Intel's NSP
program had been ``shot in the head.''
</P>
<P>
   In an Oct. 18, 1995, e-mail, Gates told several executives that
Intel felt that after Microsoft's ``NSP chill'' personal computer
makers would not do anything to fine-tune their machines to exploit
Intel's new multimedia chip, the MMX, for Windows 95 ``unless we
say it's OK.'' Gates added, ``This is good news,'' because it meant
the computer makers ``are listening to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular meetings between Gates and Grove continued. While
conflicts persisted, especially over what Microsoft viewed as
Intel's support for its rivals in the Internet software business,
like Netscape Communications Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., the
Microsoft-Intel relationship clearly was on the mend after the NSP
issue was settled.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9, 1996, Gates wrote an e-mail to his senior executives,
briefing them on a two and a half hour meeting he had had two days
earlier with Grove. ``Our relationship with Intel is advancing on
many fronts,'' Gates began in a lengthy e-mail sent at 10:26 p.m.
on a Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The strengthening of the Microsoft-Intel relationship was a
message Gates was eager to communicate to a wider audience. He and
Grove had recently given a chummy performance for Fortune magazine.
He passed this along in his e-mail to his colleagues: ``The Fortune
magazine coming out in a week features a joint interview with Andy
and I where we are very friendly to each other.''

 Amazon Expands For the Holidays  
 By Jamie Beckett   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Online bookseller Amazon.com is opening up an Internet boutique,
just in time for the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning today, shoppers who go to Amazon.com for the latest
best-seller will have the option of sticking around to buy a
PalmPilot, a digital camera or even a Barbie doll. The Seattle
merchant is expanding _ for the holiday season only _ to offer
toys, games and electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Amazon.com will redesign its site to permanently add
more than 60,000 video titles to its product line.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the move could help Amazon _ which hasn't yet
turned a profit _ go into the black sooner. ``It's all about
establishing long-term relationships with Internet shoppers,'' said
Jae Kim, an analyst at Paul Kagan &AMP; Associates in Carmel. Winning
online customers is expensive, but Amazon.com can profit by holding
onto customers and persuading them to buy more on the site, Kim
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com first moved beyond books in June, when it started
selling music CDs on its site. Within three months of the launch,
music sales topped $14 million, putting Amazon.com ahead of rivals
CDNow and Music Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The wider expansion beginning today had been expected since
August, when Amazon.com made two purchases, Junglee Corp. and
PlanetAll, that it said would help turn it into an Internet
shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Junglee, formerly located in Sunnyvale, makes a database
software program that lets Internet surfers comparison shop.
PlanetAll provides a Web-based address book, calendar and reminder
service to 1.5 million subscribers. At the time, Amazon.com said it
planned to use the technologies to personalize the shopping
experience and to make it possible to buy practically anything at
its site.
</P>
<P>
   But Amazon.com spokesman Bill Curry said yesterday the holiday
store does not use the Junglee or PlanetAll technologies and is not
intended to turn the bookseller into an Internet Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Among items Amazon.com will sell in its gift shop are Dilbert
dolls, Motorola Walkie Talkies, Nintendo video games, Panasonic DVD
players and Sony Walkman stereos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a select list of gifts our customers have told us
they're interested in,'' Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   The online shop will include services such as free batteries and
a gift matcher to help shoppers pick their holiday purchases.

   Flatter, faster, lighter, cheaper and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the words that will be uttered countless thousands of
times this week as 220,000 people descend on Las Vegas to try to
make sense of some 100,000 new or enhanced technology products on

   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates kicked off the six-day geekfest
last night with a keynote speech that turned into an 80-minute
infomercial for upcoming Microsoft products like Office 2000, SQL
Server 7.0 and Windows CE. Unlike spring Comdex, where a Windows 98
demo crashed, this time everything worked.
</P>
<P>
   Aided by videotaped appearances by talk show host Jay Leno and
director George Lucas, Gates said the future of technology depends
on keeping the average consumer in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're enhancing people's lives, connecting people from Maine
to mainland China,'' Gates said. ``But as computers become more
powerful, we must keep them simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Comdex is the high-tech industry's chance to show off products
and give consumers a glimpse of the gadgets they'll covet in the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   One buzzword is flatter, for flat panel displays. These computer
monitors, as thin as a book, are expected to be one of the hottest
items during the six-day trade show because they've dropped below
$1,000 for the first time, making them half of what they cost last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Optiquest Inc. for example, will unveil a 15.1-inch liquid LCD
display that is only three inches deep, 75 percent thinner than a
standard computer monitor. Other manufacturers like Sony, IBM and
Panasonic are also displaying new flat panel screens, which are
expected to be hot sellers next year as they get cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're able to reclaim four square feet off any desk where
you have one of those big monitors, that's prime real estate,''
said William Sell, general manager of Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibitors will show off faster 40-speed CD-ROMs that can write
and rewrite data like a floppy disk, and the next-generation DVD
players. Advanced digital cameras, universal serial bus devices and
speech recognition products are also expected to be hot items at
this year's show.
</P>
<P>
   Faster also applies to new handheld PalmPilots and similar
devices that boot up instantly, Sells said. In fact, the show has
created a new ``instant on'' category on the show floor for such
devices.
</P>
<P>
   Another hot-button item will be lighter notebook computers from
makers like Hewlett-Packard, which will show off an ultra-light
1.4-pound notebook with 10 hours of batterly life, said analyst Tim
Bajarin, president of Creative Strategies Research International of
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, Toshiba and Sony will also weigh in with mini-notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Although attendance is expected to be slightly up this year,
companies from economically strapped Asia are sending smaller
contingents to Comdex.
</P>
<P>
   And some big U.S. companies have opted to go smaller rather than
competing in the din of the big showroom floors.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp., for one, decided against having a booth for the
first time in years. Instead, the chipmaker will try to inspire the
computer industry to think ``out of the box'' by showing some
concept PCs in odd shapes and colors. The machines, running Intel's
next generation technology, are designed to show how computers can
be both attractive and easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can get value out of the show, without having the
full-blown booth,'' said Intel spokesman Bill Calder.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's main presence will come when its chief executive, Craig
Barrett, delivers an unconventional keynote on Tuesday. He'll serve
on the ``Technically Incorrect'' panel with, among others, comedian
Bill Maher and magician Penn Jillette.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies say their booths _ which are expensive to buy,
set up and staff _ are not worth the effort. But they still send
representatives, as Comdex is the one place the entire computer
industry gathers, and attendees' PalmPilots have already filled
with appointments.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, for example, dropped out of Comdex after last year's show
because it had become too big for Big Blue. Still, IBM spokesman
Dave Berman said the company will have a ``very limited presence''
in town, hosting a Tuesday lunch briefing tomorrow on new software
products for Windows 2000 and Lotus.
</P>
<P>
   This year's show may also test technology against the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Every November, the Leonid meteor shower lights up the night
sky. But every 32 or 33 years, the Leonids provide an even more
spectacular display. Their last major storm came in 1966, before
hundreds of satellites were orbiting the earth, providing service
for pagers, television, spy agencies, global positioning systems
and many other uses.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say the Leonids could ``sandblast'' satellites.
Alarmists fear even worse. Either way, it could wreak havoc with
communications at Comdex and around the globe.

Printing a screen grab can shake family tree 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It has been my experience that if you persist in
computing, you will, every so often, develop a need for software
you never gave a thought to before.
</P>
<P>
   This came about just tonight in my computing room, where my wife
was feverishly _ or at least semi-feverishly _ finishing a
presentation she is making to a computer club. Through the articles
she wrote for me on genealogical computing, she has become somewhat
of a celebrity in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In order to make a nice presentation, she needed to create some
overhead projection transparencies of screen images in her favorite
program, Family Tree Maker. This is a rather specialized function
called a screen grab, and it requires special software.
</P>
<P>
   One can use the Print Screen key, which copies the screen to the
clipboard. But you must then paste the screen to a document and
fiddle with the image until it's the right size.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, an outfit called TechSmith has persisted in sending
me upgrades of its screen grab program, now called SnagIt/32. I
have steadfastly ignored SnagIt until I suddenly needed it.
</P>
<P>
   SnagIt is a small, reasonably simple program that will capture
screen images, video images and even text when no other options are
available for cutting and pasting it. It will then send the image
to a printer, a file or the clipboard.
</P>
<P>
   It can even be set to ``auto scroll,'' which means it will grab
an entire screen, even if the screen is longer than your display,
and fit it onto a single page.
</P>
<P>
   You simply get the screen you wish on display, call up
SnagIt/32, set the output for the desired destination, and press
the screen grab hot keys. Well, not really. If you do that, your
screen grab will have the SnagIt window on top of everything else.
First minimize SnagIt, then press the hot keys.
</P>
<P>
   Of course in our operation, everything was more complicated. To
make these overhead projection sheets, you have to buy special
transparent plastic stuff on which to print. My wife, of course,
wanted color transparencies, but her computer is hooked up to a
laser printer, which doesn't do color. Mine, on the other hand, is
hooked up to a LexMark 5700 inkjet printer, which does color very
well.
</P>
<P>
   She went to an office supply store and got a package of
transparencies for inkjets _ you have to be careful to get the kind
that works with the printer you have. They're not cheap, either, at
20 sheets for $15. They are also very easily marred by fingerprints
or by putting them on top of warm coffeecake.
</P>
<P>
   To make this work, we installed SnagIt on both computers. She
grabbed the image she wanted and saved it to a bitmap file on a Zip
disc, and passed it to me. I used SnagIt to take the file from the
disk and send it to the printer.
</P>
<P>
   This operation took all night, chiefly because my print spooler
crashed about every three printings, requiring a restart of the
entire computer. We are now well into the next morning, and my
eyeballs are capsizing. However, we had a jolly time and no one
actually got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   My thanks to TechSmith, whose fine screen grab program costs a
mere $40 and can even be had in a trial version from its Web site
at http://www.techsmith.com.

 A Web of Conspiracy Theories  
 By JON SWARTZ   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has all the makings of an Oliver Stone movie.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of unlikely events during the past few weeks that
have conspiracy theorists frothing, a controversial plan to
privatize the Internet domain-naming business takes effect, a key
architect of the plan dies, a congressman launches an inquiry into
the plan, and another key figure behind the scheme mysteriously
resigns (maybe).
</P>
<P>
   The latest wrinkle came last weekend, when a staffer for Ira
Magaziner, President Clinton's Internet czar, said Magaziner will
resign this year to spend more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The normally loquacious Magaziner isn't commenting on his
reported departure. Although he routinely uses the speed-dial
button on his phone to answer interview requests, he has been
virtually unreachable by phone and e-mail the past few days. There
has been no formal statement about his apparent resignation.
</P>
<P>
   According to a staffer in his office, Magaziner is in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The public-policy wonk, who also authored theClinton
administration's ill-fated health care plan, was a leading figure
in a controversial plan to transfer Web domain-naming rights from
the federal government to a global, nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Network Solutions, a Virginia company working
under a federal contract, would lose its exclusive right to sell
Web addresses ending in .com, .org, .net, .gov and .edu. Instead, a
worldwide nonprofit group named the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers would decide who could sell domain names
as well as new ones. Network Solutions could continue to sell them,
but so could other firms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the transfer officially took effect October 1, nothing
has really changed. ICANN has said it needs six months to get fully
staffed and running.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Network Solutions continues to control the
multimillion-dollar domain-naming business _ a crucial element in
the fledgling e-commerce field.
</P>
<P>
   So why did Magaziner resign?
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of theories.
</P>
<P>
   One is that Magaziner quit in frustration because the transition
didn't go as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that Magaziner never wanted the transfer to take
place _ that he was acting on behalf of the government, which
wanted to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another is that Magaziner was ousted because the plan got
stalled.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe he just wanted to spend more time with his family.
There had been whispers for months that Magaziner was on his way
out.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding the conspiracy theorists is the October 16 death of Jon
Postel, 55, the reclusive technical wizard nicknamed the ``guardian
of the Internet's infrastructure.'' Postel died from complications
following heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, which
maintains a vast database of all domain names, Postel was another
key figure in the domain-name transition plan.
</P>
<P>
   The same day Postel died, House Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas Bliley, R-Va., opened an inquiry into the domain-name
transfer. He was responding to complaints that the process was
drafted behind closed doors with minimal public input.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about the manner in which the process of
privatizing the governance of (domain names) has apparently
unraveled,''Bliley wrote in letters to Magaziner and Secretary of
Commerce William Daley. ``A loss of credibility in the Internet
community at large will seriously undermine the ability of (ICANN)
and the stability of the Internet itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Others claim that the process was akin to the movie ``Star
Chamber.'' Issues quietly were discussed among a group of
unidentified people, who posted their conclusions online. ``It was
like a military operation,'' said Naseem Javed, president of ABC
Namebank International Inc., a brand-name consulting firm in
Ontario, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domain names are the single most important element of
e-commerce, so how come the Clinton administration did such a poor
job of handling this issue?'' Javed said. ``The process was a
laid-back, hush-hush affair that maintained a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   What really hasn't changed is the role of Network Solutions, a
publicly held company in Herndon, Va., with a market value of $1
billion. Network Solutions is busy expanding into Japan and Germany
_ the next-most-important markets for e-commerce after the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions officials say they support Magaziner's
transition plan. They say competition will fuel growth in the
domain-naming business and that it will benefit everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they predict that 100 million domain names will be
registered by 2000. Currently, more than 4 million domain names are
registered, and NSI has registered about 3 million of them. It
currently costs $70 to register a domain name for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, any number of companies will have the right to dole
out names.
</P>
<P>
   Until then ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a damn thing has changed,'' said an angry Eric Gullichsen,
director of Tonic Domain Name Registry. Tonic sells domain names
ending in .to, which is short for Tonga, a country that registers
domain names. ``The transition plan was a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest focus on Magaziner's handling of the transition plan
overshadows his many good works.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime White House adviser is credited with alerting the
Clinton administration to the economic importance of the Internet
and setting an e-commerce policy into motion. He also encouraged
the Clinton administration to rethink its strict limits on the
export of encrypted software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ira heightened awareness of the Net in the Beltway. Without
him, I doubt we would have a law banning new Internet taxes, and a
general hands-off attitude,'' said Erik Olbeter, director of
telecom policy at the Economic Strategy Institute, a think tank in
Washington, D.C. ``He has set the framework for continued strong
growth of the Internet.''

PUTTING A STOP TO SPAM  
 BY BENNY EVANGELISTA  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a little more than a decade, Sunil Paul has been a space
station designer, a government policy wonk and a guru of the
once-hot ``push'' technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he hopes to become known as the ``spammer jammer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail has been abused and turned into a medium for
spamming,'' said Paul, whose latest startup, Bright Light
Technologies Inc. of San Francisco, is developing programs to fight
unsolicited commercial e-mail, popularly known as spam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most offensive and most obvious way that your
privacy has been violated on the Net,'' said Paul, 33, who is known
for his previous startup, FreeLoader Inc., and for being America
Online's first Internet-products director.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Light, which is on track to market spam-fighting programs
by the end of the year, is a year-old startup that employs tactics
similar to those used by antivirus software-makers. It compiles
lists of known spammers, so they can be blocked by the Internet
service providers before they get to the intended victim.
</P>
<P>
   In a South of Market building, Bright Light has created spam
central, cataloging tens of thousands of known spam e-mail
addresses. The company has set up tens of thousands of e-mail
accounts as ``bait'' for the spammers who send annoying messages
about pornographic sites or get-rich-quick schemes. The e-mail
accounts ``harvest'' addresses of spammers, so Bright Light's
technology can block them.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said he hopes to have hundreds of thousands of spammer
addresses in the databank by the end of the year. The intelligence
center is what Paul calls his ``secret sauce'' for Bright Light's
main product, Spam Wall, designed for Internet service providers
and corporations to use to block spam.
</P>
<P>
   Bright Light already has signed up two major service providers,
Concentric Network and USA.NET, as customers and is working with
AT&AMP;T WorldNet Service and EarthLink Network to help develop the
product.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Plaskon, product management director for the 1.2-million
member AT&AMP;T WorldNet Service, said his company is interested in
Bright Light because its ``very unique product'' seems like a
potentially forceful weapon in the war against spam. AT&AMP;T intends
to use Spam Wall, depending on the results of continuing tests, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been working on minimizing spam for two years, and it
seems like it's guerrilla warfare,'' Plaskon said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul got the idea for Bright Light last summer when both he and
his wife, Michelle Odom, were getting spammed at their America
Online addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it was very infuriating,'' Paul said during a
recent interview. ``Somebody out there has figured out who I am and
has sent me stuff that there's no way on Earth I'd be interested
in, and there's nothing I can do about it. If I send them a loud,
obnoxious letter, they love it. It's like, `Great, we know you're
really alive; we'll send you some more.'''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, he said, his wife asked him, ``Can't you do something
about this?''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting spam became another test of his lifelong abilities to
come up with ideas that go against the norm. Even as a teen growing
up in the country music capital of the world, Nashville, Tenn., the
native of India preferred listening to rock.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1987 from Vanderbilt University with a
bachelor's in electrical engineering, Paul hooked on with NASA as a
contractor helping to design the space station. But he said he
became frustrated that ``we would spend a year designing some facet
of the space station and Congress would come along and redesign
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So he joined the Office of Technology Assessment, a
congressional advisory think tank, because ``I wanted a role in
making sure our public policy was guided by informed decision
making rather than politics. Just at that time, ``the Internet
started receiving attention, mainly by policy wonks and engineers,
and I happened to be both,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   He left the OTA in early 1994 to become the first Internet
product manager at AOL, which then had only 300,000 subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one of the first meetings I had about future planning, I
said someday we're going to have to figure out how to get a Web
browser, and everybody's like, `Oh, how are you going to get a Web
browser on 9600 baud, there's no way we're going to have a Web
browser,''' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he left in late 1995, the online service had a
browser, a Web site and 3 million customers
</P>
<P>
   Paul and colleague Marcus Pincus left AOL _ and about $1 million
in unvested stock options _ to co-found FreeLoader Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Their original idea was to develop a Web browser that would
automatically retrieve information from the Web, ``pushing'' to the
desktop instead of requiring the computer user to spend time
``pulling'' it from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   FreeLoader and chief rival PointCast Inc. of Sunnyvale made
``push technology'' the hottest buzz phrase of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Pincus and Paul used the buzz to quickly raise $3.1 million in
investments, generate publicity in publications such as the Wall
Street Journal and become courted by the likes of Yahoo Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Just eight months after starting the company, without having
made a dimein profits, they sold FreeLoader for a cool $38 million
to Individual Inc., a news-retrieval service.
</P>
<P>
   The deal seemed a good idea at the time, especially because
rival PointCast had the lead in both product development and
financing. But Individual ended up folding FreeLoader eight months
later after a corporate shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   Paul's own profit from the sale has plummetted with Individual's
stock. The stock options he got in the deal are probably worth
about $3 million to $4 million now, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Paul believes that FreeLoader and push technology
failed for the same reason that his latest venture is drawing
attention _ advertisers turned it into a way to shove their
products in front of computer users' faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Push got spammed to death, and the users lost control,'' Paul
said. ``The real reason push never took off is that it didn't
address the needs of real users and instead fell victim to the
needs of advertisers.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unchecked, spam could ``snuff the magic out of the
Internet,'' he said. Already, an estimated 10 billion pieces of
spam shoot through the Internet each year, according to industry
experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who have never visited a porn site in their lives get
porn spam,'' Paul said. ``A spammer doesn't care whether you're a
kid, whether you're a man or a woman, whether you're black or
white. All that matters is that the cost of sending spam is almost
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright Light may have a good idea, but one analyst who has
followed the electronic messaging industry for 15 years said the
company has to prove it has a product that appeals to a broader
market than just Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
   Corporations already are using some form of e-mail filtering
technology that weeds out spam, said Phil Schacter, a senior
analyst with the Burton Group, a research group based in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they do something to start interesting enterprise
customers, they're looking at a fairly limited market,'' Schacter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul, though, remains confident about the market and has rounded
up $5.5 million in investment funding from influential Silicon
Valley venture capitalists like Bud Colligan ofAccel Partners and
Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bright Light is concentrating on spam, Paul said he
sees future business possibilities in other forms of e-mail
monitoring and management for companies.
</P>
<P>
   And if not, Paul said he's always coming up with new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day in the shower, there's at least one or two new
ideas,'' he said. ``The hard part is turning those ideas into
something that can be real.''

AT&AMP;T SPIN-OFF LUCENT TECHNOLOGY RIDES INTO HEART OF SILICON
VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By Deborah Solomon   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
 &HT;    Paranoia seems an odd trait for Lucent Technologies _ a $30
billion company with an AT&AMP;T pedigree, a market value of $109
billion and the adoration of Wall Street.
 &HT;    But Lucent knows it faces a herd of up-and-coming competitors
and must stay vigilant to survive.
 &HT;    Keeping tabs from its headquarters in New Jersey is hard,
however, because most of Lucent's potential competitors are here in
the Bay Area.
 &HT;    So the nation's largest telecommunications equipment company,
eager to protect its valuable market share, is setting up shop in
its competitors' own back yard.
 &HT;    The New Jersey company has spent the past year beefing up its
presence in Silicon Valley _ building new facilities, acquiring
local companies, setting up research labs and aligning with local
universities like Stanford.
 &HT;    Lucent is preparing to go head-to-head with local hotshots like
Cisco Systems, Ascend Communications and 3Com Corp. for a share of
a multibillion-dollar industry that will transform the way people
communicate.
 &HT;    It's developing new products and technologies such as wireless
telephone systems at its facilities in the Bay Area and soon will
open a Lucent Venture Fund office in Menlo Park to finance startup
tech companies.
 &HT;    The company now employs more than 3,000 people in the Bay Area
and plans to add several hundred more during the next few years.
That's still a small number when compared with Cisco's 16,000
employees and 3Com's 13,500 employees, but it's more than Ascend's
1,820, and it's enough to show those companies that Lucent means
business.
 &HT;    ``We are very conscious of what Lucent is doing out here,'' said
an executive from one of the area's largest companies.
 &HT;    What Lucent is trying to do is compete in the data networking
business, a relatively new task for the company. Lucent and others
are working to create products that seamlessly integrate voice,
video and data networks.
 &HT;    Data networking products will give companies enhanced services,
such as universal messaging, plus the ability to control all phone
calls, Internet access and video-conferencing from a single
network.
 &HT;    The strategy for developing the products out here, says Lucent
CEO Richard McGinn, is to siphon off some of the creativity, energy
and brain power that's made Silicon Valley the premier place for
innovation. Harnessing what McGinn calls the ``intellectual
horsepower'' of the Valley will help Lucent compete in the brave
new world of telecommunications.
 &HT;    ``The culture of the Valley fits in very well with what we want
to do,'' McGinn said. He cited the area's educated workforce, rich
talent pool and impressive universities as reasons for having a
presence here.
 &HT;    Synergy aside, industry watchers say Lucent needs to be in the
Valley because that's where most of the breakthrough technology is
happening and where customers expect their suppliers to be located.
 &HT;    ``One of the biggest issues for Lucent near-term is the ability
to become a stronger player in data networking,'' said Gregory S.
Geiling, who follows Lucent at J.P. Morgan Securities in New York.
``With the West Coast being such a hotbed of data networking, in
order to be in the flow of information and to have the
relationships with companies and customers, Lucent needs to be out
here.''
 &HT;    Being in Silicon Valley also will allow the company to keep
close tabs on its competitors. Lucent has had explosive growth
since it was spun off from AT&AMP;T Corp. two years ago and is
desperate to sustain that pace.
 &HT;    Revenue has soared from $23.3 billion in 1996 to $30 billion in
1998. The company's market value is $109 billion, and its stock has
defied the recent market downturn. Shares are up more than 90
percent for the year.
 &HT;    Lucent has been so successful because its products run
everything from traditional phone systems to wireless phones to the
Internet. The company is the largest U.S. provider of telecom
equipment, and its customer list reads like a who's who of the
technology and telecom industries _ SBC Communications Corp., Intel
Corp., AT&AMP;T, AirTouch, Apple, Sun Microsystems all use Lucent
products.
 &HT;    But times are changing, and the products that Lucent primarily
focused on _ equipment for circuit-switched telephone systems _ are
going the way of the record player. Lucent says it is committed to
being at the forefront of this new market but faces challenges from
other companies that have been focused on data networking for much
longer.
 &HT;    Lucent's core business, providing equipment to telephone
companies, is a slow-moving one that hasn't changed much in several
decades.
 &HT;    Data networking, on the other hand, moves on Internet time, and
companies that want to survive need to keep pace.
 &HT;    Privately, competitors question whether Lucent can compete in
the fast-moving world of data networking, which spits out products
at a significantly quicker pace than the company is accustomed.
Companies like Cisco refer to Lucent as an ``old world company.''
 &HT;    Industry watchers also wonder whether Lucent, which now has
130,000 employees worldwide, will be able to keep up with the
industry's lightning-fast pace.
 &HT;    ``The big challenge is transitioning to this data networking
base successfully. Product development cycles are a lot quicker,
competition is fierce, and focus on technology is very important.
As they transition to data, they have to be quicker,'' Geiling
said.
 &HT;    Company officials admit that Lucent needs to move at a rapid
clip, but they shake off the notion that it's too mired in its ways
to succeed.
 &HT;    ``Our challenge is to continue to execute with speed,'' said
Carly Fiorina, president of Lucent's Global Service Provider
business, the company's largest division. ``We're limited only by
our own movement.''
 &HT;    To keep up momentum and stay ahead of competitors, Lucent has
acquired several Bay Area companies with a large presence in
markets the company wants to compete in.
 &HT;    But Lucent wants to do more than just absorb other companies'
technology. McGinn has committed $4.5 billion to research and
development this year, and much of that money will make its way out
here.
 &HT;    In February, Lucent quietly opened a division in Milpitas that
was charged with finding ways to deliver more bandwidth to
customers. Nine months later, the division is preparing to ship
wireless antennas that enable customers to make calls, access the
Internet and do video-conferencing using microwave transmissions.
The antenna _ one of the company's most anticipated products _ is
headed to local phone companies, Internet service providers and
anyone else who needs a lot of bandwidth.
 &HT;    The product also is unique in that it was conceived, designed,
built, tested and marketed at the building in Milpitas.
 &HT;    ``We needed to integrate all things together, to take research
and development and sales and fuse it into one team and one
environment,'' said Larry Schwerin, general manager of the wireless
broadband division. While demand for bandwidth is the current rage,
Lucent also wants to develop products that customers don't even
know they want.
 &HT;    The company, which announced more than 30 products this year, is
building a research lab facility in Menlo Park to develop new
ideas.
 &HT;    The 43,000-square-foot building, which will be housed in the
Stanford Research Park, is expected to open next summer with about
125 employees.
 &HT;    The division will focus on developing sophisticated products
that use the Internet to transmit data but are of better quality
and more reliable than what's already available.
 &HT;    ``We're trying to go after things where you can't forecast the
market because it's so new,'' said Ronald Schmidt, who will co-lead
the research lab along with William Coughran Jr.
 &HT;    Analysts say Lucent's timing could not be better. By moving into
the Bay Area, the company is closing a geographic gap and
positioning itself to compete vigorously in the data networking
market.
 &HT;    ``Lucent is one of the largest telecom vendors; they have the
advantage of size; they have good stock currency and are in a great
position if they need to do acquisitions,'' said Geiling.
 &HT;    Philip Sirlin, an analyst with Shroder &AMP; Co. in New York, is a
bit more blunt about Lucent's future. ``They are going to give
Cisco and Nortel a run for their money,'' he said. Lucent ``doesn't
have a choice. Lucent will either be successful in data networking
or they won't be successful. Period.''

 LUCENT SET TO GO ON BUYING BINGE 
 &HT;     BY DEBORAH SOLOMON 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucent Technologies has been doing more than just gobbling up
space and talented engineers in Silicon Valley. It's also been
buying local companies with expertise in the markets in which
Lucent wants to compete _ and it's poised to go on an even bigger
buying spree.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lucent bought Livingston, a data networking company
in Pleasanton that makes products that connect computer users to
Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition helped fill a hole in Lucent's business
portfolio and gave it access to an even broader customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Three months earlier, Lucent bought Octel Communications Corp.
of Milpitas, a leader in voice mail and messaging. That acquisition
gave Lucent access to large corporate accounts, such as Bell
Canada, Hewlett-Packard and Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   But those purchases may pale in comparison with what industry
watchers expect Lucent to do in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   There is much speculation that the company soon will make
another big acquisition in the data networking or wireless
business, now that it will no longer be penalized for certain
stock-swap takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   Under accounting rules, spin-offs are barred for two years from
``pooling of interest'' transactions. It forces companies to take
charges against earnings and sticks them with a big tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Large deals have been out of reach for Lucent because they would
have been too expensive, but on October 1, Lucent turned 2 years
old and the shackles came off.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area companies such as Ascend and 3Com have been mentioned
as potential takeover targets for Lucent, as have foreign telecom
companies such as Siemens, Alcatel and Nokia. For now, however, the
company is keeping mum on which companies it might be courting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have acquired 10 companies in the past 30 months, and we're
going to continue to acquire firms to add technology, distribution
and new customer groups, in addition to wonderfully talented
people,'' said Lucent CEO Richard McGinn. ``We don't have an
acquisition strategy. We have a business strategy to invest in the
fastest-growing areas, such as hardware and data networking.''
</P>
<P>
   Data networking, with a growth rate of 25 percent a year, is
probably the most obvious target for Lucent acquisitions. Lucent
also would do well to buy businesses with expertise in Internet
protocol routing technology and asynchronous transfer mode. Both
those technologies provide the plumbing for routing telephone calls
and data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent's been rumored to buy almost everybody that's out
here,'' said Gregory Geiling, who follows Lucent for J.P. Morgan
Securities in New York. ``My gut reaction is that any immediate
acquisition would focus on data networking. Lucent is one of the
largest telecom vendors, and they have the advantage of size, they
have good stock currency and are in a great position to do
acquisitions.''

COMPUTER INDUSTRY STANDARD DOUBLE-TALK NOT TO BE TRUSTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TOM ABATE   
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The computer industry kicked off a week of hype last nightin Las
Vegas, but as we listen to the keynote speeches from Comdex, we
have to ask: Can we believe these guys?
</P>
<P>
   If the testimony at the Microsoft antitrust trial in Washington
has proven anything, it's that high-tech execs routinely get up on
stage and feed us bull.
</P>
<P>
   At the Macworld Expo in Boston a year ago, Apple Interim CEO
Steve Jobs put a happy face on his alliance with Microsoft Chairman
Bill Gates. But under oath at the Microsoft trial, Apple execs say
they were bullied into smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe people are cynical enough to tune out the words and just
enjoy the multimedia slide shows that usually accompany the
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is that top execs aren't the only ones who
flip-flop. Just last week, Guy Kawasaki made industry observers
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki used to be Apple's evangelist. He made a career out of
rallying Mac loyalists and railing against Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kawasaki, who runs a business-resource Web site called
Garage.Com, has joined an advisory board to help Microsoft recruit
software developers. He'll be joined by former Apple exec Heidi
Roizen.
</P>
<P>
   Kawasaki shilling for the Evil Empire makes me wonder what's
next. Maybe Newt Gingrich will find the hidden virtues in Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HONESTY THE BEST POLICY?_ Sometimes concealment isn't the best
executive strategy. Richard Gilbert, CEO of Copper Mountain, is
up-front about his desire to grow his DSL company by selling it to
any of a half-dozen network-hardware vendors.
</P>
<P>
   DSL is a technology for sending high-speed data and voice
traffic over ordinary phone lines. DSL startups have had a hard
time competing with Pacific Bell, which owns those copper lines.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert seems to think it takes a networking giant to fight a
giant network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to merge with somebody with routers and switches,'' he
told my colleague Deborah Solomon. ``There are six or seven
companies that would be logical for us to merge with,'' he said,
naming Cisco Systems, Lucent Technologies, Northern Telecom, Ascend
Communications, Siemens, Alcatel and Ericsson.
</P>
<P>
   Copper Mountain has invited some of these prospects in for a
look-see, but if Gilbert can't make a merger deal, he said he may
take the company public in 1999 _ providing Wall Street is in the
mood for 3-year-old startups that have some revenues, if not
profits.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SMART REGION_San Francisco will host a conference on December
10-11, where 400 government and business leaders will consider ways
to spur the creation of broadband networks in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband networks are high-speed ``pipelines'' for getting
electronic data to businesses, schools and homes. The conference,
being organized by the Bay Area Council, is supposed to get civic
and commercial leaders talking about how they might stitch together
the existing fiber optic and coaxial cables _ owned by companies,
utilities and others _ into a single high-speed network ringing the
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Many people think that such broadband networks will be the
catalyst for electronic commerce in the next century, just as
canals, railroads and highways were the arteries of commerce in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many companies and municipalities digging up the
streets and laying cable, there ought to be some way to work
together,'' said John Eger, a San Diego telecommunications expert
and keynote speaker at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's easier said than done when you think about
asking Pacific Gas and Electric to collaborate with CalTrans, or
TCI to share with Pacific Bell, much less getting San Francisco and
Oakland on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Eger: ``If we don't walk away from the conference with
a working plan than we've failed.''

CALIFORNIA RULING IS A SETBACK FOR MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp., whose business practices are being challenged
by the government in a major antitrust case, suffered a legal
setback on another front Tuesday when a U.S. judge in California
ordered the company to stop shipping its own version of Java, a
programming language owned by a rival, Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Under a licensing agreement signed in March 1995, Sun gave
Microsoft the right to ship Java, the most popular language for
programs that run on the World Wide Web, with Microsoft's Windows
operating system and its Web browser, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   However, in 1997, Microsoft altered parts of the Java language
so that programs written in Java for other operating systems would
not run on Windows machines and vice versa. Microsoft said it was
improving Java, but many others in the industry, including Sun,
said it was an attempt to ``pollute'' a language that threatened
Microsoft's operating system monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Sun sued, claiming that its licensing agreement did not allow
Microsoft to make changes to Java.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Ronald Whyte, who is hearing that suit, ruled
that Sun was likely to prove its claim in a trial next year and
ordered Microsoft to begin shipping Sun's version of Java within 90
days. If, after that time, Microsoft continues to ship its
operating system or browser with its own version of Java, it will
be in contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Microsoft said the ruling would not require
recalls of either Windows 98 or its World Wide Web browser,
Internet Explorer 4.0. Although a company spokesman said the
changes ordered by the judge would be costly, he declined to be
specific.
</P>
<P>
   What, if any, impact Tuesday's preliminary injunction in a
private lawsuit in California might have on the government's
antitrust case, now being heard in Washington, is uncertain. But
the allegations in the government's suit do include the practices
that are at the heart of the breach-of-contract case.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 20 states suing Microsoft in the
antitrust case say this is part of a pattern of illegal practices
by the software giant intended to protect and extend its tight grip
on the market for personal computer software. If Sun's Java became
an industry standard, the government asserts, it could pose a
serious challenge to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Java potentially allows developers to write a software program
once and have it run on a wide variety of computers, regardless of
the underlying operating system. That is a threat to Microsoft's
control over the direction of software development.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors interact to insure the continuation of Microsoft's
operating system monopoly. First, the vast majority of programmers
write their software first _ and often exclusively _ for the
Windows operating system because has a better than 90 percent share
of personal computer operating systems. Second, Windows users are
reluctant to change operating systems because switching requires
buying all new programs.
</P>
<P>
   However, programs written in Java could, at least theoretically,
run on any operating system, meaning that a user could abandon
Windows for Apple Computer Inc.'s Mac OS or any flavor of the Unix
operating system and run the same Java programs that he or she had
purchased to run on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mail exchanges among Microsoft executives made public in
both the Sun trial and the government antitrust case, this
possibility was referred to as ``commoditizing the platform,''
meaning that Windows would lose its proprietary grip on newly
developed programs, a serious threat to Microsoft's monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling is badly timed for Microsoft, but the
spillover, if any, to the antitrust case in Washington is difficult
to determine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Justice Department will argue that a breach of contract is
part of the pattern of bad acts by Microsoft and of its intent to
monopolize,'' said Robert Litan, a former senior official in the
Justice Department's antitrust division. ``It helps the
atmospherics of the government's case, but it's not clear beyond
that what the effect will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Tuesday is a preliminary injunction, Litan noted, and
the Sun-Microsoft trial is not scheduled to begin until next year.
Meanwhile, the antitrust trial is already well under way, and Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson is expected to rule early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was a final ruling in the contract case, it would
have far more direct impact on the antitrust case,'' said Litan,
who is now at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   The California ruling, industry analysts say, is not likely to
have a significant impact on Microsoft's business anytime soon _
though it does raise questions about the company's strategy of
trying to influence the industry to accept Microsoft's version of
Internet software standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the judge gave it 90 days to comply, there is no
business interruption for Microsoft,'' said Richard Sherlund, an
analyst for Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``Microsoft does not have to pull
products out of distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Sherlund noted, the ruling does ``rein Microsoft in, and it
clearly comes at an awkward time for the company, given the
antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   In its lawsuit, Sun accused Microsoft of trying to foil any
chance for Java to become a universal programming language.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it was disappointed by the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Maritz, a Microsoft group vice president, said: ``We don't
anticipate any disruption to any products, including Windows 98.
Customers need not fear any disruption.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Tuesday evening with reporters and industry
analysts, Maritz said the ``option of not supporting Java is open
to us.'' But most industry analysts doubt that Microsoft would walk
away altogether from Java, a popular Internet programming language
developed by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Sun welcomed the preliminary ruling, and Michael Morris, the
company's general counsel, said that when the case was tried, Sun
planned to seek unspecified monetary damages from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came as many industry executives had gathered at a
major computer trade show in Las Vegas known as Comdex. The early
reaction to word of the ruling was generally favorable, based on
the assumption that the eventual effect of the decision would be to
encourage a single, industry-standard version of Java for which
software developers could write programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single Java standard is what the industry needs,'' said Eric
Schmidt, chief executive officer of Novell Inc., a maker of
software that links computers in networks. Schmidt was Sun's chief
technology officer at the time Sun introduced Java in 1995 as a
language designed specifically for software that runs on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In his 31-page ruling, Judge Whyte based his preliminary
injunction on the his judgment that Sun was likely to ``prevail on
the merits'' in its suit. The dispute between Microsoft and Sun
focuses on whether the 1996 contract allowing Microsoft to license
Java technology _ which was gaining a strong following in the
industry _ also allowed Microsoft to tailor the Java language for
use with its own software.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft argued that its fine tuning merely improved the
performance of Java, but Sun countered that Microsoft's real agenda
was to undermine a challenge to Microsoft by co-opting it. This
tactic was described in the antitrust trial last week by an
executive for Intel Corp., who quoted a Microsoft executive as
saying, ``embrace, extend and extinguish.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, Judge Whyte wrote that Sun has ``demonstrated a
reasonable likelihood'' that the contract ``does not authorize
Microsoft's extension of the Java language and its corresponding
modifications to the Java language compiler.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun, among other things, took issue with Microsoft's licensing
policies for distributing software that includes Microsoft's
modified version of Java. Microsoft's licensing deals, according to
Whyte, require its business partners to exclusively distribute
Microsoft's Java-based technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court finds that negotiating for or enforcing the
above-mentioned licensing terms constitutes an unfair business
practice,'' Whyte wrote. ``Microsoft does not argue that these
licensing provisions bear any utility which outweighs the harm
asserted by Sun.''

THE OLD MASTER'S ENDURANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, when the 106th Congress convenes, a remarkable
tableau of history will occur on the Senate floor. Three of the
longest-serving members in the 210-year history of that body, all
in the all-time top 10 in seniority, will take the oath:
</P>
<P>
   Strom Thurmond, South Carolina's gift to gerontology, first
elected in 1954; Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, elected in 1958;
and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, sworn in on Nov. 7, 1962,
four months before his 31st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   None of this durable trio shows any sign of quitting. Some
Republicans have murmured that Thurmond, the party's nonagenerian
patriarch, resembles father Anchises in the Aeneid, a burden to his
son fleeing the flames of Troy. A dignified burden, but a burden
nonetheless. Ol' Strom told 'em to take a hike. Byrd, historian of
the Senate, has an almost religious belief in seniority. Kennedy,
reelected in 1994, is campaigning nonstop for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   After Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York announced that he
would not run for reelection, ``I called Pat to say we're going to
miss him in the Senate,'' Kennedy said in his Boston office.
Moynihan and Kennedy, two of the few senators who might be
remembered deep into the next century, differ in style and
priorities, but Kennedy praised his colleague's ``courtesy,
understanding, professionalism and good political sense.'' Those
qualities also apply to Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan is 71. Kennedy is 66, a stripling among Senate
sequoias. Next year, he passes in service James O. Eastland of
Mississippi, to become the eighth-longest-serving senator in
history. Thurmond is first and Byrd is fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Kennedy had no local public experience. He's been
working on his equivalency diploma since. Some state reps may know
more about health care, but not many. An alderman or two may be as
versed in education, but their schdeules don't match Kennedy's,
whose daily grind would daunt an aspirant for the Boston City
Council: a medical-care event, then a charity dinner here, a Social
Security forum there. He still listens and learns. This time, they
can't catch him napping if he doesn't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls his 1962 slogan, ``He Can Do More for
Massachusetts,'' and annotates it with enthusiasm, especially the
National Institutes of Health budget, which he has been milking
like a Guernsey for decades. ``The next century is the century of
life sciences, and 15 percent of research from NIH comes to this
city. Boston is the number one city in the country for
pharmaceutical research.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 elections excited Kennedy. ``Two months ago,'' he said,
``People thought it would take 10 years for Democrats to come back.
Now there's a lot of energy. The House has a better than even
chance of turning Democratic and in the next Senate elections, the
numbers favor us, with 19 of theirs and 12 of ours up, and a large
turnout in a presidential year.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's own presidential run in 1980 ended badly, but in
recent years, he's delivered his own ``state of the union'' address
on ``our agenda,'' on HMOs and AIDS research, on high-tech and
minimum wage, a list for friend and foe alike.
</P>
<P>
   He calls Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle ``indispensable'' in
uniting Democrats, but thinks Majority Leader Trent Lott is
isolated, unable to realize that ``they do best when they show they
can work with Democrats, that in a sense you don't `need' to elect
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was once the GOP's favorite fund-raiser, a hobgoblin to
terrify direct-mail pigeons into digging deep. Newt Gingrich later
served the same purpose for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived Gingrich and many others, the Old Master looks
forward to another eon or two in Congress. In the final session of
the Senate in the 20th century, Kennedy says, ``The numbers haven't
changed, but there's another message: that Republicans are adopting
our issues and may want to work toward a common goal.''

A DYNASTY SIGN IN BUSH SONS' RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They say Texas Governor George W. Bush is the
wiseacre in the family, but it was brother Jeb, the serious one,
who made even his famous father blush the day George W. brought his
girlfriend home to meet the family.
</P>
<P>
   Falling down on one knee, proposal-style, Jeb flung open his
arms and asked the 31-year-old George W. what his nervous parents
would not: ``Brother, did you pop the question, or are we just
wasting our time?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than two decades later, the Bush brothers' often
close, sometimes comic, and always competitive relationship has
grown even stronger, friends and family members say, and the
Republican sons of former President George H.W. Bush definitely are
not wasting time.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3, George W. Bush (who on that did indeed propose to and
marry Laura Welch) was reelected to a second term as governor of
Texas in a longhorn-sized landslide that could propel him to the
top of the GOP presidential pack in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The same day, John Ellis Bush _ Jeb for short _ easily won
Florida's governorship, bouncing back from a 1994 defeat for the
same office in the nation's fourth most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brothers are expected to make their debut on the
national stage when they attend the annual convention of the
Republican Governors Association, which opens today in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the late 1960s, when siblings Nelson and Winthrop
Rockefeller were simultaneously governors in New York and Arkansas,
have two brothers presided over state houses. And not since
``Kennedy'' became synonymous with political dynasty has one family
shared so much political power and presidential ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know the Bushes say these are no Kennedys, despite the
similarities: the New England prep-school pedigrees, the wealth,
the obsession with sports. What's different, they say, is that the
senior Bush did not push Junior or Jeb into politics; in fact, he
was surprised that his sons chose the hard knocks over the privacy
and security of business careers.
</P>
<P>
   The former president will not discuss his advice to his sons.
Publicly, all he has said since the election is that he's really
proud of their achievements. George W., 52, and Jeb, 45, also are
reluctant to talk about their relationship; they did not answer
repeated requests for interviews for this story.
</P>
<P>
   But family and friends describe a true friendship between two
very different brothers, a relationship that was nurtured by doting
parents during their childhoods in Texas, and that has strengthened
and matured in their pursuits of public office.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, nobody helped Jeb Bush more to win the Florida
governorship than did George W., who raised hundreds of thousands
of dollars for him in Texas, screened his television ads, offered
moral support, and made sure lots of family members campaigned in
the Sunshine State. Four years earlier, a deeply disappointed Jeb _
the Bush that bettors believed would win a governor's race in 1994
_ attended George W.'s inauguration in Austin and showed no trace
of hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been competing for generations in this family, but
there's a difference between being competitive and being rivals,''
said William ``Bucky'' Bush of St. Louis, who is a senator's son, a
president's brother, and uncle to two governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boys are competitive, but they aren't rivals,'' Bucky
Bush said. ``They weren't raised to have chips on their
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, their relationship has survived personal crises that
make political defeats look pale. (George W. also lost his first
campaign, a bid for a House seat, in 1978.) Robin, the sister born
between them, died of leukemia when George W. was 7 and Jeb was a
baby. George W. was a heavy social drinker until the day after his
40th birthday party when, with a killer hangover, he swore off
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb's Mexican-born wife, Columba, suffered such social ostracism
in Houston, his hometown, that in the early 1980s Jeb moved his
family to Miami. Jeb's family was so wrenched by the 1994 campaign
that afterward Bush converted to Roman Catholicism, his wife's
faith, and sought drug-prevention counseling for one of his
children, according to friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``As George and Jeb have gone through challenging times in their
lives, their siblings and parents have supported them, but I
wouldn't call the Bushes dependent on one another,'' said
Massachusetts native Andrew H. Card, a family friend who served as
President Bush's transportation secretary. ``The boys are very good
friends, but they are also individuals with strong views of their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, they are different men. George W. looks like his father
and displays the same restless energy. Jeb more resembles his
mother, and seems to have her calm demeanor and firm resolve.
</P>
<P>
   George W. is the quick, cocky, and hot-tempered one; he was a
curious and incorrigible child who surely spent more hours in the
time-out chair than all of his siblings (including Neil, 43,
Marvin, 41, and Doro, 39) combined.
</P>
<P>
   In her memoirs, former Barbara Bush called George W. ``the son
who pulls no punches and tells it like he thinks it is.'' George W.
attributes those traits to her: ``I've got my father's eyes and my
mother's mouth,'' he has said.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy growing up in Midland, Texas, George W. was a bit of a
bully, according to Bucky Bush, his frequent babysitter, but he was
packed off to boarding school at Phillips Academy in Andover,
Mass., before his considerably younger siblings could encounter
that side of him. He was the absent brother during his years at
Yale and Harvard Business School; George W. didn't settle down in
Texas until his father's political career had moved the younger
children to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb, who also went to Andover but then chose the University of
Texas over the Ivy League, was quiet and studious, a Phi Beta Kappa
like his father, an outstanding tennis player, and a kinder,
gentler contrast ``to his Texas-swaggering, tobacco-chewing,
roughneck-talking, cowboy boot-wearing brother,'' said Card, a
former state representative from Holbrook who is now the auto
industry's chief lobbyist in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb never dated any girl but Columba, whom he met as a
high-school exchange student in Mexico and married right after
college. George W. had the reputation of a partygoer and ladies'
man, which was why the family was so keen to meet Laura, the
librarian he married in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeb was always very disciplined, very focused, and in a
hurry,'' said David Bates of San Antonio, a boyhood friend. ``He
matured quicker than the rest of us, graduated faster, got married
sooner, and was ready to go out in the world and get down to
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb had played a lot of baseball with his younger siblings, but
when he needed to hit a home run _ to win a statewide race, tailor
a more populist message, become a ``compassionate conservative,''
and reach out to minority voters _ he turned to a brother with
experience. ``George W. was very, very supportive in this
election,'' Bates said. ``The brothers are much closer now than
they ever have been.''
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview after his victory, George W. said, ``I
love my brother a lot. He's going to be a great governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to the press after his win, Jeb dismissed any
suggestion of a Bush-Bush ticket in 2000. ``I think he'll impose a
vice presidential nepotism rule,'' Jeb said of his brother. ``If he
doesn't, I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's a lot of speculation that the Bush brothers
aspire to one of the two highest offices in the land, which, not
incidentally, were both held by their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have played and lost enough tennis in Texas's 90-degree heat
to know there is a very strong competitive instinct in this
family,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, who was President Bush's longtime
spokesman. ``They like to win, but they also know how to lose with
dignity and grace.''
</P>
<P>
   They also know who is the boss. President Bush may be their
political point of light, but Barbara Bush is the one who makes
them stand at attention.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzwater recalls how he and George W. once sneaked out of a
Houston rally for President Bush to smoke cigars. Suddenly spotting
Mrs. Bush coming their way, they instinctively tried to hide the
forbidden tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what are you boys up to,'' Mrs. Bush casually asked,
according to Fitzwater, ``that is making smoke come out of your
pockets?''

DEMOCRATS DOUBT IF GOP CAN MOVE CLOSER TO THE CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats are privately hoping the Republican
makeover, which begins today when the House GOP elects its new
leadership, is not the first wave of a national effort by the party
to move to the political center and reach out to minorities and
women.
</P>
<P>
   A more moderate Republican Party would benefit President
Clinton, Democrats say, if it allowed him to accomplish pieces of
his legislative agenda before his term ends. But it could hurt
Democrats if Republicans succeed in appealing to more voters in the
2000 election, when voters will decide contests for both the White
House and the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans reeling from their worse-than-expected showing
in the midterm election and so much at stake in the next two years,
many Republicans say they have no choice but to change their
messengers and message or risk a return to their minority status in
Congress. Many Democrats are betting that the GOP's efforts will
not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we recognize that a smarter and more moderate
Republican Party would be more difficult to face in a general
election,'' said Democratic consultant Geoffrey Garin. ``It would
strengthen the Republicans' hand. I don't think there's any
question about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Garin gave long odds to that possibility. ``If I win the
lottery tomorrow, I'll be a lot richer,'' he said. ``If the
Republicans become more moderate, they will be a lot better. But
the chances of me winning the lottery and them becoming more
moderate are about equal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' first opportunity will come today when they
vote on a replacement for House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The
presumptive successor, Bob Livingston from Louisiana, is known for
his adroit legislative skills and ability to reach across the aisle
and work with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will also decide whether to elevate a woman _
Representative Jennifer Dunn of Washington _ to the number two spot
as majority leader, and the only black Republican in the House _
Representative J.C. Watts of Oklahoma _ to the post as Republican
conference chairman. Both candidates are considered to have a
serious chance of winning, though observers say the races are too
close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Anne Northup, a Republican from Kentucky who has
two adopted black children and garnered about 18 percent of the
black vote in the recent congressional election, has emphasized her
ability to help broaden the party's appeal to minorities in her
candidacy for vice chairman of the Republican conference _ number
six in the leadership hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Democratic leadership did not select a woman for a
top leadership post Monday _ Connecticut Representative Rosa
DeLauro was defeated in a contest to head the Democratic Caucus _
the Republicans are guaranteed to have at least one woman in its
upper ranks. Ohio Representative Deborah Pryce is running unopposed
for reelection as conference secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to win elections, you have to capture the middle, the
center, and I think the Republicans got a wakeup call on November
3,'' said Kenneth Duberstein, a Republican political consultant and
a chief of staff to former President Ronald Reagan. ``Sometimes
there's nothing like a near-death experience to concentrate the
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Mark Sanford, a Republican from South Carolina,
said: ``Necessity is the mother of all invention, and I think the
same holds true for the Republican Party. This is a turning
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanford, elected to Congress during the Republican stampede in
1994, asked: ``Do I think things will change? Yes. And if they
don't, I think we are in real trouble as a party.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, are counting on the GOP conservatives'
prevailing in its showdown with the political pragmatists and
moderates who say the party should try to emulate the success of
Republican governors, whose centrist style of governing has enabled
them to expand their base among women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats such as political consultant Tubby Harrison of Boston
said Democrats benefit from the conservatives' dominance in the GOP
because they can draw sharper distinctions with Republicans in the
absence of having anything else to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats don't really have a message,'' Harrison said.
``The Democrats have stands on particular problems, but there is no
central reason for their existence. The Republicans give them one.
The Republicans say this is what is important, and the Democrats
say we don't want to deal with that, so vote for us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Harrison said a standoff exists between
Republicans and Democrats. ``The Republicans have the ability to do
better, but so do the Democrats. So it's a question of which one
articulates the compelling message.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Duffy, a political analyst at the Cook Political
Report, said Republicans are going through ``the political
equivalent of group therapy.'' She said many have called her to ask
what lessons they can take from the midterm election that gave
Democrats five additional House seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the Republican problems are frankly mechanical, they
are tactical; and those are very easy to fix,'' she said, such as
returning to grass-roots get-out-the-vote efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Their larger problem, Duffy said, is finding a message that's
appealing. ``What they are going through now isn't that much
different from what Democrats went through after 1994, when the
party really had to take a hard look at itself and say, `We can no
longer be dominated by the left,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Bositis, a senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for
Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank in Washington,
said: ``There's no magic bullet that is going to attract black
voters or Hispanic voters to the Republican Party. At best, it's
going to be a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Representative Charles B. Rangel, a member of the
Democratic Black Caucus, doubts whether the GOP will make inroads
among minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is politically impossible for the Republicans to move to
the center. The people who are in control of the party are small in
number, but they would rather go down the tubes than deal with
us,'' Rangel said, referring to minority groups.

FRESH OR FROZEN TURKEY? THE ANSWER'S IN THE LABEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is the BIG one. Thanksgiving. Possibly the
most anticipated and scrutinized home-cooked meal of the year.
There are even rules for this dinner:
</P>
<P>
   1. You must serve turkey. It must be cooked until white instead
of pink and moist but not dry.
</P>
<P>
   2. The turkey is to be served with stuffing, which can be made
with anything from apples to oysters as long as it, too, is moist
and not dry.
</P>
<P>
   3. You have to have mashed potatoes and gravy, with lumps in the
potatoes but not in the gravy.
</P>
<P>
   But back to the turkey; the BIG bird.
</P>
<P>
   For best results, use the finest ingredients, advise chefs. But
which is best, fresh turkey or frozen turkey? It all depends on
whom you ask. ``You have to go with the fresh,'' said Bob Briggs,
associate dean of advanced cooking at the Culinary Institute of
America in Hyde Park, N.Y. ``Freezing breaks down cells and when
you thaw (the turkey) out, all that water that comes out of the
package is moisture that was in the bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to mention all the hassles of thawing: the water
collecting in the bottom of the refrigerator, trying to pry out the
frozen neck,'' Briggs said. ``You go to cook it and you find it
isn't thawed completely and you just about have to stand on the
thing to get the bags out of the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all chefs agree. Food safety is the issue that makes
Michael St. John go with the frozen birds. St. John is the
executive chef at The Desmond in Colonie, N.Y., where the kitchen
staff will cook 25 turkeys for the holiday. ``When a frozen bird is
processed, it is killed, cleaned and flash frozen within minutes.
With a fresh turkey, you have raw meat going from the farm to the
warehouse, from the warehouse to the store and from the store to
your home, where it will sit a day or two before you cook it.
``I've had fresh turkey at home a couple of times and I have to
say, I have my concerns about fresh turkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are more concerned with the additives in frozen turkeys
than with the food safety issue. According to the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, MSG, salt and sodium erythorbate (a synthetic agent
used in processed meats to preserve color) cannot be used on birds
labeled ``fresh'' or ``minimally processed.''
</P>
<P>
   Frozen birds, however, can be processed with these additives but
the ingredients must be listed on the label. In addition, many
frozen turkeys are ``basted'' or ``self-basted,'' meaning the
turkey has been injected with a solution containing some or all of
the following: edible animal fat, broth, stock, water, spices and
flavor-enhancers. Again, the label must identify the common name of
all the ingredients and the amount of the solution used.
</P>
<P>
   For assurance that the turkey they're serving wasn't being fed
antibiotics or grain treated with pesticides, some people are
turning to organically or naturally raised turkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although those practices have been approved for use by the
USDA, there is some controversy about whether or not those are
really good things to put in your body,'' said Eric Paul, meat
manager at the Honest Weight Co-op in Albany. Honest Weight will
sell between 60 and 80 organically raised birds from the Misty
Knoll farm in Vermont for the holiday, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest reason for the popularity of frozen turkeys
is price. They are generally less expensive than fresh.
</P>
<P>
   While you may think you're buying a fresh turkey if it has a
label that says ``never been frozen,'' that may not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to the USDA, the term ``fresh'' may only be used on
raw poultry products that have never been stored below 26 F.
Poultry stored at 0 F., or below, must be labeled ``frozen.'' But
there are no rules for labeling fowl stored between 0 and 26 F.To
ensure you get what you want, look for ``fresh'' or ``frozen'' on
the label.
</P>
<P>
   So, which is better? We might as well try to answer the
proverbial ``Which came first, the chicken or the egg?'' Instead
we'll quote the USDA: ``There is no appreciable difference between
a fresh or frozen bird. It is just a matter of preference.''

THE POPE PLANS FOR THE YEAR 2000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is widely known that many religions have unusual, even
bizarre, expectations for the year 2000. For instance, some
Christian fundamentalists hold that the ongoing US-Iraqi conflict
is the prophesied Time of Tribulation preceding the post-millennial
Apocalypse. But it is less widely known that Pope John Paul II and
the Vatican have been pursuing an ambitious spiritual agenda for
the new millennium, aimed at a purification and renewal of the
Roman Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the pope declared that the year 2000 would be ``a
turning point in human history.'' Four years ago, in a
little-noticed apostolic letter, ``As the Third Millennium Draws
Near,'' John Paul wrote that ``preparing for the year 2000 has
become as it were an (interpretive) key of my pontificate.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has carefully distanced himself from the millennarian
Christian sects that are fanning apocalyptic expectations for the
year 2000. Indeed, in what almost amounts to a humorous aside, the
1994 letter acknowledges the historical dispute over the year of
Christ's birth _ some scholars believe it may have been 4 B.C. _
and the resulting uncertainty of the precise timing of the
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Landes, the medieval historian who directs Boston
University's Center for Millennial Studies, calls John Paul ``a
soft millennialist,'' meaning he does not expect any apocalyptic
prophecies to be fulfilled in 2000 AD. On the other hand, says
Landes, ``The pope has undertaken a level of introspection the
Vatican has never seen before. He wants everybody in the church to
embark on a meditation on what the meaning of Christ is and what
the meaning of faith is.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _Under John Paul, the Vatican commissioned an 11-year
investigation into the Church's role in the Holocaust, culminating
in an extraordinary _ and controversial _ statement of
``repentance'' released in March.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _Similarly, a two-decade inquiry into another dark corner of
church history _ the Inquisition _ resulted in a scholarly
conference last month. For the first time, the Vatican opened some
of its Inquisition archives to researchers outside the church.
</P>
<P>
   _Also last month, the pope, a former professor of moral
philosophy, published a sweeping encyclical on ``Faith and
Reason,'' a generally well-received condemnation of
anti-intellectualism in the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   And yes, there is more to come. John Paul has said he would like
to visit Lebanon, Jerusalem, and the rest of the Holy Land _ ``the
places on the road taken by the people of God of the Old Covenant''
_ during the year 2000. For the same trip, he also mentions
visiting Egypt, Mount Sinai, and Damascus, ``the city which
witnessed the conversion of St. Paul.'' Whether geopolitical
realities will allow the pontiff to accomplish this historical
mission, which does not yet figure on his official calendar, is
another question altogether.
</P>
<P>
   On Ash Wednesday (March 8), 2000, John Paul is scheduled to lead
a public ``Request for Pardon,'' highlighted by a Mass procession
to the Circus Maximus in Rome. Catholic officials say John Paul
will use the traditional day of repentance to make a public
confession of sins committed by church members during the past
thousand years. Among the most grievous transgressions, in John
Paul's view, are the 11th-century schism between the Greek Orthodox
and Latin churches, and the 16th century Protestant Reformation:
``Such wounds openly contradict the will of Christ and are a cause
of scandal to the world,'' he writes. ``These sins of the past
still burden us and ... it is necessary to make amends for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's ambitions for a rejuvenated Catholicism are dramatic,
and obviously heartfelt. For me, the pope's physical frailty adds a
layer of tension to his historic demarches. Although it sounds
callous, ``Will the pope live until the year 2000?'' is an
extremely important question in Catholic circles. If, God willing,
he lives and thrives well into the next millennium, he will have
transformed the church as no other pontiff in this century _ or
perhaps in this millennium.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLEMONT, Mass. _ Susan Patlove and her husband came to this
quiet Mohawk Trail town in the early 1960s to join a new
alternative community.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the community, where the couple raised three children
and still live, shared similar values. The Buddhism came later.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us were Buddhists then, but most of us are now,
although we all practice different forms,'' says Patlove.
``Buddhism is one of the things that happened to our generation,''
said the 51-year-old freelance editor. ``We took
consciousness-expanding to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Buddhism _ a philosophy that through meditation cultivates
self-awareness, compassion, discipline, and moderation _ has become
trendy in recent years, the favored faith of celebrities like
Richard Gere, Courtney Love, and members of the Beastie Boys. It
has also been the focus of recent Hollywood movies such as
``Kundun'' and ``Seven Years in Tibet.'' Instruction in arcane
Buddhist meditation techniques, some once confined to remote
Tibetan monasteries, is now almost as easy to find as yoga or
karate training.
</P>
<P>
   But there are few places in the nation where Buddhism in its
major forms and schools of practice has put down roots so deeply
and become such an accepted part of the landscape as in the verdant
hill towns of northwestern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People joke that out here you can probably find more Buddhist
groups than churches,'' says Patlove, a Zen Buddhist.
</P>
<P>
   One reason Buddhism has found such easy acceptance is the area's
long tradition of religious tolerance, dating to Colonial days when
Quakers and other dissidents, fleeing Boston's regimented
Puritanism, found a haven among the inland hills.
</P>
<P>
   The presence now of five major colleges and universities in
Western Mas-sa-chusetts also fosters open-mindedness. ``There are a
lot of artists and crafts people around here, and they tend to be
open and want to be with like-minded people,'' says Marit Cranmer
of Conway, a weaver who practices a form of Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in Buddhist meditation in Western Massachusetts
is an amazing phenomenon,'' says Mark Hart of Shutesbury. ``That's
why I settled here.'' A native of Washington state, Hart has a
doctorate in theology from Boston College and at one time
considered becoming a Roman Catholic monk.
</P>
<P>
   Hart makes his living teaching Vipassana, a type of meditation
associated with Theravadan Buddhism of Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans usually sample different kinds of Buddhism and then
select the spiritual path that appeals to them the most,'' says
Patlove. ``I like Zen because it's starkly simple and challenging,
but Tibetan Buddhism is attractive to a lot of people because it's
so colorful and artistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Patlove says that becoming a Buddhist was a gradual process that
started with readings and prog-ressed to attending lectures and
then meditation classes. ``It happened slowly during a time of
searching when I was in my 20s,'' she recalls. ``A lot of us were
looking for something, and Buddhism pointed us in a different
direction and gave us a new worldview without contradicting
anything in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Patlove says she grew up in an academic family that wasn't
particularly religious, but occasionally attended Unitarian
services. Her husband, Leslie Patlove, was raised in the Jewish
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Like most American Buddhists, the Patloves neither flaunt nor
conceal their Buddhism. They meditate together for 45 minutes on
weekdays and for several hours with a group on Sundays. ``Many
people I know well have no idea that I'm a Buddhist,'' Susan
Patlove says. ``Sitting quietly with your eyes closed doesn't
attract attention and isn't threatening to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs of Buddhism's spread in Western Massachusetts are
increasingly evident. Stupas, traditional bell-shaped shrines, are
certainly not as common on hilltown skylines as the spires of
Congregational churches. But neither are they that unusual anymore.
Leverett, a small farming town once as thoroughly Yankee as baked
beans for breakfast, now has two Buddhist temple complexes.
</P>
<P>
   The Peace Pagoda, a large domed white stupa decorated with
images of Buddha, stands on a hilltop about a mile from Leverett's
town center. Beside it is a Japanese-style meditation garden
maintained by volunteers. Under construction nearby is a temple
that will contain a prayer hall and living quarters for Buddhist
monks and nuns.
</P>
<P>
   The pagoda was built 13 years ago by monks of the Nipponzan
Myohoji order, founded in Japan after World War II to work for
world peace through prayer and pilgrimage. The order was attracted
to Leverett's rural beauty and tranquillity but was even more
impressed that the town had declared itself ``a nuclear-free
zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the pagoda community are currently leading an
``Interfaith Pilgrimage of the Middle Passage,'' in which dozens of
people are spending a year retracing the trans-Atlantic slave trade
route to recall the sufferings of the slave trade. ``Buddhism is
the basis of our activities, and we chant Buddhist prayers on our
pilgrimages,'' says Brother Gyogo Kato, ``but our primary focus is
on peace and justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kato says his community was regarded with some suspicion when it
arrived, but that faded. ``Gradually, we have been accepted, and
now we get a stream of visitors.'' he says. ``The younger
generation is not so involved in mainstream churches and is looking
for alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   At the foot of the hill below the Peace Pagoda is Wat Kiry
Vongsa Bopharem, an ornate white-and-gold temple typical of those
in Cambodia. Redolent of incense, a large shrine room is filled
with images of Buddha and photographs of revered monks and
teachers. The temple has a resident community of three monks and 10
nuns, all Cambodian-born. There are plans to build a large stupa
nearby, a shrine that would also be a repository for the ashes of
deceased Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Cambodian temple, but it's not just for
Cambodians,'' says Kork Ork, a young monk from Amherst who smiles
often and wears an orange robe. ``A lot of Americans come and sit
and meditate with us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   A Buddhist family group also meets every Sunday afternoon in the
Leverett Town Hall. Meetings offer a group meditation for adults,
along with what amounts to Sunday school for their children. Hart,
who has two small children, teaches meditation techniques to kids
at the meetings and also discusses basic Buddhist beliefs with
them. ``My own children sometimes sit on our laps when my wife and
I meditate,'' he says.

 CHARLMONT, Mass.: ... he says.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since most American practitioners are first-generation
Buddhists, they have no working model for their religion in family
life. ``There's no blueprint for being a Buddhist in this
country,'' says Susan Patlove. ``It will be interesting to see how
that resolves itself.''
</P>
<P>
   When her children were small, Patlove says, the family always
had a Christmas tree, but considered it more a seasonal symbol than
a religious one. Nominally Buddhist, her children are not as
committed to the faith as the parents are. ``But, they're very
open, and their generation has to evolve, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Evolution is precisely what American Buddhism is going through
now, says Geoffrey Brown of Greenfield, an ordained novice priest
(comparable to a deacon in many Christian faiths) of the Soto Zen
school of Buddhism. ``Soto has its roots in Japan, but we can't
transfer Japanese culture to this country. The soil is different,''
says Brown. ``We have to create our own institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 41, was ordained four years ago by Rev. Issho Fujita,
abbot of the Valley Zendo in Charlemont, the Buddhist community to
which the Patloves belong.
</P>
<P>
   Brown says his ordination was a milestone on a spiritual journey
that began while he was a student at the Putney School in Vermont,
and included Buddhist studies at Columbia University and years of
wandering from one hippie commune to another.
</P>
<P>
   His wife Rebecca, 37, is also a practicing Zen Buddhist. The
couple has an 11-month-old daughter, Sophie. ``We take turns
baby-sitting her while the other one meditates,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has no formal priestly duties, works full time as a
psychiatric nurse in a Greenfield hospital. ``I wear my priest's
robes only in the zendo,'' the meditation hall, he says, ``but I
keep my head shaven like a Buddhist priest to symbolize that I have
renounced worldly values.''
</P>
<P>
   While some Buddhist centers in the area, such as the two in
Leverett, clearly reflect their Asian origins, others are not only
Americanized but even look thoroughly Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the Center for Buddhist Studies in Barre _ which
has a large reference library and offers lectures, classes, and
workshops on different aspects of Buddhism _ blends seamlessly into
its small-town surroundings. Offices are in a 225-year-old
converted farmhouse. The white clapboard meditation hall, a modern
building, resembles an old New England meetinghouse, except that
there are cushions on the floor instead of pews.
</P>
<P>
   The center is affiliated with the Insight Meditation Society,
also in Barre. Founded in 1975 by former Peace Corps volunteers,
IMS is one of the oldest Buddhist meditation centers in the
country. It was also among the first to teach Vipassana, also known
as insight meditation, an intense practice intended to heighten
self-awareness and increase self-control.
</P>
<P>
   IMS retreats range in length from 10 to 90 days, during which
participants meditate with closed eyes and in absolute silence from
about 5 in the morning until 9 at night, with only a few breaks to
eat and exercise. ``The crown jewel of the program is the
three-month retreat,'' says Mu Soeng,, the center's director.
``There's always a waiting list, and you have to sign up six months
in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Insight meditation is also taught at the Vipassana Meditation
Society in Shelburne, a 100-acre complex where as many as 150
meditators at a time are in residence. But there, unlike at IMS,
there are no images or shrines to Buddha, and the focus is
completely on the practice and benefits of meditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vipassana's tradition is Buddhist, and we honor the Buddha's
teachings, but the technique is nonsectarian,'' says Luke Matthews,
manager of the center.
</P>
<P>
   The Vipassana Society is constructing a large Burmese-style
pagoda that will be topped by a lotus-shaped gilded stupa. While
the partially completed pagoda's exterior will be colorful and
ornate, the interior is like a beehive for humans. It consists of
meditation cells, small windowless chambers , dimly lighted, where
future Vipassana meditators will spend most of their time during
retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan Buddhism, which incorporates elements of Hinduism and
shamanism, is, in its original form, the most ritualized and
traditional of all. Shamanism is the belief in good and bad spirits
that can be influenced by priests. Americans often practice a more
simplified version of Tibetan Buddhism based primarily on the
teachings of individual lamas, or monks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dzogchen Community in Conway is housed in a large yellow and
white Victorian building that was once the town grammar school.
Other than the removal of the inner walls of a modular annex to
convert classrooms into a meditation and meeting space, the
building is little changed from the days when it held
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the community are followers of Choegyal NamkaiNorbu,
a Tibetan lama who lives in Italy. He visits Conway, North American
headquarters of his movement, every two years. ``We're not as
traditional or regimented as some Buddhists,'' says Jim Smith, a
50-year-old builder who lives in Amherst, ``and we're really a
practice, not a religion, so you don't have to accept or reject
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the low-profile Dzogchen Community, the Mahasidda
Nyingmapa Center in out-of-the-way Hawley _ whose members are
disciples of another Tibetan lama, Dodrupchen Rinpoche _ proudly
displays its Tibetan connection. The white and gold stupa, the
colorful prayer flags fluttering from a row of poles, and the blue
and yellow wooden temple all stand out vividly against a
pine-tree-covered hillside.
</P>
<P>
   The temple replaced a smaller one destroyed in 1984 in a fire
set by several troubled Vietnam veterans trying to call attention
to their problems. Shocked by the incident, veterans organizations
around the country contributed to a reconstruction fund and dozens
of local volunteers helped put up the new building.
</P>
<P>
   Flooded with sunlight and scented with incense, the Mahasidda
Nyingmapa shrine room is Tibetan in feeling. There are images of
the Buddha and revered Buddhist teachers, and others of dancing
figures representing demons, gods, and goddesses from Tibetan
mythology. Yet the atmosphere is cozy as well as exotic.
</P>
<P>
   David Dvore, a 45-year-old computer consultant from Rowe and a
longtime member of the center, loudly chants in Tibetan as he
prostrates himself before the shrine, touching the floor with his
forehead three times. Then, he leaps to his feet, picks up his
briefcase and _ as the scowling demons look on _ greets a visitor
with a grin. ``Hi, Im Dave,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Many American Buddhist centers emphasize individual meditation.
However, Mahasidda Nyingmapa emphasizes community, much like a
typical small-town church or synagogue. The 50 or so members have
frequent social gatherings, Dvore says, and usually meditate
together on Sunday mornings.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist groups in the hill towns generally go their own way,
Dvore observes, respecting their differences and letting people
come to them rather than proselytizing. ``Buddhism is vast, varied,
and adaptable,'' he says. ``Buddha taught different practices for
different kinds of people. You don't even have to call yourself a
Buddhist if you don't want to. He didn't.''

HER SEEDS OF RENEWAL WERE SOWN IN TRAGEDY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   One night when she was a 15-year-old worried about grades and
boyfriends, Naomi Levy was awakened by her mother and sister. In
her groggy state, Levy thought they were saying, ``The doctor gave
Daddy a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' Levy replied. ``So what if he got a shot?'' But
what they were really trying frantically to tell Levy was that her
father had been shot in a botched robbery attempt on a Brooklyn
street.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, her father died. For Levy, many other things
died, too _ her religious faith, hopes for future, and confidence
in herself. But it was from that despairing moment that Levy began
a new life &UR;  &LR; whose foundation was built on her Jewish roots.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Levy is a successful and pioneering rabbi who was in the
first group of women admitted into the rabbinate by the
Conservative movement in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   A mother of two, Levy has turned her story and those of many of
her congregants into a book, ``To Begin Again,'' a treatise on how
God and faith can help people recover from the worst of times. It
deals with a fundamental issue raised by human suffering _ Why
would God allow this to happen?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that wracked Levy after her father's murder _ a
killing that was never solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, his death was the end of everything that had been
sacred,'' Levy, 35, recalled in an interview last week in Boston.
``I completely lost my faith. I was very angry. I stopped praying.
I was going to a private Orthodox high school, but I hated God.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a painfully bleak moment for a young girl who had
wanted to be a rabbi ``ever since I was 3 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in Levy's life came when she was in college at
Cornell University in upstate New York. She came to a new
understanding of God, she says, by studying modern Israeli poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to believe not in a God who prevents all evil, but in a
God who is with us in times of pain,'' said Levy, who resigned as
spiritual leader of Temple Mishkon Tephilo in Venice, Calif., two
years ago to spend more time writing. She became a rabbi in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``If God's job description really was to prevent evil in the
world, then all you need to do is look around you to realize God is
doing an awful job,'' she added. As she studied the great Jewish
philosophers, Levy came to a different belief in the complex
relationship between God and humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith isn't about magic,'' Levy said. ``It isn't about putting
a prayer request here and expecting a direct answer to come out
there. God isn't there to screw up our lives. God is there to help
us when we screw up our lives or our lives become screwed up. God
gives us the capacity to soar beyond any tragedy and to resurrect
our lives and to learn to rejoice again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new outlook on God not only restored Levy's faith but made
it stronger. ``I wake up every morning appreciating the blessings
God has given me,'' she said. ``It helps me every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, Levy, who was in the first group of women rabbis to
train at the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, chronicles
the wrenching tales of some of her congregants, such as a woman
raped on her way to Yom Kippur services.
</P>
<P>
   Her congregants, Levy says, helped her realize that ``there is
no way I can ever answer the question of why certain things happen.
But one question I think we can grapple with is how. How can I
carry on with everything that has happened? That is where we can
begin to deal with pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy hopes her book, though steeped in Jewish theology, can be
useful to people of all faiths. ``When something bad happens so
many other pieces of our lives are affected _ our faith, our
relationship with our families, how we look at our work,'' she
said. ``We can't change that one big thing. We can't take back the
death, the rape, the divorce, the job loss. But all the other
ancillary things that are affected we do have power over. We can
start over again. God is our ally in that.''

SCHLESINGER ON JFK `MYTHS'; MRS. STARR REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

   They say the premium cigar craze is finally waning. But you
can't tell that from looking at  &UR; Cigar Aficionado &LR; , the robust (386
ad-laden pages) glossy devoted to the joys of the $10 Macanudo. The
December cover is entrancingly eye-catching with its warm, hazy
illustration of John F. Kennedy relaxing with a fine cigar. But the
``JFK Revisited'' cover story _ Arthur Schlesinger Jr.'s rebuttal
to almost every nasty Kennedy story in circulation _ isn't as
convincing as the cover art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myth breeds countermyth,'' writes Schlesinger, attacking the
revisionist take on Kennedy as an ``incorrigible philanderer, a
reckless risk-taker,'' and a ``bellicose'' Cold Warrior. In his
determined effort to reestablish the myth, Schlesinger insists,
among other things, that JFK: did not steal the 1960 election with
Illinois voter fraud; did not recruit the Mafia to kill Castro; and
was not put in a compromising position by gangster Sam Giancana
(although Schlesinger grudgingly admits Kennedy shared a bed with
Giancana's mistress Judith Campbell). He suggests that the stories
of the late president's sexual conquests were exaggerated and
posits that Kennedy would never have ``Americanized the war'' in
Vietnam. (Calling Oliver Stone.)
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Schlesinger's timeliest point _ given the results of
this month's Congressional elections _ is his contention that
``history shows no connection between private morality and public
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   In this era of Rat Pack cable movies depicting Kennedy as little
more than a Vegas lounge lizard, it's time for cooler heads to lead
a sensible reassessment. But Schlesinger's hyperaggressive defense
of the Kennedy legacy seems to succeed largely in countering the
foggy anti-Kennedy tales with an equally thick layer of, fittingly
enough, smoke.

   Speaking of womanizing,  &UR; Mirabella &LR;  offers up an exclusive
interview with Alice Starr, the largely invisible wife of the
independent counsel and Lewinsky report author. There's nothing
surprising or provocative here, as Mrs. Starr stoutly defends her
husband as a rigorously honest man and a loving husband and father
who doesn't bring the stress of the job home at night.
</P>
<P>
   Unfailingly temperate, Starr reserves her harshest words for New
York Times columnist Maureen Dowd (``she doesn't know my husband'')
after Dowd characterized the special counsel as a kind of
prosecutorial Peeping Tom.
</P>
<P>
   There are no Hillary Clintonesque outbursts here about a
left-wing conspiracy out to bury her husband. But that doesn't keep
Mirabella from trying to spin an otherwise arid interview with
repeated comparisons to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hillary Clinton, Alice Starr must defend a husband accused
of being obsessed with sex. ``Like Hillary Clinton, Alice has
always handled the family's finances.'' ``Like Hillary Rodham and
Bill Clinton, Alice Mendell and Ken Starr fell in love almost
instantly.'' You get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   One notable difference is a family friend's suggestion that ``I
don't think that Alice Starr has ever had to put up with
infidelity.'' Touche.

   This week, the Associated Press moved a report that New York's
``Son of Sam'' serial killer David Berkowitz was now saying that
the devil made him do it. A converted evangelical Christian,
Berkowitz _ who pleaded guilty to six murders in 1978 _ says in a
new video that he was a soldier in a ``Satanic army ... determined
to bring New York City to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   This should all be good news for  &UR; gear &LR; , another of those
proliferating new ``magazines for men'' (read: a pinch of skin and
a smidgen of attitude), which features a story arguing that
Berkowitz was part of a sophisticated satanic cult that planned and
committed the Son of Sam murders.
</P>
<P>
   Mysteries are a weak point. I've never yet been able to finger
the culprit in a Perry Mason episode, so I'm not the best judge of
complicated murder plots. But this story sure does offer the mother
of all conspiracy theories. In one way or another, writer Maury
Terry tries to tie Berkowitz and his cult _ The Process Church of
the Final Judgment _ to Charles Manson, Sirhan Sirhan, and the
horrific 1979-1981 Atlanta child killings.
</P>
<P>
   The final graphs of the story chillingly inform us that the
Process cult under a ```socially acceptable' cover'' is still
around, has amassed a vast real estate empire, and is hoping ``to
inspire Armageddon in time for its professed witching hour _ the
Millennium.'' Kind of strains credulity, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>

   Finally, with no actual NBA basketball season to watch, it's at
least time for some hot stove league action. The  &UR; Athlon &LR;   &UR; Sports &LR; 
Pro Basketball Edition is sure to inspire debate with its ranking
of the 50 Greatest Basketball players of all time. The Celtics are
richly rep-resented with Larry Bird (No.6) John Havlicek (11), Bob
Cousy (13), Bill Sharman (26), Dave Cowens (28), and Kevin McHale
(39). Most satisfying to Boston fans will be Bill Russell's
designation (2) as king of the great centers, nipping Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar (3) and the hated Wilt Chamberlain (7).
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious flaw in the rankings is the Chicago Bull
inflation factor. Michael Jordan is a deserving No.1, but Scottie
Pippen seems too high at No.19, and Dennis Rodman at No.47 is as
ludicrous as one of his multihued coiffures.

TWENTY YEARS LATER, A SURVIVOR REMEMBERS JONESTOWN

<P>
   A Jonestown Survivor's Story of Life and Death in the Peoples
Temple &QL; 
By Deborah Layton &QL; 
Anchor, 309 pp., $23.95 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago today, the world first learned of unimaginable
horror in the jungles of Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   There, at a self-styled retreat called Jonestown, hundreds of
people died during a night of madness. Among the dead was Jim
Jones, a preacher-turned-demagogue who convinced the members of his
``Peoples Temple'' that their compound was under attack, and that
the time had come to ``die with dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a day Jones was prepared for, and had practiced
repeatedly during his ``White Night'' suicide drills. As Jones
rambled on about revolutionary suicide, his followers drank cups of
cyanide-laced punch. Parents fed the fatal potion to their
children, and those who refused were forced to ingest it at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Jones would die from a single gunshot, perhaps self-inflicted,
to the head. In all, 913 men, women, and children perished amid the
stench of heat and death.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Layton was a member of the Peoples Temple for seven
years, but she would not die among its followers. Once a member of
Jones's inner circle, she made a harrowing escape months before the
massacre, and was the first to reveal the escalating paranoia and
violence of the man she once unfailingly obeyed and called
``Father.''
</P>
<P>
   In her shattering memoir, ``Seductive Poison,'' Layton recalls
what led her, as well as her brother and mother, into Jones's
terrifying lair, and how she found the resolve to leave. In
riveting detail, Layton unveils the sorrowful story of a family
nearly destroyed by Jones, as well as her own blind faith in
someone who was more madman than messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, every few years there's another discovered cult,
another group of lost believers. But the attention given cults
began with Jonestown. Its name became ``an ominous warning to all
those Americans who sought meaning for their lives,'' in fringe
organizations, writes Charles Krause in the book's introduction.
``Jonestown would demonstrate in bold relief just how dangerous
these groups and their leaders could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Krause, now a foreign affairs correspondent for ``The NewsHour
with Jim Lehrer,'' was a reporter for The Washington Post when he
arrived in Guyana two days before the massacre. He was on the
makeshift airstrip when temple loyalists opened fire on those who
tried to leave Jonestown.
</P>
<P>
   Five people, including California congressman Leo Ryan, were
killed; Krause was among 12 wounded. It was Layton's testimony
about the horrors of Jonestown that led Ryan's delegation to make
their ill-fated trip. Layton's brother, Larry, was the only person
convicted for the deaths, and he is currently serving a life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   It was Larry Layton Jr. who first discovered Jones in 1968.
Jones was then a charismatic preacher in San Francisco, with a
growing congregation drawn to his fiery sermons denouncing racism,
social injustice, and the Vietnam War. Larry encouraged his
youngest sister, Deborah, to attend one of Jones's serv-ices. She
was moved by the multiracial parishioners, but especially by Jones,
who seemed to be directing his every word toward her.
</P>
<P>
   At 17, Layton was desperately seeking direction. She rebelled
against her parents and experimented with alcohol and other drugs.
Even time in an English boarding school did little to curb her
unruly spirit. But when Layton looked at Jones she saw in his
``clean, radiant, handsome face'' someone ``easy to trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Other followers spoke of Jones's healing powers, and his
``family of all races.'' He garnered the enthusiastic support of
then California Governor Ronald Reagan, and of Willie Brown, now
San Francisco mayor, who once called Jones ``a combination of
Martin Luther King, Angela Davis, Albert Einstein, and Chairman
Mao.'' But there were also Jones's dire warnings of a coming
apocalypse, and the ``promised land'' to which he and his followers
would escape.
</P>
<P>
   Layton joined the Peoples Temple, and soon witnessed Jones's
darker side, which became more evident once the Temple moved from
California to Guyana. There were public beatings, and those who
questioned their leader's authority mysteriously disappeared or
suffered sudden, fatal accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Jones controlled every aspect of his followers' existence, from
their sex lives to time spent with those outside the Temple.
Layton's mother, Lisa, would eventually leave her husband and join
the group, in part to be closer to her youngest child. Her mother,
who had escaped Hitler's Germany, would die of cancer _ without
pain medication, which Jones had confiscated for his own uses _
days before the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not knowingly join `cults' that will ultimately
destroy and kill them,'' Layton writes. ``In their open-hearted
endeavor to find meaning in their lives, they walk blindly into the
promise of ultimate answers, and a higher purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   In reading this chilling memoir, some may desire ultimate
answers to the most obvious question, namely, why any sane person
would join such a group. Layton doesn't cheapen her ordeal, or the
lives of those lost, with throwaway analysis. Perhaps the only
answer lies in the basic human need for fulfillment, sanctuary, and
belonging. And as long as such emotional cravings exist, there will
be shrewd self-appointed saviors promising heaven _ and leading
their followers to hell.

AT A VERMONT RETREAT, IT'S A HOMESPUN HARVEST 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHERYL JULIAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST SANDGATE, Vt. _ It's quiet up here on a chilly Sunday in
November. Chickens scramble across the dirt road and a black goat
and his white mate cut stark silhouettes against the mountainside.
This corner of Vermont, northwest of Bennington, is congested with
traffic during the warm months. Now that the tourists are gone, the
natives and ``flatlanders'' are left.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher and Adrienne Kimball don't pretend to be anything
but city folk who weekend here in their country house. Christopher
Kimball, the publisher of Cook's Illustrated and Handcraft
Illustrated magazines and author of ``The Cook's Bible,'' is never
seen around Boston without his trademark bow tie, the perfect
signature to his buttoned-up persona. But up here, giving in to a
``farming bug'' inherited from his mother and grandfather, he is
more easygoing, reserved yet happier in his role as gentleman
farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Kimballs' kitchen, every bowl appears to be in use,
the timer is beeping, pots of root vegetables are vigorously
bubbling on Viking burners, and all four children _ Whitney, 10;
Caroline, 8; Charlie, 3; and 6-month-old Emily _ seem to need
something at once. ``This is what my life is really like,'' Kimball
says.
</P>
<P>
   The midday meal is about to be served, a meal that bears more
than a passing resemblance to the Thanksgiving feast because the
harvest is over and the Kimballs are cooking many of their own
vegetables: potatoes they dug up and are about to garnish with
caramelized onions, which they also grew. They'll mash their own
turnips into the potatoes, though the dish isn't billed that way
when served (the children might not eat them). Sweet potatoes are
glazed with butter and molasses, and buttermilk biscuits _ the same
flaky rounds one of the local women made when Kimball summered up
here as a boy _ are about to emerge from the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball, who began his cooking magazine 18 years ago, celebrates
the home-style food he was raised on and has spent much of his
career perfecting. His just-published ``The Yellow Farmhouse
Cookbook'' (Little, &UR;  &LR; Brown and Co.) is based on this uncomplicated
fare, meals you might find in any American home when Sunday dinners
were served in the middle of the day. The chapters are arranged
according to how a farmer and his family think about the land and
the seasons, as in ``The Root Cellar'' and ``The Chicken Coop.'' In
this household, the harvest feast is a way of life. Variations on
the Thanksgiving menu appear all fall.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball, 47, is the third generation of his family to buy land
and dabble in agriculture. He's the grandson of Dr. Stanley White,
a Washington doctor who had ``two of everything _ like two cows and
two chickens'' on a farm in Leesburg, Va. In the 1950s, Kimball's
parents bought land in this Vermont town, where they raised pigs
and Black Angus. When the marriage faltered many years later,
Kimball's mother, Mary Alice White, bought a farm in Salisbury,
Conn. White's grandchildren call her ``Grandmaw,'' based on her
acronym. Grandmaw _ a doctorate in psychology who spent a good part
of her career at Columbia University _ now raises 150 chickens and
collects freshly laid eggs in her retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' says Kimball, who is famous for his meticulous
recipe testing, ``when I use her eggs in baking, they turn the cake
yellow. The yolks are almost orange colored and they're thicker. I
suspect in the old days they were thickeners.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandmaw will host her son and his family for Thanksgiving, and
the table in Salisbury will boast the traditional American menu:
roast turkey, sweet potatoes, and mashed potatoes. And endless
desserts. ``My mother likes trifle. There are pies. We have pecan
pie, apple pie, and pumpkin pie,'' he says. With seven for dinner,
``it's not enough people to eat all that pie. But she's not unhappy
with the leftovers.''
</P>
<P>
   After Thanksgiving, the Kimballs head up to Vermont to re-create
the meal _ turkey, pies, and all. He roasts turkey the slow way,
unstuffed and untrussed, beginning in a 350-degree oven, then 250
degrees, four hours for an 18-pound bird. He swears by this method,
having made 28 turkeys before settling on it. ``We crave turkey
sandwiches,'' says Adrienne Kimball, 38, who works in Cook's
marketing department.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Kimball has been baking a lot of pies lately. He's
been traveling to promote ``Yellow Farmhouse,'' and the apple pie
he's making uses a mixture of McIntosh and Granny Smith. At home he
prefers Macouns or Northern Spys, both of which he grows on his
land, but those varieties are only available locally. He decided to
develop a pie with apples anyone in the country could find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Macs have a nice flavor and they cook to applesauce,'' he
says, ``but I don't use a thickener. The Granny Smiths hold their
shape. I like to serve the pie cold and the apples firm up. A
thickener ruins the flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 40 apple trees on the Kimballs' land, and they're
planning to plant more. Kimball, an indefatigable researcher, did a
blind tasting of 17 apples at Cook's Brookline offices and
discovered that new apples were developed by cross-pollination, and
that now genetic engineering has taken over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am thinking about abandoning the new disease-resistant
varieties,'' he writes in ``Yellow Farmhouse,'' for ``an orchard of
full-growth old-fashioned varieties _ Freedom, Winter Banana, Blue
Pearmain, and Liberty.'' These are antique cold-hardy apples once
prevalent in New England orchards.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball writes lucidly about the land and the people in West
Sandgate he has followed for 40 years, particularly Junior. Junior
Bentley, who employed the young Christopher Kimball on his farm,
taught him milking and haying. Junior comes to dinner at the
Kimballs' house. ``If we say 6 p.m.,'' says Kimball, ``he pulls his
truck up at 5:59.''
</P>
<P>
   That precision isn't unfamiliar to Kimball, whose philosophy is
to cook scientifically.
</P>
<P>
   He measures everything, from the 1/4 cup of capers he will add
later to veal shanks to the 2 tablespoons of parsley that goes into
the caramelized onions for the potatoes. Adrienne Kimball follows
suit. She weighs the sweet potatoes, first placing a dish on the
scale, then subtracting it from the measurement. She sets a timer
for 17 minutes to cook the quartered potatoes (a master chart in
``Yellow Farmhouse'' gives boiling and steaming times for several
kinds of potatoes cut into various shapes). A measuring spoon adds
the 2 tablespoons of molasses to the potatoes.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the art world's fervor over the traveling
Vincent van Gogh exhibition, it's easy to forget that the capital
has a wealth of other treasures to offer, including temporary
exhibitions rivaling the van Gogh show in quality.
</P>
<P>
   Hours spent in the iffy pursuit of van Gogh passes might better
be devoted to enjoying the National Gallery of Art's immense
permanent collection. Housed in two separate buildings on the
National Mall, it includes other van Gogh paintings among thousands
of works that span the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, one rare find is Leonardo da Vinci's ``Ginevra de'
Benci,'' the only painting by the famed Florentine artist in the
Western Hemisphere and one of only three portraits of women
(including Mona Lisa) painted by da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   Another gem, commanding its own room at the gallery, is Augustus
Saint-Gaudens' memorial to Gen. Robert Gould Shaw and the
Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the African-American unit that
inspired the Civil War movie ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   If your goal in Washington is not just van Gogh bragging rights,
but a memorable aesthetic experience, here are some other good
bets:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gifts to the Nation from Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney. Van
Gogh's 1989 ``Self-Portrait'' is a highlight of this donation from
one of the finest American private collections of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   While this exhibition is small _ only 16 paintings _ it is
replete with significant works by artists including Henri Matisse,
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, George
Bellows, Thomas Eakins, Edward Hopper, Henri Rousseau and James
McNeill Whistler. It is on view through Jan. 3 at the National
Gallery's East Building.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige. This exhibit at the
Phillips Collection in Northwest Washington brings together 62
Impressionist winter landscape paintings.
</P>
<P>
   On view through Jan. 3, it focuses on the ``snow effect'' works
of Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley and others.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Phillips Collection is a privately owned museum,
there is an admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whistler's ``Harmony in Blue and Gold: the Peacock Room.''
Once the dining room of a wealthy shipowner in London, Whistler's
only existing interior design has been reassembled in a permanent
display at the Freer Gallery of Art, also on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   A lattice of intricately carved gold shelving surrounds the
room, and rich green walls are accented by golden depictions of
peacocks. Oval lamps appear to grow from a ceiling of lush
blue-green patterns of peacock feathers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chuck Close. If ``so what?'' is the first thing you say after
glancing at this 80-painting retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden, then ``wow'' will almost certainly be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   At a distance, Close's monumental mug shots of his friends and
family look like unflattering eight-foot photographs. But closer
inspection reveals tiny strokes of acrylic on canvas, meticulously
applied in some cases with an airbrush, in others with the artist's
own fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Close's early photo-realistic style turned more abstract in
1998, when a blood vessel in his spinal column ruptured, leaving
him mostly paralyzed from the neck down. The faces of his later
subjects emerge from a colorful mosaic of circles, rectangles,
triangles and ovals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's working 100 years later (than van Gogh), and you can't
help but notice how his art is very expressionistic,'' Linda
Powell, the museum's director of education, said of Close. ``He
moved from photo-realism to a more expressionistic and vibrant
palette.'' The exhibition continues through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Philippe Halsman: a Retrospective. This show at the National
Portrait Gallery near the Mall trace-- the career of the longtime
Life magazine photographer. Among the approximately 80 vintage
prints from the 1930s through the 1970s are images of Albert
Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, and Salvador Dali that have become modern
icons. The exhibition continues through Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The museums don't end there. From other branches of the
Smithsonian Institution such as the National Museum of American Art
to private museums such as the Corcoran Gallery, interesting
collections abound in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Mary Combs said tourists need to give
themselves plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One technique families use is to split up,'' Combs said. ``The
ones who want to go to the National Gallery can go, and everybody
has a good day.''

   WASHINGTON _ Advance passes for the National Gallery's Vincent
van Gogh exhibit are long gone, but art lovers still have two ways
to get in: patient determination or cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   Every day before sunrise, bleary-eyed people begin forming a
twisting line that can grow to thousands of people, all hoping for
one of the 2,000 free same-day passes the gallery hands out.
</P>
<P>
   Gallery spokeswoman Deborah Ziska said visitors with the best
chance of seeing ``Van Gogh's van Goghs: Masterpieces from the van
Gogh Museum, Amsterdam'' are those who are in line at the gallery's
West Building by 8 a.m. on a weekday and 7 a.m. on a weekend or
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Since passes aren't handed out until 10 a.m. (11 a.m. on
Sundays), even the first person in line will wait two to four hours
for an allotment of up to four tickets. Those who do succeed must
return later that day for their appointed visiting time.
</P>
<P>
   And for many, the vigil is for naught. Some visitors tell of
joining the line well before dawn, only to be turned away
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   If you would rather spend money than time, the daily Washington
Post and Washington Times newspapers carry numerous classified ads
for advance tickets, all of which were distributed weeks before the
exhibition opened.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary, depending on whether you want to see the show
during the week or on the weekend, but expect to pay $60 to $100
each.
</P>
<P>
   As for same-day passes, some of those early birds in the daily
line for free tickets work for scalpers, a fact that has provoked
heated debate here.
</P>
<P>
   These tickets are sometimes sold on the street near the museum _
if you trust them to be genuine. Others may be available from
ticket resellers or from hotel concierges, always for what the
market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, more than 213,000 visitors have seen the
exhibit, averaging about 5,000 per day, Ziska said.
</P>
<P>
   The 72 paintings will remain at the gallery until Jan. 3. The
show will move to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art before
returning to Amsterdam.

AMERICA 1900 
Narrated by: David McCullough 
Produced by: David Grubin 
On: PBS, 8 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we count down the final days of this dreadful, wonderful,
bloody, inspired century of ours, it's natural for us to start
crystal-balling the prospects for the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, we'll come up with more worst-case scenarios than
did our forebears in the year 1900, many of whom looked forward to
the 20th century with unalloyed optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``People felt exhilarated by the possibilities of America,''
narrator David McCullough says in ``America 1900,'' which raises
the curtain in stellar fashion on the 11th season of ``The American
Experience'' series. ``Cynicism and self-pity were not in style ...
On Jan. 1, 1900, most people imagined only good things to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, when cynicism and self-pity are very much in style, that
view could seem hopelessly naive, as out-of-date as the horse and
buggy that was beginning to pass from the scene in 1900. But over
three engrossing and sometimes stirring hours, ``America 1900''
suggests that those alive at the last turn of the century simply
had stronger inner resources.
</P>
<P>
   A resilient faith in a better tomorrow animated the mine workers
who went on strike in 1900 to protest meager wages and hideous
working conditions, the residents of Galveston who doggedly rebuilt
their hurricane-shattered city, the African-Americans who used the
words of W.E.B. DuBois to map a road from vile and
institutionalized racism to social justice, the women who began
forging careers outside the home at a time when they were still
denied the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But then blue-skies optimism was contagious in 1900. Even amid
the hardship and misery that governed so many lives, the future
beckoned. The concept of leisure time, of vacations, began to reach
the middle and working class, and new inventions began to transform
daily life: motion pictures, telephones, phonographs, electric
light, X-rays, indoor plumbing, the automobile.
</P>
<P>
   However, America also had begun succumbing to colonial
temptations little more than a century after winning its own
freedom from colonial rule. Having won control of the Philippines
in the Spanish-American War, the United States moved quickly to put
down an uprising there, as President William McKinley sent 60,000
US troops there.
</P>
<P>
   By exploring that early contradiction between the nation's
ideals and its actions, ``America 1900'' foreshadows some of the
issues US citizens would grapple with in what came to be known as
The American Century.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by David Grubin and skillfully written by Judy Crichton
and Grubin, ``America 1900'' brings the year to life through
marvelous archival images, period music, and portraits of numerous
celebrated and unknown figures, ranging from McKinley and his
firebrand running mate, Theodore Roosevelt, to pioneering
photojournalist Frances Benjamin Johnston and United Mine Workers
organizer John Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Such are the storytelling skills of Crichton and Grubin that
they manage to evoke strong curiosity, and even cliffhanger
tension, about the fates of people long dead.
</P>
<P>
   Will American missionary Eva Price and her family escape the
marauding Boxers of China, whose rallying cry was ``Exterminate the
foreigners''? Will actress Olga Nethersole, star of the scandalous
play ``Sappho,'' be convicted on charges of violating public
decency? Will the mine workers be able to stave off starvation long
enough for their strike to succeed? ``America 1900'' prompts us to
ask these questions, and care about the answers.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary does not belabor the parallels between that turn
of the century and the one just around the corner, preferring to
let us draw the connection ourselves between, say, the state of
race relations then and now, or the dizzying pace of invention in
1900 and our own Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   Like the year 2000, 1900 was an election year. But McKinley
largely let Roosevelt hit the hustings for him because, McCullough
informs us, it was considered ``beneath the dignity of the
president to campaign.'' At times like that, 1900 seems an eon,
rather than a mere century, away.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Advance passes for the National Gallery's Vincent
van Gogh exhibit are long gone, but art lovers still have two ways
to get in: patient determination or cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   Every day before sunrise, bleary-eyed people begin forming a
twisting line that can grow to thousands of people, all hoping for
one of the 2,000 free same-day passes the gallery hands out.
</P>
<P>
   Gallery spokeswoman Deborah Ziska said visitors with the best
chance of seeing ``Van Gogh's van Goghs: Masterpieces from the van
Gogh Museum, Amsterdam'' are those who are in line at the gallery's
West Building by 8 a.m. on a weekday and 7 a.m. on a weekend or
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Since passes aren't handed out until 10 a.m. (11 a.m. on
Sundays), even the first person in line will wait two to four hours
for an allotment of up to four tickets. Those who do succeed must
return later that day for their appointed visiting time.
</P>
<P>
   And for many, the vigil is for naught. Some visitors tell of
joining the line well before dawn, only to be turned away
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   If you would rather spend money than time, the daily Washington
Post and Washington Times newspapers carry numerous classified ads
for advance tickets, all of which were distributed weeks before the
exhibition opened.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary, depending on whether you want to see the show
during the week or on the weekend, but expect to pay $60 to $100
each.
</P>
<P>
   As for same-day passes, some of those early birds in the daily
line for free tickets work for scalpers, a fact that has provoked
heated debate here.
</P>
<P>
   These tickets are sometimes sold on the street near the museum _
if you trust them to be genuine. Others may be available from
ticket resellers or from hotel concierges, always for what the
market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, more than 213,000 visitors have seen the
exhibit, averaging about 5,000 per day, Ziska said.
</P>
<P>
   The 72 paintings will remain at the gallery until Jan. 3. The
show will move to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art before
returning to Amsterdam.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the art world's fervor over the traveling
Vincent van Gogh exhibition, it's easy to forget that the capital
has a wealth of other treasures to offer, including temporary
exhibitions rivaling the van Gogh show in quality.
</P>
<P>
   Hours spent in the iffy pursuit of van Gogh passes might better
be devoted to enjoying the National Gallery of Art's immense
permanent collection. Housed in two separate buildings on the
National Mall, it includes other van Gogh paintings among thousands
of works that span the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, one rare find is Leonardo da Vinci's ``Ginevra de'
Benci,'' the only painting by the famed Florentine artist in the
Western Hemisphere and one of only three portraits of women
(including Mona Lisa) painted by da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   Another gem, commanding its own room at the gallery, is Augustus
Saint-Gaudens' memorial to Gen. Robert Gould Shaw and the
Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the African-American unit that
inspired the Civil War movie ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   If your goal in Washington is not just van Gogh bragging rights,
but a memorable aesthetic experience, here are some other good
bets:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gifts to the Nation from Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney. Van
Gogh's 1989 ``Self-Portrait'' is a highlight of this donation from
one of the finest American private collections of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   While this exhibition is small _ only 16 paintings _ it is
replete with significant works by artists including Henri Matisse,
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, George
Bellows, Thomas Eakins, Edward Hopper, Henri Rousseau and James
McNeill Whistler. It is on view through Jan. 3 at the National
Gallery's East Building.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige. This exhibit at the
Phillips Collection in Northwest Washington brings together 62
Impressionist winter landscape paintings.
</P>
<P>
   On view through Jan. 3, it focuses on the ``snow effect'' works
of Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley and others.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Phillips Collection is a privately owned museum,
there is an admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whistler's ``Harmony in Blue and Gold: the Peacock Room.''
Once the dining room of a wealthy shipowner in London, Whistler's
only existing interior design has been reassembled in a permanent
display at the Freer Gallery of Art, also on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   A lattice of intricately carved gold shelving surrounds the
room, and rich green walls are accented by golden depictions of
peacocks. Oval lamps appear to grow from a ceiling of lush
blue-green patterns of peacock feathers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chuck Close. If ``so what?'' is the first thing you say after
glancing at this 80-painting retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden, then ``wow'' will almost certainly be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   At a distance, Close's monumental mug shots of his friends and
family look like unflattering eight-foot photographs. But closer
inspection reveals tiny strokes of acrylic on canvas, meticulously
applied in some cases with an airbrush, in others with the artist's
own fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Close's early photo-realistic style turned more abstract in
1998, when a blood vessel in his spinal column ruptured, leaving
him mostly paralyzed from the neck down. The faces of his later
subjects emerge from a colorful mosaic of circles, rectangles,
triangles and ovals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's working 100 years later (than van Gogh), and you can't
help but notice how his art is very expressionistic,'' Linda
Powell, the museum's director of education, said of Close. ``He
moved from photo-realism to a more expressionistic and vibrant
palette.'' The exhibition continues through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Philippe Halsman: a Retrospective. This show at the National
Portrait Gallery near the Mall trace-- the career of the longtime
Life magazine photographer. Among the approximately 80 vintage
prints from the 1930s through the 1970s are images of Albert
Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, and Salvador Dali that have become modern
icons. The exhibition continues through Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The museums don't end there. From other branches of the
Smithsonian Institution such as the National Museum of American Art
to private museums such as the Corcoran Gallery, interesting
collections abound in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Mary Combs said tourists need to give
themselves plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One technique families use is to split up,'' Combs said. ``The
ones who want to go to the National Gallery can go, and everybody
has a good day.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 WEST SANDGATE, Vt.: ... the potatoes.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing organic about the process, no tossing in a
little something just to see what happens. The results are
delicious: a homespun array of strong tastes that don't overpower
one another, honest ingredients cooked beautifully and nicely
seasoned, a meal you might eat at the table of an off-duty chef.
The tender shanks are served in their own juices, garnished with
capers, anchovies, sage, chopped carrots (each minuscule dice looks
even), tomatoes, and lemon rind. Buttermilk biscuits are as light
as promised. Sweet potatoes spiked with sherry are rich but not too
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   And Kimball turns out to be right about the turnips and
potatoes. You might not guess the dish contains turnips, but you
know at once that it's earthier and deeper-tasting than ordinary
mashed potatoes. Their onion garnish is also made with anchovies,
though you can't taste it. ``I use a lot of anchovies,'' he says,
``just for their flavor and salt.''
</P>
<P>
   At the table, he doesn't taste food the way some cooks do _
curious about how things worked out this time. He picks up his fork
and knife with confidence. Kimball has followed his own recipes,
and he knows they work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Art history to food art
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Kimball was raised in a household where his mother
pushed a button under the dining room table and someone came to
clear the dishes. His grandmother was even more formal. From the
time he was quite young, he was required to wear a jacket and tie
to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   He came to publishing armed with degrees from Phillips Exeter
Academy ('69) and Columbia University ('73), where he studied art
history and was a long-haired member of Students for a Democratic
Society. ``Some people say that was my worst moment,'' he notes.
``Some say it was my finest.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, he thought about a doctorate in oceanic art, but he
changed course because there were no jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He started Cook's Magazine in 1980, publishing it in
Connecticut, where he lived at the time. He wanted a publication
that didn't look or sound like the others on the market, he says,
but ``the food wasn't as good as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   He sold Cook's Magazine twice (both times, as it turned out, to
S.I. Newhouse Jr.). The first sale in 1983 gave the controlling
interest to The New Yorker, which Newhouse later bought. Then
Newhouse sold that interest to the Swedish company Bonnier in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Kimball sold his remaining equity to Bonnier and left
the magazine. A year later, Newhouse bought the company from
Bonnier and killed Cook's Magazine. Subscribers were given Gourmet.
``Newhouse was never interested in small magazines, just bolstering
Gourmet.'' Kimball says Newhouse also bought Cuisine magazine and
ceased its publication, too.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Kimballs moved to Boston and bought an old house in
the South End to fix up. Kimball came to run East West Journal,
which badly needed sprucing up. He was hired by Eliot Wadsworth,
publisher of Horticulture magazine. Eventually, Kimball turned East
West around under its new name, Natural Health. He and Wadsworth
and the other investors formed a partnership they named Boston
Common Press. Earlier this year, Natural Health was sold for a
reported $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball never gave up on Cook's. He relaunched it through dogged
perseverance. One day, he did some research and discovered that the
old name was available. ``Bonnier had let the trademark expire,''
he says. ``It cost $175. I sent a check by Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``That was a really good moment,'' he adds, showing some
elation.
</P>
<P>
   He renamed it Cook's Illustrated because there are few finished
photographs _ and no ads or fanfare. Cook's has a devoted fan club
of subscribers interested in the hows and whys of cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Though many wonder how he survives without advertisers, others
estimate Cook's Illustrated value at the same $30 million that
Natural Health was sold for.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as publisher of Boston Common Press, he still owns
Handcraft Illustrated and has a few other projects in mind. One is
television. ``People would watch us as we develop the best way to
do recipes. It would be bringing the magazine to life in a
television format.'' This science-of-the-stovetop show will begin
filming next spring, in studios built in the Brookline offices.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The real yellow farmhouse
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the few recipes Kimball makes without thinking is
buttermilk biscuits, which he used to eat at the home of Marie
Briggs. She lived in the yellow farmhouse immortalized in the title
of his book. The boy who had to wear a tie for dinner at home was
in his element in the yellow farmhouse, and he writes longingly and
in detail about her midday dinners and the old house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps I remember most fondly the smell of that parlor,'' he
writes, ``the ripe scent of yeast, molasses, fresh bread, green
wood, maple syrup, wood smoke, and pickled meats, a heady perfume
that seeped into the wallpaper and floorboards and that remains
today.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kimball pulls out a bowl to make Marie's biscuits, his
children appear. Caroline glances around and decides on something
more interesting. Charlie, dressed in a cowboy outfit, announces
that he'll put his hands into the biscuit dough. Whitney,
suspecting her father might need help, keeps an eye on her younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie pushes a chair up to the counter where a large bowl
holds flour and fat. He holds his hands vertically over the bowl,
ready to plunge them in. Christopher Kimball quickly mixes in the
buttermilk and removes the dough. He begins to roll it out, but
Charlie is champing at the bit to roll, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do it nice and light _ not hard,'' says the father. Charlie
follows his instructions. Kimball stamps out biscuits, then Charlie
mimics him.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball moves away to drain turnips and potatoes. Whitney
collects the scraps and rerolls the dough. Charlie watches her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very gently,'' he says. ``Very gently.'' Proud of the moment,
he picks up a handful of scraps and pops them into his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kimball catches the farmhouse bug.

   WASHINGTON _ Advance passes for the National Gallery's Vincent
van Gogh exhibit are long gone, but art lovers still have two ways
to get in: patient determination or cold, hard cash.
</P>
<P>
   Every day before sunrise, bleary-eyed people begin forming a
twisting line that can grow to thousands of people, all hoping for
one of the 2,000 free same-day passes the gallery hands out.
</P>
<P>
   Gallery spokeswoman Deborah Ziska said visitors with the best
chance of seeing ``Van Gogh's van Goghs: Masterpieces from the van
Gogh Museum, Amsterdam'' are those who are in line at the gallery's
West Building by 8 a.m. on a weekday and 7 a.m. on a weekend or
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Since passes aren't handed out until 10 a.m. (11 a.m. on
Sundays), even the first person in line will wait two to four hours
for an allotment of up to four tickets. Those who do succeed must
return later that day for their appointed visiting time.
</P>
<P>
   And for many, the vigil is for naught. Some visitors tell of
joining the line well before dawn, only to be turned away
empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   If you would rather spend money than time, the daily Washington
Post and Washington Times newspapers carry numerous classified ads
for advance tickets, all of which were distributed weeks before the
exhibition opened.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary, depending on whether you want to see the show
during the week or on the weekend, but expect to pay $60 to $100
each.
</P>
<P>
   As for same-day passes, some of those early birds in the daily
line for free tickets work for scalpers, a fact that has provoked
heated debate here.
</P>
<P>
   These tickets are sometimes sold on the street near the museum _
if you trust them to be genuine. Others may be available from
ticket resellers or from hotel concierges, always for what the
market will bear.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, more than 213,000 visitors have seen the
exhibit, averaging about 5,000 per day, Ziska said.
</P>
<P>
   The 72 paintings will remain at the gallery until Jan. 3. The
show will move to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art before
returning to Amsterdam.

20 YEARS LATER AND JONESTOWN REMAINS A VIVID IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jim Jones has come home to roost at City Hall.
He stares from behind dark glasses from posters on the first floor,
and from photographs arrayed near the Board of Supervisors' meeting
room on the fourth floor.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, it's almost unbearable to look at these
photographs of Jones and Jonestown, taken by Greg Robinson, a
photographer for the San Francisco Examiner, on the last day of
Robinson's young and promising life. The exhibition is called
``Days of Darkness,'' and it's a darkness many still can't fathom.
</P>
<P>
   The painful part isn't seeing the bodies. It's seeing Robinson's
pictures of vibrant young children and older members of the Peoples
Temple. It's knowing that 900 of them will die in a few hours,
along with Rep. Leo Ryan and others in his delegation to Jones'
dystopia in Guyana. That includes the man who took these great
photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction is it's incredible to see that all these
people died on the same day,'' Claes Ostlund said. ``You can't
believe that one guy can be that powerful, that he can get so many
people to kill themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostlund and his wife, Karin, love San Francisco and come here
every other year from Stockholm. Like all of us, they tried to make
sense of how the evil of Jim Jones could grow in the heart of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just brings it all back,'' said Lynne Tondorf, a city
employee. ``Twenty years later, and it all comes back. .... It's
something we shouldn't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Some City Hall workers can't bear to look at the photographs.
They knew Jones. They knew people Jones murdered. They knew how
Jones had insinuated himself into the heart of the political
establishment of San Francisco, and how politicians bought his act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why people here wouldn't like it, having to
look at that every day,'' said Patty Moran, pointing at Robinson's
famous portrait of Jones, with glazed eyes behind shades.
</P>
<P>
   Moran was a Democratic Party activist when Jones was seducing
the liberal establishment. She worked for both Mayor George Moscone
and city Supervisor Harvey Milk, who would be murdered in City Hall
by disgruntled former Supervisor Dan White a week after the
Jonestown horror.
</P>
<P>
   Moran remembered how Peoples Temple members joined her political
club. ``They infiltrated all the clubs. They'd send members in blue
suits and dark glasses, and turn out hundreds of members for
rallies.''
</P>
<P>
   Moran kept looking at the photographs, sighing and saying,
``Yep'' and ``Oh, Golly.''
</P>
<P>
   Some workers in city offices say they always were suspicious of
the man in the leisure suit and dark glasses and his believers who
would turn out for political events. But these are mostly people
who weren't in elective office.
</P>
<P>
   I talked to several people like this, and none wanted to be
quoted. Twenty years later, Jim Jones is still a sensitive subject.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, the mayor's press secretary, said one colleague
at first said, ``I'm not ready for this,'' but later came back and
said it was good to have to face the reality of Jim Jones and
Jonestown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of exhibits here, but very few with this
power,'' Bender said. ``For the first 48 hours I saw so many people
who were actually touching the photographs.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd only been here a year when November 1978 struck San
Francisco, and I'm still trying to understand what happened. Is
there some darkness at the heart of this beautiful city, or is it
just that San Francisco welcomes anyone charismatic who preaches
social justice?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Jones' followers. How could perceptive civic leaders
be seduced by Jones?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jones wasn't just a cult leader. He made San Francisco know
shame all too well.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Willie Brown said he had not seen the Jonestown photo
exhibition, but intends to. I asked him how Jones could line up so
many important people in San Francisco on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fooled me. He fooled George Moscone,'' Brown said. ``George
even appointed him to the Housing Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Can another Jim Jones come along and work his way into the
political establishment?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't stop them,'' Brown said. ``Nuts can succeed if they
work at it. All you can do is go on with your work.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who has had bad press in the past because of his links to
Jones, said he would like to see a memorial wall with the names of
the Jonestown victims in Oakland's Evergreen Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The other memorial to the dead of Jonestown is the Greg Robinson
Scholarship Fund at San Francisco State University, established by
the San Francisco Examiner to aid aspiring photojournalists.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's famous image of Jim Jones demonstrates the power of
photojournalism.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, and we can still see the evil.

LOOK WHO'S COMING TO MAKE YOU DINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISON BASS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ It's not that Pat Kauffman-Lang doesn't like to cook.
As a marketing representative for Bread &AMP; Circus, the supermarket
for health-conscious baby boomers, she not only loves to cook but
she's good at it, especially when it comes to preparing healthy,
low-fat meals.
</P>
<P>
   What Kauffman-Lang lacks is time. She and her husband, a
commercial real estate consultant, work such long hours that they
find themselves too tired at the end of the day to prepare dinner.
So Kauffman-Lang recently turned to a personal chef to make those
healthy meals for them, and feels only a little guilty about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still struggle over it,'' says Kauffman-Lang. ``It feels a
little indulgent having someone come in and cook for me, but it's
necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Endlar Lee, on the other hand, has experienced no such
twinges since she hired a personal chef last February. Lee, 36, is
the mother of a 3-year-old daughter and a 5-month-old son and works
full time as an institutional bond broker for a large Boston firm.
Her husband is a pediatrician who, Lee says, ``can't even boil
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee says that if she had known before this year that a personal
chef like Susan Goldstein existed, she would have hired her long
ago. ``I had to ask around quite a while before I found'' Susan,
she says. ``Now I can't imagine not having her cook for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal chefs may be the best-kept secret in the home service
industry these days. The field is considered _ by those in the
know, such as Entrepreneur Magazine _ one of the ``hottest
home-based businesses in 1998,'' with the number of personal chefs
doubling every year (There are more than 2,000 personal chefs in
business nationwide.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, most people don't even know what a personal chef does.
Nor do they realize that such chefs are no longer the exclusive
province of rock stars or Hollywood celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Personal chefs may not have arrived in middle America, says
David MacKay, the executive director of the US Personal Chefs
Association, but they are penetrating major metropolitan areas such
as Boston and many of its more well-heeled suburbs. And they can be
found cooking away in such diverse locations as an elderly widow's
spacious art-filled home in Belmont, a dual-earner couple's
comfortable split-level in Newton, and a tiny apartment turned
condominium on the west side of South Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, who has worked as a personal chef for a dozen years,
says: ``Five or 10 years ago, my clients considered me a luxury,
not a necessity. But now my clients think of me more as a necessity
than a luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Endlar Lee certainly does. Once a month, usually on a
Wednesday, Goldstein walks into Lee's neo-colonial house in Weston
at 7:30 a.m. with five or six bags of groceries that she bought the
night before. Goldstein, whose business is called Personally
Prepared by Susan, has already discussed the day's menu with Lee by
phone. And by the time Goldstein arrives, Lee and her husband have
departed for work.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein is usually greeted by the nanny, who watches the
couple's children. She ties on a white freshly laundered &UR;  &LR; apron,
takes some pots and pans out of the Lees' cabinets, and gets down
to work.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 p.m., she has prepared anywhere from 10 to 14 meals for
the family: chicken cacciatore, stir fry with chicken and shrimp,
baked stuffed potatoes with vegetables, marinated veal chops for
the grill. She puts them in plastic or glass containers, labels the
meals, and stores them in the Lees' ample refrigerator. Some of
these meals can also go into the freezer, and Goldstein leaves
specific instructions on how to heat up or thaw meals.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein then cleans up her ``mess'' and walks out the door
around 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan is great,'' says Lee during a brief break from her
hectic bonds job.  &UR;  &LR; ``She will cook anything you want and use any
recipe you want. And it's not outrageous in terms of price. I spend
between $300 and $325, including the cost of the groceries, and
that's for 10 to 14 meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Lee discovered Personally Prepared by Susan, she used to
boil pasta or stick chicken in the broiler when she came home from
work every evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``As my daughter got older and wanted my attention when I came
home, it became increasingly difficult to turn my back on her and
cook something on the stove,'' Lee recalls. ``And now with two
children, it's even more difficult. If there's nothing prepared, my
husband will eat peanut better and jelly sandwiches, but I get sick
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra Ruder, the mother of two preschoolers, also works full
time, in the communications department at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute. She, too, was sick of eating the same old spaghetti and
meat sauce every night. Seven months ago, her in-laws offered to
pay for a personal chef for the family, and Ruder is still gushing
over the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best gifts we could have received,'' says
Ruder, who doesn't walk in her front door until after 6 p.m.,
having picked up her two sons from day care. ``It has really made a
difference in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, coming home to find freshly prepared baked
chicken with peaches or vegetable stuffed peppers, cooked
Russian-Jewish style and neatly stored in plastic containers in her
refrigerator, allows Ruder and her husband to sit down and eat with
their children. In the days before they had a personal chef, the
couple often didn't get around to cooking for themselves until
after their sons went to bed, around 9 p.m. It was just too
difficult to try to cook their own meals while fixing the boys'
requisite macaroni and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a big mac-and-cheese fan,'' Ruder admits. ``And this
feels so much better to me than doing a lot of takeout. There are a
lot of hidden salts and fats and other things in takeout food, and
this gives us control over what we're eating.''
</P>
<P>
   For many people who use personal chefs, that is one of the
biggest selling points of the service. Chefs like Goldstein, who
will travel up to 60 miles, or Laurie Goguen, who is based in
Watertown, customize their cooking to their clients' tastes and
dietary needs.
</P>
<P>
   Goguen, for instance, asks her clients to fill out a lengthy
food preference survey before she begins cooking for them.
Goldstein asks the same questions in person. And both chefs shop
where their clients want them to shop.
</P>
<P>
   Both Goldstein (who charges $35 an hour plus the cost of
groceries) and Goguen (who charges $25 an hour plus groceries) are
experienced chefs. Goldstein, 39, graduated from the prestigious
Culinary Institute of America in New York and worked as a
commercial chef for several years before going into business for
herself. Goguen, 26, taught nutrition cooking classes for a
health-food company before striking out on her own this year.
</P>
<P>
   But, as they and others caution, there are entrepreneurs who don
the personal chef's hat with very little experience or skill. And
getting a referral from the US Personal Chefs Association, a
for-profit operation based in Albuquerque, simply means the chef
has paid $595 to $1,800 for a mail-order training package, and $50
more to sign on as a member of the association.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kauffman-Lang has never heard of the chefs' association. She
hired her first personal chef by word of mouth, through the friend
of a friend. But she says the woman wasn't very clean and didn't
have a large repertoire of dishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't trust her alone in my kitchen,'' Kauffman-Lang says.
``With Laurie (Goguen), I leave the door open and give her free
rein in the kitchen. I totally trust her and her judgment.''

JOHNSON WARY OF ROAD AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jimmy Johnson is not impressed or comfortable with the fact that
his team is leading the AFC East by one game with six left in the
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go look at our schedule,'' said Johnson Tuesday afternoon
before going into a coaches meeting to prepare his Miami Dolphins
for Monday night's game in Foxborough. ``We've got a schedule the
rest of the way that's as tough as anyone's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the road in New England, in Oakland, and finish in
Atlanta. At home we've got New Orleans, the Jets, and Denver. Not
one of those teams has a losing record.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, whose team beat New England, 12-9, in overtime four
weeks ago in Miami, is aware that the Patriots are banged up but
has no sympathy for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team has injuries at this time of year,'' he said. ``I'm
not even thinking about their situation. All I know is that we
don't play well up there. I've never won a game there. And we don't
play as well on the road as we do at home. So we know how big this
game is on Monday night and we know it is going to be difficult for
us to win up there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even thought they haven't been winning, from what I've seen,
their defense has still been playing pretty good. They gave up some
yards to (Doug) Flutie's scrambling in the last game, but our
quarterback (Dan Marino) doesn't scramble,'' laughed Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Sharpe will have the last laugh. Wayne Simmons got cut
Tuesday by Kansas City, and teammate Derrick Thomas has been
suspended one game, after both of them acted like thugs at the end
of the Chiefs' 30-7 loss to the Denver Broncos Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs had five personal fouls in the closing minutes of the
game, 13 penalties in all. Thomas had three personal fouls, and
Simmons triggered some mayhem at the end of the contest with a
personal foul.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer said he was embarrassed by his
team's actions.
</P>
<P>
   According to someone close to the Chiefs, the Kansas City
defensive players were looking to punish Sharpe, the
sometimes-mouthy tight end, for remarks he reportedly made about
them. It is not clear whether the alleged remarks were made to the
media or in private. However, word was around before the game that
they would go after Sharpe if they had a chance. When the game was
out of reach, that's exactly what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, referee Dick Hantak did not take the opportunity
to eject both Simmons and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs can dump Simmons because he does not hurt them much
under the salary cap. But even if they wanted to get rid of Thomas,
they couldn't, because he has a huge contract, and all of it would
roll forward into next year's salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is the biggest disappointment in the league to date.
After posting the best record in the AFC the previous two years,
the team has fallen apart. In recent years, the Chiefs took in a
lot of players who had bad reputations around the league, and that
appears to be haunting them.
</P>
<P>
   This past offseason, their big free agent acquisition was former
Raider defensive tackle Chester McGlockton. McGlockton was injured
in training camp, underwent back surgery, and returned to the
starting lineup four games ago. The Chiefs have lost all four of
those games. Last year, the Raiders finished 30th _ last _ in
defense, with McGlockton supposedly their best defensive player.
Without him this season, they have been leading the league.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why isn't the league going after the Patriots for not telling
the truth on their Oct. 22 injury report?
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 21, Terry Glenn reportedly was injured in practice. The
league rules stipulate that such an injury must be reported to the
league and the opponent (Miami) by 1 p.m. the next day. Yet when
the Patriots filed their report the next day at 1, there was no
mention of Glenn. It wasn't until three hours later that the
Patriots made the notifications.
</P>
<P>
   When the Patriots reported the injury, they listed Glenn as
``questionable,'' which means the player has a 50/50 chance of
playing. There have been four games since then, and Glenn hasn't
even dressed for one of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll keeps talking about how the Patriots' offense has
to be better, and he is correct, but the defense hasn't been any
bargain, either. After Sunday's 13-10 loss in Buffalo, they still
have given up more first downs via the pass than any team in the
league, and they are 26th in time of possession, because they can't
get the other guys off the field. What the Patriots have done well
on defense is hold opponents to field goals rather than touchdowns,
even though they have been giving up a lot of yards.

   DEMS-GOP (Washington) -- With the 2000 election approaching, the

HANCOCK UNIT FACES CHANGES IN TIMBER MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston has made a buck off a lot of things over time, from cod
to computers. Add trees to the list.
</P>
<P>
   The city has evolved as the capital of a relatively young and
growing form of investing over the last decade, buying and managing
millions of acres of timberland for institutions across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But changes appear to be taking place rapidly. Forest products
companies have more motivation than ever to sell; publicly traded
real estate investment trusts specializing in timber are around the
corner; and management head-hunting that goes with an emerging
business is rearranging executive rosters.
</P>
<P>
   No company sits in the middle of these developments like the
king of the institutional forest, Hancock Timber Resource Group.
</P>
<P>
   The group, a unit of John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.,
manages about half of all of the $5 billion to $6 billion
institutions have invested in timberland. Three other companies,
including Boston-based Prudential Timber Investments, compete in a
distant second tier of competition.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock was a pioneer in the business in the early 1980s, taking
expertise developed lending to forest products companies and
building it into actual portfolios of property managed for pension
funds and other institutional clients.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock expanded the business with a diversification pitch and
handsome returns. Hancock's timber clients have earned an average
of 16 percent a year over the last five years, in a real estate
category that matches the long-term horizons of its pension
investors.
</P>
<P>
   But Hancock has suffered a big round of management turnover,
losing at least seven executives in the last year. An important
long-term client, the $44 billion State Teachers' Retirement System
of Ohio, decided this month to move its $335 million timber account
and split it between two other firms.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's biggest client of all, the California Public
Employees' Retirement System, has opened its giant $1.2 billion
timber account to new management proposals for the first time in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals from more than a dozen competitors were due in
September, and a spokesman said the pension plan would probably
interview candidates on its short list early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question we're focused on the Calpers account,''
said William Coleman, chief executive of Hancock Timber Resource
Group. ``They have asked for proposals for all their real estate
accounts, and now it's Hancock's turn. We've told what we think is
a very good story in response to that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is upbeat news, too. Hancock Tuesday landed a big deal in
Australia, agreeing to pay $352 million for timber rights on
411,000 government-owned acres. A small group of US and Australian
clients put up the money. For Hancock, the deal effectively
replaces the Ohio pension business it just lost and brings the
firm's total assets under management to $3.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been looking at the southern hemisphere as a way of
globally diversifying our clients' portfolio,'' said Coleman.
``This deal is really a huge victory for us because we've become
the largest private owner of timber in Australia in a single
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock has lost a string of longtime timber executives to new
ventures within the last year, including its former leader, Rick
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith left Hancock last year and launched a start-up, Forest
Systems, with the idea of growing an investment company that
actually owned timberland instead of just managing it for clients.
Investors would buy into Forest Systems itself, with hopes that it
would become a publicly traded company before long.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's first piece of business just came in the door. Forest
Systems was the company that won the lion's share of Hancock's Ohio
teachers account. But for now it will only manage $210 million of
the pension fund's property.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hancock alum, Scott Jones, is the chief executive of
Timberland Growth Co., a timber real estate investment trust
waiting to go public. Timberland Growth operates 824,000 acres that
was owned by two forest product companies. Three other former
Hancock Timber executives joined Jones in the new venture earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hancock had the most envied track record in the business, and
individuals with that experience became sought-after for
opportunities as (timber investing) continued to grow,'' said
Jones, who had served as Hancock Timber's director of acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said Hancock moved quickly to fill management holes
created by the turnover. He said new Hancock executives tend to
have more global investment and capital markets experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's perfectly natural for the industry to look to us
for talent,'' said Coleman, who joined Hancock in March. ``In a
funny kind of way, we take that as a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   All the timberland management firms are facing two important new
developments as they compete. The advance of timber real estate
investment trusts, which offer liquidity through shares that can be
easily bought or sold, may catch on. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   Timberland Growth and a handful of other companies are going to
find out. Hancock's Coleman agreed there would be ``significant''
securitization of timberland in the future and said his firm was
looking into the possibility of forming a REIT.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, forest products companies that produce things like
paper, hardwood for furniture, pulp, and construction timber are
thinking harder about the possibility of getting cash or stock in
return for their illiquid real estate holdings. Monetizing their
timberland holdings can make financial sense for companies
competing around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Timberland investments could baloon if real estate investment
trusts attract lots of fresh cash and forest product companies
decide its smart economics to sell their property.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, lots of new competitors like Forest Systems and
Timberland Growth make for a crowded field of investment managers.

THE HMO BUCK STOPS HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They promised us the moon.
</P>
<P>
   And we wanted to believe we could get it for little or no cost _
that, plus fabulous medical care, delivered by ever-cheerful
doctors and nurses, eager to diagnose and treat every gripe and
groan.
</P>
<P>
   The managed health care industry lured us with an eternity of
sunsets and beaches where everyone ages happily and gracefully,
with access along the way to all the treatments any body would
possibly need.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad fiscal reality is quite different from gauzy, feel-good
commercials. Now, the check is on the table and no one wants to
pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   Take Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, long considered the jewel of
Massachusetts HMOs, which consistently rank among the highest of
quality in the United States. It is the villain of the moment,
having declined to join in a one-year reprieve that would allow
seniors enrolled in Medicare HMOs to continue to chose a plan with
unlimited drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no one villain in this drama. And there are no real
heroes either.
</P>
<P>
   To make a complicated story simple, this is all about passing
the buck.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government does require that seniors are cared for,
and it developed the Medicare program to do that. However, the
federal government does not require Medicare to safeguard seniors
by covering drug prescription costs. Medical costs continue to
increase and reimbursement, including Medicare, is not keeping
pace.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has been the only state in the nation requiring
the HMOS to offer unlimited drug benefits for those enrolled in
Medicare health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The HMOs challenged the requirement and won. So, on Jan. 1, the
220,000 seniors and disabled people enrolled in all of the state's
Medicare HMO's will likely face limited drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   As the deadline approaches and the politicians scurry to buy
time, the HMOs are engaging in a flurry of gamesmanship. Each one
is trying to make the other look like the bad guy, pledging an
assortment of caps, reprieves, and foundations that are all but
impossible to sort out and understand.
</P>
<P>
   After a public outcry, Tufts Health Plan, Blue Cross and Blue
Shield of Massachusetts, and Fallon Community Health Plan said they
would extend unlimited benefits for a year while policy makers
worked out a long-term solution _ but only if Harvard Pilgrim also
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in their cold, corporate heart-of-hearts, each competitor
probably knew Harvard Pilgrim would never sign on. So their
accommodating proposals were at least partly for show.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Harvard Pilgrim says it simply cannot afford to pay the
drug costs. The HMO, which employs more than 4,500 people, says it
lost $22.2 million in the first three quarters of 1998. It blamed
the losses on larger than expected medical expenses, which
outstripped its premium revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipated we would be able to control our medical
expenses, more than was the case,'' says Harvard Pilgrim spokesman
Alan Raymond.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the losses, Harvard Pilgrim will increase premiums in
1999 and reduce administrative expenses. This week, it announced it
would eliminate 100 jobs, in a way using its own employees as pawns
in this high-stakes public relations game.
</P>
<P>
   But what about us?
</P>
<P>
   We bought into the HMO commercials because we wanted to believe
what we know cannot possibly be true.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot stay young and healthy forever. We will all grow old,
some more gracefully than others. Medical care costs money and
prescription drugs _ the single largest health-care and unregulated
expense for the elderly _ cost more.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials showing the bliss of healthy seniors jogging
into the twilight will be the ultimate ruse on the baby boomer
generation, if government and business don't join forces to staunch
the bleeding. A bandaid is not enough.
</P>

 NEW YORK: ... any more.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of which raises the question: Why would Sillerman pay $1
billion for all these businesses?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Sillerman said that the answer, in a
nutshell, is national advertising. Having created the first
nationwide network of amphitheaters with his purchases, he is
convinced he can attract national advertisers who have avoided
concerts and most other live events until now because of the
fractured nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he said, credit card companies, apparel makers,
telecommunications firms, and soft-drink bottlers will want to buy
spots at events in every corner of the country or the right to slap
their names on tours and the facilities at which they play. And the
money they pay will be gravy for SFX.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside here is just tremendous,'' Sillerman said.
``There's so much inherent growth that's available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But some entertainment industry veterans suspect
Sillerman's true aim is something quite different, something that
doesn't require him to tightly manage the companies he has acquired
or even do much to attract advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, he's going to flip it'' _ sell SFX to a record
company and media conglomerate like MCA, Polygram, or Time-Warner,
said former Ticketmaster chief executive Frederic D. Rosen, a
longtime industry player. ``Bob's a bright guy, who in his prior
career helped consolidate the radio industry. But his history is
one of consolidating and selling, not consolidating and
operating.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman learned the art of buying and selling from his father,
who assembled the Keystone Radio Network when his son was a child.
At Brandeis, the younger Sillerman started a company that sold
fellow students almost anything he could lay his hands on.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was a heady place in the late 1960s, even for those who
did not let drugs and revolutionary rhetoric cloud their interest
in business. ``We were all part of the alternative culture,''
recalled veteran DJ Charles Laquidara. ``It was OK for the Boston
Tea Party or the Phoenix (or a young Brandeis student's company) to
make money because it was going to be part of a new capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Sillerman's case, there was always a twist to the
money-making. His company started serving not as an alternative
kind of business but as a consultant on ``youth culture'' for
corporate advertisers. He began trawling for his first deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although he bought and sold radio stations during the late 1970s
and throughout the 1980s, his ship did not really come in until the
beginning of this decade, and then in a way that left many people
outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Correctly anticipating that the federal government would loosen
restrictions on radio station ownership, he started three publicly
traded companies that bought more than 70 small and mid-sized
stations. He kept large blocks of stock in each firm for himself
and then _ for huge fees _ served as the firms' investment banker,
financial adviser, corporate strategist, and even landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was a deal shop,'' said Gary Stevens, one of the
nation's largest independent radio brokers, who was stung in an
early transaction with Sillerman, but later made millions selling
him stations. ``His real business was not operating (stations); it
was generating deals to take the fees.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was buying, Sillerman brushed aside complaints of
self-dealing by saying the arrangements had been properly disclosed
in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Since selling his
radio properties at a tremendous profit, he has declared himself
vindicated and even former critics agree.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everybody in the entertainment industry thinks
Sillerman is out to duplicate his radio success in live
entertainment. Everybody, that is, except Sillerman himself, who
asserted that he is running the company ``as if my now 5-year-old
daughter is going to be operating this business.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Sillerman said he will soon announce a series
of new advertising deals, food concession arrangements, and
ticketing contracts that will show how SFX intends to pay off its
huge debt and make money, both without raising costs to the average
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   But industry veterans warn that there is a fundamental flaw in
his plan: his assumption that SFX will be able to keep any
additional money it makes. Unlike entertainment companies such as
Disney, which owns the movies and theme parks from which it
profits, SFX does not own the bands, theatrical shows, and monster
trucks that fill its venues. These groups once worked for
comparatively modest amounts, but that day is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Sillerman's proposal to expand advertising, for
example, Irving Azoff, who manages the rock group The Eagles, said:
``If they're going to create new revenue sources, that's great. I'm
going to want 90 percent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The moon rose high and the house hopped the night of Sillerman's
benefit concert in July. As Rod Stewart prepared for his last
number, his drummer stepped aside for a guest player _ Ron
Perelman. The song was ``We're Havin' a Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman said he thinks there will be a lot of parties as the
century draws to a close, and that that is good news for SFX.
``There is a general belief,'' he said, ``that the US is going to
be in a party atmosphere for the next two years, so a lot of
entertainers will be touring'' and playing SFX amphitheaters.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent $1 billion, he had better be right, according to
industry executives. If he's not, he may never again be as well-off
as he was that July night. Neither may America's rock and pop
concertgoers, who would have to endure the crumbling of the
entertainment empire he has built.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it optimism in the face of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   As US stock markets nosedived and most investors bit their
nails, venture capital funds pumped a record-setting $550.8 million
into 114 young New England companies during the third quarter,
continuing their bets on software, communications, medical
technology _ even retailing and education _ as tomorrow's
money-makers.
</P>
<P>
   That money represented one-seventh of the $3.77 billion that
went to 708 companies nationwide during the July-September period,
also a record.
</P>
<P>
   The total for New England topped the previous high, set during
this year's first quarter, by $16.6 million, according to The
Boston Globe/PriceWaterhouseCoopers Money Tree Survey for the third
quarter of 1998. The national figure was up $70 million from last
spring's high.
</P>
<P>
   Software and computer companies, including a proliferation of
Internet-related companies, captured 65 percent of New England
investment, double what those sectors attracted nationwide. Medical
instruments and devices took third place in the region.
Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies followed.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick M. Gray, a PricewaterhouseCoopers Technology Group
partner in Boston, said the survey's findings painted ``a rosy
picture'' for entrepreneurs who depend on venture capital to build
what begins as a good idea into a profitable company.
</P>
<P>
   And Gray said this pace should continue, as institutional money
managers, who put money in venture funds, roll over the proceeds of
venture-fund investments made many years ago. Many of those
long-term investments last year delivered annualized returns of
between 25 percent and 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are huge dollar amounts going into venture capital,''
added David Fischer, executive vice president at Silicon Valley
East, a local investment banking affiliate of Silicon Valley Bank
of California. Fund managers in turn are obliged to ``put it to
work,'' he said. ``Investors don't want it just sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   But some venture fund managers, still upbeat about long-term
prospects, said recent uncertainty in financial markets casts a
cloud on whether this momentum can be sustained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think things will flatten out a bit,'' said Nicholas
Callinan, in the Boston office of Advent International, a major
venture capital firm. ``That's not to say that things are bad, just
that they won't be as strong as they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is a slowdown, last summer's flow of money should
keep many companies afloat for some time, and the biggest winners
illustrate New England's entrepreneurial diversity:
</P>
<P>
   _ Medicines Co. of Cambridge, Mass. received the largest single
funding in New England during the quarter, $36 million. The company
buys drug ideas from other firms for development and will use its
money to pay for ongoing work on two products, and as ``a war
chest, so if we find another candidate we can buy it,'' said Clive
Meanwell, founder and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nexabit Networks Inc. of Marlborough, mass., which is
developing high-capacity telecommunications switches and is seen as
a leader among scores of firms in this field, received $25 million.
With Ray Stata, chairman of Analog Devices Inc., as its leading
private investor, Nexabit hopes to have its first products out for
testing this year and widely marketed in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _ OrderTrust LLC of Lowell, Mass. raised the third largest
amount, $22.9 million, from private investors and two venture
funds. The company uses the Internet to process orders for
marketers who sell products delivered by other vendors. SkyMall,
the airline-magazine marketer, and 1-800-FLOWERS, which arranges
floral deliveries nationwide, are clients. OrderTrust controller
David Desrochers said the funding will support growth as the
founders, Timothy and Thomas Litle, explore whether to go public,
remain private, or seek a buyer or a merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   _ HarvardNet Inc. of Portsmouth, N.H., an Internet service
provider in Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, received $18
million, the fourth largest funding for the quarter. William
Southworth, founder of the five-year-old firm, said the cash is
being used to bolster management, install high-speed data lines,
and build a facility in Boston to house servers holding Web pages
and user software. ``We needed a quantum change,'' he said. ``It
was time to raise some money to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of third-quarter investments in New England
were late-stage placements. Some fund managers said this may
reflect the need some companies had for cash after the summer
downturn on Wall Street delayed plans for making initial public
stock offerings to raise money and pay off earlier investors.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff began in mid-July and hit young and technology-based
companies hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Seven New England companies did go public during that time,
though _ six in July and one in September. The largest of these,
Cyberian Outpost Inc. of Kent, Conn., defied the odds, going out at
$18 per share, compared with the company's prediction, in a
registration filing, of between $13 and $15 per share.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet-only computer products retailer's offering on July
31 raised $72 million. ``I say we just made it by a day,'' Cyberian
president Daryll Peck said. ``The following week would have been
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyberian Outpost shares traded up to 26 on the first day, before
a downward slide that bottomed at 6 3/4 on Sept. 14. As of Friday
shares closed &UR;  &LR; at 16 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the traditional sources of money for venture funds _
pension funds, college endowments, trust-fund managers, and others
who allocate a percentage of assets to these high-risk, high-return
investments _ keep pouring it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more venture capitalists than ever before,'' said
Fischer, at Silicon Valley East.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, venture companies created 140 new limited
partnership funds in 1997, according to Venture Capital Journal, a
magazine that covers the industry. At least as many are expected to
be formed this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pieter Schiller, a partner at Advanced Technology Ventures in
Waltham, Mass., said a $175 million fund ATV created this year was
oversubscribed, but was closed at that point to avoid putting too
much pressure on its managers to invest.
</P>
<P>
   ``One cannot help but look at the amount of money flowing into
the industry and scratch your head,'' Schiller said. But the effect
is inevitable, he said: ``If you have more people putting money in,
the amount of money being poured into little companies will go
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Matrix Partners, also in Waltham, closed another new fund at
$150 million. ``We could have raised three or four times that,''
Matrix partner Paul J. Ferri said. A third Waltham-based venture
firm, Charles River Ventures, is now closing another $175 million
pool, and many more are in progress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, even more cash is being made available through
venture funds developed by brokerage houses and marketed to
individuals made rich by the recent stock-market boom.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Wadsworth, a managing director at HarbourVest
Partners in Boston, said those funds have raised new problems
revolving around investor expectations.
</P>
<P>
   These buyers are accustomed to buying and selling quickly on the
open market. Venture fund partnership shares, however, are not
easily traded and don't deliver returns for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole new source of capital that may not be as
long-term in its outlook, may be more volatile, and may dry up when
private equity markets hit a downturn,'' Wadsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe/PricewaterhouseCoopers survey again ranked
California's Silicon Valley as the nation's dominant region for new
companies getting venture funding, with 208 firms there attracting
$1.24 billion. That was about the same amount companies in that
region received during the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But venture funding in the Southeast, which in the past has
threatened to overtake New England and move from third place to
number two, slipped 3.5 percent, to $336.2 million shared among 60
firms. The Los Angeles/Orange County region ran fourth, with $290
million going to 27 companies. Texas was in fifth place with 44
companies sharing $257.5 million.

USERS OF 10-10 SERVICES CONFUSED BY OBSCURE TERMS?

 (Includes 10-10 companies text table)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG

<TEXT>
<P>
   Theodore Jacobs feels besieged. He gets several direct-mail
pitches a week for 10-10 long-distance telephone services. He only
has to spin the television dial to see more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I am snowed under. It boggles the mind all these
10-10 offers,'' says Jacobs, a retired teacher and part time actor
from Framingham, who so far has not used any of them. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Long-distance phone carriers offering 10-10 ``dial-around''
services recently have unleashed an advertising blitz. Trumpeting
their ability to offer lower rates, the 10-10 services seek
cost-conscious callers willing to dial the extra digits to &UR;  &LR; make
interstate and international calls.
</P>
<P>
   With names like Telecom USA, Lucky Dog, and New Dimeline, the
dial-around operators use TV actors such as John Lithgow, Dennis
Miller, and Tony Danza, as well as promotional contests that award
cruises, airline tickets, and other prizes. They hope to get
consumers to bypass their chosen long-distance provider; 10-10
calls are connected through the alternative provider's network. In
the past 12 months, nearly 20 percent of US households have tried
dial-around, according to the Yankee Group, a Boston market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   As the number of 10-10 operators grows, so does confusion over
the myriad terms and conditions of the services. ``Dial- around is
becoming very cluttered,'' says Ken R. Ball, senior vice president
of marketing for Vartec Telecom Inc. of Lancaster, Texas, which
runs the 10-10-811 service, one of 10 major dial-around providers.
</P>
<P>
   Dial-around is one of the latest signs of the constant ferment
in the long-distance phone market. The changes sweeping the $90
billion-a-year industry have made it ever more competitive, pushing
rates ever lower. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, 15 cents a minute was considered a good deal. Today,
service is available for as little as 5 cents a minute.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, per-minute rates for consumers may be on the way out.
Sprint Corp. recently announced a $25 a month calling plan for
unlimited long-distance domestic calls on weekends, although it
will still charge 10 cents a minute for weekday calls. AT&AMP;T Corp.
has said it would match Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it is just a matter of time before the flat-fee
structure adopted by America Online and Internet service providers
becomes a common option for long-distance callers.
</P>
<P>
   While long-distance rates have been declining since the break-up
of the Bell System in 1984, the big push really started with MCI
Communications Inc., which gained millions of AT&AMP;T residential
customers through clever marketing of ``Friends and Family,'' a
pioneering calling plan that provides discounts off standard rates
for frequently dialed numbers. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; MCI's success prompted Sprint and a host of smaller carriers to
roll out a wide range of calling plans &UR;  &LR; with low monthly fees and
drastic reductions off basic per-minute rates. &UR;  &LR; More recently, some
carriers have come out with one-rate plans that offer the same,
discounted rate 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the majority of residential customers _ upwards of 60
million households _ haven't signed up for a low-cost calling plan.
Many of them make few long-distance calls _ less than $20 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the dial-around carriers. Aiming to capture these
infrequent callers with no strong allegiance to a long-distance
carrier, small long-distance companies jumped into dial-around, on
a regional basis, starting &UR;  &LR; around 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Dial-around companies all pitch simplicity: no sign-ups for
calling plans and no monthly minimums for service. Just dial 10-10,
a three-digit access code, 1, the area code, and the number. The
cost of the call automatically appears on your monthly local phone
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many dial-around services, to the consumer's surprise,
are actually subsidiaries of the established phone giants.
</P>
<P>
   MCI, which started offering dial-around in 1996, last year
elevated it to a national level with hefty television and radio
advertising. The company, now part of MCI Worldcom Inc., was
followed last month by AT&AMP;T's launch of its Lucky Dog 10-10
service, which is now being heavily advertised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major long-distance companies were losing minutes of usage
to smaller carriers, some offering dial-around, others with prepaid
calling cards, and realized they had to respond,'' said Robert Fox,
telecommunications analyst at Mercer Management Consulting in
Lexington.
</P>
<P>
   And while dial-around is the fastest growing segment of the
long-distance market, it still accounts for only about 3 percent of
the more than $90 billion spent annually on interstate and
international phone calls. Consumers are expected to spend $3
billion on 10-10 dialing this year, double a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The number of long-distances choices today can be mind-boggling,
requiring consumers to shop with pencil-sharp precision.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring out the actual costs and savings from a dial-around
service, for instance, isn't so simple. What's rarely understood is
that savings hyped by dial-around carriers are off AT&AMP;T's basic
phone rates, which are the highest available. Heavy users of long
distance _ people who make frequent or lengthy calls _ may be
better off signing up for a calling plan. And, depending on the
time of day or day of the week, some dial-around rates can work out
to be much higher than under calling plans. So it's essential to
know your calling patterns before using dial-around.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, 10-10 services may be most appropriate for
people who make few long-distance calls _ and are willing to pay
for the calls a la carte rather than subscribing to a calling plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers using dial-around are not really saving much money
compared to having a calling plan from a major carrier,'' says
Rebecca Sachs, a spokeswoman for the Telecommunications Research
and Action Center, a Washington-based consumer group.

NEW GENERATION OF SWITCH MAKERS GROWS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When New England telecommunications entrepreneurs are
encouraged to go west, they're not being steered toward
California's Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   They're heading straight to Westford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Route 128 and Cambridge are still attracting
start-ups, but in the $10 billion marketplace to develop the big
iron of the Internet _ the next generation of switches, software,
and high-tech tools for the nation's communications infrastructure
_ several dozen telecommunications firms are planting their roots
in the Interstate 495 communities of Littleton, Tewksbury,
Boxborough, and Chelmsford, with Westford as the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   With the names Argon, Convergent, Sycamore, Redstone, Castle
Networks, and ArrowPoint, their collective goal is to develop
communications switching systems capable of moving data at
trillions of bits per second and sending a mix of millions of data,
video, and voice ``packets'' to their destinations more quickly and
accurately than today's voice systems.
</P>
<P>
   They were drawn to the quiet community of Westford, 35 miles
northwest of Boston near the New Hampshire border, because of easy
access to I-495, little traffic, low office rents, and a ready-made
work force.
</P>
<P>
   That work force came largely from the former Cascade
Communications Corp., one of the fastest-growing telecom companies
in the mid-'90s. Part of Cascade's success was its ability to
attract experienced electrical engineers who lived in either the
surrounding towns off I-495 or southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   So when Cascade was acquired by Ascend Communications last year,
some key employees left to form or join start-ups. In fact, some of
these start-ups are housed in the former Cascade headquarters
building.
</P>
<P>
   The community of 20,000 has felt an impact. Realtors report
housing prices have risen 10 percent annually over the past two
years, and commercial rents, which were under $10 per square foot
three years ago, are now in the $15 to $18 range _ but still well
below the $30 seen along Route 128. And local retailers and
restaurants have seen an increase in business.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike an earlier generation of Route 128 firms that sold
communications and networking products and services directly to
medium and large corporations, the new wave of telecommunications
start-ups are targeting their products to existing telephone
carriers, many of which are not set up to handle today's boom in
digital data.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if the Internet continues to grow at its current pace,
some specialists believe voice telephone traffic will amount to
less than 5 percent of the total communications business by 2004.
That forecast has some of the largest domestic and European
telephone carriers and their traditional voice switch suppliers
scrambling to figure out how to deal with the convergence of data,
voice, and video networks.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Sprint has spent $2 billion to retool its long-distance
telephone network to handle a mix of voice and data more
effectively, while SBC Communications, one of the largest regional
Bell phone companies, said it plans to spend $600 million over the
next three years to transform its network.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, new phone companies, which compete against AT&AMP;T,
Sprint and Bell Atlantic, want to buy the latest Internet switch
technology to gain an edge over their much larger, well-entrenched
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to be the go-to players for the next generation of super
high-speed telecommunications switches are some of the Westford
start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a sea change in how telecommunications will be
delivered in the future, and that means developing significantly
better products quickly and at lower prices to a relatively small
group of customers, who will buy large quantities,'' said Tom
Burkhardt, president and founder of Castle Networks Inc. in
Westford, which is building a new switch to bridge the gap between
separate voice and data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Castle is among four start-ups _ the others being ArrowPoint
Communications Inc., Redstone Communications Inc. and Sonus
Networks Inc. _ launched in Westford over the past 18 months,
having received nearly $20 million each in venture capital funding.
A fifth, NextPoint Networks, a software firm, was launched two
years ago and has received $16 million from investors.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Tewksbury, Convergent Networks Inc., formed last May
with $7 million in first-round venture capital, is developing a
switch to move voice traffic over existing data switches. In
Littleton, Argon Networks Inc., formed 18 months ago and now
employing 75 people and $34 million in venture capital, is
developing a high-speed switch aimed at Internet service providers
and telephone carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Further along I-495 in Marlborough is another telecom cluster,
where start-ups Nexabit Networks, Omnia Communications, and
Broadband Access Systems reside.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you are seeing is start-ups tackling a piece of the
telecommunications infrastructure they did not handle before, as
the major telephone carriers like AT&AMP;T used to do it all
themselves,'' said Michael Grady, Argon president and cofounder.
``So companies around here are working on bigger, more complex
problems that require more capital and must be solved more
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, a telecom switch start-up must follow a rigorous
timeline: 12 to 15 months to develop its product followed by six to
nine months to market it to some key customers before competition
arrives, and then another six to 12 months to reach profitability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology changes are moving so fast these days that if you
need two years to develop your product, don't bother, because
you'll miss the time-to-market window when you have little
competition,'' said James Dolce Jr., president of Redstone
Communications Inc., who previously cofounded Arris Networks,
acquired by Cascade before its first anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   And while none of the leaders of these emerging businesses
dreams of becoming industry titans, maybe one will hit financial
pay dirt with an initial stock offering and the others will prosper
when they are acquired by either a big-name competitor or by one of
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisition rumors have already been reported about some of
these start-ups. Argon's Grady declined to discuss published
reports that his company could be acquired by Siemens AG, the
German electronics and telecom company. And earlier this month
Ericsson, the giant Swedish telecommunications equipment company,
said it is looking to acquire start-ups from its new data
networking headquarters in Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be surprised if some of these companies that get $20
million to $30 million in venture capital ultimately sell out for
nothing less than $250 million,'' said Todd A. Dagres, a general
partner at Battery Ventures, a Wellesely venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very large companies are not good at architecting new
products; they are good at adding features to existing products,''
said Edward Anderson, general partner at Northbridge Ventures,
which helped fund three Westford start-ups among a dozen
Massachusetts telecom start-ups. ``But what may take them three
years to design, our companies can do in one-third the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the start-ups: to develop breakthrough telecom
products quickly, working very long hours with colleagues who enjoy
the technical challenges with the ultimate reward of a public stock
offering that makes them a pile of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember telling engineering applicants that if you can't
work 60 hours (a week), don't apply,'' said Cheng Wu, president of
ArrowPoint Communications and a cofounder of Arris Networks.
``Although we probably had people here working 80-hour weeks, we
got our product out on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Those long hours can be punishing on family life. Some firms
provide their employees dinner up to four nights a week,
occasionally with spouses and children at the table.
</P>
<P>
   With salaries averaging $90,000 a year for experienced
engineers, the older, established telecom companies are feeling the
competition, some offering a $25,000 ``retention bonuses,'' stock,
or salary increases to retain talented employees.
</P>
<P>
   Some engineers are in such high demand that they will not even
consider driving down heavily traveled Route 3 toward Bedford,
insisting they would work only close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told the first six engineers that I was thinking of
starting the company in Burlington, they were all ready to quit,
saying they wanted Westford,'' said Rubin Gruber, chairman and
cofounder of Sonus Networks, which last week successfully tested a
combination voice and data switch that works over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber, at 54 the oldest chief executive of the telecom
start-ups, retired three years ago after launching several
companies including Davox Corp. and VideoServer Inc. ``I hated
playing golf, and sitting on the boards of directors of other
companies just did not fulfill me,'' he said. ``This is fun.''

 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By all accounts it was a golden evening, the night
last July when Robert F.X. Sillerman introduced British rocker Rod
Stewart at a benefit concert Sillerman had organized in the tony
vacation preserve of the Hamptons, where he now makes his home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long way from when he had hustled discount magazines
and a dating service as a Brandeis student in the late 1960s, and
another step in his transformation from scrappy dealmaker to member
of the monied set. (Among concert guests: billionaire Revlon
chairman Ronald Perelman.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, Bob Sillerman, 50, has a talent for transformations.
He pulled one off recently with, of all things, a string of
mid-sized radio stations, which he sold for an unheard-of $2.1
billion, reportedly pocketing at least $200 million himself. And he
is out to pull off another, this time with live entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 18 months and at a cost of $1 billion _ most of it
borrowed _ Sillerman has basically bought America's rock and pop
concert industry. He has made himself the maestro of the nation's
theatrical touring trade, which brings Broadway shows to places
such as Boston and Washington, Austin and Omaha. And for good
measure, he has sewn up the country's specialized motorsports
business, with events where monster trucks with names like ``Grave
Digger'' crush everything in their paths.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he and the publicly traded company he controls, SFX
Entertainment Inc., spent $90 million in cash and assumed debt to
take over the operations of Boston concert promoter Don Law and,
with them, control of Great Woods, Harborlights, and the Orpheum. A
month later, he spent $10 million more to buy Boston theater
producer Jon B. Platt's firm and, with it, control of the Colonial
and Wilbur theatres and the Charles Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of us, there's not much left here he
doesn't control,'' said Josiah A. Spaulding Jr., chief executive of
Boston's nonprofit Wang Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much left anywhere else, either, and that fact _
together with Sillerman's penchant for picking fights with
competitors _ has set off an unholy uproar. In short order:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (BBOX)The Justice Department has begun an informal review of
SFX's most recent acquisitions with an eye toward possible
antitrust violations. People familiar with the review say the
concern is that the company has cornered so much of the concert
business it could raise ticket prices with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Agents such as Tom Ross, who until he resigned last week
from Los Angeles-based Creative Artists Agency was widely
considered one of the most powerful figures in the music business,
have steered big acts such as Eric Clapton and Celine Dion away
from SFX, fearing it will use its clout to slash what it pays
artists and, possibly, cut agents out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Entertainment executives such as Barry Diller, chairman
and chief executive of USA Networks, have landed in unusually
public and spectacularly bitter clashes with Sillerman. In letters
and public comments last summer, Diller, whose company owns
Ticketmaster, accused Sillerman of exaggerating the number of
tickets that Ticketmaster sells for SFX and of wrongly suggesting
that the ticketing company had offered SFX a bigger cut of ticket
prices, all to promote SFX's new stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Leaders of nonprofit performing arts centers including the
Wang and Washington's Kennedy Center have engaged in a frantic
series of meetings _ the most recent in Hartford two weeks ago _ to
try to figure out what to do if, as most expect, SFX's theatrical
touring subsidiary, PACE Entertainment, raises the price it charges
for shows or begins directing them to SFX-controlled venues.
Although Broadway musicals are only a small part of what these
centers present, according to their administrators, they are among
the few productions that make money and therefore are key to
keeping the facilities solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the industry are worried about monopoly,''
said Lawrence J. Wilker, president of the Kennedy Center. ``We use
the surplus (from musicals) to subsidize other art forms. Now that
SFX is in control they are going to want that money, which means
it's going to go out of the community and not be available to us.
It's a real concern.''
</P>
<P>
   A concern, but, as it turns out, not yet a reality. For all the
angst about SFX in the arts and entertainment world, the company
has yet to begin behaving like a behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the firm has raised some concert ticket prices, but
it has lowered others. Nationwide, prices have not risen any faster
this year than in past years, when SFX was not a factor, according
to Pollstar, a concert industry trade magazine. Although the
company is running millions of dollars in the red largely because
of interest costs on its debt, the fees it pays performers are
actually higher, not lower, than the music industry norm, said
Pollstar editor Gary Bongiovanni.
</P>
<P>
   Even regarding issues that are clearly within its control and of
little concern to consumers or antitrust officials _ like whether
SFX consolidates management of the 16 or so firms it has acquired
and cuts staff _ it essentially has done nothing. Although the
company now has 2,000 employees, according to Thomas Benson, SFX's
chief financial officer, it has laid off only about 20 and does not
expect to lay off any more.

DELUGE OF NEW DRUGS MAY LEAD TO CONFUSION, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the new anti-psychotic drug Zyprexa debuted
two years ago, several pharmacists reading those prescriptions
mistook it for Zyrtec, an antihistamine.
</P>
<P>
   At least two dozen times, people prescribed Navane for
schizophrenia instead got the blood pressure medication Norvasc,
research data has shown.
</P>
<P>
   And two heart drugs, amrinone for heart failure and amiodarone
for arrythmias, also have been confused, and some patients have
received the wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   Some mix-ups have been fatal. Such was the case with Losec, an
ulcer medication, that was being confused with Lasix, a diuretic.
At least one person died before drugmaker Merck agreed to change
Losec's name to Prilosec in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today, that drug, one of the most commonly prescribed in the
country, is sometimes mistaken for Prozac, another high-volume drug
that is used to treat depression.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes, with Narcan and Norcuron, nelfinavir and
nevirapine, Premarin and Primaxin. With the proliferation of new
drugs on the market, confusion over medications has become a
serious problem, said Bruce Lambert, a professor at the University
of Illinois in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   His database of drug names has grown to more than 1,100 pairs
where one drug was mistakenly dispensed for another, Lambert said
Tuesday. He was attending the American Association of
Pharmaceutical Scientists meeting in San Francisco to discuss the
problem of look-alike and sound-alike drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert told of his recent study in which pharmacists were shown
a list of drug names and then shown another, longer list and then
asked whether any of those on the first list also showed up on the
second. When similarly sounding names were on both lists, the rate
of errors doubled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The take-home message is: We know that similarity increases
the risks of certain kinds of memory errors,'' Lambert said.
``Therefore, we ought to reduce the similarity in drug names
wherever possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration has taken notice. A year ago,
it began requiring drug companies to get approval ahead of time for
new medication names to make sure they are not too similar to ones
already on the market.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also is about to launch a surveillance campaign to
keep track of problems that crop up because of similar names, as
well as confusing packaging, according to Mike Cohen, president of
the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a private, nonprofit
organization that tracks prescription errors.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also are becoming more careful. Several have used
Lambert's database to screen names they are considering for new
drugs, he said. The FDA already forbids companies from using names
that sound like the condition the drug is intended to treat, or
that are similar to the medication's generic name.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are concerned because they spend hundreds of thousands
of dollars picking the right name for a new drug, using consultants
and focus groups that help them identify ones the public likes.
Naming drugs has become more of an issue in the past few years as
pharmaceutical companies have begun marketing their products
directly to consumers through big advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notice how many names have Xs and Zs in them,'' Lambert said.
``The branding people believe those letters make the names
distinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lambert has developed a computer program for
pharmacists designed to raise a warning flag when a prescription
for a commonly confused drug name is presented. It is similar to a
program now used to alert pharmacists when a patient is being
dispensed two or more drugs that can be dangerous when taken
together.
</P>
<P>
   With 35,000 drug brand names now registered with the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office and another 10,000 used as generic names, the
potential for mix-ups is great, Lambert said.
</P>
<P>
   And with doctors' handwriting being what it is, the problem is
by no means rare. Figures reflecting the scope of the problem are
hard to come by, but it is on the rise, Cohen said. He said at
least 4,000 reports of mix-ups had come into his organization since
1993.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much worse situation than it was 10 or 15 years ago,''
Cohen said. ``There's a lot more drugs on the market ... and with
the pressures on health professionals because of managed care and
need to control costs, the staffing is different.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen wants doctors to write on the prescription what it is they
are treating with the drug, so a pharmacist can better figure out
which one they mean. New prescription pads also are being
distributed that have icons representing the heart or kidney or
other body part the drug is supposed to treat.
</P>
<P>
   But he said patients should also be aware of what they were
getting and why and ask their doctors and pharmacists what the drug
should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done a good job teaching patients what they need to
know to protect themselves,'' Cohen said.

WHEN KING REIGNED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Billie Jean King was borne into the bedlam on an Egyptian
litter by six bare-chested men dressed as Nubian slaves, as Bobby
Riggs appeared in a rickshaw pulled by six women in red T-shirts
that proclaimed them Bobby's Bosom Buddies, as 30,472 spectators in
the Houston Astrodome and a television audience of 50 million
squared off blatantly along gender lines (``Win One for the
Bedroom, Bobby,'' implored one banner), the woman who would become
a legend had a quiet thought:
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no turning back.''
</P>
<P>
   She was right. As King and nine other legends of women's tennis
gather this weekend in Hartford, Conn. to celebrate the 25th
anniversary of her triumph in the ``Battle of the Sexes,'' many now
believe _ as King knew all along _ that the match was a turning
point in the movement toward equal opportunity for women not only
in sports but in every facet of American society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understood it was about social change,'' she said during a
recent interview. ``That match really got people feeling and
thinking and questioning and asking about themselves and about the
opposite gender. I still get women who come up to me and say, it
changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, as part of the 1998 Phoenix ATP Tour World Doubles
Championship at the Hartford Civic Center, Martina Navratilova and
Chris Evert will lead two teams in an exhibition to commemorate the
historic match. Fittingly, Sunday is the day King will turn 55 _
the same age as Riggs when he lost to her in straight sets 6-4,
6-3, 6-3, on Sept. 20, 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Riggs died in 1995 of prostate cancer at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem absurd in 1998 that a tennis match between a
29-year-old in the prime of her career and a 55-year-old far beyond
his could generate such excitement. But in 1973, fresh on the heels
of Title IX and Roe v. Wade, with women earning 59 cents to a man's
dollar and Watergate in full swing, King was yet another threat to
the status quo. Many women thought that was terrific. Many men did
not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I daresay there were millions and millions of men and women
watching that match who had no interest in tennis whatsoever,''
said Allen Guttmann, who teaches at Amherst College and is the
author of ``Women's Sports, A History.''
</P>
<P>
   The hype had been building for months. Riggs, a top player in
his day who won Wimbledon in 1939, had long since become the
self-proclaimed clown prince of the sport. As his skills faded his
imagination grew, Riggs made a decent living by betting on himself
to win matches while chained to a Great Dane, or holding a valise.
When he challenged any of the top women tennis players to face him,
$100,000 to the winner, it was just another stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting no part of such nonsense, King turned him down. Several
times. But Margaret Court did not. Apparently succumbing to nerves
and psyched out by the red roses Riggs presented her before the
match in honor of Mother's Day, Court was trounced, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't say no'' after that, said King. ``When she lost
badly, then I knew I would have to play. And when ABC said, `We're
going to do it,' I knew that was this was our chance for social
change. Exposure is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rosie Casals, winner of five Wimbledon doubles titles with
King who was in the ABC booth that night and will play this
weekend, put it: ``You knew you were at the top of the top. Howard
Cosell did not do little events.''
</P>
<P>
   While King was largely silent in the days leading up to the
match, Riggs more than made up for it. ``I'll tell you why I'll
win,'' he told Globe writer Bud Collins. ``She's a woman, and they
just don't have the emotional stability.'' But King was winning all
the important skirmishes: the number of sets (five instead of
three), speed of the playing surface, weight of the tennis balls
all favored her youth. Behind the scenes, she was outhustling the
hustler, paying attention to the details while he brayed. ``I was
very scared,'' she said. ``I really needed to win. I just felt like
(a loss) would put us backward. I think it would have given a lot
of people an excuse not to support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the match got under way, Riggs led only briefly, quickly
fading in the face of King's powerful volleys. ``She wore him out
in the second set,'' said Casals. ``By the third set, he was
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Women were ecstatic. ``Here we were in the middle of the women's
movement, and there had to be this catalyst, this thing that broke
it all open,'' said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the
Women's Sports Foundation. ``It was like the Berlin Wall. Once one
brick was pushed off, the whole thing came apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Olympic gold medalist Donna de Varona put it: ``We went
right into their sandbox, met 'em face-to-face, and we won. So what
could they say anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   King's battle against Riggs was not her first stand for
equality. In the mid-1960s, she spoke out against under-the-table
payments to ``amateur'' players. In 1970, after several years of
unsuccessful lobbying for prize money comparable to men's, King
helped organize the Virginia Slims professional tour for women. And
it was not her last. She, along with de Varona, founded the Women's
Sports Foundation in 1974, and King remains committed to increasing
diversity and team play in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``All women in sports should bow down to Billie,'' said Tracy
Austin, the two-time US Open champion who also will play this
weekend. ``She really put a lot on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, cautioned King, it is too soon for her or anyone else to
grow complacent. ``The climate and the landscape has changed, but
it obviously needs to change a tremendous lot more. We truly have
to be sure the ABL and WNBA, women's fast pitch softball, make
it,'' she said. ``You really have to give women's professional
sports the same kind of time frame that men's have had to evolve.
People have to be patient. It's very important that people support
these, if people want these opportunities to stay around for their
daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Riggs, who started it all as a hustle and ended up an
inadvertent key player in the women's movement, ``in his later
years, he got the picture of the social change,'' said King, who
became a friend and stayed in touch until the end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the last things he said to me,'' said King, ``was,
`Boy, we really did make a difference'''

HOLZMAN SPOKE VOLUMES _ SOFTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the people who have ever coached in the National
Basketball Association, no one has ever had a temperament better
suited to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win,'' Red Holzman would say, ``I'm going to go out and
have a steak and Scotch. If we lose, I'm going to go out and have a
steak and Scotch.''
</P>
<P>
   That would make precisely 1,300 steaks and 1,300 Scotches
(assuming, of course, he limited himself to just one of the latter)
during an NBA coaching career that began when he was a 33-year-old
player-coach with the Milwaukee Hawks in 1953 and lasted until the
1981-82 season, when he ended his second stint running the New York
Knicks. Red was very serious about what he did, but he was never
going to get an ulcer, preferring instead to give them, if that's
what it would take to make the team successful. When he left the
bench, it was hardly the end of his contribution to the game he
loved, because for the past 16 years, he had been the Knicks'
``basketball consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Consultant,'' he laughed during a 1987 radio interview. ``A
consultant is a guy you owe money to.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical Red Holzman. He never wanted you to think that he
thought he was important.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always low-key toward everybody,'' wrote Phil Jackson
in his autobiography, ``Maverick.'' ``He had the ability to fade
into the background whenever it was necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything about the public Holzman was understated. Take the
way he called for a timeout, for example. He would rise halfway out
of his seat, casually wave his left hand in the direction of a
player, and then mouth that player's first name once he had his
attention. He looked like an English gentleman hailing a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   He did what he did with so little outward fuss that you could be
forgiven for thinking the team ran on autopilot _ but that would be
a serious miscalculation. The truth is that Red Holzman did a whole
lot of coaching behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight games into the 1967-68 season, he assumed control
of a Knicks team that was widely perceived to be an underachieving
bunch that was taking incessant advantage of Dick McGuire, a noted
nice guy. It took 15 minutes for Holzman to get everyone's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   He called a meeting for 10 a.m. At 10:10, Dick Van Arsdale and
Howard Komives came sauntering in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're fined $10 each,'' Holzman informed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys looked at each other,'' wrote Walt Frazier in his
autobiography, ``Clyde.'' ``You could just about read their lips as
they said to thsmselves, `Hey, what's he think he's doing?'''
</P>
<P>
   At 10:15, the future senator himself arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're fined $15,'' Holzman told Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``From then on the guys knew he meant business,'' wrote Frazier.
``I think he gained instant respect. I know he gained mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The players soon learned that playing for Holzman was at once
simple and demanding. The emphasis was on defense. They were to
``see the ball'' and they were to help each other out. On offense,
they were to make the extra pass.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you say, who doesn't preach that?
</P>
<P>
   What made Holzman special was his ability to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my understanding that Red Holzman possesses more
understanding of human nature than most other coaches do,'' Jackson
tells us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real genius of Holzman lies in his handling of players,''
echoes Bradley in ``Life On The Run.'' (This was, as you see, a
very literary group). ``A comment on a plane or in an airport might
relate tangentially to a previous game, but it is always delivered
low-key.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not afraid to offend his stars and he was completely
comfortable with his black players, neither of which was
necessarily the NBA norm in the late '60s and early '70s.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley postulates that Holzman learned a great deal about
coaching during seven summers in Puerto Rico, where he had to deal
with all sorts of playing personalities in all sorts of hostile
environments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the feeling that the Ponce experience has given him
confidence in handling any player in any situation,'' Bradley
wrote. ``It was there he learned to discard his own non-basketball
perceptions when they clashed with a player's in an area unrelated
to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Holzman revealed no company secrets, and he never knocked a
player to the media. You'd ask him a question after a game and he'd
say, ``You saw it; what did you think?'' You came away emptyhanded
but flattered.
</P>
<P>
   He loved to goof on young writers. The first time I ever dealt
with him professionally was after a game in which the Knick bench
had played nobly in defeat. I threw him a softball question, hoping
to extract a few words of praise for Cazzie Russell and the boys.
``He looked at me with apparent disdain. ``They all get in line at
salary time, don't they?'' he shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   The man was a classic sideline bench jockey, but the crowd never
knew it because he seldom strayed from his seat. One night he was
on the road and he felt referee Don Murphy was giving the home team
a few too many breaks. ``Hey, Murph,'' Red said, ``you planning on
opening a nice restaurant and bar here when you retire?''
</P>
<P>
   The players talk of him conducting practice in a necktie, and I
can believe it. I don't know if Red Holzman even owned a sports
jacket, because all I ever saw on him was a suit. I always figured
he had 20 suits, 10 black and 10 gray. ``He dresses OK for a
coach,'' Frazier tells us, noting, however, that he wears ``ties
and shirts your cousins give you for birthdays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's looking?'' Holzman would say when queried about his
limited wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   He probably will go down in basketball history as the ``other''
Red, but there is no way to overstate his role in popularizing the
NBA. For it was the 1969-70 Knicks who first connected with the
public at large, and the 1969-70 Knicks were nothing more than Red
Holzman's basketball vision brought to life. As much as people in
Boston don't want to hear it, those Knicks teams of the late '60s
and early '70s brought more attention to the game with their
exquisite brand of team basketball than the 11 Celtics titles of
the Russell years. It was, and is, always all about New York, and
the idea that if a sport can make it there, it can make it
anywhere, to borrow a phrase.
</P>
<P>
   I am going to be deprived of an annual pleasure, which was to go
to Madison Square Garden each year and say hello to Red Holzman. He
died last Friday night, a victim of leukemia. He was 78. I don't
have to ask anyone if he was both a great coach and a great man. I
knew him. I know what I think.

HAND IT TO SIMMONS: HE LOOKS LIKE AN OLD PRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ His nickname at the University of Wisconsin
was ``Touchdown Tony.'' Oh, how the Patriots hope that fits Tony
Simmons in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Especially now, when gloom has descended on Foxborough with the
team 5-5, with talk of a lost season, with talk of a coaching
change at season's end, and with talk of the team moving to another
New England state.
</P>
<P>
   Especially now, when former No. 1 pick Terry Glenn is again
beset by injuries and iffy to return against the Miami Dolphins
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In five games, Simmons has caught two touchdown passes. Among
his 13 receptions are a 47-yarder, a 63-yarder, a 43-yarder, and a
37-yarder. It took Glenn 20 games to catch a 50-yarder, and he has
never had a reception longer than 51 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons, who had started three straight games in place of Glenn,
didn't start against the Bills last Sunday because Pete Carroll
wanted Vincent Brisby's veteran leadership on the field. Brisby
tried gallantly to play with a pad around a broken finger but
missed two balls.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons watched as veterans Shawn Jefferson and Ben Coates also
missed passes.
</P>
<P>
   It was the rookie Simmons who caught the ball like a grizzled
veteran, grabbing two passes for 48 yards, including a 37-yard
touchdown _ the only time New England put the ball in the end zone
against the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   It's only been five games, but Simmons appears to be a finely
conditioned athlete _ in track shape, which everyone will tell you
is one step above football shape. It leads you to believe that the
Patriots may have have found something _ a big, durable, tough,
fast receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows that for sure. But Simmons is strength and
conditioning coach Johnny Parker's dream player: a well-conditioned
athlete who is always working toward staying in the best possible
shape.
</P>
<P>
   The irony in his recent emergence is that Simmons played in a
run-oriented system at Wisconsin. Draft gurus across America
thought the Patriots had blown it when they took Simmons in the
second round with the 52d overall pick.
</P>
<P>
   They said he didn't run routes well. They said he had bad hands.
They said he was a ``project.'' They called him a ``track guy,''
which in football means you can't play.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Simmons has shattered all the stereotypes associated
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lots of confidence in my game right now,'' said
Simmons. ``I'm confident that the ball can be thrown to me and I
can catch it. Right now I'm doing my best and doing what I can to
help the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons said defenses are playing him as they would most rookie
receivers _ trying to be physical and rattle him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been seeing the same types of coverages, where teams play
a man up and a man behind me, try to catch me, but that's the
defensive plan, and whatever it is, I have to try and defend it,''
he said. ``From the first play, you can tell what they're trying to
do _ or whether it's going to be a long day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a rookie. They have to do something. They try to get me
out of my game. They yell out to me, `You're a rookie, you're a
rookie, you ain't that good.' When they see me play, they try to
instill it in my head that you have to earn your way in this
league.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has responded to the physical abuse on the field by
giving it right back. Simmons often can be seen fighting off his
defender to make separation so he can catch the ball. He's done
that quite successfully. Because he's so fast, he usually does
separate, and because he is so strong in his legs and hips, he can
outleap defenders for ``jump balls,'' much like the Jets' Keyshawn
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons has complete confidence in his speed; in college, he ran
a 4.35-second 40-yard dash and a 10.2 100. He knows few defenders
can keep up with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm faster than some,'' said the Chicago native. ``As
the game goes on, I start to realize whether I'm faster than the
other guy. Sometimes I just come off the ball and rocket off the
ball _ no hands, you can't touch me _ and I'll run past them and
see if they can catch up to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, I played the same way. I got quieter with my hands
when I got here and I was told I had to use my hands more to fight
guys off the line. I haven't got called for them. If a DB is going
to put his hands on me, well, I don't want them on me, so I got to
do what I got to do to get free and to get open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I prove I can get off people and get them away from me,
they'll continue to play bump on me. I know a lot of the DBs
complain to the refs that I'm pushing off. I'm not pushing off. I'm
just playing the game. If they're going to put their hands on me in
the 5-yard range, I'm going to push them off and I have that much
room to do that. I know I can't do that downfield, but I'm going to
take advantage of the space I have.''
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that Simmons is getting more and more comfortable
with Drew Bledsoe. After the 37-yard touchdown pass, the
quarterback pointed to Simmons as if to say, ``Nice job, kid.'' It
was telling that Bledsoe went right back to Simmons after the
rookie was called for ``illegal touching'' (going out of bounds and
coming back in to catch a ball).
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like I had to make up for that play,'' said Simmons,
``but I didn't think I stepped out of bounds. There was no
indication that I had. I asked the ref to explain it and he
couldn't, so I figure that's a phantom call or whatever. I don't
know where they came up with that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Patriots have lost four of their last five, Simmons
has been a bright light for the future. Fans appear more excited
when Simmons goes deep than they do on any other play the offense
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see myself as the go-to guy,'' said Simmons. ``I'm
just a guy out there playing, but if that's what people want to
call me, then that's the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, this is an ongoing process. I have to keep showing I
can do it at this level. My confidence is high right now and I know
I have good skills to play in this league. The more I face some of
these guys, the better I'm going to get. It's fun to play and I
think I'm still on a very good team. We have six more games to show
what we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon Glenn may return. Troy Brown is scheduled to be back within
two games. Whither Simmons then?
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots know they can't put him on the back burner, for he
is the hot receiver, the one producing results.

THANKSGIVING CRANBERRY DESSERT HITS TWO BIRDS WITH A SINGLE CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not necessary to serve dessert after a Thanksgiving
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Write that down and pass it around the table when the holiday
feast nears its conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says right here I don't have to feed you any dessert. It
was in the newspaper, so it must be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, I know as well as you do that if you do save the
clipping, you are going to toss it in the trash bin on or about
Nov. 25. And you are going to bake two pies and buy a gallon of
pumpkin ice cream that nobody wants or needs.
</P>
<P>
   Every year newspaper editorialists feel compelled to remind us
of the true meaning of Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you what it is: It is America's annual guilt trip.
</P>
<P>
   Are you going to cook the feast or will somebody else? If it's a
potluck, who gets lucky and who will be assigned the pot?
</P>
<P>
   Can you put oysters in the stuffing even though you know Aunt
Audrey will turn green, clutch her throat and fall heavily to the
floor? Who is going to be assigned the task of holding Uncle Ned's
head out of the mashed potatoes and gravy after he has killed off
that jug of Gallo blush?
</P>
<P>
   Don't even think about eating in a restaurant on Thanksgiving,
or buying an entire cooked meal from the supermarket. The women in
the party may manage to choke down the food. But they are pretty
sure they are going to be struck with a thunderbolt of hellfire
about the time the check hits the table.
</P>
<P>
   Eating out on Thanksgiving is like cheating _ big time _ on your
income tax. Sooner or later the IRS, or the ghost of John Alden, is
going to catch up with transgressors. And they will spend eternity
chopping turkey gizzards, breaking up day-old bread and boiling
cranberries until they pop.
</P>
<P>
   The modern woman may have been born to be a cop, an astronaut or
a nuclear scientist. But deep down she knows what she is really
supposed to do is cook a big Thanksgiving dinner for all the
relatives. And to complete the meal with two pies and a quart of
pumpkin ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Well, since I know you are going to ignore my good advice, you
might as well prepare a cinch-o dessert for Thanksgiving. And you
won't have to make any cranberry sauce. The berries are in the:
</P>
<P>
   Thanksgiving Cake
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sifted flour
</P>
<P>
   3 teaspoons baking powder
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 cups raw cranberries
</P>
<P>
   Cream the butter with the sugar in an electric mixer. Beat in
the vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   In another bowl sift together the flour, baking powder and salt.
</P>
<P>
   With the mixer running, alternately add flour mixture and milk
to the sugar mixture and beat until smooth. Turn off the infernal
machine and stir in the cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   Pour this mess into a greased 8-by-8-inch baking pan.
</P>
<P>
   Bake 30 to 35 minutes in a preheated, 400-degree oven.
</P>
<P>
   Serve warm with either of the following sauces:
</P>
<P>
   Brandy Sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup water
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup cream or low-fat evaporated milk
</P>
<P>

SIZING UP DOWNSIZING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, two weeks after his divorce became final,
computer engineer Larry Nagel learned he would be part of a
company-wide downsizing at AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Nagel was 48, and his life was a mess: His marriage had fallen
apart, his mother was sick, he was drinking too much, and his
relationship with his boss had deteriorated. Still, Nagel was
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   So was Tom Chase. He lost his managerial job at AT&AMP;T in the
summer of 1994. Within two years, his marriage had ended, his two
daughters had left with their mother, and an intense job hunt,
involving hundreds of resumes and dozens of interviews, had yielded
only a brief stint as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Harvard University who had been regarded as a
creative _ or ``idea'' _ man at AT&AMP;T, Chase is now 53, and says he
will never work for a corporation again.
</P>
<P>
   Chase and Nagel are among six men and women whose stories are
recounted in ``Disconnected,'' a new book by New York author
Barbara Rudolph. Published by The Free Press, a division of Simon &AMP;
Schuster Inc., ``Disconnected'' goes beyond the workplace, into the
protagonists' homes and personal lives. By getting so close,
Rudolph succeeds in exploring the impact of downsizing while
revealing the connection between work and identity and how much
that connection has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph chose American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. workers for her
research because no other company seemed to fit the new work
paradigm as much as the telecommunications giant. Between 1984 and
1985, the company shed 120,000 jobs from its employment roster.
Though AT&AMP;T had been laying off factory workers for years, the new
layoffs targeted white-collar workers for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   As early as the summer of 1980, AT&AMP;T had announced plans for a
companywide reorganization that would lead to the establishment of
new domestic and foreign subsidiaries. The announcement came in
response to an earlier decision by the Federal Communications
Commission, which planned to push for deregulation of the telephone
industry with or without congressional legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shape of our future is coming clear,'' then AT&AMP;T chairman
Charles L. Brown said at the time. ``So complex and extensive are
the changes that will be required of us, that we had best get on
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until 1984, with the actual break up of Ma Bell, did AT&AMP;T
begin a massive reorganization involving the first big wave of
white-collar layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T is an extreme example of the forces at work in corporate
America,'' Rudolph said in an interview. ``This was a company where
people really did have a job for life. I was bowled over by the
sense of family that people had at the firm. It was quite
meaningful to them, and it seemed to be much more intense than at
other places.''
</P>
<P>
   To dull the impact of job loss, AT&AMP;T and other US companies
created a new workplace lexicon in the mid-1980s and early 1990s,
one that has become an integral part of our vocabulary. ``At
AT&AMP;T,'' writes Rudolph, ```You're accepted for the package' means
you're fired. `You're involuntarily separated' means you're fired.
`Your job won't be there going forward' means you're fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Other euphemisms such as downsizing, right-sizing,
re-engineering, and reorganization joined the list, as companies
searched for ways to lessen what was surely a devastating
experience for American workers. In fact, AT&AMP;T public relations man
Burke Stinson said as much in a telling interview with Rudolph:
``If I tell you it's downsizing,'' he said, ``you won't think
people are getting fired.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People really don't have the same narrative in terms of their
working lives,'' noted Rudolph. ``It is no longer a linear
narrative. Instead, many of us are now beginning to think of
ourselves and our work as contingent.''
</P>
<P>
   While the argument has been made that these changes are a
reflection of very powerful economic forces, Rudolph shows us that
there are personal consequences. For Larry Nagel, the consequences
included a failed marriage and, until he was able to move on, an
incredible sense of loss.
</P>
<P>
   Nagel's world had revolved around his career as an engineer,
which was all he ever wanted to be, ``ever since he was an only
child building ham radio sets in Bakersfield, Calif.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a bachelors of science degree and a doctorate in
electrical engineering from the University of California at
Berkeley, he had been a star at Bell Laboratories and a highly
regarded employee at AT&AMP;T. Still, he had his own set of problems.
Each member of his research team was required to review or evaluate
the problems and failings of his department. Nagel was assigned to
document the failings of his own boss, a longtime nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the pink slip finally landed in Nagel's lap, the
explanation was simple: poor teamwork. ``My ears got warm, and I
could feel my skin getting flushed,'' recalled Nagel. ``My heart
was racing and my muscles tensed ... Getting fired completely
blindsided me.''
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks later, just before Nagel was set to leave, the
company offered him work in another section of Bell Laboratories.
But the offer was a demotion. He refused.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Larry Nagel has rebounded. Rudolph tells us
that four months after his layoff, he found work at a New Jersey
start-up that valued him so much it sent out press releases
boasting of its new hire. Less than a year later, Nagel was
promoted. Today, he works as a consultant in a business in which he
is constantly in demand. And, like Chase, he no longer wants to be
a company man.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Tom Chase's story remains unresolved. Rudolph
calls it a life in progress. Chase says he has learned to tackle
one problem at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Chase was very creative and should never have gone to AT&AMP;T
in the first place,'' noted Rudolph. ``He had a flinty
antiestablishment attitude, but that does not keep you in good
standing in a hierarchical organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase has sold his house and moved to a wooded and remote
section of New Jersey. He drives a limousine, does some consulting
work, and is preparing to launch his own home-based business
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Chase declined to reveal details of
the venture for fear competitors would take his idea. He seems
confident, and feels he will be successful if he can attract the
money to launch his company. He says there is little competition
for what he plans to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Barbara Rudolph got it fairly right in her book,'' he
said. ``She was right. The companies took good care of you ... You
get lulled to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had any advice for young men and women entering
the corporate world, Chase said: ``When you acquire the tools, and
everything you need, just beat it. I did not do it soon enough.''

 By PETER G. GOSSELIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By all accounts it was a golden evening, the night
last July when Robert F.X. Sillerman introduced British rocker Rod
Stewart at a benefit concert Sillerman had organized in the tony
vacation preserve of the Hamptons, where he now makes his home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long way from when he had hustled discount magazines
and a dating service as a Brandeis student in the late 1960s, and
another step in his transformation from scrappy dealmaker to member
of the monied set. (Among concert guests: billionaire Revlon
chairman Ronald Perelman.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, Bob Sillerman, 50, has a talent for transformations.
He pulled one off recently with, of all things, a string of
mid-sized radio stations, which he sold for an unheard-of $2.1
billion, reportedly pocketing at least $200 million himself. And he
is out to pull off another, this time with live entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 18 months and at a cost of $1 billion _ most of it
borrowed _ Sillerman has basically bought America's rock and pop
concert industry. He has made himself the maestro of the nation's
theatrical touring trade, which brings Broadway shows to places
such as Boston and Washington, Austin and Omaha. And for good
measure, he has sewn up the country's specialized motorsports
business, with events where monster trucks with names like ``Grave
Digger'' crush everything in their paths.
</P>
<P>
   In April, he and the publicly traded company he controls, SFX
Entertainment Inc., spent $90 million in cash and assumed debt to
take over the operations of Boston concert promoter Don Law and,
with them, control of Great Woods, Harborlights, and the Orpheum. A
month later, he spent $10 million more to buy Boston theater
producer Jon B. Platt's firm and, with it, control of the Colonial
and Wilbur theatres and the Charles Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of us, there's not much left here he
doesn't control,'' said Josiah A. Spaulding Jr., chief executive of
Boston's nonprofit Wang Center for the Performing Arts.
</P>
<P>
   There is not much left anywhere else, either, and that fact _
together with Sillerman's penchant for picking fights with
competitors _ has set off an unholy uproar. In short order:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (BBOX)The Justice Department has begun an informal review of
SFX's most recent acquisitions with an eye toward possible
antitrust violations. People familiar with the review say the
concern is that the company has cornered so much of the concert
business it could raise ticket prices with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Agents such as Tom Ross, who until he resigned last week
from Los Angeles-based Creative Artists Agency was widely
considered one of the most powerful figures in the music business,
have steered big acts such as Eric Clapton and Celine Dion away
from SFX, fearing it will use its clout to slash what it pays
artists and, possibly, cut agents out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Entertainment executives such as Barry Diller, chairman
and chief executive of USA Networks, have landed in unusually
public and spectacularly bitter clashes with Sillerman. In letters
and public comments last summer, Diller, whose company owns
Ticketmaster, accused Sillerman of exaggerating the number of
tickets that Ticketmaster sells for SFX and of wrongly suggesting
that the ticketing company had offered SFX a bigger cut of ticket
prices, all to promote SFX's new stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Leaders of nonprofit performing arts centers including the
Wang and Washington's Kennedy Center have engaged in a frantic
series of meetings _ the most recent in Hartford two weeks ago _ to
try to figure out what to do if, as most expect, SFX's theatrical
touring subsidiary, PACE Entertainment, raises the price it charges
for shows or begins directing them to SFX-controlled venues.
Although Broadway musicals are only a small part of what these
centers present, according to their administrators, they are among
the few productions that make money and therefore are key to
keeping the facilities solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the industry are worried about monopoly,''
said Lawrence J. Wilker, president of the Kennedy Center. ``We use
the surplus (from musicals) to subsidize other art forms. Now that
SFX is in control they are going to want that money, which means
it's going to go out of the community and not be available to us.
It's a real concern.''
</P>
<P>
   A concern, but, as it turns out, not yet a reality. For all the
angst about SFX in the arts and entertainment world, the company
has yet to begin behaving like a behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the firm has raised some concert ticket prices, but
it has lowered others. Nationwide, prices have not risen any faster
this year than in past years, when SFX was not a factor, according
to Pollstar, a concert industry trade magazine. Although the
company is running millions of dollars in the red largely because
of interest costs on its debt, the fees it pays performers are
actually higher, not lower, than the music industry norm, said
Pollstar editor Gary Bongiovanni.
</P>
<P>
   Even regarding issues that are clearly within its control and of
little concern to consumers or antitrust officials _ like whether
SFX consolidates management of the 16 or so firms it has acquired
and cuts staff _ it essentially has done nothing. Although the
company now has 2,000 employees, according to Thomas Benson, SFX's
chief financial officer, it has laid off only about 20 and does not
expect to lay off any more.

 NEW YORK: ... any more.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All of which raises the question: Why would Sillerman pay $1
billion for all these businesses?
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Sillerman said that the answer, in a
nutshell, is national advertising. Having created the first
nationwide network of amphitheaters with his purchases, he is
convinced he can attract national advertisers who have avoided
concerts and most other live events until now because of the
fractured nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, he said, credit card companies, apparel makers,
telecommunications firms, and soft-drink bottlers will want to buy
spots at events in every corner of the country or the right to slap
their names on tours and the facilities at which they play. And the
money they pay will be gravy for SFX.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside here is just tremendous,'' Sillerman said.
``There's so much inherent growth that's available to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But some entertainment industry veterans suspect
Sillerman's true aim is something quite different, something that
doesn't require him to tightly manage the companies he has acquired
or even do much to attract advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, he's going to flip it'' _ sell SFX to a record
company and media conglomerate like MCA, Polygram, or Time-Warner,
said former Ticketmaster chief executive Frederic D. Rosen, a
longtime industry player. ``Bob's a bright guy, who in his prior
career helped consolidate the radio industry. But his history is
one of consolidating and selling, not consolidating and
operating.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman learned the art of buying and selling from his father,
who assembled the Keystone Radio Network when his son was a child.
At Brandeis, the younger Sillerman started a company that sold
fellow students almost anything he could lay his hands on.
</P>
<P>
   Boston was a heady place in the late 1960s, even for those who
did not let drugs and revolutionary rhetoric cloud their interest
in business. ``We were all part of the alternative culture,''
recalled veteran DJ Charles Laquidara. ``It was OK for the Boston
Tea Party or the Phoenix (or a young Brandeis student's company) to
make money because it was going to be part of a new capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Sillerman's case, there was always a twist to the
money-making. His company started serving not as an alternative
kind of business but as a consultant on ``youth culture'' for
corporate advertisers. He began trawling for his first deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although he bought and sold radio stations during the late 1970s
and throughout the 1980s, his ship did not really come in until the
beginning of this decade, and then in a way that left many people
outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Correctly anticipating that the federal government would loosen
restrictions on radio station ownership, he started three publicly
traded companies that bought more than 70 small and mid-sized
stations. He kept large blocks of stock in each firm for himself
and then _ for huge fees _ served as the firms' investment banker,
financial adviser, corporate strategist, and even landlord.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was a deal shop,'' said Gary Stevens, one of the
nation's largest independent radio brokers, who was stung in an
early transaction with Sillerman, but later made millions selling
him stations. ``His real business was not operating (stations); it
was generating deals to take the fees.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was buying, Sillerman brushed aside complaints of
self-dealing by saying the arrangements had been properly disclosed
in Securities and Exchange Commission filings. Since selling his
radio properties at a tremendous profit, he has declared himself
vindicated and even former critics agree.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually everybody in the entertainment industry thinks
Sillerman is out to duplicate his radio success in live
entertainment. Everybody, that is, except Sillerman himself, who
asserted that he is running the company ``as if my now 5-year-old
daughter is going to be operating this business.''
</P>
<P>
   In his interview, Sillerman said he will soon announce a series
of new advertising deals, food concession arrangements, and
ticketing contracts that will show how SFX intends to pay off its
huge debt and make money, both without raising costs to the average
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   But industry veterans warn that there is a fundamental flaw in
his plan: his assumption that SFX will be able to keep any
additional money it makes. Unlike entertainment companies such as
Disney, which owns the movies and theme parks from which it
profits, SFX does not own the bands, theatrical shows, and monster
trucks that fill its venues. These groups once worked for
comparatively modest amounts, but that day is long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Sillerman's proposal to expand advertising, for
example, Irving Azoff, who manages the rock group The Eagles, said:
``If they're going to create new revenue sources, that's great. I'm
going to want 90 percent of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The moon rose high and the house hopped the night of Sillerman's
benefit concert in July. As Rod Stewart prepared for his last
number, his drummer stepped aside for a guest player _ Ron
Perelman. The song was ``We're Havin' a Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Sillerman said he thinks there will be a lot of parties as the
century draws to a close, and that that is good news for SFX.
``There is a general belief,'' he said, ``that the US is going to
be in a party atmosphere for the next two years, so a lot of
entertainers will be touring'' and playing SFX amphitheaters.
</P>
<P>
   Having spent $1 billion, he had better be right, according to
industry executives. If he's not, he may never again be as well-off
as he was that July night. Neither may America's rock and pop
concertgoers, who would have to endure the crumbling of the
entertainment empire he has built.

RUSSIANS LEARN ABOUT SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE USA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Small businesses in Russia are taxed so heavily
it stunts their growth, laws governing business are few, and
franchising is virtually unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   But the lack of rules gives hope to a group of visiting Russian
lawyers who are studying how the United States regulates small
businesses. They say they have the opportunity to create a legal
system that will help pioneering entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have few rules _ not enough, but your country has much
rules,'' said Elena Zhdanova, a lawyer who specializes in tax law
in Moscow. ``We have to find the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Organized by the Center for Citizen Initiatives, a San
Francisco-based organization that provides technical aid to Russia,
the program provided the 10-person delegation with fresh ideas on
how to help Russia with its arduous transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Substantially funded by the U.S. Information Agency, Citizen
Initiatives has brought more than 1,200 Russian business people to
the United States for training during the past three years. But
this delegation is considered the most likely to effect change in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The group was handpicked by Irina Khakamada, an official of the
newly created Ministry of Anti-monopoly Regulation and
Entrepreneurship Support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose is to bring young lawyers from all over Russia to
learn about U.S. legislation, and especially legislation for small
and medium-sized businesses,'' said Madina Bikboulatova, director
of the Center for Citizen Initiatives office in Dubna, Russia. ``We
need good lawyers to support and develop small business in
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   The group _ nine lawyers and the head of a women's business
advocacy group, ranging in age from 23 to 43 _ maintained a tight
schedule, traipsing between meetings with lawyers, business
agencies and state and local government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, small businesses account for just 7 percent of the
country's total gross domestic product, according to government
statistics reported last year. In contrast, U.S. small businesses
made up 51 percent of GDP in 1992, the most recent year for which
numbers were available.
</P>
<P>
   Irina Tchitakhova, a delegate from Rostov-on-Don, said it wasn't
that the Russian government didn't care about small business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government can see that small business is a priority,''
she said. ``The government believes (in) the economic benefits of
small business for renewing the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Tchitakhova said, political and economic instability in
the country have made it impossible for businesses to do the
necessary long-term planning.
</P>
<P>
   The visit ended Tuesday.

TEACHING TURKEY ESSENTIALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Ed note: Recipes at end))  
 By GREGORY ROBERTS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Rodgers approaches Thanksgiving as if he were Eisenhower
organizing the Allied invasion of Europe. That means planning,
planning and more planning.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Thanksgiving can be the home cook's version of
``The Longest Day.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rodgers, Thanksgiving Rule No. 1 is ``You can never have too
many lists.''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he lists a guest list, a grocery list, a prep
list, a utensil list, a tableware list and, last but not least, a
complete menu taped to the refrigerator door.
</P>
<P>
   He should know. In the past eight years, he's cooked more
Thanksgiving dinners than anyone's grandmother: upwards of 250.
Most of those were prepared in the ``Thanksgiving 101'' cooking
classes he's conducted across the country.
</P>
<P>
   He's collected his wisdom in ``Thanksgiving 101'' (Broadway
Books, 165 pages, $15), a cookbook devoted to Turkey Day and the
day after (there's a chapter on leftovers).
</P>
<P>
   From Sweet Potato and Peanut Soup to Cranberry Granita, Rodgers
leads the timid through the entire meal, with stops for such
all-American classics as Green Bean Bake, Jell-O Cream Cheese Mold
and PumpkinPie.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention turkey. Rodgers covers several different takes on
the big bird, though not with equal enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my taste, I prefer the flavor and appearance of a
perfectly roasted turkey,'' Rodgers said on a recent promotional
tour that brought him to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider the deep-fried turkey somewhat of an abomination.
No stuffing, no gravy _ that's two strikes against it right there.
It's actually more about cooking with testosterone than it is about
cooking with good sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The increasing popularity of such variant preparations of turkey
reflects a greater willingness by home cooks to experiment, Rodgers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are introducing more bold flavors into their
traditional dishes,'' he said. ``They're not afraid to add
jalape &UR; gftilde &LR; no peppers to Grandma's stuffing recipe if they
think it will taste good.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers' ``Thanksgiving 101'' recipes show he's not afraid to
break with tradition, at least when it comes to the trimmings. But
he knows his limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cook according to my personal tastes, but also with
practicality in mind,'' he said. ``How much food is going to be on
my table? How much storage space do I have in the refrigerator, or
reheating space in my oven?
</P>
<P>
   ``People leave out these huge hunks of good sense when preparing
this meal. These aren't details; they're essentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving is scary to people because it's been 364 days
since the last time they made it, and they forgot what they did
last year,'' he said. ``They don't want to believe that it's really
easy to make a delicious turkey. They overcook it, they defrost _ I
only buy fresh birds myself _ they use lousy aluminum-foil roasting
pans, they cook it without a meat thermometer and then they blame
the turkey when it's dry. It's not the turkey's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are recipes for a complete Thanksgiving dinner from
``Thanksgiving 101'' by Rick Rodgers (Broadway Books, 165 pages,
$15).
</P>
<P>
   Perfect Roast Turkey
</P>
<P>
   With Best-Ever Gravy
</P>
<P>
   1 18-pound fresh turkey (see note)
</P>
<P>
   12 cups (approx.) of your favorite stuffing
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly milled black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-one-half quarts homemade turkey stock or canned
reduced-sodium chicken broth, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   Melted unsalted butter, if needed
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup bourbon, port or dry sherry (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Position a rack in the lowest position of the oven, preheated to
325 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve the turkey neck and giblets to use in gravy or stock.
Rinse the turkey inside and out with cold water. Pat the turkey
skin dry. Turn the turkey on its breast. Loosely fill the neck
cavity with stuffing. Using a thin wooden or metal skewer, pin the
neck skin to the back. Fold the turkey's wings akimbo behind the
back or tie to the body with kitchen string. Loosely fill the large
body cavity with stuffing. Place any remaining stuffing in a
lightly buttered casserole, cover, and refrigerate to bake as a
side dish. Tie the drumsticks together with kitchen string.
</P>
<P>
   Place the turkey, breast side up, on a rack in the roasting pan.
Rub all over with the softened butter. Season with salt and pepper.
Tightly cover the breast area with aluminum foil. Place 2 cups of
the turkey stock into the bottom of the pan.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the turkey, basting all over every 30 minutes with the
juices on the bottom of the pan (lift up the foil to reach the
breast area), until a meat thermometer inserted in the meaty part
of the thigh (but not touching a bone) reads 180 degrees and the
stuffing is at least 160 degrees, about four-and-one-half hours.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the drippings evaporate, add stock to moisten, about
one-and-one-half cups at a time. Remove the foil during the last
hour to allow the breast skin to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the turkey to a large serving platter and let it stand
for at least 20 minutes before carving. Increase the oven
temperature to 350 degrees. Drizzle one-half cup turkey stock over
the stuffing in the casserole, cover and bake until heated through,
about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a
heatproof glass bowl or large measuring cup. Let stand for 5
minutes, then skim off and reserve the clear yellow fat that has
risen to the top. Measure three-quarters cup fat, adding melted
butter if needed. Add enough turkey stock to the skimmed drippings
to make 8 cups total.
</P>
<P>
   Place the roasting pan on two stove burners over low heat and
add the turkey fat. Whisk in the flour, scraping up the browned
bits on the bottom of the pan, and cook until lightly browned,
about 2 minutes. Whisk in the turkey stock and the optional
bourbon. Cook, whisking often, until the gravy has thickened and no
trace of raw flour taste remains, about 5 minutes. Transfer the
gravy to a warmed gravy boat.
</P>
<P>
   Carve the turkey and serve the gravy and the stuffing alongside.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 18 servings with about 7 cups gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Adapt recipe to size of bird, if larger or smaller
</P>
<P>
   Italian Stuffing With Sausage
</P>
<P>
   and Parmesan Cheese
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 medium celery ribs with leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 medium red bell peppers, cored, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound sweet or hot Italian sausage, casings removed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon crushed hot red pepper
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces day-old crusty Italian bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
(about 7 cups)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about 4 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half cups homemade turkey stock or canned
reduced-sodium chicken broth, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the
onion, celery, bell peppers and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until
softened, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage and cook, breaking up
the meat with a spoon, until it loses its pink color, 8 to 10
minutes. Stir in the basil, oregano, salt and crushed red pepper.
Transfer to a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add the bread and cheese and mix well. Stir in the butter, wine
and enough of the stock to moisten the dressing, about 1 cup. Use
to stuff the turkey, or place in a buttered baking dish, drizzle
with an additional one-half cup stock, cover and bake as a side
dish.
</P>
<P>
   Makes about 10 cups.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberry, Ginger
</P>
<P>
   and Lemon Chutney
</P>
<P>
   1 medium lemon
</P>
<P>
   1 12-ounce bag fresh or frozen cranberries
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup diced (one-quarter-inch) crystallized ginger (about
2.5 ounces). See note.
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup finely chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 cinnamon stick
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dry mustard
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Grate the yellow zest from the lemon. Using a small sharp paring
knife, cut away and discard the thick white pith. Cut the lemon
crosswise in half and pick out the seeds with the tip of the knife.
Dice the lemon into one-quarter-inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium non-reactive saucepan, combine the cranberries,
diced lemon and zest, sugar, ginger, onion, garlic, jalapeno,
cinnamon stick, mustard and salt. Bring to a boil over medium heat,
stirring often to help dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to low
and simmer until the sauce is thick and the cranberries have burst,
10 to 15 minutes. Cool completely. (The chutney can be prepared up
to 1 week ahead, covered tightly, and refrigerated.)
</P>
<P>
   Remove the cinnamon stick just before serving. Serve at room
temperature. Makes about 3 cups, or 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Crystallized ginger may be purchased in many supermarkets
and specialty food stores, or more cheaply at Asian markets.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Potato (Yam) and Peanut Soup
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium celery rib, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, crushed under a knife
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds sweet potatoes (yams), peeled and cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   Three-and-one-half cups homemade turkey or chicken stock, or
canned reduced-sodium chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half cups water
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup smooth peanut butter (not the ``natural'' kind)
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon freshly milled white pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons (approx.) heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
</P>
<P>
   In a Dutch oven or soup pot, melt the butter over medium heat.
Add the shallots, carrot, celery, jalapeno and garlic. Cover and
cook, stirring often, until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes.
Add the sweet potatoes, stock and 1{ cups water. Bring to a boil.
Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until the sweet
potatoes are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife, about 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In batches, transfer the soup to a blender and puree. Return the
pureed soup to the Dutch oven and stir in the peanut butter and
lime juice. Cook over low heat, stirring constantly, until very hot
but not simmering. Season with the salt and white pepper. (Soup can
be prepared up to two days ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated.
Reheat over low heat, stirring often.)
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to a warmed soup tureen. Ladle the soup into individual
soup bowls, drizzle each serving with heavy cream, and sprinkle
with the cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   Makes eight to 10 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Green Beans With Portobello Mushrooms and Bacon
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half pounds green beans, cut into 2-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   4 large portobello mushrooms (about 1 pound)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup finely chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces sliced smoked bacon (usually 1 slice equals 1 ounce)
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter teaspoon freshly milled black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high
heat. Add the green beans and return to the boil. Cook until
crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Drain and rinse under cold running
water. (The green beans can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. Pat the
green beans dry with paper towels. Roll up the green beans in a
double thickness of more paper towels, place in a large
self-sealing plastic bag and refrigerate.)
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the stem from each mushroom and slice crosswise into
one-half-inch-thick rounds. Using a teaspoon, scrape out the dark
brown gills from the underside of each mushroom cap and cut the
caps into one-quarter-inch-thick strips.
</P>
<P>
   In a 12-inch non-stick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil
over medium heat. Add the mushrooms stems and caps and cook,
stirring often, until lightly browned and tender, about 5 minutes.
Add the shallots and cook, stirring often, until the shallots
soften, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside. (The
mushrooms can be prepared up to 2 hours ahead, covered, and kept at
room temperature.)
</P>
<P>
   Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the skillet and tilt to
coat the pan. Add the bacon and cook over medium heat, turning
occasionally, until the bacon is crisp and brown, about 5 minutes.
Using a slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to drain. Leave
the bacon drippings in the skillet. When the bacon is cool,
coarsely chop and set aside. (The bacon can be prepared up to 2
hours ahead, covered, and kept at room temperature.)
</P>
<P>
   Place the skillet over medium heat and heat until the bacon
drippings sizzle. Add the green beans and mushrooms, cover, and
cook, stirring occasionally , until heated through, about 5
minutes. Stir in the bacon and season with the salt and pepper.
Transfer to a warmed serving dish and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes eight servings.
</P>
<P>
   Cranberry Granita
</P>
<P>
   4 cups water
</P>
<P>
   1 12-ounce bag fresh cranberries
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   Mint sprigs
</P>
<P>
   In a large non-reactive saucepan, bring 4 cups water, the
cranberries and sugar to a boil over high heat, stirring often to
dissolve the sugar. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for 10
minutes, or until all of the cranberries have burst. Pour into a
wire sieve placed over a bowl and drain well. Press gently on the
cranberries to extract as much juice as possible, but don't force
the solids through the sieve. Stir the lemon juice into the
cranberry liquid. Refrigerate, uncovered, until completely cooled,
about 2 hours.

   Meanwhile, place a metal 9-by-13-inch baking pan in the freezer
to chill.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the cranberry liquid into the chilled pan. Freeze until the
mixture freezes around the edges, about 1 hour, depending on your
freezer's temperature. Using a large metal spoon, mix the frozen
edges into the center (leave the spoon in the pan).
</P>
<P>
   Freeze again, repeating the stirring procedure about every 30
minutes, until the mixture is frozen into a slushy consistency, 2
to 3 hours total freezing time. Serve immediately in well-chilled
glasses, garnished with mint sprigs, or keep frozen until ready to
serve, or overnight. (If the granita freezes solid, allow it to
soften slightly in the refrigerator for about 10 minutes and try
stirring again. Or, break into large chunks and process in a food
processor until slushy and serve immediately.)
</P>
<P>
   Makes six to eight servings. To double, freeze the granita in
two pans.

Zarya module _ the first of several dozen scheduled to be assembled
in earth's orbit in the next several years _ is a milestone that
did not come easily. Russia's economic crisis forced delays in the

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of lives lost, certainly it was not on scale with TWA
Flight 800 and Swissair Flight 111. More than 200 people died in
each of those crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly
two-thirds of the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so
this crash is not only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from
Georgia to Maine to Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview
survivors of ASA Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files
of the National Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken
during the ensuing litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9 minutes and 20 seconds of
horror aboard that doomed aircraft as it fell to earth, the fire
that consumed the broken fuselage, as well as how the tragedy has
reshaped lives.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth day of the six-part series. WITH PHOTOS and
ILLUSTRATIONS.
</P>
<P>
   DAY 5
</P>
<P>
   CRASH-ATTENDANT _ Robin Fech had tried once to get back into an
airplane. But she made it only as far as the flight attendant's
jump seat near the door.
</P>
<P>
   She kept that door open _ and left through it when fear overcame
her.
</P>
<P>
   Her psychotherapist's plan was to slowly desensitize Fech to an
airplane so she could fly again. First she did nothing more than
park at the Macon airport to watch planes take off and land. Next
she walked into the terminal. The first time she moved onto the
tarmac, she cried.
</P>
<P>
   It was so unlike the person she had been, so full of sass and
moxie that she once explained her nature with the laugh line, ``I
don't get my panties in a wad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now each step toward recovery revived the terror. She couldn't
so much as use a curling iron without being reminded of the smell
of fire.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a month passed before Fech could step into an empty
Brasilia identical to the crash plane and stay awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, she did a necessary thing. She sat in each of the 30
seats. Closing her eyes, she tried to become the passengers who
fell from the sky with her.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to know what they had felt in the last nine minutes
and 20 seconds of Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529.

RUSSIAN ROCKET TO LAUNCH SPACE STATION'S FIRST COMPONENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid anticipation worldwide, the mammoth first component of the
U.S.-led international space station is poised for launch early
Friday from Central Asia aboard an unmanned Russian Proton rocket.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-story booster is scheduled to blast off from the Baikonur
Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:40 a.m. EST. The usually reliable,
three-stage Proton is powerful enough to place the 44,000-pound,
41-foot-long, ``Zarya,'' or ``Sunrise,'' control module into an
elliptical orbit varying from 115 miles to 220 miles high.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of discussing, planning and replanning, we're
about to launch hardware and embark on one of the most complex
engineering projects in human history,'' said Gretchen McClain,
NASA's deputy associate administrator for the project.
</P>
<P>
   The mission is high stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Zarya's launching is the culmination of a five-year effort to
fold the economically ailing Russians into a station partnership
that already included the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first of 45 launchings, three dozen by the United
States and the remainder by Russia, to fashion a permanently
staffed, seven-person orbiting laboratory that will span an area
equal to a pair of football fields stretched side by side. Dozens
of cargo launchings will also be required to complete the project
by mid-2004.
</P>
<P>
   Built by Russia's Krunichev State Research and Production Space
Center at a cost of $240 million to the United States, Zarya was
designed to furnish electrical power, propulsion and ground
communications during the earliest stages of assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Zarya to a launch accident or a serious malfunction
would set the project back a year while the Russians upgrade a
ground test version for flight, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space
station program manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not specifically addressed who would be responsible
for paying for the second (module),'' he said. ``The most important
thing is we do have a second control module that could be
launched.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced by the Russians in the mid-1960s to launch heavy
military payloads, the Proton rocket has more recently become a
commercial satellite launcher. With more than 200 successful
flights, the Proton is considered to have a reliability rating of
98 percent, according to the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   A forecast of subfreezing temperatures and overcast skies at
Baikonur is not a barrier to the launch as it would be to NASA's
space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Russian space agency officials offered final approval
for the Zarya mission earlier this week, allowing the 18-story
Proton to be transported by rail to its launching complex Monday.
The four-hour fuel-loading operation is scheduled for the final
stages of the countdown.
</P>
<P>
   Once launched, the Proton will take just over 9 1/2 minutes to
place Zarya in its initial orbit. The next several minutes will be
followed by the deployments of communications antennas aboard the
module as well as the unfurling of its two 35-foot-long solar
arrays for electrical power generation.
</P>
<P>
   During the following days, Zarya's propulsion system will raise
the module's altitude to 240 miles to prepare it for the arrival of
the station's second component.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. shuttle Endeavour is scheduled to blast off early Dec.
3 with a 36-foot-long, 25,600-pound module called Unity. The $350
million Unity is fashioned with a half-dozen docking ports. Once
joined to Zarya, the two modules will serve as the bridge between
future U.S. and Russian components.
</P>
<P>
   Following a rendezvous with Zarya, the Endeavour crew will use
the shuttle's robot arm to lift the second module from its cargo
bay and position it for mating with Unity. Astronauts will link the
two modules with power and data cables and establish a direct
communications link between the new station and NASA's Mission
Control Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The new station's third major component, the Russian-contributed
service module, has been delayed at least 15 months by Russia's
financial problems. U.S. and Russian officials are hopeful that a
recent $60 million payment from NASA will ensure its launch by
August.
</P>
<P>
   The service module will provide the living quarters for the
station's first resident crew of three in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've faced obstacles and we've gotten through each one of
those,'' McClain said. ``There is no doubt we will have challenges
in front of us, but with our strong partnership we will get through
them.''

CREWS DRESS FOR WALKS IN $10 MILLION OUTFITS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It will take the world's smallest spaceship, the
spacesuit, to build its largest, the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of U.S. astronauts will don the bulky $10 million
garments, which NASA calls the extravehicular mobility units, for
spacewalks during the more than six-year assembly period.
</P>
<P>
   Without the suit, the United States and its international
partners could not establish the electrical power, computer data
and communications links to the station's many large components.
</P>
<P>
   At 250 pounds, the stiff but flexible suits were developed by
NASA and its contractor, Hamilton Standard, to protect wearers
against the airless realm of space, temperatures that swing between
250 degrees above and below zero Fahrenheit, and impacts from small
micrometeoroids for up to 7 1/2 hours, while providing only the
most basic of amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Planners estimate that the construction of the space station
will require 1,705 hours of spacewalks. Responsible for about
one-third of that, the Russians will don similar garb developed in
their own country. The station's astronauts and cosmonauts also
will be trained to use one another's spacesuits as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. suit is of an early 1980s vintage, but has been
modified extensively for the tasks of assembling and maintaining
the space station.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is a marvel of synthetic fabrics and materials. Its
basic components include trousers, a top that fits over the upper
torso like a pullover sweater, boots, gloves and a helmet. Oxygen,
communications gear and equipment to monitor the physical health of
the astronaut are mounted in a backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Before climbing into the suit, the spacewalking astronaut will
pull on a set of long underwear laced with spaghetti-thin tubes
through which coolant flows.
</P>
<P>
   The trousers and upper garment are lined with an airtight,
urethane-coated nylon material that enables the suit to be
pressurized without leaking. Layered atop are fabrics of Dacron,
Neoprene-coated nylon, aluminized Mylar and a tough outer covering
of Teflon, Kevlar and Nomex, all for micrometeoroid protection.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. suit is so thoroughly designed for orbital spacewalks
that it could not be used to walk on the surface of the moon or
Mars. Its mobility comes from joints at the waist, shoulders and
elbows. The armor is so stiff that if a wearer fell over on the
moon or Mars, he would be unable to get up without help from a
colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Its basic amenities are a bag with 32-ounces of water that can
be sipped through a tube, a fruit bar sheathed in edible rice paper
and an absorbent diaper that will hold up to a quart of urine.
</P>
<P>
   The station spacewalks will be tightly choreographed around
specific tasks to ensure maximum productivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get as exhausted mentally as I do physically,'' said U.S.
astronaut Jerry Ross, who will participate in the station
assembly's first three spacewalks. Ross has logged four spacewalks
in five previous flights.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. suits have been enhanced in seven key areas to prepare
them for station work. Probably most important is the back-mounted
jet pack, which will allow the astronauts to propel themselves
through space, in the event that a lifeline is severed. In the
past, spacewalking astronauts have been tethered to the shuttle
during the walks. If the lifeline snapped, the shuttle would
maneuver to pick up the drifting astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   The station protocol will continue the use of tethers, but a
docked shuttle could not respond fast enough to a spacewalker whose
lifeline was severed.
</P>
<P>
   The garment has been modified so it can be stored aboard the
station, undergo minor repairs and be used 25 times before
requiring major overhauls on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts will be able to replace the spacesuits' electronic
displays and life-support elements aboard the station rather than
on the ground. New sizing features permit the arm and leg spans to
be adjusted to fit all but the tallest or shortest astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Electric heaters have been installed in the gloves and boots. In
frigid conditions, a spacewalker can shut off the flow of coolant
to his coldest extremities.
</P>
<P>
   The life-support system components that filter carbon dioxide
from the suit are metabolic rather than chemical. The change eases
servicing between spacewalks because the filter can be recycled by
heating it. The gloves have been extensively modified, as well, to
make the fingers more tactile. Nonetheless, the airtight gloves are
as cumbersome as working with oven mitts.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts who have worn them report that the Russian suits are
similar to the U.S. suits in many regards. The chief difference is
the way the suit is donned. The back of the one-piece Russian suit
swings open so the wearer can climb in or out.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian suit was not designed for extensive refurbishment.
When its major components wear out, the suit is thrown away. &QL;

SHOOTING FOR THE STARS: TIGHT BUDGET INSPIRES SOME CREATIVE
ENGINEERING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental spacecraft and research laboratory, the
international space station promises to be a little of both as it
zips around Earth at an altitude of 250 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But achieving the facility's full science and engineering
potential will take time. For one thing, the station will take at
least six years to build. For another, money once earmarked for
science has been channeled instead to cover construction costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, almost $500 million in research funds has
been reallocated by NASA to pay for overruns in hardware
development, caused primarily by Russia's financial problems. More
will be necessary as the United States attempts to shoulder
responsibilities that were Russia's before its economic crisis
worsened earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Once the station is assembled, however, NASA plans to spend $2.5
billion on research over a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what happens, I have to be patient and wait for the
infrastructure to develop,'' said Chuck Lloyd, the deputy manager
of NASA's space station payloads office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand I have to take a back seat,'' Lloyd said. ``But
the funny fact of the matter is that, in the end, I take the front
seat, and I stay in the front seat for a very long period of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a couple of intriguing engineering projects, well
outside the realm of traditional laboratory research, have moved to
the forefront, in part because of the station's tight budget. NASA
was forced to pursue them to stem the rising costs associated with
Russia's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Each project could play a key role in future human exploration
of the moon and Mars, goals well beyond the mission of the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   One is TransHab, an inflatable module that may become the living
quarters for up to a half dozen space station occupants and include
novel systems that recycle air and water for the crew. The second
is the X-38, a speedboat-shaped space glider, which NASA plans to
develop into a lifeboat that could bring as many as seven crew
members back to Earth in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   If successful on the station, TransHab could become the habitat
for future manned spacecraft dispatched to the moon or Mars. And
the X-38 may evolve into a crew transport vehicle to carry
explorers from Earth to a larger orbiting spacecraft destined for a
long journey to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``TransHab is basically a space inflatable habitat that could be
used for anything,'' said Donna Fender, who manages the development
project at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. ``You could use
it for the space station, to go to the moon or Mars, or wherever
anybody decides to go. Therefore, I can get a two-for-one or a
three-for-one in my agency money.''
</P>
<P>
   The version of TransHab proposed for the international space
station is 40 feet long and 25 feet in diameter. Nearly three times
as long as the aluminum module that NASA originally proposed,
TransHab would offer station crews a three-level habitat. One level
would be sleeping quarters, another a gymnasium and the third, a
large galley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can provide an environment for the crew that should keep
them very happy for an extended period of time,'' Fender said. ``If
you are going to be up there for a long duration, then I think it's
critical to keep your crews happy. If they are happy, you keep
their minds sharp and productive.''
</P>
<P>
   TransHab is set for launch in 2004 as one of the last components
of the space station, though the plans may change if funds
earmarked for TransHab engineering studies are reallocated to more
immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
   It is a miracle of synthetic fabrics and materials. When
launched, TransHab will be deflated, its outer fabric carefully
packed around its lightweight structural core.
</P>
<P>
   Once it arrives at the station, a shuttle crew will use the
ship's robot arm to lift the module from the cargo bay and attach
it to the orbital outpost. It will be inflated with breathable air.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the inside out, the module comprises three
envelopes of flexible but sturdy fabrics, each surrounding an air
bladder that prevents the inside atmosphere from leaking into the
vacuum of space. The bladders are surrounded by a layer of Kevlar
webbing, the material used in bulletproof vests. The outer layer is
a foot thick and is made primarily of Kevlar to protect the
enclosure from high-velocity micrometeors and man-made space
debris.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers have calculated that this fabric barrier could stop a
projectile of nearly an inch in diameter, traveling at more than
four miles a second. The barrier is designed to absorb the energy
of a projectile by breaking it into smaller pieces, then slowing
their advance.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency calculates that the odds of such a strike are
one every 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The fabric barrier will be surrounded by an additional layer of
insulation to protect the habitat from the wide swings in
temperature to which the station will be exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep stations will be strategically located within the module's
structural core. The astronauts would retreat to the sleep stations
to ride out solar storms with potentially lethal radiation.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's X-38 is undergoing its initial unmanned flight tests at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. The spaceship is patterned after
stubby experimental aircraft called ``lifting bodies,'' which were
tested by the Air Force and NASA in the 1950s and 1960s. The
gracefully curved shape of the underbody is designed to provide
lift in the absence of traditional wings, as the vehicle descends
through Earth's atmosphere from space.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's engineers propose that at least one seven-person version
of the spacecraft be docked at the new station in 2003. It would
replace the lifeboat duties performed until then by a three-person
Soyuz capsule.
</P>
<P>
   In case of fire, collision or a medical emergency, the station
crew would go into the rescue craft and undock. A propulsion module
would send the ship and its crew back through Earth's atmosphere
via an automated landing _ one that would not require manual
control by pilots aboard the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery scenario is designed to get the spacecraft to land
within two hours, at a location within an hour of a major medical
facility.
</P>
<P>
   After its re-entry, the spacecraft would deploy a large
rectangular parachute, called a parafoil, to slow and control its
landing. The ship is designed to land on a traditional runway or a
smooth unpaved surface.
</P>
<P>
   The most favored landing sites are in the southwestern United
States, Australia and North Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``High tech doesn't have to be expensive,'' said Brian Anderson,
NASA's X-38 manager. Limited to a $90 million development budget,
the X-38 engineering team has relied on combining existing flight
computers, guidance devices and lightweight structural materials to
fashion their creation rather than developing it from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The X-38 and its parafoil have passed their first drop tests, in
which the craft was released from beneath the wing of a high-flying
B-52 bomber to glide to a landing at Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   By early 2001, NASA expects to launch a test version of the
rescue craft in the cargo bay of the space shuttle. It will be
deployed unmanned to determine whether it can make an automated
re-entry and landing.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, the first of the rescue vehicles will be
docked to the space station. &QL;

THE GOLD LIFE LIVES ON FOR TARA LIPINSKI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tara Lipinski doesn't lead a normal life. Never
has, really. Probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   Got a problem with that?
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's your problem. Not hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Describe normal,'' Lipinski was saying Tuesday night, after
another workout on another rink in another city that isn't home.
``I think my life is very normal to me. I know in some ways it's
different or busier. But I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Being normal is more overrated than the supposed wonders and
deeper meaning of Woodstock. Anybody who puts a premium on being
one of the crowd either hasn't been 16 or has forgotten what it was
like to be that age. People these days have a hard time finding a
happy medium between leading a life of quiet desperation and
appearing on the Jerry Springer show. Lipinski dared not only to
have a dream, but to seeing it through to the end.
</P>
<P>
   At an age when a driver's license is a status symbol, Lipinski
has an Olympic gold medal. Lipinski is the youngest individual gold
medalist in the history of the Winter Olympics. People pay to watch
her do what she loves to do. What she did for free for years _ at a
high cost to her family.
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski is a professional figure skater now. There will be no
more anguishing waits for the long program scores at the world
championships. There will be no rematch between Lipinski and
Michelle Kwan at the 2002 games in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is off me,'' Lipinski said. ``I accomplished the
goal of my life. Now I just get to enjoy it and perform. And I'm
still competing, doing shows. It's nice to improve on my skating
and not have to worry about a title.''
</P>
<P>
   The gold-medal dress rehearsals began when Lipinski was 2.
Standing on a Tupperware container, little Tara would drape herself
in ribbons and dried flowers and soak in the cheers of her parents,
Jack and Pat. Tara began roller skating at 3, figure skating at 6.
She was so determined to see how far she could go, her parents
didn't have the heart to tell her no.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that meant Jack would have to live alone, just outside
of Houston, so that Tara and Pat could find the best possible
training environment. Now Tara can call Texas home again. She still
trains in Detroit, but it's different now. She has no Olympics to
consume either her mind or her time.
</P>
<P>
   Does she miss the agony and ecstasy of giving everything she has
to something, not knowing in advance whether it will be worth it?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Lipinski said emphatically. ``You can't get that back.
That's going to be the biggest thing I've ever accomplished. But I
have day-to-day goals.''
</P>
<P>
   So the quest of trying to become a better skater, a better
performer, isn't quite the same when there is no gold standard to
meet. So what? For every Lipinski, there are legions of people
whose shining moment in life is going to be playing on the high
school football team, or sinking the winning shot in a basketball
game nobody else remembers, or setting off the stink bomb that
caused the school to close for an entire afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tsk-tsk at the probability that Lipinski the adult will
never accomplish anything on a par with what she did as a
4-foot-10, 82-pound, 15-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performing is my favorite thing to do,'' Lipinski said. ``To
be here in front of all my fans and show them what I've worked so
hard for for a couple months. Just give them some enjoyment. They
came to see us, so you do the best you can for them.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski at her Olympic best was truly a sight to behold. Kwan
was in first place after the short program, and she left only the
narrowest of openings with a smooth, play-it-safe long routine.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote the following words on the day of the long program in
Nagano, Japan:
</P>
<P>
   ``What will unfold in the women's long program today at the
White Ring is only slightly more in doubt than the outcome of a
Cuban election. Kwan, 17, will win the gold medal, unless she
decides at the last moment to spend her entire four-minute program
doing nothing but figure-8s. Lipinski, 15, will have to settle for
the silver, even if she pulls off a quintuple-luzt, quadruple-axel,
triple-flip, double-martini combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipinski went for the gold with so much a combination of grace
and gusto, the judges had little choice but to do away with the
natural order of things. Before Lipinski literally sprinted off the
ice at the end of her routine, she screamed and thrust her hands
into the air triumphantly. An Olympic moment for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more pressure at a competition like that,''
Lipinski said. ``Here, it's more relaxed and fun and entertaining.
I've got the best of both worlds: I won and I had fun competing.
Now I'm doing shows and doing the other parts that are really
cool.''
</P>
<P>
   She got to visit the White House. She did the Jay Leno-David
Letterman-Rosie O'Donnell circuit. Why would she long to be normal?
Besides, Lipinski's decision to turn pro made it possible to live
under the same roof with her father again _ at least, when she's
not on tour.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly nine months have passed since Tara Lipinski struck gold.
And guess what? The thrill isn't gone, or even faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Lipinski said. ``I think it's going to be here
for the rest of my life. I think I'm still in shock from it. I
couldn't be happier than I am right now. Everything is twice as
good as I thought it would be.''

   HOUSTON _ When it comes to space stations, Russia's experience
is unmatched.
</P>
<P>
   It has launched 10, seven successfully, including Earth's first
in 1971. Mir, its most recent, has logged nearly 13 years in orbit,
despite a major collision, fire and other well-publicized problems
last year. The United States launched one, Skylab, which briefly
housed Apollo-era astronauts a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States embarked on plans to spearhead the
development of Earth's first international space station, it
elected to brush up on the topic by sending seven astronauts to Mir
for a series of visits. They logged nearly 1,000 days in orbit, the
last 812 of them consecutively.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's prowess with space stations, however, exists in the
shadow of its brief and chaotic track record with economic reform.
This discrepancy has imperiled the early development of the
U.S.-led international space station.
</P>
<P>
   In October, NASA won White House approval for a $1.2 billion
plan to reduce U.S. reliance on Russia, a fundamental change in the
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its other space-station partners _ Japan,
Europe and Canada _ are relying on Russia for the station's first
habitable component, the service module. Russia also is to launch a
parade of Progress supply capsules and produce the Soyuz lifeboat,
which will be able to whisk a station crew back to Earth in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets on the supply capsules will fire periodically to
keep the growing orbital complex circling Earth at safe altitudes
while Progress is docked to the station. The capsules also will
furnish fuel for thrusters on the service module that will perform
the same task when no Progress is docked.
</P>
<P>
   Even at altitudes of 250 miles, the new station will fly through
a thin region of Earth's atmosphere, creating a slight drag that
will cause the orbital laboratory to slowly sink. The propellant is
needed to counteract these forces.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a major financial jolt in Russia prompted a
$22.6 billion global bailout, chiefly through loans issued by the
International Monetary Fund. Within weeks, Russia was forced to
drastically devalue its currency against the U.S. dollar, further
weakening its ability to meet station commitments.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Russian government's wider attempt to impose new
fiscal restraints, it cut funding earmarked for the station this
year from $340 million to $160 million. The amount actually
disbursed by the central government to the Russian Space Agency,
however, was less than 15 percent of the reduced amount by summer's
end.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-summer, NASA administrator Dan Goldin had alerted
Congress that Russia appeared unable to complete work on the
service module in time to launch it as planned in April 1999. He
also warned that there was little work under way on the first of
the half dozen Progress cargo ships or the two Soyuz crew capsules
that the new station will need annually.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of the service module, intended to house the first
three-member crew that will staff the new station, was pushed from
April 1999 to July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the White House, Russia was not expelled from
the project, but NASA was forced to initiate new measures to cope
with Russia's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial was a proposal for direct cash payments
to the Russian Space Agency _ $60 million this year to keep the
service module's launch from sliding beyond July 1999 and another
$600 million over the next four years to improve the prospects for
the production of Progress and Soyuz launches.
</P>
<P>
   Additional hedges against Russia's problems include
modifications to the fuel lines of NASA's space shuttles. At a cost
of $90 million, the alterations will enable shuttles to handle
orbital boosting duties beginning in late 2000, if Progress
production in Russia falters.
</P>
<P>
   A second hedge was to initiate the fabrication of a U.S.
propulsion module that could be docked to the station in early 2002
and subsequently fueled by visiting space shuttles. Initial
estimates place the cost of the new module at $350 million.
</P>
<P>
   Additional U.S. shuttle-supply missions will cost another $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency also anticipates launching a U.S.-built
``interim control module'' carrying enough fuel to meet the new
station's propulsion needs for at least a year. It could be
launched any time after the service module goes up.
</P>
<P>
   None of the new measures, however, eliminates the need for the
Russian service module.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that the timely completion of this important
international project is at risk, should the shortage of Russian
funding continue,'' Goldin told lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin's warning to Congress was based in large part on an
assessment by a panel of experts assembled by NASA in late 1997 to
sort out cost and schedule threats to the project, for which the
United States, as well as Russia, was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The schedule uncertainty associated with Russian
implementation of joint partnership agreements is the major threat
to the international space station program,'' the study concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Chaired by aerospace consultant Jay Chabrow, the panel warned
that NASA's costs associated with the station's development were
likely to climb from $17.3 billion to $24.7 billion, largely
because of Russian delays and uncertainties over whether Russia
could provide critical hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants estimated that plans to complete assembly by
2004 could drag out for up to three more years. Lawmakers were not
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians have simply failed to follow through on their
funding commitments, and the Clinton administration brought the
Russians into the project for the wrong reasons, placed the
Russians in the critical path, and routinely let them off the hook
for their failures'' said U.S. Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.,
who chairs the House Science Committee and is a longtime backer of
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was invited to join the project as a major partner in
1993, two years after the breakup of the Soviet Union and a few
months after Russia signed the Missile Technology Control Regime, a
multinational agreement that restricts member nations from
exporting technologies that could be used to build nuclear
missiles. Clearly, there was concern in the United States that
Soviet arms not find their way into the wrong hands.
</P>
<P>
   The project's charter members _ the European Space Agency,
Japan, Canada and the United States _ struck their partnership in
1988, when the former Soviet Union still posed a military threat.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the alliance modified to include Russia was an
agreement that each member would contribute hardware and services
at its own expense. When possible, they agreed, members of the
partnership would barter away inequities instead of formally
exchanging funds.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Russia's previous space-station experience, the United
States remained the managing partner for the new enterprise because
of its much stronger economic footing.
</P>
<P>
   Through NASA, the United States will furnish the station's first
laboratory (a 28-foot-long research module), a crew habitation
compartment, an air lock, structural truss and connecting nodes,
power-generating solar arrays, as well as the shuttle assembly
flights, satellite communications, crew training, ground control, a
future seven-person rescue vehicle and the overall management.
</P>
<P>
   The European Space Agency, comprising 11 countries, has pledged
a 20-foot-long research module called Columbus. Europe plans to
install a 33-foot-long robotic arm on Russia's segment of the
station.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has pledged a 33-foot-long habitable laboratory called the
Japanese Experiment Module, along with a 15-foot-long porchlike
platform to hold external experiments. The platform will be
augmented with another robotic arm of just over 38 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Europe and Japan are developing unmanned supply capsules to
augment Russia's Progress ships. Neither will be ready for service
until 2003. A half dozen European supply crafts could boost as much
fuel as 16 Russian Progress capsules.
</P>
<P>
   Canada will make a modest but crucial contribution _ an advanced
version of the 50-foot-long robot arm that it developed to maneuver
large cargo flown by NASA's space shuttle. The device is essential
to the latter stages of construction and the periodic removal and
replacement of small electronics boxes during maintenance and
positioning of large experiments outside the station.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's robotic arm is designed to move along the structural
truss of the station in response to remote commands from the
astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's mission control in Houston is responsible for the ground
supervision of the complex, though in the early stages of
construction, it will exercise that authority through Russia's
control center in suburban Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia plan to alternate commanders once
the international station is staffed in January 2000. Russia's
command role may shrink if the country's role in the partnership
decreases because of economic worries. U.S. astronaut William
Shepherd will be the first commander.
</P>
<P>
   English is the station's official language, though the U.S. and
Russian crews likely will converse bilingually.
</P>
<P>
   When fully assembled, the international station will house seven
men and women.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Europe, Japan and Canada will furnish four
crew members under a flexible formula that will not mean there is
always one from each member country at any one time. Russia will
furnish three crew members.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for its many contributions, the United States has
access to nearly half the laboratory volume of the Japanese and
European science modules, and will get nearly 80 percent of the
electrical power apportioned for research. &QL;

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The world is my oyster on the half
shell
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Traveling here, there and yonder, I'm always on the lookout for
a decent place to eat. Along the way I've found a few.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Big Sur, Calif., try the cafe at the state park
headquarters. You'd think the speciality would be burgers and
fries. Instead, it's gourmet all the way. A couple of years ago
when I was there, the resident chef was a graduate of the CIA _
Culinary Institute of America, or something to that effect. For
sure, his secret recipes were to kill for.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Johannesburg, South Africa, the hotel _ I forget the name,
but it's the big one _ where I stayed in 1990 had an excellent
recipe for chicken-fried steak. I should know. I gave it to the
chef, faxed to me directly from my Cousin Booger back in Texas.
Until then, the speciality of the house was ox tail soup, along
with German and English dishes, not the best of combinations. I'm
not saying a good chicken-fried steak can change history. No doubt
Mandela would have been released from prison the very next month,
regardless.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Monaco, a sure thing at the outdoor cafe just outside the
Casino du Monte Carlo is a full plate of oysters on the half shell.
Excellent with a glass of the house white wine. The French onion
soup is superb as well. Take time to linger over cafe au lai and
check out the beautiful people. If you should happen to see Sean
Connery strolling by, pretend to ignore him. The waiter may think
you're somebody, too.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Japan, go with the sushi. Forget that it's raw fish. After
all, you like raw oysters, don't you. Squid is tasty. Octopus is a
bit chewy. Beware those little tables where you have to sit with
your legs folded under you, Indian style. After about five minutes,
you lose circulation in your lower extremities. Difficult for the
digestion.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Moscow, there are no good restaurants. Better you should
figure out a way to eat at Natasha's apartment. She's the ex-wife
of my friend Pavlik. When they were still married, I always stayed
with them. Natasha is half-Georgian on her mother's side, which is
something akin to being half-Italian. My heavens, that woman can
cook. She baked a type of cheese bread I've never found anywhere
else. That was back when she was a housewife. Nowadays, as a result
of the fall of Communism and her marriage falling apart, she has a
successful catering business. Good for her. She deserves it.

   _ In Italy, if there's such a thing as a bad meal, I couldn't
find it. I'm content to simply eat the spaghetti and then order a
dessert. Sometimes the desserts take half an hour to prepare;
that's how good they are. One that I'll always remember had a
freshly baked muffin as the centerpiece, encircled by fresh fruit,
syrupy sauces and Italian ice cream. Now that I think about it,
forget the spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Lufkin, Texas, my little hometown, you can't do any better
than the Let's Eat! Cafe, located just a couple of blocks behind
the newspaper office. It's the very soul of soul food. Sister
Sharon does the cooking. Meat dishes vary daily from roast beef to
smoldered pork chops to fried catfish. It's turnip greens or
collard greens, depending on whether it's Tuesday or Wednesday.
Yams are on the menu most every day. Comment heard from a fellow
diner who had been raised on soul food: ``This is so good it makes
you wanna slap your grandmaw.'' Best place I know _ in Europe or
Asia or wherever in the world _ for hot water cornbread. Makes me
wonder why I ever left home.

News Service for Thursday, Nov. 19:
</P>
<P>
   KOOLHAAS-ARCHITECTURE (Bordeaux, France) _ In the outskirts of
Bordeaux, Rem Koolhaas has designed a house for the millennium. It
is a space for facing the unknown: for risk, mystery, surprise and
suspense, a house where floors and walls disappear, and inside
merges with outside in a sparkling play of reflections. By Herbert
Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER-HEWITT (New York) _ The Cooper-Hewitt has just completed
a $20 million, four-year renovation that has expanded the museum,
added a Design Resource Center and shrunk many of the barriers that
have kept the museum from serving its purpose: showing the biggest
possible audience that utility, done well, can move your soul. By
Barbara Flanagan.
</P>
<P>
   NY-HOTEL-SPA (New York) _ The wellness biz is in strapping good
health and growing like a weed _ or, rather, a ginkgo tree. These
days, invoking the word ``spa,'' with all of its Rorschach
associations _ pampering, cleansing, oases, antitoxins and the leaf
of that stinky tree _ can add appeal to everything from shampoos
and sheets to forks and furniture and now the much-anticipated W, a
business hotel and spa to open in midtown on Dec. 1. By Julie
Iovine.

<P>
   NY-COP-CARS (New York) _ For all of their diversity, the
streetscapes of New York City can be boiled down to a few
representative elements: a yellow cab, a hot dog stand and a
steaming manhole cover. Throw in a light-blue and white police car
and the location is fixed beyond all doubt. Unfortunately, that
last component of the city's visual signature will soon go the way
of all things. One by one, the NYPD's familiar patrol cars,
Chevrolet Caprices painted white and a custom shade that the
department calls ``grabber blue,'' are being replaced by lily-white
Ford Crown Victorias. By 2000, when the transition is complete, New
York will be a little bit more like everywhere else. By Philip
Nobel.

   FALL-ANTIQUES-SHOW (New York) _ Miniseries and documentaries
have long extolled the immigrant experience in the United States.
But few if any scholars have addressed the connection between
immigration and America's aesthetic history. Luckily, until that
time, the Fall Antiques Show will have to do. Opening today at the
Seventh Regiment Armory here, this 20th annual exhibition of
America's top dealers in rustic antiques and folk art sheds new
light on a dim corner in the history of American decorative arts.
By Mitchell. Owens.

   NY-COOPS (New York) _ When you're president of a co-op board,
the complaints just come flooding in. ``It's always the little
stuff, like the complaint last week about a guy who goes out in the
hall every morning to get his paper _ wearing nothing but a cowboy
hat,'' said Sylvia Shapiro, board president, lawyer and author of

INITIATIVE WOULD OUTLAW GAY MARRIAGE IN CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL NESS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A measure that would outlaw same-sex marriage in
California will appear on the primary election ballot in 2000, an
issue that is certain to incite heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   The California Defense of Marriage Act qualified easily with
482,044 signatures declared valid out of the 677,512 submitted,
Secretary of State Bill Jones said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative, sponsored by Republican state Sen. Pete Knight
of Palmdale and organizations such as the Traditional Values
Coalition, would ban same-sex marriage and prohibit the state from
recognizing gay marriages performed legally in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for gay rights and other likely opponents of the
ballot measure face an uphill fight if votes in Hawaii and Alaska
are any indication. Two-thirds of the voters in both states passed
anti-gay-marriage measures on Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have shown that a majority of Californians oppose
legislation legalizing gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   The ballot initiative approved in Hawaii authorizes state
lawmakers to write a law prohibiting same-sex marriages, while
Alaskans voted a gay-marriage ban into their constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights groups promised to fight the measures in the court.

 &HT;    LOBBYISTS LAMENT LACK OF RESPECT
 &HT;    520&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the American League of Lobbyists, persuasion is
a way of life. Now the group faces a daunting task _ persuading the
public that lobbyists deserve respect.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of the professional group's 508 members, 62 percent
of respondents agreed that ``the lobbying profession is unfairly
maligned because of a general lack of public understanding.'' Five
percent disagreed, and the remaining 33 percent were either
uncertain or didn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the press reports ``fairly'' on lobbying or
lobbyists, 76 percent of the professional persuaders said ``no,''
and 19 percent said ``yes.'' The rest didn't respond.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the league's members _ mostly senior-level managers of
lobbying efforts at corporations, unions, associations or
multi-client ``contract'' shops _ have other consolations: 65
percent reported earning more than $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, any group, whether it's a business
association or organized labor, would tend to believe it's not
treated fairly,'' the league's president-elect, Kenneth Feltman,
said Wednesday. ``On the other hand, there's no doubt that many
contract lobbyists are irritated when the news media blithely
dismiss them as 'hired guns.' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the survey shows we have some additional educational
and outreach responsibility to work not just with Congress and the
administration, but with the media,'' said Feltman, who is
executive director of the Employers Council on Flexible
Compensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lobbying is good for America,'' said the survey's instigator,
Deanna Gelak, chief lobbyist for the 103,000-member Society for
Human Resource Management. ``The stereotypical picture of lobbyists
who spend most of their time schmoozing with legislators and giving
out campaign contributions is all wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When the league asked its members to identify the single factor
that ``most frequently changes the vote of a member of Congress,''
only 5 percent chose ``campaign contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   More popular choices were ``good information ...effectively
presented directly to the member of Congress'' (35 percent);
``grassroots'' lobbying by people from the member's constituency
(30 percent) and ``good information ...effectively presented to
staff'' (25 percent).
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the campaign contributions are related to
the ability to meet directly with members of Congress,'' said Larry
Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics,
a nonpartisan group in Washington that analyzes the role of money
in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to get into a congressman's office is to give him
a check with his campaign committee's name on it,'' Makinson said.
``It doesn't just get you access. It also gets you a sympathetic
ear.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that even though the lobbyists didn't stress the
usefulness of campaign contributions, half of them said they or
their clients have a political action committee (PAC), and 70
percent said they give contributions personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish everyone had a lobbyist, but the reality is not
everyone can afford one,'' Makinson said. ``Those with more money
can have more influence.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   However, contract lobbyist James Albertine said, ``Spending a
lot of money doesn't necessarily mean you're the most powerful
lobbying group.''
</P>
<P>
   He was backed up by Evelyn Dubrow, retired lobbyist for UNITE,
the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deny that when my union wants to get legislation
considered, it often goes first to members (of Congress whom) its
PAC has helped,'' Dubrow said. ``But I don't think money is the
most important thing to members of Congress. What they want most is
votes, so groups with members in their districts can find a way to
meet with them.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the art world's fervor over the traveling
Vincent van Gogh exhibition, it's easy to forget that the capital
has a wealth of other treasures to offer, including temporary
exhibitions rivaling the van Gogh show in quality.
</P>
<P>
   Hours spent in the iffy pursuit of van Gogh passes might better
be devoted to enjoying the National Gallery of Art's immense
permanent collection. Housed in two separate buildings on the
National Mall, it includes other van Gogh paintings among thousands
of works that span the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, one rare find is Leonardo da Vinci's ``Ginevra de'
Benci,'' the only painting by the famed Florentine artist in the
Western Hemisphere and one of only three portraits of women
(including Mona Lisa) painted by da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   Another gem, commanding its own room at the gallery, is Augustus
Saint-Gaudens' memorial to Gen. Robert Gould Shaw and the
Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the African-American unit that
inspired the Civil War movie ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   If your goal in Washington is not just van Gogh bragging rights,
but a memorable aesthetic experience, here are some other good
bets:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gifts to the Nation from Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney. Van
Gogh's 1989 ``Self-Portrait'' is a highlight of this donation from
one of the finest American private collections of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   While this exhibition is small _ only 16 paintings _ it is
replete with significant works by artists including Henri Matisse,
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, George
Bellows, Thomas Eakins, Edward Hopper, Henri Rousseau and James
McNeill Whistler. It is on view through Jan. 3 at the National
Gallery's East Building.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige. This exhibit at the
Phillips Collection in Northwest Washington brings together 62
Impressionist winter landscape paintings.
</P>
<P>
   On view through Jan. 3, it focuses on the ``snow effect'' works
of Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley and others.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Phillips Collection is a privately owned museum,
there is an admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whistler's ``Harmony in Blue and Gold: the Peacock Room.''
Once the dining room of a wealthy shipowner in London, Whistler's
only existing interior design has been reassembled in a permanent
display at the Freer Gallery of Art, also on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   A lattice of intricately carved gold shelving surrounds the
room, and rich green walls are accented by golden depictions of
peacocks. Oval lamps appear to grow from a ceiling of lush
blue-green patterns of peacock feathers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chuck Close. If ``so what?'' is the first thing you say after
glancing at this 80-painting retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden, then ``wow'' will almost certainly be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   At a distance, Close's monumental mug shots of his friends and
family look like unflattering eight-foot photographs. But closer
inspection reveals tiny strokes of acrylic on canvas, meticulously
applied in some cases with an airbrush, in others with the artist's
own fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Close's early photo-realistic style turned more abstract in
1988, when a blood vessel in his spinal column ruptured, leaving
him mostly paralyzed from the neck down. The faces of his later
subjects emerge from a colorful mosaic of circles, rectangles,
triangles and ovals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's working 100 years later (than van Gogh), and you can't
help but notice how his art is very expressionistic,'' Linda
Powell, the museum's director of education, said of Close. ``He
moved from photo-realism to a more expressionistic and vibrant
palette.'' The exhibition continues through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Philippe Halsman: a Retrospective. This show at the National
Portrait Gallery near the Mall trace-- the career of the longtime
Life magazine photographer. Among the approximately 80 vintage
prints from the 1930s through the 1970s are images of Albert
Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, and Salvador Dali that have become modern
icons. The exhibition continues through Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The museums don't end there. From other branches of the
Smithsonian Institution such as the National Museum of American Art
to private museums such as the Corcoran Gallery, interesting
collections abound in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Mary Combs said tourists need to give
themselves plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One technique families use is to split up,'' Combs said. ``The
ones who want to go to the National Gallery can go, and everybody
has a good day.''

   Among them, one rare find is Leonardo da Vinci's ``Ginevra de'
Benci,'' the only painting by the famed Florentine artist in the
Western Hemisphere and one of only three portraits of women
(including Mona Lisa) painted by da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   Another gem, commanding its own room at the gallery, is Augustus
Saint-Gaudens' memorial to Gen. Robert Gould Shaw and the
Massachusetts 54th Regiment, the African-American unit that
inspired the Civil War movie ``Glory.''
</P>
<P>
   If your goal in Washington is not just van Gogh bragging rights,
but a memorable aesthetic experience, here are some other good
bets:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gifts to the Nation from Mr. and Mrs. John Hay Whitney. Van
Gogh's 1989 ``Self-Portrait'' is a highlight of this donation from
one of the finest American private collections of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   While this exhibition is small _ only 16 paintings _ it is
replete with significant works by artists including Henri Matisse,
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Georges Braque, Raoul Dufy, George
Bellows, Thomas Eakins, Edward Hopper, Henri Rousseau and James
McNeill Whistler. It is on view through Jan. 3 at the National
Gallery's East Building.
</P>
<P>
   _ Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige. This exhibit at the
Phillips Collection in Northwest Washington brings together 62
Impressionist winter landscape paintings.
</P>
<P>
   On view through Jan. 3, it focuses on the ``snow effect'' works
of Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro and Alfred Sisley and others.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Phillips Collection is a privately owned museum,
there is an admission charge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whistler's ``Harmony in Blue and Gold: the Peacock Room.''
Once the dining room of a wealthy shipowner in London, Whistler's
only existing interior design has been reassembled in a permanent
display at the Freer Gallery of Art, also on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   A lattice of intricately carved gold shelving surrounds the
room, and rich green walls are accented by golden depictions of
peacocks. Oval lamps appear to grow from a ceiling of lush
blue-green patterns of peacock feathers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chuck Close. If ``so what?'' is the first thing you say after
glancing at this 80-painting retrospective at the Hirshhorn Museum
and Sculpture Garden, then ``wow'' will almost certainly be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   At a distance, Close's monumental mug shots of his friends and
family look like unflattering eight-foot photographs. But closer
inspection reveals tiny strokes of acrylic on canvas, meticulously
applied in some cases with an airbrush, in others with the artist's
own fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Close's early photo-realistic style turned more abstract in
1988, when a blood vessel in his spinal column ruptured, leaving
him mostly paralyzed from the neck down. The faces of his later
subjects emerge from a colorful mosaic of circles, rectangles,
triangles and ovals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's working 100 years later (than van Gogh), and you can't
help but notice how his art is very expressionistic,'' Linda
Powell, the museum's director of education, said of Close. ``He
moved from photo-realism to a more expressionistic and vibrant
palette.'' The exhibition continues through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   _ Philippe Halsman: a Retrospective. This show at the National
Portrait Gallery near the Mall trace-- the career of the longtime
Life magazine photographer. Among the approximately 80 vintage
prints from the 1930s through the 1970s are images of Albert
Einstein, Marilyn Monroe, and Salvador Dali that have become modern
icons. The exhibition continues through Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The museums don't end there. From other branches of the
Smithsonian Institution such as the National Museum of American Art
to private museums such as the Corcoran Gallery, interesting
collections abound in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   Smithsonian spokeswoman Mary Combs said tourists need to give
themselves plenty of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``One technique families use is to split up,'' Combs said. ``The
ones who want to go to the National Gallery can go, and everybody
has a good day.''

   WASHINGTON _ In the art world's fervor over the traveling
Vincent van Gogh exhibition, it's easy to forget that the capital
has a wealth of other treasures to offer, including temporary
exhibitions rivaling the van Gogh show in quality.
</P>
<P>
   Hours spent in the iffy pursuit of van Gogh passes might better
be devoted to enjoying the National Gallery of Art's immense
permanent collection. Housed in two separate buildings on the
National Mall, it includes other van Gogh paintings among thousands
of works that span the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, one rare find is Leonardo da Vinci's ``Ginevra de'
Benci,'' the only painting by the famed Florentine artist in the

 UNDATED: ... commercially funded.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the old question, said Jay Katz, a Yale University
professor emeritus of law, medicine, and psychiatry: ``Who should
then guard over the guardians?''
</P>
<P>
   That same question might be asked of the short-staffed federal
agency charged with watching over thousands of local boards.
</P>
<P>
   The Office for Protection from Research Risks is part of the
National Institutes of Health, the federal agency that has both
funded and conducted some of the psychiatric research that has
prompted the renewed calls for special protections for the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much self-interest,'' said Katz, adding that he
believes that the office, known as OPRR, should be independent of
the agency financing most of the research. Katz served on the 1972
federal panel that examined the Tuskegee study.
</P>
<P>
   OPRR has investigated only a handful of the more than two dozen
federally funded institutions that have conducted psychiatric
``challenge'' or ``withdrawal'' studies over the last 25 years.
These were studies in which mentally ill patients were either
pushed towards psychosis with amphetamines or other powerful
stimulants or deprived of their medication to examine the return of
psychotic symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   When the agency does find problems, it has no authority to fine
or discipline, only to call for changes so that the institution
complies with its main oversight tool _ the ``assurance'' document,
an upfront promise by the institution that it will abide by federal
research regulations.
</P>
<P>
   At a congressional hearing in June, Gary B. Ellis, director of
OPRR, defended his agency and the local review boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the possibility of a catastrophic failure in human
judgment running through six or more layers? I would characterize
that possibility as `slight,''' testified Ellis, who did not return
several phone messages requesting an interview.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Stronger voice urged
</P>
<P>
   for the mentally ill &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most apparent conflicts, however, are those that exist among
researchers and within the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill,
an organization made up of mentally ill and their family members.
NAMI has come under fire from other mental health groups for
failing to speak out strongly enough for people with mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia-based nonprofit organization gets more than $3
million annually from pharmaceutical companies for various
purposes, and its research arm has even been funding at least one
ongoing schizophrenia challenge study.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Flynn, NAMI's executive director, said she did not know
that the NAMI Research Institute was funding a challenge study
until the Globe brought it to the attention of another NAMI
official, Wesley Alcorn, national president of the organization's
consumer council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are troubled by these studies. We need to understand much
more about the justification for them,'' Flynn said. ``It seems to
us that they are high-risk studies and we do not want to expose
people to this kind of challenge if there is another way to move
science forward.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that NAMI has set up different foundations to accept
industry donations to avoid having the main organization be
influenced by pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the main organization has a foundation to fight
stigmatization of the mentally ill, which receives $3.2 million
annually from nine pharmaceutical companies, Flynn said. But NAMI
itself gets less than 10 percent of its annual $4.2 million budget
from private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn is on the presidential bioethics commission as a
representative of the mentally ill. Although Flynn said she
supports research protections, last month she urged fellow
commissioners not to proceed with a recommendation that, she
believes, would categorize routine procedures as risky. Such
restrictions would deter research.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn, who has been diagnosed with mental illness, expressed
outrage that NAMI funded challenge studies and said the voice of
mentally ill patients has been minimized within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a leading schizophrenia
researcher and director of the NAMI Research Institute in Bethesda,
Md., blasted Alcorn in a letter he sent to NAMI officials, calling
him ``grandiose and clearly experiencing a recurrence of some
symptoms of your illness,'' and accusing him of ``fear mongering.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn had organized opposition to Torrey's Treatment Advocacy
Center, an Arlington, Va., organization started with NAMI funding,
which he said supported involuntary commitment of the mentally ill
and forced medication. Torrey has long been seen as a friend and
powerful advocate for the mentally ill, which made his letter to
Alcorn all the more disheartening to Alcorn and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   For other people who have been diagnosed with mental illness,
the attitude of such scientists is a major reason they want special
research protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are people being subjected to research with the potential of
being beneficial to them? Or are they being asked by researchers to
participate as useful guinea pigs?'' asked Judi &UR;  &LR; Chamberlin, an
associate with the National Empowerment Center, a mental health
advocacy group based in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should you participate in a study for the advancement of
someone's career?'' Chamberlin said.
</P>
<P>
   For some scientists, however, medical research is not a choice
for the mentally ill, but an obligation, to advance medical
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``All persons living in society have a moral responsibility to
participate in efforts to promote and contribute to the present and
future welfare of that society. Research is one of those
obligations,'' says a statement of principles by the American
College of Neuropsychopharmacology, which consists of psychiatrists
and scientists whose work focuses on the neurobiological bases of
psychiatric illness.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's 1998 statement on ethical conduct in research
also says that ``in certain studies, it is possible to deceive the
subject concerning the nature of the experimental interventions if
such deception does not alter objective risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakley Ray, the college's executive secretary and a Vanderbilt
University professor of psychology, psychiatry, and pharmacology,
acknowledged that some members have ``disagreed vehemently'' about
deception in research and that the statement is currently up for
revision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those situations that needs to be continually
updated,'' said Ray, whose group has weighed in against restricting
psychiatric research, saying it is ``likely to paralyze'' the quest
for knowledge and treatment of mental illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But James Childress, a University of Virginia professor and
member of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, said that
rather than paralyzing research or stigmatizing people with mental
illness, special protections will help restore people's faith.
</P>
<P>
   Research, he said, ``can't go forward unless there's confidence
on the part of potential subjects and their families that important
rules and guidelines are protecting subjects' rights and
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the commission has neither looked for nor found
widespread abuse in psychiatric research, there are enough problems
to demand change, Childress said.
</P>
<P>
   For George Annas, chairman of Boston University's health law
department and a consultant to the 1970s commission that first
called for special protections for the mentally ill, the time for
minimizing the possibility of doing harm to one more vulnerable
class of people is long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that research is important, but not at the
expense of patients,'' Annas said. ``Some things you have to do to
protect people.''

<P>
   However, the financial pressures and opportunities have been
known to lead physicians astray. A criminal case in Georgia
revealed just how far.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Borison and Bruce Diamond were longtime favorites of
pharmaceutical companies developing schizophrenia drugs. Borison,
48, chairman of the psychiatry department at the Medical College of
Georgia in Augusta, and Diamond, 53, a pharmacologist on the
school's faculty, had demonstrated time and again a knack for
bringing psychotic patients quickly into trials funded by drug
companies. Eli Lilly, Janssen, Zeneca, Novartis _ they all came
knocking.
</P>
<P>
   As faculty, Borison and Diamond were supposed to get approval
from the medical school for their research. Drug-company payments
for clinical trials were supposed to be sent to the school. But
according to Georgia state authorities, who indicted the pair in
early 1997, they began in 1989 to have the companies send payments
directly to them. They opened an office across the street from the
medical school, used a commercial service to do ethical reviews of
their studies, and placed their staff on the school's payroll while
keeping all the research funding for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   From 1989 to 1996, Borison and Diamond made over $10 million
from drug trials, including more than $4 million from schizophrenia
drugs, according to the indictment and sworn testimony from their
staff during an investigation by the Augusta Veterans Affairs
Hospital, where Borison was chief of psychiatry. Witnesses said the
two researchers focused on getting patients into the studies and
paid minimal attention to their care.
</P>
<P>
   To recruit the mostly male patients, they hired attractive young
women, who later testified that they were paid bonuses that ran
into the thousands of dollars. According to testimony, one staffer
was given a Honda Accord for coaxing schizophrenia patients into
trials.
</P>
<P>
   To earn these rewards, workers phoned and later met mentally ill
patients who were stable and living in the community and offered
them $150 to check themselves into the VA hospital so they could be
in a study. Patients already in locked wards were offered
cigarettes for agreeing to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a possibility that you are going to get a car,
you're going to do whatever you can,'' study coordinator Angela
Touhey told VA investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Touhey and the other study coordinators, many of whom had no
medical training, determined whether a patient belonged in a study.
According to an FDA investigation, untrained staff drew blood
samples and adjusted doses of the experimental drugs. Touhey said
Borison and Diamond hardly saw patients during the trials. At one
weekly meeting, Touhey said Diamond told the staff they weren't
interested in hearing about the patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bruce told me, `We don't care about how the patients are
doing. We just want to know how many people you have enrolled in
the past week or couple of weeks,''' Touhey said.
</P>
<P>
   The two researchers lived high, according to Georgia
authorities. They tucked away more than $5 million in cash and
securities, drove Mercedes-Benz cars, and dropped more than
$400,000 on antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Borison bought medieval tournament armor from Sotheby's auction
house in New York, and mahogany-paneled doors in London, for an
11,000-square-foot castle that he was planning to build. The
indictment charged that they bribed a staff member, Terri Davis, to
keep quiet after a schizophrenia patient in an olanzapine trial
attempted suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing was very dirty,'' Dr. David Hess, chief of
neurology at the VA, told the hospital's investigators. ``It was
basically a numbers game. These patients are purely used for the
greed of the researchers. That was very apparent to me what was
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond and Borison are now behind bars. In December, 1997,
Diamond pleaded guilty to theft and bribery charges and was
sentenced to five years in prison, fined $125,000, and ordered to
pay $1.1 million to the college.
</P>
<P>
   After one week of testimony at his trial in October, Borison
pleaded guilty to theft and a racketeering charge. He was sentenced
to 15 years in prison, fined $125,000, and ordered to pay $4.26
million to the college.

Researcher caught

<P>
   falsifying records
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice received
allegations that Dr. Faruk Abuzzahab was endangering the welfare of
patients in his general psychiatric practice, it hired Dr. Morris
Goldman of the University of Chicago to investigate. One of the
first things he discovered was that Abuzzahab was fudging records
in order to put patients into lucrative drug studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have the patient's diagnosis called one thing in the
regular chart, and then the person would be put on a drug study and
the person's diagnosis would be called something else to fit the
criteria,'' Goldman said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In July, after Abuzzahab admitted to the board that he had
entered ``disturbed and vulnerable'' patients into drug studies
even though they didn't meet eligibility criteria, and had ``kept
them in the study after their conditions deteriorated,'' the
medical board suspended his license.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Abuzzahab admitted that he cycled one woman
with paranoid schizophrenia through three drug trials from 1991 to
1994, despite the fact that she did poorly on the experimental
drugs and complained of being a guinea pig. Eventually she became
catatonic and incontinent; she was then given standard therapies
and responded well.
</P>
<P>
   In another instance, the psychiatrist took a woman off
clozapine, a newly approved drug that had led her to make a
remarkable recovery, and enrolled her in a drug trial. The woman
had previously spent 13 years as an inpatient at a psychiatric
institution, but while on clozapine she had been able to go into
the community and even hold a job. One day she approached Abuzzahab
with questions about clozapine's side effects; he immediately
stopped the drug that had helped her so much and put her into an
olanzapine trial. She deteriorated until she found her way to
another physician, who put her back on clozapine.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state medical board, Susan Endersbe was another
patient whom Abuzzahab ``recklessly'' entered into a clinical
trial. The doctor, the medical board noted, entered her into the
trial the first day he met her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a key flaw in this whole thing is the financial
gain,'' said Edward Endersbe. ``I am not a communist, but it is
really disturbing to see how much this is driven by financial gain,
and that it can, and does, such harm. There is no question in my
mind that that is what happened with my sister. My sister very much
wanted to live and to be a survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Incentives encourage
</P>
<P>
   aggressive recruiting
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abuzzahab and Borison can be dismissed as isolated ``bad
apples'' who unfairly tarnish the image of all researchers who
conduct schizophrenia drug trials. But the economic incentives they
pursued so eagerly are in play in all commercial drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Angela Bowen, president of the Western Institutional Review
Board, a commercial ethics review service, said researchers are
becoming more aggressive in their use of advertising to recruit
patients into schizophrenia studies. Research centers that don't
have any ongoing studies have even submitted advertisements for IRB
approval seeking depressed and schizophrenic patients who would
consent to being withdrawn from their medications, she said. The
researchers apparently wanted to develop a pool of mentally ill
people, already off standard therapies, who could be quickly
enrolled once new drug contracts are secured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, of course, don't approve those ads,'' Bowen said. ``It
boggles the mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Aggressive recruitment of schizophrenic patients is problematic
because participating in drug trials exposes them to the risk of
relapse and suffering. To determine whether a drug can curb
psychosis, it must be tested in people who are actively psychotic.
That scientific standard, which is endorsed by the FDA, leads
straight into an ethical minefield.
</P>
<P>
   One approach is for researchers to seek people who are already
actively sick, either because they have stopped taking medication
on their own or because the symptoms aren't being adequately
controlled by medication. But many of these patients suffer from
``disorganized thoughts'' and some degree of psychosis, making it
questionable whether they can give meaningful informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   Another route is to seek stable patients who are on medication.
These patients, however, must be hospitalized and their medications
stopped in order for them to take part, with the expectation that
their delusions and hallucinations will return. The patients must
become sick again to be useful subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't take people who have reestablished active
disease, then you don't know what you are looking at'' when you
test the drug, said Robert Temple, associate director for medical
policy at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ``That
is why you have to have a washout. And once you realize that you
have to do medication withdrawal, you have already gone into what
people are worried about, and that is giving a relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Temple said the profession has not ``reached the conclusion
that allowing people to withdraw (from medication) is dangerous to
them, if they are closely monitored and well informed.''
</P>
<P>
   If patients become too ill when their regular drug is stopped,
researchers may shorten the washout period. They then enter the
active part of the study and either receive the experimental drug,
a standard drug (usually Haldol), or an inactive placebo.
Researchers will also use ``rescue medications'' if the patients
deteriorate too rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do not have to become dramatically, floridly more
psychotic in order to be ready to go into the study,'' said Nina
Schooler, director of psychiatry research at Hillside Hospital, a
division of Long Island Jewish Health System in Queens. ``We are
not talking about requiring dramatic psychotic relapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the essence of the process is to let the patients become
sicker.

 &HT;    TYLER ULM'S FAMILY DEALT WITH A DISEASE THEY HAD NEVER HEARD OF
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tyler Ulm's 3-year-old body is covered with bright red patches
of raised skin. Every toe on his left foot has been amputated. His
right knee, stripped of its original muscle, is so weak and stiff
that he drags the leg when he walks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Tyler's parents, his infirmities are miracles, his
never-ending physical therapy a joy. They realize how lucky he is
to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Tyler contracted meningococcemia, an uncommon and brutal
disease that kills up to 60 percent of its victims. What seemed
like the stomach flu in the afternoon began destroying his skin and
muscles by nightfall. His hold on life grew so shaky that a
hospital chaplain twice prepared Tyler's parents for the worst.
</P>
<P>
   The boy fought off the disease in three days. The work to repair
its damage may last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be dealing with this the rest of his life one way or the
other, whether it be physical or emotional,' said his father,
Dayton, Ohio resident Jamie Ulm.
</P>
<P>
   Meningococcemia is an especially pernicious disease because it
begins innocently. By the time anyone realizes what's happening, it
can be too late. That is almost what happened to Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   On May 23, at the end of a long stay with relatives in
Cincinnati, the boy developed a high fever and began vomiting. His
parents say they took him to Children's Hospital Medical Center in
Cincinnati and were assured that he simply had the flu.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 p.m., small red spots broke out on Tyler's body. They
looked like chicken pox, hardly an alarming disease for a child.
Tyler's parents put him to bed without worry.
</P>
<P>
   But later that night, about 1:30 a.m., Tyler's mother checked on
him. What she saw made her breath catch in her throat.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's lower legs had become a mass of dark purple bruises.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Mark McGwire had taken his baseball bat and was
practicing his home-run swing on (Tyler's) legs,' recalled Jamie
Ulm.
</P>
<P>
   It was awful. My mom and dad both said that if they weren't
there that night, they would have swore that we beat him.'
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to them, meningococcemia had reached its end game.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is similar to meningitis, but it attacks the
bloodstream instead of the tissue covering the brain. Both
conditions are caused by bacteria that reside in the throat and
nasal passages of a small portion of the population.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria can be spread by close, prolonged contact. Most of
the time it doesn't cause any problems, but for reasons no one
understands, it occasionally becomes a monster.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Brilli, a Children's Hospital physician who is
conducting a national study of the disease, said meningococcemia
annually strikes 2,000 to 3,000 Americans, most of them children
(Ohio health statistics do not separate meningococcemia from
meningitis). Various studies put its fatality rate at 20 to 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   It begins with flu-like symptoms: fever, nausea, a stiff neck,
severe headaches and drowsiness. It quickly grows much worse.
</P>
<P>
   The disease chews up the lining of veins and arteries, causing
blood clots. The surrounding tissue is starved of oxygen and begins
to die. That is what caused the horrific bruises on Tyler's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Ulm called Children's Hospital when he saw the marks, and
45 minutes later, Tyler was in its intensive care unit. Doctors
gave him antibiotics to kill the bacteria and drugs to make his
heart beat stronger. They put him on a respirator to support his
lungs and force oxygen to his starving tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's life was in doubt for the first two days. But at last,
doctors stopped the bacteria's attack.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler then went to Cincinnati's Shriners Hospital for Crippled
Children. The hospital specializes in burn victims, and Tyler had
lost so much tissue that he was treated as if he had been in a
fire.
</P>
<P>
   He endured a dozen surgeries in less than two months. Surgeons
excised the dead tissue, amputating his left toes, cutting away
large muscles in his legs and removing smaller ones in his arms.
They took a muscle from his belly to support his right knee. They
performed numerous skin grafts, turning Tyler's small body into a
scarlet patchwork.
</P>
<P>
   They also put Tyler in a pressure suit - essentially, a
neck-to-ankle Ace bandage that prevents scarring. He wears it 23
hours a day, shedding it onlyto take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ordeal, the boy was an ideal patient.
</P>
<P>
   Kids do great with everything,' said Dr. Glenn Warden, chief of
staff at Shriners. People say, Gee, I feel sorry for these kids,'
(but) kids are perfectly wonderful ... much better than adults.'
</P>
<P>
   By early September, the doctors had finished their repair work.
Tyler came home to Dayton and plunged into a five-day-a-week
rehabilitation at The Children's Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Physical therapist Dorie Marek started one recent session by
putting Tyler on his back and stretching his legs. She was trying
to increase the flexibility of both muscle and skin.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's reconstructed right leg is so weak and stiff that he
doesn't like to put any weight on it, so Marek has devised drills
that force him to do so, from walking up stairs to kicking a soccer
ball with his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have told the family that Tyler's rehabilitation could
last until he is 21 or beyond. As he grows, his many skin grafts
could split, or his muscles could stiffen again. He may even lose
that stubborn right leg - Jamie Ulm said it doesn't seem to be
growing properly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no doubt Tyler is fortunate. Warden said other
children who have faced meningococcemia ended up losing several
limbs. And Tyler shows no sign thus far of the learning
disabilities and psychological disorders many young survivors of
this disease develop.
</P>
<P>
   For a child who has withstood so much, Tyler seems as normal as
can be. He loves race cars, Nintendo, soda pop, cookies and
irritating his younger sister. His parents hope to start him in
preschool before the year is over.
</P>
<P>
   As Tyler settles into his dramatically altered life, Jamie Ulm
said he wants other parents to be aware of the warning signs no one
detected in his son's case.
</P>
<P>
   If we could just get one family to catch this early, that would
be more satisfaction than somebody dumping a pickup full of $100
bills in our front yard,' he said.

<P>
   Moreover, critics say that the administration of
symptom-inducing drugs is only part of the harm. Patients in these
studies are typically taken off their medication first and may not
receive effective treatment for days and even weeks, exposing them
to an extended period of psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   A chilling example of this was detailed by University of
Maryland researcher Carol Tamminga and colleagues in a 1995 article
on their first ketamine experiment. One of their subjects was a
29-year-old man who at the start of the experiment was described as
doing well on his medication. His medication was stopped and he was
injected three times with ketamine, which caused him to become
``floridly delusional.'' The researchers allowed his disease to
progress even after the ketamine study ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``During a later drug-free period unrelated to this study, his
clinical symptoms were that of paranoid schizophrenia,'' Tamminga
wrote. ``There were similarities between his disease symptoms and
those induced by ketamine.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with whatever harm such experiments cause, critics say
that they necessarily violate the trust between doctor and patient
that is vital to the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the patients have any idea about what is being done to
them, they know that they are being used as guinea pigs,'' said Dr.
Peter Breggin, director of the Center for the Study of Psychiatry
and Psychology in Bethesda and an outspoken critic of mainstream
psychiatry. ``If they are mentally unbalanced, and their condition
is worsened by doctors for the purpose of serving the doctors'
scientific careers, of course that is going to make it harder for
them to trust anyone again.''
</P>
<P>
   The voices that are hardest to find are those that matter the
most: the mentally ill patients who have been the subjects of these
symptom-exacerbation experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, however, the mother of one patient stepped forward to
tell the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, a presidential
panel that advises the government on ethical issues in biomedical
research, what happened to her mentally ill daughter after she
apparently was given multiple doses of intravenous amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1987, Janice and Carl Becker brought their daughter
Laura, 26 at the time and ill with schizophrenia, to the Maryland
Psychiatric Research Center, outside Baltimore. Researchers
emphasized that she would get excellent care while on the ward,
Janice told the commission.
</P>
<P>
   A few months after Laura was admitted, researchers stopped her
medications as part of a research protocol, and her condition
quickly deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Twice when her mother visited, she found Laura bound with sheets
to a chair, the knots so tight around her wrists and ankles that it
took 20 minutes to free her.
</P>
<P>
   Laura's appearance changed. She lost 40 pounds. She would pace
for hours on end. Alarmed and getting no answers from the staff,
her parents pored through protocols, and found one describing an
amphetamine study. They concluded that the amphetamine explained
many aspects of her deterioration: her weight loss, the hyperactive
behavior, the increased psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   Laura's parents never got a copy of any consent forms Laura may
have signed and, to this day, do not know for sure whether their
daughter signed the form for the amphetamine study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heartbreaking to watch Laura's condition deteriorate,''
Janice told the commission. ``We had not expected that she would be
required to endure such painful symptoms without medication for
years. Nor had we expected that she would be given drugs that would
make her psychotic symptoms worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Laura is on her own, taking medication for her illness,
living in a group home and holding a job. But her mother believes
that Laura's story shows that the researchers put science first and
patient care second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The physician's creed of `do no harm' does not apply to
research physicians,'' Janice said from the kitchen of her rural
Maryland home. ``I was wrong to trust that my daughter would be
protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Hart, a spokesman for the University of Maryland, said,
``Because there are issues of patient confidentiality involved, we
can't comment.''
</P>

Troubling methods surface
</P>
<P>
   in relapse studies
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Relapse studies conducted during the '80s and early '90s are at
least as troubling as the symptom-exacerbation experiments. In one
line of experimentation, researchers withdrew medications from
stable patients precisely to study the biology of relapse,
expecting the patients to become sick again. After their subjects'
descent into sickness could be studied, they planned to put them
back on their medications.
</P>
<P>
   One of the largest studies of this type was led by Dr. Daniel
van Kammen at Highland Drive Veterans Affairs Medical Center in
Pittsburgh. From 1985 to 1995, he conducted experiments that
involved withdrawing medication from more than 150 stabilized
schizophrenic patients and using spinal taps to analyze their
spinal fluid. The researchers then followed the patients until they
relapsed, which was defined as exhibiting worse symptoms for three
days straight.
</P>
<P>
   During the 10-year Pittsburgh study, virtually all the
schizophrenic patients either relapsed or stopped coming to the
hospital and were, in the researchers' own words, ``lost to
follow-up.''
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable evidence that this relapse study put
research subjects directly in harm's way. Patients in relapse have
been found to have seven times the risk of falling victim to
antisocial behavior, such as assault, and 2.5 times the risk of
self-injury, including wrist cutting, poisoning, and attempted
hanging, according to a published study.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do not put patients through pain and suffering, with
experiments that have a high-risk design, with no benefit to their
future,'' said research critic Shamoo, at the University of
Maryland. ``You just don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Kammen has since left the Pittsburgh VA; his coresearcher on
some of this research, Dr. John Gurklis, is still there, but he
declined to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, researchers conducted a long-running
medication-withdrawal study. Gregory Aller of Los Angeles was a
subject, and his experiences led him to file a complaint with
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA psychologist Keith Nuechterlein began his research 15 years
ago, and in an update published in 1988 he detailed how
schizophrenic patients admitted to UCLA's Aftercare Clinic had been
taken off medication and allowed to deteriorate into ``clear''
relapse.
</P>
<P>
   Aller, 24 at the time, became a patient at the clinic in 1988,
after suffering an initial bout of psychosis. At first, he was put
on antipsychotic medication, Prolixin decanoate, and thrived,
earning a 3.8 grade-point average at Santa Monica College. But in
late 1989, he entered a medication-withdrawal experiment led by
Nuechterlein and fell into a severe relapse. He growled on buses;
he lapped water out of a toilet like a dog. One evening while
visiting his parents, he said he picked up a butcher knife in the
kitchen and called out his mother's nickname: ``Come here, Poo!''
Aller said he needed to exorcise the devil that he believed
inhabited her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so bizarre,'' said Aller, a mild-mannered man who looks
younger than his 34 years. ``I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 12, 1990, his parents argued with researchers that
Gregory needed his medication. They detailed his psychotic behavior
in a letter, but, according to the Allers, the researchers made no
attempt to remedicate him. Exactly when the researchers attempted
to put Gregory back on an antipsychotic drug is in dispute; what is
clear is that Gregory did not resume taking medication until May
15.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, the harm had been done. Gregory is doing well
today, said his father, Robert, but ``he never returned to his
previous level of function.''

LURE OF RICHES FUELS CLINICAL TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT WHITAKER  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the first three weeks she spent in Fairview Riverside
Hospital, Susan Endersbe, a 41-year-old Minneapolis woman
struggling with schizophrenia and suicidal impulses, obtained care
and medication that made her feel much better.
</P>
<P>
   Her mood lightened. By May 26, 1994, she was telling nurses that
she felt she'd be ready to leave soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the very next day, she was referred to psychiatrist Faruk
Abuzzahab, an encounter that put her on a path that led to her
death.
</P>
<P>
   Abuzzahab, a past president of the Minnesota Psychiatric Society
and onetime chairman of its ethics committee, had a contract with
Abbott Laboratories to test the experimental antipsychotic drug
Sertindole. What he earned has not been disclosed, but such
contracts typically pay physicians much more than regular health
insurance reimbursement, creating a powerful incentive to put
patients into commercial research trials.
</P>
<P>
   Endersbe's death offers a peek into the financial side of
corporate-funded research of new drugs for the mentally ill. While
the development of new antipsychotic drugs has brought new hope for
schizophrenic patients and allowed many to live successfully in the
community, the clinical testing of these medications is also big
business, with the pursuit of money often in conflict with good
patient care. The result is a research landscape tarnished by the
greed of some rogue investigators and repeated instances of
patients being harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abuses are there,'' said Dr. Morris Goldman, associate
professor of psychiatry at the University of Chicago School of
Medicine, who investigated Abuzzahab's transgressions. ``A big part
is the dollars involved.''
</P>
<P>
   There are ``people drawn into this field because they are
interested in dollars,'' Goldman adds. ``They are very
profit-conscious. And that combination of a lot of money, plus the
added ethical dilemma you face in human research, that is a bad
combination. And there are particular risks with psychiatric
patients, with the whole issue of informed consent. It can really
go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When Abuzzahab enrolled Endersbe into his drug trial, he later
admitted to state investigators, he ignored study criteria that
excluded patients who were suicidal. And as soon as she stopped
taking the venlaxafine that had controlled her symptoms, she
quickly worsened, state investigators reported.
</P>
<P>
   Endersbe repeatedly told nurses that she intended to kill
herself. Devils were now struggling for her mind, her brother said.
Her complaints were recorded in nurses' notes, but Abuzzahab
presented a rosy picture in his research records for Abbott.
Endersbe was experiencing no side effects from the drug, he wrote,
so he kept her in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two weeks, until June 8, Endersbe received no
antipsychotic medication. Then, on June 11, when she had been on
the experimental drug for three days, Abuzzahab granted her a day
pass to leave the hospital unaccompanied. She went to her apartment
to gather some keepsakes, slipped the key back under the door, and
walked straight to the Franklin Avenue Bridge. Just as she had said
she would, Endersbe clambered over the railing and leapt to her
death in the Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   ``For nearly 20 years, my sister was managing to win the battle
for her survival, and when she went on a drug study, there were
supposed to be safeguards in place to protect her,'' said her
brother, Edward Endersbe. ``Not only were they not in place, they
neglected to have the usual safeguards that she would have had if
she stayed on as an inpatient'' outside the drug trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``And to wash people out from their medication, to take away any
kind of treatment, that to me is inhumane,'' he added. ``If they
did that to someone with a physical illness, I would think it would
be criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Troubling questions
</P>
<P>
   about patient safety
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People with schizophrenia, studies have shown, are at greatest
risk of suicide during a relapse, at the beginning of an acute
psychotic episode, and when they are discharged from the hospital.
Taking part in a drug trial often exposes them to all those
factors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, three antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia have
been brought to the market: Zyprexa (olanzapine), Risperdal
(risperidone), and Seroquel (quetiapine). Abbott Laboratories also
submitted an application for Serlect (sertindole) _ the drug Susan
Endersbe was given _ but withdrew it after a Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee questioned its safety.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the clinical trials submitted to the FDA,
obtained by the Globe through Freedom of Information requests,
raise troubling questions about the safety of schizophrenic
patients enrolled in commercial drug trials:
</P>
<P>
   _Among 12,176 patients from the US and abroad who had
participated in trials for all four drugs at the time the data was
submitted to the FDA, there were 88 deaths, including 38 suicides.
(The figure includes deaths up to 30 days after patients left the
trial.) That is an overall death rate of 1 of every 138 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   _The suicide rate for the clinical trials is two to five times
higher than the norm. In the medical literature, annual suicide
rates for schizophrenia patients range from two to five deaths per
1,000 people. The annual suicide rate in the trials, on a
time-adjusted basis, was close to 10 per 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   _In trials for the three approved drugs _ Zyprexa, Risperdal,
and Seroquel _ 60 percent of the 7,269 patients who received the
experimental drug dropped out before the end of the study period,
typically six to eight weeks. Patients dropped out because the
drugs didn't work, because of side effects, and sometimes because
they refused to continue.
</P>
<P>
   No one has made a detailed study of the mortality or suicide
rates of subjects in schizophrenia drug trials. When queried, a
half dozen psychiatric researchers expressed varying responses to
the numbers collected by the Globe. Some thought they were
remarkably high. Some argued that the majority of the people
entering the trials had been chronically ill with schizophrenia,
and thus a number of suicides and deaths could be expected. And
some researchers begged off; they did not know what to make of the
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reasearchers seduced by
</P>
<P>
   lure of lucrative rewards
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The research enterprise that has produced new neuroleptic drugs
for schizophrenia has paid off, of course, in important ways. The
standard drugs used from the 1950s to the early 1990s typically
made patients feel like zombies and caused major side effects that
disrupted muscle control. The antipsychotic drugs that have reached
the market in recent years (Risperdal, Zyprexa and Seroquel) are
less sedating and appear to have fewer harmful side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately ill schizophrenics have turned to clinical trials
for early access to these new drugs, and many of those patients
attest to the attentive care that they received from researchers
conducting the trials.
</P>
<P>
   But there are powerful financial factors at work that can tempt
researchers to enroll mentally ill patients into drug trials even
when it will not serve the patients' interests.
</P>
<P>
   Antipsychotic drugs are considered a major and fast-growing
market for the pharmaceutical industry. In 1997, US sales topped
$1.5 billion, double the figure from two years earlier.
Pharmaceutical companies developing antipsychotic medications know
that every day shaved from the testing process can get them to the
market a day sooner, and each day earlier to market represents $1
million to $2 million in additional sales per drug. The companies
need to get patients into their trials quickly, and they will pay
researchers handsomely for doing so. But they also expect the
researchers to deliver. Researchers who do not meet their patient
quotas are not likely to get a contract for the next project.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressures are enormous,'' said Newell Unfried, executive
vice president of the Alliance for Multispecialty Research, a group
of leading for-profit research centers. Increasingly, he added,
performance reviews ``are being drawn up by pharmaceutical
companies on every physician in clinical research on their patient
recruitment. There is pressure to get these patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the drug-testing industry today is a highly
competitive, profit-driven enterprise. Only about 25 percent of
drug trials are conducted in nonprofit academic medical centers.
The rest are conducted by community physicians who contract with
drug makers or by for-profit companies whose sole focus is
conducting drug trials.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians who do commercial drug research full-time regularly
report generating more than $1 million in annual revenues, and
profits exceeding $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, a Providence-based company, Clinical Studies,
built a nationwide chain of research centers focusing on drugs for
Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and other neurological
disorders. The founders sold it in 1997 to a physician-practice
management company for stock valued at $85 million. Hoping to make
similar scores, venture capital groups have poured more than $100
million into start-ups seeking to duplicate Clinical Studies'
success.
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, researchers know that the ``product'' they
deliver is patients who can be enrolled in trials and kept there
until they complete the study protocol. Physicians often earn
bonuses for meeting patient-recruitment goals.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the monetary incentives put researchers on a
slippery slope, particularly when it comes to testing schizophrenia
drugs. Their financial interests push them to recruit patients
aggressively, yet the trials expose the patients to numerous risks.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Stanley Cheren, a Brookline psychiatrist who conducts
commercial drug trials on a full-time basis, insists ``there are a
number of things that keep you sober and honest _ your own
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving that aside, you are accountable to the patient and to
the patient's family, and they do raise hell when things aren't
going well. The hospital staff keeps you accountable. And the third
thing always lurking in the background is the FDA. If you recruit a
lot of patients and do it fast, the FDA takes that as a red flag
and audits your site.''

<P>
   Shames by revelations that for 40 years the US government
allowed black ``volunteers'' to suffer and die from untreated
syphilis, federal officials now attempt to limit medical
experimentation on most of society's more vulnerable populations.
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners, children, pregnant women, fetuses _ all are covered
by special regulations that restrict their involvement in medical
research, allowing it only in certain circumstances and under tight
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   People with mental illness have no such protection, even though
a federal panel in the wake of the Tuskegee, Ala., syphilis
experiments that began in 1932 included the mentally ill in its
call for special safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gaping hole,'' said Cliff Zucker, executive director of
Disability Advocates Inc. in Albany, N.Y., a group that represents
the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, some psychiatric specialists are conducting medical
experiments in which research subjects are allowed to grow sicker.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the psychiatric research community has adamantly
opposed any move to restrict its work, arguing that its approach is
an important avenue for understanding the underlying biology of
mental illness and developing new antipsychotic medicines.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the newly approved drugs to combat mental illness
can be traced to these types of studies. And critics say
psychiatric drugs should be developed the same as other drugs _
first through animal testing, then with humans already sick with
the disease, and never by provoking psychosis or by misleading
subjects about the nature of the research.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For the past two years, a 17-member national commission has
been studying the issue. &UR;  &LR; Tuesday (Nov. 17) it called for tougher
research standards to protect the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition from psychiatric researchers has been heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barriers to this sort of research could slow down dramatically
the accelerating advances we have seen in recent years,'' Dr.
Joseph T. Coyle, chairman of Harvard Medical School's department of
psychiatry, told hundreds of participants at a National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill meeting in Washington, D.C., in July.
</P>
<P>
   Coyle later wrote to the National Bioethics Advisory Commission,
which is drafting the new guidelines, arguing that to single out
people with mental illness for special protections would be to
stigmatize them.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move, he added in an interview, ``represents a rather
naive understanding of complex factors that can affect
decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyle's letter on behalf of the nearly 30,000-member Society for
Neuroscience, a major research organization, joined more than 50
critical letters by research and pharmaceutical representatives to
the commission. Some were little more than a form letter, with a
few key paragraphs repeated verbatim on different stationery.
</P>
<P>
   The presidentially-appointed bioethics panel is wrapping up a
two-day meeting in Miami this week (Nov. 18) and is expected to
send its final recommendations to the White House within months.
The commission yesterday recommended boosting representation of
people with mental disorders on local review boards and requiring
greater researcher accountability.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, however, there is little to rein in zealous
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The current supervisory structure, in the words of one medical
ethicist, is ``wheezing'' and has been compromised by close
relationships between researchers and reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an overwhelmed system of review that is being asked to
handle a pace of research, a level of research, that it just wasn't
built to do,'' said Arthur Caplan, a University of Pennsylvania
medical ethicist. ``It's very incestuous.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oversight bureaucracy &QL; 
overworked and understaffed &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What little federal oversight exists is largely handled by a
small bureaucracy within the National Institutes of Health, the
government office that funds much of the research.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen federal officials in charge of protecting human
research subjects are responsible for monitoring nearly 5,000 local
review boards, which in turn examine hundreds, if not thousands, of
psychiatric research projects a year.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the inspector general's office of the US Department of
Health and Human Services called for an overhaul of the review
board framework. A congressional subcommittee, chaired by
Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, plans
to file legislation next year to create a national review committee
to bolster protection for research subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The local review boards are the cornerstone of the current
system. Review-board members are supposed to abide by the ethical
principles embodied in the Nuremberg Code of 1947 and the Helsinki
Declaration of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, the boards are usually overworked and
poorly trained.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Dr. Dorothy Rosenthal, a physician who headed a
review board at the University of California, Los Angeles in the
1980s during a long-running schizophrenia study, acknowledged in a
court deposition that she was not familiar with the Helsinki
Declaration. She said she had a ``vague recollection of that as a
title,'' but didn't ``have a clue as to what was contained in it.''
The deposition was taken as part of a lawsuit against UCLA filed by
two families affected by the research.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say these part-time boards often do not have the time or
expertise to judge the scientific merit of a proposal and may end
up approving the examination of research questions that have been
answered by other studies.
</P>
<P>
   A federal report issued in June found that the six boards it
examined were swamped with cases, with an average increase of 42
percent in initial examinations of studies during the past five
years. Some boards were vetting as many as 2,000 research protocols
a year. One received an average of 200 reports a month of ``adverse
events,'' or episodes of side effects and other bad outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   With so much work and so little time, the report concluded,
board members often can only flip through the pages of a report for
studies they are charged with monitoring. One board member, for
instance, said he will only raise questions about an ongoing study
``if a patient has died,'' according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   In only the rarest of cases did review board members interview
subjects to make sure they understood they were in a study, not in
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps an even greater problem is conflict of interest. Board
members often are the colleagues of the researchers they are
reviewing. Sometimes they work at the same institutions; often they
know each other professionally and socially. Many of these board
members may themselves be facing peer approval in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to criticize colleagues' work. It's hard to prevent
colleagues from doing the kinds of research they want to do,'' said
Leonard Glantz, professor of health law at the Boston University
School of Public Health. Glantz served as a consultant to the first
US commission to call for special research protections for the
mentally ill, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   With research institutions increasingly relying on
pharmaceutical firms for support, review board members face yet
another conflict. One of the academic medical centers visited by
the federal inspectors derived nearly $200 million, or about 25
percent of its budget, from research. Much of this was commercially
funded.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... become sicker.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The patient is suffering,'' acknowledged Cheren, the Brookline
psychiatrist who conducts drug studies. ``Psychosis makes a person
suffer. A second (risk) is that the patient could become more
violent and destructive to himself and to others. Third, people
think that acute psychosis does damage to the brain, and you want
to limit those periods. Multiple episodes of acute psychosis lead
to poorer long-term outcomes. You want to limit all of those things
as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping a schizophrenic patient's medication raises two other
concerns. In normal clinical care, when a patient is taken off
drugs, the recommended practice is to lower the dosage gradually,
because abrupt withdrawal has been shown in numerous studies to
dramatically increase the risk of relapse. Moreover, evidence is
emerging that sudden withdrawal may lead to a rebound psychosis
more severe than if the patient had never been treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not simply a matter of not being treated and going back
to baseline of an untreated state,'' said Dr. Ross Baldessarini,
professor of psychiatry and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School.
``There is an additional risk involved that may be due to the
discontinuation itself .... We are trying to get people sensitized
to this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   David Cohen, a professor of social work at the University of
Montreal who has done extensive research on neuroleptic drugs, said
abrupt withdrawal can also lead to flu-like symptoms, nausea, and
vomiting. This, he said, is a withdrawal reaction, not just a
return of previous symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be new symptoms the person has never experienced
before,'' Cohen added. ``But they don't tell them the kind of
suffering it will entail. They don't tell the patients how severe
these symptoms may be, and that they could be life threatening, and
that they could be driven to kill themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, potential benefits for the research
subjects. The primary one is that they may respond to the
experimental drug, and be able to continue to get it by
participating in a long-term followup study. But the mentally ill
patients can expect, at least at first, to go through a difficult
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when I was three or four days into the washout I
was really struggling,'' said D.L., a 41-year-old woman in Illinois
diagnosed with mild psychotic disorder who recently entered a trial
of an experimental antipsychotic. ``My symptoms increased
dramatically. It was getting scary. If they had been any more
severe, I know that I couldn't have handled it. I hope that if that
had happened, I would not have hurt myself. But when you are
delusional, it is hard to know what you are going to do.''

Researchers grapple with
</P>
<P>
   ways to reduce patient risk
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Within the psychiatric research community, there is controversy
over whether drug studies can be designed to reduce the risk to
patients. In Europe, for instance, researchers are reluctant to
conduct placebo-controlled trials for schizophrenia. Instead,
European researchers usually conduct trials that compare the
experimental drug to a standard therapy.
</P>
<P>
   That is also how US drug trials are typically designed for
medical conditions such as high blood pressure, for which there are
already effective approved drugs. But in schizophrenia research,
the FDA believes that patients' reactions to antipsychotic drugs
are so variable that without a placebo group, the tests cannot show
whether an experimental drug is effective. That could result in
ineffective drugs being approved, said the FDA's Temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to think about the people in the trial, but you also
have to think of the consequences to the community of marketing
ineffective antipsychotics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others find that justification unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine an antibiotic study that would compare the
experimental drug to a sugar pill?'' asked Unfried, head of the
alliance of for-profit research centers. ``Can you imagine that
goofy study? With the result that the patient died from too much
infection? In those studies, you use a standard therapy as a basis
for comparison. The FDA has a role to protect people and to make
sure you design the trial in such a way that you do not hurt
people.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Testing violations lead
</P>
<P>
   to a death in California
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone agreeing to take part in a risky drug trial would expect
attentive medical care. But that wasn't the case with Borison and
Diamond. It wasn't the case with Abuzzahab. And it was not what
Jennifer Abigayle McIntyre received when she entered a trial in
1993 for Janssen Pharmaceutica's experimental drug risperidone.
</P>
<P>
   After she died, an investigation by the California Department of
Health found violations that took 16 pages to detail.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1993, Abigayle's mother, psychiatrist Judith
Vukov, accompanied Dr. Robert Liberman, director of schizophrenia
research at the University of California, Los Angeles, to lobby
Congress to fund research on mental illness. Her daughter had
schizoaffective disorder (a variant of schizophrenia), existing
medications weren't helping her, and, as Liberman had told her,
experimental treatments offered the best hope.
</P>
<P>
   Later that same summer, on July 20, 1993, according to the
California Department of Health and court records, Abigayle
McIntyre was transferred to the research ward at Camarillo State
Hospital, where doctors were treating patients with experimental
protocols developed by UCLA researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Abigayle signed an informed-consent form that stated she would
be given a physical exam, be closely monitored, and that if her
condition worsened, her treatment would be ``promptly adjusted.''
In fact, the investigation showed, she never received a physical,
nor did the staff prepare any plan for treating her psychiatric and
behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   The principal researcher, Dr. Barringer Marshall Jr., gave her a
new diagnosis, chronic schizophrenia, which made her eligible for
the risperidone study.
</P>
<P>
   As her previous medications were withdrawn, she became more
volatile, crying and screaming for hours on the phone with her
mother. On Aug. 12, as part of the protocol, she was prescribed
Haldol, a standard antipsychotic. Even though she began to suffer
terrible headaches and her blood pressure soared, she was kept on
Haldol. The protocol called for her to take the drug for three
weeks before she could be switched to risperidone.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother complained, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because I am a doctor doesn't mean anything,'' Vukov
said. ``If you have a psychiatric child, your opinion is useless.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the unit's staff made an entry on Abigayle's chart
was Aug. 26. On Sept. 11, her mother took her out of the hospital
on a day pass. At some point her daughter swallowed a large number
of aspirin; she died several hours later after emergency room
physicians failed to promptly diagnose the aspirin poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought research was the best treatment in the country,''
said Vukov. ``Today it is not. It is the most dangerous. Abigayle
wouldn't have gotten sick like that if she hadn't been in research.
She ended up outside my control and outside the control of a good
doctor, who would have done something about (her illness). She was
actively neglected in research.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Messy picture often
</P>
<P>
   buried in a marketing glow
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a drug company submits data to the FDA, it must detail all
deaths that occurred in the clinical trials, along with a full
accounting of side effects, patients who dropped out of the study,
and any other problems suffered by the patients.
</P>
<P>
   But that often messy picture is rarely reflected in the accounts
of the drug's performance that get published in medical journals.
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca's Seroquel, approved by the FDA last fall, is the newest
antipsychotic drug on the market. When the Globe compared the mixed
results hidden in FDA files, including 14 deaths, with the glowing
conclusions published in medical journals, the differences were
stark.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FDA's review of Zeneca's data, 80 percent of
the 2,162 patients given Seroquel in clinical tests stopped taking
the drug before the trial was over, even though the trials often
lasted less than eight weeks. Of those who dropped out, 1,033 did
so because the drug didn't help them, 398 simply refused to
continue or were lost to follow-up, and 86 had to stop because of
adverse reactions that included excess sleepinees, convulsions,
suicide attempts, and depression.
</P>
<P>
   But when articles began appearing in medical journals on the
results in the summer of 1997, the authors glossed over the
dropouts, failed to report on the deaths, and drew rosy
conclusions. An article in the Archives of General Psychiatry
hailed Seroquel as ``an effective antipsychotic with a favorable
safety profile''; a report in Biological Psychiatry touted the drug
as ``well tolerated and clinically effective in the treatment of
schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the trial results that are published have as authors
both (researchers) and people involved with the trial who work for
the company,'' noted New York-based researcher Schooler, who Zeneca
designated to be its spokesperson. ``Of course people put the most
positive spin possible on their results.''
</P>
<P>
   One result of this marketing spin is that practicing
psychiatrists often say they no longer know what to believe about
new drugs. Although Seroquel and the other new drugs do appear to
cause fewer side effects than standard antipsychotics, there are
still many questions about how they compare in efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets put out is not necessarily the truth,'' Dr. E.
Fuller Torrey, director of research for the National Alliance for
the Mentally Ill, said this summer at the group's annual
conference. ``You'd be surprised at how much money many of my
colleagues are regularly taking from the pharmaceutical industry.
$10,000 is not an uncommon amount to be given for giving a talk....
If we really hope to answer the question of new antipsychotics
vis-a-vis the old ones, we're going to need something other than
the pharmaceutical industry to provide funds on it.''

SCHIZOPHRENIA TREATMENT FALLS SHORT, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Schizophrenia may be one of the most baffling of mental
illnesses, but the medical profession and society at large could be
making much better use of what we do know about combating the
devastating disorder, a major study has found.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments that are known to work are woefully underused and
support services &UR;  &LR; are often non-existent, the federally funded
project concluded after five years of reviewing the scientific
literature and interviewing patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' said Dr. Anthony F. Lehman, principal
investigator for the Schizophrenia Patient Outcomes Research Team
(PORT) study, which discovered glaring disparities between what's
known about the disease and what's provided to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most patients don't get an adequate treatment package,'' said
Lehman, a University of Maryland professor of psychiatry. ``I think
that outcomes could be better, and people could have a better
quality of life within the limits of what we already know. There's
plenty of room for improvement for many patients.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, hospital and outpatient clinicians failed to provide
effective treatment approaches more than 50 percent of the time,
according to the study that analyzed in depth the care provided to
more than 700 patients in two states, one in the South and one in
the Midwest. While the study did not name the states, to protect
confidentiality, Georgia has disclosed its participation.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia, which was first described more than 100 years ago
and is characterized by such symptoms as hallucinations, delusions,
and emotional withdrawal, affects up to 2 million Americans. Some
patients become chronically ill; others experience a single
psychotic episode and recover. The disorder usually manifests
itself in adolescence or early adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in response to the PORT study, the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill, a Virginia-based advocacy group, launched an
initiative to get every state to adopt, by the year 2002, a major
recommendation &UR;  &LR; set forth by the study _ the so-called Program for
Assertive Community Treatment, or PACT.
</P>
<P>
   The PACT program includes intense psychiatric, social work,
nursing, and vocational rehabilitation services to keep those
people at greater risk of serious illness from being hospitalized,
becoming homeless, or of going to prison. The study found that only
10.1 percent of outpatients in the two states examined received
such treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The PACT concept is based on a program that began 25 years ago
in Madison, Wis. It now is offered statewide in Delaware, Idaho,
Michigan, RhodeIsland, Texas, and Wisconsin, and pilot programs are
under way in California, Hawaii, Minnesota, Virginia, and
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Department of Mental Health has taken all the
study's recommendations to heart and expanded upon them.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to require mental health providers doing business with
the state to follow the recommendations on medication use,
psychosocial services, and the other aspects of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty extensive mandate, if you will,'' said Dr. Paul
Barreira, deputy commissioner for clinical and professional
services. ``It's a way to standardize the treatments, so treatments
known to be effective are being used.''
</P>
<P>
   The department expects to wrap up consultations with providers,
patients, and families on the recommendations by the end of the
year, said Barreira, and then it will make copies of the report
readily available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be a common document that patients and
families and clinicians can use to talk about where the treatment's
at,'' Barreira said.
</P>
<P>
   Other treatment approaches the PORT study found to be underused
include antipsychotic medication for new or relapsed patients,
drugs to combat the depression that some patients experience,
psychotherapy, and family education and support.
</P>
<P>
   Family education and support are most lacking, the study found;
only 9.6 percent of patients and their families getting such
services. That kind of support has been shown to reduce relapse
rates by 50 to 75 percent, especially when used in conjunction with
medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a simple kind of thing. When someone comes into the
hospital and is first diagnosed with schizophrenia, there should be
a systematic way to educate the family about what's going on,''
said William Hargreaves, a professor of psychology at the
University of California, San Francisco. ``It's something we ought
to be able to do on a large scale nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's recommendations on medication use were generally
better followed than those for psychosocial services. Yet more than
10 percent of hospitalized patients in the study did not receive
antipsychotic drugs, and more than 70 percent of outpatients did
not get the appropriate dose of drugs over the long term.
</P>
<P>
   The findings show ``what a chasm'' exists between what is
possible and what is being done, said Gerard Hogarty, a professor
of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh who has done studies
on the effectiveness of family education and other psychosocial
services in treating people with schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The PORT study is not the first to point out that with the use
of available treatment options many people with schizophrenia can
lead productive lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a societal misperception that people with schizophrenia are
violent or beyond help continues to make difficult efforts to
expand the availability of treatments, say some mental health
professionals and advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The recent headlines about the Capitol Hill gunman and a Yale
law student who killed his girlfriend add to that misperception,
even though a study earlier this year found that people with
schizophrenia who were not also substance abusers are no more
likely to be violent than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``That myth or misconception that people do not recover affects
all research, all treatment, all funding,'' said Dr. Daniel B.
Fisher, a community-based psychiatrist who was diagnosed with
schizophrenia 30 years ago. He is executive director of the
National Empowerment Center, a federally funded mental health
advocacy group in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in Behavioral Healthcare Tomorrow magazine,
Fisher identified factors that have helped people with
schizophrenia to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Key among the findings from his federally funded study: A strong
social support network, and the financial resources to help the
patient get through periods when he or she is unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   Also hindering the expansion of psychosocial services, in
particular, is the prevailing belief that the answer to
schizophrenia lies in a drug yet to be discovered, or a
neurobiological secret yet to be unlocked, say some mental health
professionals and advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Research funding is ``very lopsided in favor of neurobiology,''
said Hogarty, who is a social worker by training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly not equity in this. I look around and I ask
myself, `Who in the United States is testing new psychosocial
training for schizophrenia?' and I can exhaust that on a couple of
fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   The names of neuroscientists, however, could fill a phone book,
Hogarty said.
</P>
<P>
   PORT's Lehman also thinks the emphasis on the search for new
drugs or neurobiological clues can work against people getting the
support services _ or the answers _ they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reductionism that goes on sometimes,'' with the
research focus on this brain chemical or that brain chemical being
implicated in schizophrenia, and less so on psychosocial treatments
and other areas, Lehman said. ``We need to think very broadly about
this disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   His views are shared by Fisher of the National Empowerment
Center, who was once a biochemist at the National Institute of
Mental Health. ``We're just too complex a being to narrow down all
of our existence to one or another chemical,'' he said.

 &HT;    
 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Recently, at a fund-raiser for a national organization dedicated
to overcoming racial and religious bigotry, the speaker linked
anti-Semitism to intolerance against homosexuals.
 &HT;    Afterward, a friend noted sadly, ``I'm worried he brought up the
gay issue. It might offend some contributors.''
 &HT;    ``Let it offend them,'' I responded, ``maybe they need to be
offended.''
 &HT;    In the weeks since Matthew Shepard died -- apparently the victim
of a brutal gay-bashing -- liberal pundits have blamed his murder
on ``the climate of hate'' created by the religious right.
 &HT;    This analysis is wrong. The religious right did not create the
current ``climate of hate.'' If you want to blame religion for
antigay violence, blame Christianity. Liberal, conservative,
Protestant, Catholic -- it does not matter.
 &HT;    Although Jesus never mentioned homosexuality, his followers
developed an anti-homosexual ethic. Beginning with Paul, who
condemned either homosexuality in general or homosexual
prostitution specifically, homophobia contaminated Christianity
from almost its inception.
 &HT;    Throughout much of history, the church proclaimed homosexuality
inimical to faith. Often it ignored or silenced -- and only rarely
affirmed -- its gay and lesbian children. From Augustine through
Aquinas to Protestant reformers, homosexuality was seen as
``unnatural'' and the source of idolatry, deception, and
corruption.
 &HT;    When antigay picketers held up ``God Hates Fags'' signs at
Shepard's funeral they did not represent only the contemporary
religious right. Rather, they embodied a history of horror directed
against homosexuals by the church -- part of a western society's
collective inheritance.
 &HT;    Not every Christian, of course, is homophobic. Rather, all
Christians -- and nearly all Americans -- are influenced by antigay
biblical interpretations. As one professor noted regarding a course
she taught, ``Almost every student described feeling fearful and
uncomfortable about talking to gays and lesbians.''
 &HT;    Students far from the religious right -- such as those in her
liberal classroom -- still snicker about ``the sin that knows no
name.''
 &HT;    Some of my gay and lesbian friends struggle with this heritage.
As Christians, they honor the Bible, trying to live as God would
have them. As homosexual people, they feel the weight of tradition
against them.
 &HT;    The struggle? To believe in a God whose people reviled and
persecuted them.
 &HT;    Of course, others have suffered similar biblical fates.
African-Americans were told the Bible cursed them to be slaves;
women were taught their intrinsic inferiority and wifely
submission; Jews became demonic ``Christ- killers.''
 &HT;    In each case, Christianity developed elaborate theological
systems based on a few biblical texts to keep people subject to the
cultural status quo and male authority.
 &HT;    Powerful though they were, these interpretations are just that:
interpretations. Gay Christians know they have been oppressed by
what people have said about the Bible -- not the Bible. It presents
a different message -- that of a loving God.
 &HT;    The straight community often fails to recognize the difference
between the text and interpretation. Instead, heterosexual
Christians enshrined their prejudices as ``biblical'' and reading
into the Bible ideas not contained therein.
 &HT;    For example, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is not -- as
commonly believed -- about homosexuality. It is about inhospitality
and violence. English mistranslations aside, the Bible never
actually uses the word ``homosexual.''
 &HT;    The Bible does not condemn what we know as homosexuality --
especially if a monogamous partnership. Tradition does, but most
Christians do not believe tradition infallible. Thus, rejecting bad
tradition in favor of biblical fidelity should be a compelling task
for believers.
 &HT;    Since the 19th century, many Christians have used biblical
criticism to keep the church from misinterpreting its scripture. As
a result, biblical arguments no longer justify slavery. Sermons no
longer identify Jews as the cursed children of Cain. Churches admit
women to full participation in ministry, not some second-class
status.
 &HT;    At some point in history, however, Christians believed these
offensive things -- as many still believe that homosexuality is an
``abomination'' against the Lord.
 &HT;    Homophobia is so pervasive that even those victimized by similar
biblical interpretations fail to recognize it. Only in the last two
decades have churches seriously engaged these issues. This has been
a slow, painful process -- not unlike the arguments surrounding
slavery and women's rights.
 &HT;    One day, as did abolitionism and feminism, the argument for full
inclusion of homosexuals in church and society will win. We will
look back and wonder why it was so hard to see gays and lesbians as
people -- not sinners.
 &HT;    For Matthew Shepard, however, the day did not come soon enough.
His broken body, hung as Jesus on the cross, gives the rest of us
courage to bear the pain of change.

 UNDATED: ... its description.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I understand that my condition may improve, worsen, or remain
unchanged from participation in this study.'' A later sentence
added that ``I understand that because of the withdrawal of active
medication, I may become worse during this study and that either a
relapse of my initial symptoms or new symptoms may occur.''
</P>
<P>
   But UCLA officials painted a less uncertain picture in court
depositions and the published literature. They cited earlier
studies showing that 60 to 75 percent of schizophrenic patients
taken off medication experienced a relapse. They said medication is
withdrawn in order to study factors that can predict which patients
might relapse and which ones might be able to safely stay off drugs
known to cause troublesome side effects.
</P>
<P>
   In a revealing admission, the official who headed UCLA's human
subject protection board at the time of the study said in a
deposition that such details as relapse rates were kept out of
consent forms because they were ``overly frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   The official, Dr. Dorothy Rosenthal, was asked by Aller's
attorney if such information would deter patients from entering
such experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Correct,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back on his experience, Aller, now 35, said he had no
idea researchers expected to see him get worse. ``I thought they
cared about me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As his parents, Robert and Gloria, saw their son descend into
psychosis, they began to ask for his medical records and sought to
determine the true purpose of the study.
</P>
<P>
   When his parents finally convinced him the researchers did not
have his interests at heart, said Aller, ``I couldn't believe they
wanted relapse.'' He left the study in 1991 and is doing well on a
new schizophrenia medication.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio LaMadrid thought the UCLA researchers cared about him
too, especially when they provided weekly lunches, holiday parties,
and free care as part of the package, recalled his brother,
Laurence LaMadrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge social component,'' said Laurence, who stayed
in contact with his brother during his time in the study. ``It was
almost a fraternity.''
</P>
<P>
   When researchers told Antonio he was being transferred from the
Aftercare Clinic after several years, citing drug use, he was
devastated, Laurence recalled. Soon afterward, Antonio committed
suicide by jumping off a 12-story UCLA building.
</P>
<P>
   Although Antonio's participation in the withdrawal phase of the
study had ended about three years earlier, he had continued to be a
patient at the clinic. But court depositions in the lawsuit filed
by the LaMadrid and Aller families against UCLA show that he had
not been seen by a physician in his last year at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA spokesman Warren Robak said he could not comment on either
case because the families have not given written permission waiving
patient confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   Keith H. Nuechterlein, the UCLA clinical psychologist who headed
up the study, said that while the consent form did not specify
relapse rates, such information was raised in conversations with
patients and family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel that the amount of information that was
available _ when considering the oral and written informed consent
_ was always very complete,'' said Nuechterlein. The study,
designed to better understand the early stages of schizophrenia,
continues to be federally funded, although the
medication-withdrawal phase ended several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1994, OPRR found that UCLA had failed to fully disclose
the risk of medication withdrawal in the schizophrenia study; UCLA
changed its consent form in response. OPRR also concluded that even
though UCLA said it provided much of the information orally, that
``cannot take the place of the written informed consent which ...
regulations require prior to participation in such research.''
</P>
<P>
   Nuechterlein said he expects the standards for informed consent
to continue to evolve, ``as we try to understand how to really make
sure our patients in studies, and their family members, truly
understand, and are making good, sensible decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A Globe review of symptom-exacerbation studies from institutions
around the country found a pattern similar to that at UCLA:
researchers telling patients one thing in consent forms and
planning to do another.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center, for instance,
researchers gave schizophrenic patients the drug L-dopa, used to
treat Parkinson's disease but known to induce psychotic symptoms in
people with mental illness. But researchers told patients that ``we
think by giving you this drug and evaluating your response to it,
we may be able to tell if your regular medication is safe for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   In their 1987 published report, the researchers noted that while
most patients recovered from psychotic symptoms after the L-dopa
was stopped, ``a few patients did not.... It seems likely that
L-dopa played a role in bringing on relapse in these few patients
or caused some form of sensitization to psychosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Bronx VA acknowledged in a 1994 letter to
mental health advocate Vera Sharav that at the time of the 1987
study it was standard practice not to spell out the risks in
consent forms. They said if the study were still going on today,
the consent form would be worded more explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   At University Hospital in Cincinnati, where in 1983 Shalmah
Prince sought treatment for an impending manic phase of her manic
depression, she was shepherded into a study involving medication
withdrawal and an injection of apomorphine, but the consent form
never disclosed all the risks.
</P>
<P>
   In a court deposition in the lawsuit that Prince eventually
filed, which was dismissed last year because the statute of
limitations ran out, one of the researchers, Dr. David Garver,
explained the failure to disclose risk this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that the consent form signed by the plaintiff does
not discuss a risk associated with a drug-free period. However,
this risk would seem to be self-evident even to a person without
medical training. If therapeutic drugs are of benefit to control a
patient's disease or disorder, it should be clear that withholding
such treatment may lead to a worsening of the patient's symptoms
until treatment is reinitiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say that the omission or minimizing of risk in
consent forms during the 1980s was in keeping with standards of the
day and that procedures have vastly improved. But more recent
examples of questionable consent still exist.
</P>
<P>
   In its 1994 and 1995 review of 125 contemporary studies, some
involving the mentally ill and some not, the President's Advisory
Committee on Human Radiation Experiments found that nearly half of
all consent forms were ethically unacceptable or questionable, for
failing to disclose risks or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In its continuing investigation of the University of Maryland,
OPRR found inadequate disclosure of research risks in studies
continuing into the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   An example of lack of candor on the part of researchers doing
challenge studies comes from consent forms in which psychotic
symptoms are described as a side effect rather than the aim of the
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The symptoms are expected. They are not unintended side
effects,'' said Donald Rosenstein, a specialist on psychiatric
research at the National Institute of Mental Health, testifying
before the National Bioethics Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people, including investigators, can get
confused about that,'' Rosenstein said. ``In symptom-provoking
studies, the whole point is to elicit symptoms that are
characteristic of the condition under study.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`I don't remember
</P>
<P>
   what I signed'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even in psychiatric studies that don't provoke symptoms,
however, true informed consent can be elusive.
</P>
<P>
   When Andrew Brownstein entered a National Institute of Mental
Health program in Washington, D.C., in 1994, he was asked to sign a
sheaf of consent forms at a single sitting without having time to
read them. Some were for studies of potentially therapeutic drugs,
but others were for spinal taps and brain scans that would do
nothing to improve his condition.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In the case of Brownstein, as in others, the sheer volume of
material raises the question: Could he possibly know and understand
what he was agreeing to?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big, big black notebook,'' said Brownstein, who has
bipolar disorder, in recalling what a researcher gave him the first
night he was on the ward. ``There were so many consent forms
presented to me I don't remember what I signed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 13 months he was there until he left in 1995, Brownstein
underwent seven spinal taps, including one that was so
excruciatingly painful that he suffered a severe headache for
several days. He was also enrolled in studies of experimental
medications that might be therapeutic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful,'' he said of the headache. ``I think it knocked
me down for four or five days.''
</P>
<P>
   In an investigation prompted by Brownstein's testimony to the
National Bioethics Advisory Commission last year and concluded in
September, OPRR validated Brownstein's complaints. In response, the
National Institute of Mental Health changed its informed-consent
process.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Dr. Trey Sunderland, chairman of NIMH's institutional review
board, which is charged with protecting subjects of research, said,
``We are constantly trying to improve informed consent.'' He
acknowledged it was ``an error'' to ask Brownstein or any other
patient to sign consents for multiple protocols at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have spent a year and a half now, changing our policies
and, I think, making them better,'' Sunderland said. But he added
that NIMH's review board is ``not a policing organization. We're a
supervisory organization. We've tried to make it absolutely clear
to our investigators what we expect and what OPRR expects.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Brownstein, the consent process was part of an
experience that made him feel like a guinea pig, rather than
someone in need of care.
</P>
<P>
   As he was about to be discharged, a doctor said ```Andy holds
the record. We have done more procedures on him in 13 months than
we have done on people here a much longer time. His veins were
good, his arteries were good, his spine was good,''' Brownstein
recalled. ``That didn't make me feel proud at all. I wasn't trying
to set any records.''
</P>
<P>
   The final insult came the next day, as Brownstein left the
facility. He recalled the doctor saying to him, ``Thanks for your
time, and thanks for your body fluids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That sums it up,'' said Brownstein. ``It was very cold.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Recently, at a fund-raiser for a national organization dedicated
to overcoming racial and religious bigotry, the speaker linked
anti-Semitism to intolerance against homosexuals.
 &HT;    Afterward, a friend noted sadly, ``I'm worried he brought up the
gay issue. It might offend some contributors.''
 &HT;    ``Let it offend them,'' I responded, ``maybe they need to be
offended.''
 &HT;    In the weeks since Matthew Shepard died -- apparently the victim
of a brutal gay-bashing -- liberal pundits have blamed his murder
on ``the climate of hate'' created by the religious right.
 &HT;    This analysis is wrong. The religious right did not create the
current ``climate of hate.'' If you want to blame religion for
antigay violence, blame Christianity. Liberal, conservative,
Protestant, Catholic -- it does not matter.
 &HT;    Although Jesus never mentioned homosexuality, his followers
developed an anti-homosexual ethic. Beginning with Paul, who
condemned either homosexuality in general or homosexual
prostitution specifically, homophobia contaminated Christianity
from almost its inception.
 &HT;    Throughout much of history, the church proclaimed homosexuality
inimical to faith. Often it ignored or silenced -- and only rarely
affirmed -- its gay and lesbian children. From Augustine through
Aquinas to Protestant reformers, homosexuality was seen as
``unnatural'' and the source of idolatry, deception, and
corruption.
 &HT;    When antigay picketers held up ``God Hates Fags'' signs at
Shepard's funeral they did not represent only the contemporary
religious right. Rather, they embodied a history of horror directed
against homosexuals by the church -- part of a western society's
collective inheritance.
 &HT;    Not every Christian, of course, is homophobic. Rather, all
Christians -- and nearly all Americans -- are influenced by antigay
biblical interpretations. As one professor noted regarding a course
she taught, ``Almost every student described feeling fearful and
uncomfortable about talking to gays and lesbians.''
 &HT;    Students far from the religious right -- such as those in her
liberal classroom -- still snicker about ``the sin that knows no
name.''
 &HT;    Some of my gay and lesbian friends struggle with this heritage.
As Christians, they honor the Bible, trying to live as God would
have them. As homosexual people, they feel the weight of tradition
against them.
 &HT;    The struggle? To believe in a God whose people reviled and
persecuted them.
 &HT;    Of course, others have suffered similar biblical fates.
African-Americans were told the Bible cursed them to be slaves;
women were taught their intrinsic inferiority and wifely
submission; Jews became demonic ``Christ- killers.''
 &HT;    In each case, Christianity developed elaborate theological
systems based on a few biblical texts to keep people subject to the
cultural status quo and male authority.
 &HT;    Powerful though they were, these interpretations are just that:
interpretations. Gay Christians know they have been oppressed by
what people have said about the Bible -- not the Bible. It presents
a different message -- that of a loving God.
 &HT;    The straight community often fails to recognize the difference
between the text and interpretation. Instead, heterosexual
Christians enshrined their prejudices as ``biblical'' and reading
into the Bible ideas not contained therein.
 &HT;    For example, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is not -- as
commonly believed -- about homosexuality. It is about inhospitality
and violence. English mistranslations aside, the Bible never
actually uses the word ``homosexual.''
 &HT;    The Bible does not condemn what we know as homosexuality --
especially if a monogamous partnership. Tradition does, but most
Christians do not believe tradition infallible. Thus, rejecting bad
tradition in favor of biblical fidelity should be a compelling task
for believers.
 &HT;    Since the 19th century, many Christians have used biblical
criticism to keep the church from misinterpreting its scripture. As
a result, biblical arguments no longer justify slavery. Sermons no
longer identify Jews as the cursed children of Cain. Churches admit
women to full participation in ministry, not some second-class
status.
 &HT;    At some point in history, however, Christians believed these
offensive things -- as many still believe that homosexuality is an
``abomination'' against the Lord.
 &HT;    Homophobia is so pervasive that even those victimized by similar
biblical interpretations fail to recognize it. Only in the last two
decades have churches seriously engaged these issues. This has been
a slow, painful process -- not unlike the arguments surrounding
slavery and women's rights.
 &HT;    One day, as did abolitionism and feminism, the argument for full
inclusion of homosexuals in church and society will win. We will
look back and wonder why it was so hard to see gays and lesbians as
people -- not sinners.
 &HT;    For Matthew Shepard, however, the day did not come soon enough.
His broken body, hung as Jesus on the cross, gives the rest of us
courage to bear the pain of change.

 UNDATED: ... medical record.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite his state of mind, and over his mother's objections,
Post was asked to sign up for a protocol that involved stopping his
antipsychotic medication and taking three intravenous ``amphetamine
challenges'' so researchers could study the involuntary muscle
movements that are sometimes a side effect of antipsychotics.
</P>
<P>
   The medication was stopped to stir the involuntary hyperkinetic
movements, and the amphetamine was given to study whether it would
moderate the movements _ even though the stimulant was also known
to induce psychotic symptoms in people with mental illness,
according to the research protocol given to patients and their
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give him amphetamine, he's going to go through the roof,''
his mother, Beverly Post, remembered telling the researchers. She
adamantly objected to their plan to give her son, then 27, the
psychostimulant. ``He is a hyperactive person. He has been that way
all his life.''
</P>
<P>
   But armed with Neil Post's signed consent forms, the researchers
proceeded. After the second infusion of amphetamine, Post became
even more restless, unable to sleep, and verbally abusive,
according to his medical record. His reaction was so acute that the
third infusion was never given. His behavior alternated between
``modified catatonia'' and ``belligerent excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   Post, now 41 and with a new diagnosis of autism, recalled he
didn't like the pills he was asked to take or the brain scans and
other procedures he was asked to undergo in his two years in
research. It was a painful period he'd rather not discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'd rather talk about making music, particularly
playing the steel drum. He is a member of Potential Unlimited, a

</P>
<P>
   Chris Hart, a University of Maryland spokesman, said he cannot
comment on Post's care because ``we're always concerned about
issues of patient confidentiality.'' Hart said the Maryland
researchers are not available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   OPRR this year found the Maryland research center failed to
fully disclose the risks of medication withdrawal, both in the
1980s and today, and continues to have an open case against the
facility. It also cited the center for signing up people for too
many protocols at once. The investigation was prompted by testimony
that Beverly Post and another mother, Janice Becker, gave before a
presidentially appointed ethics commission last year, about their
children's experiences at the center.
</P>
<P>
   But Hart said that the federal agency also found ``we're doing
things the right way.'' The institution has ``suffered a lot,'' he
said, as a result of comments that cannot be countered because of
confidentiality restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland's assistant dean for research, Anne Newman Hirshfield,
said in a statement that ``we must stress that the OPRR's thorough
audit did not reveal significant instances of noncompliance with
regulations nor inadequate protection of human subjects. Several
areas were identified where we could improve our practices, and we
have implemented those suggestions.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that at her institution, ``we consider the protection
of human subjects of utmost importance. Therefore, we were
especially gratified that the Maryland Psychiatric Research
Center's additional protections for human subjects were considered
by the OPRR compliance site visitors to be `innovations (that) have
the potential to significantly enhance the informed-consent
process.'''
</P>
<P>
   In institutions across the country, others in a similarly
fragile mental state have been asked to sign up for studies
involving agents known to cause psychotic symptoms, according to
the Globe's review of the scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   At the Illinois State Psychiatric Institute, for instance, 20
patients who were hospitalized for ``acute exacerbation'' of their
symptoms were described as having given ``informed consent'' to a
study. That research used intravenous methylphenidate, or Ritalin,
to make ``possible the study of psychosis under controlled
laboratory conditions,'' according to the researchers' published
reports in 1990 and 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Half the patients experienced ``moderate to marked
deterioration,'' they noted, and two others became so psychotic
they could not finish the study.
</P>
<P>
   And at Hillside Hospital, a division of Long Island Jewish
Medical Center in New York, in long-running, federally funded
research that ultimately enrolled 70 people newly diagnosed with
schizophrenia, patients described as ``acutely psychotic'' were
said to give informed consent to ``challenges'' using Ritalin,
according to research reports in the 1990s. Family members also
reportedly gave consent. The medical center refused the Globe's
request for copies of the consent forms.
</P>
<P>
   Some Long Island mental health advocates apparently were never
told of the study, even though it had been ongoing for a decade and
all newly admitted schizophrenic patients at one time were being
asked to consent. Arnold Gould, who has a son with schizophrenia
and who founded the Long Island chapter of the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill in 1980, said he does not recall hearing about
the long-term study, even though the group meets regularly at the
hospital. He doesn't think that researchers deliberately hid this
research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I didn't ask the right question,'' Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Researchers defend methods
</P>
<P>
   in challenge studies
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers involved in challenge studies say they can tell the
difference between psychotic patients who are able to give informed
consent and those who cannot, and that they also try to obtain
consent from family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask them questions, present information, and ask them to
explain to you their understanding of what has been communicated,''
said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, who headed up the Hillside Hospital
study and is now a professor at the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have psychotic symptoms, it doesn't mean incompetence.
They can still have the necessary cognitive wherewithal to
understand what is being communicated to them and to determine the
meaning of things on a factually-accurate basis, even though they
are undergoing symptoms that affect their attention and judgment.
It is a matter of magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Appelbaum of the University of Massachusetts Medical
School, who has not done challenge studies himself but has
researched the ability of psychotic patients to consent, said
patients who are having psychotic symptoms often can function
``quite well'' in many areas of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have delusions and odd ideas about the CIA
investigating their backgrounds, or the FBI trailing them on the
street,'' he said. ``But that doesn't prevent them from
understanding what they need to buy at the supermarket that night
to make dinner, from understanding what is being proposed regarding
their entering into a research study.''
</P>
<P>
   Such statements fail to ring true for people who know firsthand
what psychosis feels like, and for ethicists who say researchers
have an inherent conflict when it comes to judging capacity to
consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sick enough to be in the hospital. I was in danger. I
was in no frame of mind to be making such a major decision about my
health,'' recalled Patricia Reynolds, who has bipolar disorder, or
manic depression, and was asked while she was having a major
delusional episode to enroll in a University of Cincinnati
treatment study in which some subjects received placebo pills
rather than medication. ``I had signed the papers because my
ability to make a reasonable, rational decision had been altered.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said she left the hospital when she ``realized that I
was being treated like a laboratory rat.''
</P>
<P>
   In any situation where acutely psychotic patients are asked to
sign up for a study when they are expecting treatment, ``you'd be
deluding yourself if you were looking for real consent,'' said
Alexander M. Capron, a University of Southern California professor
and member of the National Bioethics Advisory Commission, which is
renewing calls for research protections for the mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   Ethicists have a term to describe this problem with the way
research is conducted: therapeutic misconception.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost becomes impossible for patients and doctors to
distinguish between therapy and experiments. They look at it as all
part of treatment. That's a problem,'' said George Annas, chairman
of the health law department at Boston University School of Public
Health. He served as consultant to the 1970s national commission
that first called for special research protections for the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians who are doing this stuff don't think they're doing
bad things to people,'' he said. ``I don't think there are bad
people here. They want to do good. Patients want doctors to make
them better.''
</P>
<P>
   But when scientists get caught up in the lofty goal of advancing
research to benefit humankind, Annas said, ``they forget about the
humans right in front of them. They're overly enthusiastic. They
can't do both _ research and protect human subjects. They just
can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Katz, a professor emeritus of law, medicine, and psychiatry
at Yale who has served on national commissions examining ethical
concerns raised by Tuskegee and the human radiation experiments,
said the problem is a longstanding one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conflict ... is between the advancement of science and
protecting the inviolability of subjects of research,'' he said.
``Scientists do have a tendency to make concessions ... of not
protecting fully the inviolability of subjects of research. That is
a conflict that has been with us since the beginning of medical
science.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Consent forms fall
</P>
<P>
   short of full disclosure
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if the competence of a mentally ill patient were not an
issue, some consent forms clearly fail to fully disclose the risks
and goals of the research. This has been documented by OPRR
investigations and emerges clearly in comparisons of some consent
forms with scientists' research protocols and their accounts in
subsequent publications.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at UCLA, Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and
the University of Cincinnati, have acknowledged in letters and
sworn testimony that they have withheld information from mentally
ill subjects, either because the researchers did not want to
frighten the subjects out of participating, or because they thought
the information was unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   The consent form that UCLA researchers asked Gregory Aller and
Antonio LaMadrid to sign, for instance, was fairly innocuous in its
description:

   Americans get jiggly with it during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Kraft survey found that 75 percent of us include a
Jell-O concoction on the feast table at Thanksgiving. It seems that
amid the heaviness of the turkey, the stuffing, the mashed potatoes
and the gravy, celebrants want a dish that's lighter to the tooth.
</P>
<P>
   There's also, no doubt, a connection that all of the meal's
components, including the Jell-O, can be classified as nursery
foods _ easy-to-eat foods that we can handle from the cradle to the
grave.

DEBATABLE FORMS OF CONSENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Neil Post entered a University of Maryland research program
in 1984 he was suffering delusions, had illogical thoughts, and
felt driven to write trivial bits of information on scraps of
paper. Clinical researchers noted it all on Post's medical record.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his state of mind, they asked Post to sign a form
consenting to participation in a study involving amphetamine, a
stimulant known to stir psychotic symptoms in people with mental
illness.
</P>
<P>
   When Gregory Aller and Antonio LaMadrid signed up for a
long-running schizophrenia study at the University of California,
Los Angeles, researchers planned to stop their medication,
expecting to exacerbate their symptoms or trigger a relapse so more
could be learned about the disease. But the consent form said only
that the patients ``may improve, worsen, or remain unchanged'' or,
in a second reference, that ``new symptoms may occur.''
</P>
<P>
   For at least 25 years, psychiatric researchers at institutions
across the United States have asked people under acute mental
stress to sign forms consenting to experiments that in some cases
may drive them deeper into psychosis, that in effect may increase
their pain and suffering. Sometimes, researchers have fudged the
true purpose of their experiments and have glossed over the risks
patients face.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the research offered benefits, such as potentially
better medication, some patients have charged they were induced to
take part under circumstances that left them feeling pressured or
duped.
</P>
<P>
   These episodes, to be sure, represent only a small segment of
the broad field of psychiatric research. Hundreds of studies are
underway in which doctors and researchers are careful both to
disclose the nature of their projects and to prevent harm.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers conducting some types of studies have conceded
in court documents that they have not told mentally ill patients
the whole truth for fear of frightening them away from enrolling in
the experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers argue that the experiments hold out the potential
for future benefits, but critics argue that this does not excuse
the failure to adequately disclose the purpose or the risks of
research, or the enrollment of patients who are in a questionable
state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   For patients, the results can be agonizing.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-month amphetamine ``challenge'' and
medication-withdrawal study, Neil Post oscillated between catatonia
and belligerence.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Aller became psychotic during an 18-month withdrawal
study.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio LaMadrid committed suicide in 1991, three years after
his participation in the withdrawal phase of the UCLA study had
ended, but while he was still part of the study follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a quarter-century of efforts to protect the mentally ill
and efforts by psychiatrists to address persistent ethical
concerns, some of these tests continue, and the issue of consent
smolders. Medical watchdogs are especially concerned about studies
that offer no possible therapeutic benefits, such as experiments
that deliberately provoke pyschotic symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would anyone agree to be in these studies? If you were
really well-informed and you really knew what was going on, could
you possibly say yes?'' asked Leonard Glantz, a professor of health
law at Boston University School of Public Health. ``You don't make
psychotic people psychotic. You don't put diabetic people into
shock. You don't give people with heart disease heart attacks. It's
not an appropriate use of human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Glantz served as a consultant to a 1970s commission that called
for special research protections for the mentally ill. The
commission's proposals were never implemented because of opposition
from psychiatric researchers and bureaucratic inertia. But Glantz
remains convinced that no one _ mentally ill or not _ should be
asked to consent to psychosis-inducing experiments.
</P>
<P>
   At least four facilities in three states are still conducting
the symptom-exacerbation studies that raise disturbing questions
about patients' consent. Among the Globe's findings:
</P>
<P>
   _During the last two decades, researchers used patient consent
forms that failed to fully disclose the risks or purpose of studies
at the National Institute of Mental Health, UCLA, the University of
Maryland, and Veterans Affairs hospitals, according to a comparison
of consent forms with medical protocols and published studies.
Medical ethicists who reviewed the Globe's findings say the consent
forms raise serious ethical concerns.
</P>
<P>
   _During this same period, psychiatric researchers have been
found in violation of federal regulations requiring them to obtain
proper consent for psychiatric research at UCLA, the University of
Maryland, and the National Institute of Mental Health. UCLA changed
its consent process in response to a 1994 investigation, while
Maryland and NIMH changed their processes in response to
investigations this year.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Office for Protection from Research Risks, which is
part of the National Institutes of Health, has ongoing
investigations into research at the Bronx Veterans Affairs Medical
Center, New York State Psychiatric Institute, and the University of
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   _A committee reviewing research practices declared that some
consent forms for psychiatric studies are on the verge of being
``ethically unacceptable'' for failing to adequately describe the
risks of medication withdrawal. Overall, the President's Advisory
Committee on Human Radiation Experiments found that of all
contemporary studies it reviewed, nearly half were either ethically
unacceptable or raised serious ethical concerns; it said those
involving psychiatric patients raised the additional question of
competence to consent.
</P>
<P>
   _Researchers themselves, in behind-the-scenes admissions and
publications in scientific journals, have acknowledged withholding
information about the risks and aims of research from mentally ill
patients and recruiting actively psychotic patients from hospital
wards and emergency rooms, according to a Globe review of court
depositions and researchers' reports.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Codes aim to protect
</P>
<P>
   human research subjects
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such practices appear to violate basic principles designed to
protect human research subjects, first set down in the Nuremberg
Code of 1947 in the wake of Nazi medical experiments on imprisoned
populations, and later refined in the Helsinki Declaration of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   These experiments also appear to take advantage of the mentally
ill, a vulnerable group considered in need of special research
protection by numerous US commissions, beginning with one convened
in the 1970s in the wake of the Tuskegee, Ala., syphilis
experiments on blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The informed consent of individuals is absolutely essential,''
said Glantz, who reviewed the Globe's findings.
</P>
<P>
   There are some studies, like those known to make mentally ill
people psychotic, he added, that should not be conducted even if
risks are fully explained, the patients fully comprehend, and
consent is free of coercion _ the three requirements of meaningful
informed consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I ask, `Are you willing to jump from the third floor of a
building?,' and you say yes, can I do that research? No,'' said
Glantz. ``There are things that are wrong for me to ask you to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers defend their practices, saying they disclose what is
necessary, the studies do not injure, and the subjects willingly
give consent. They add that such research must go on if treatments
and the understanding of schizophrenia and other mental illnesses
are to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue comes down to informed consent. In a free country
like this, people are allowed to make an informed decision. They
need to be given the information they need to make an informed
decision,'' said Dr. David Shore, associate director for clinical
research at the National Institute of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a right to go through a temporary increase in
symptoms if they believe it will be beneficial to understanding the
causes of disease,'' Shore said. ``I often say that mental
disorders and altruism are not mutually exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wesley Alcorn, president of the national consumer council
for the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, vehemently
disagrees. ``Do you think people say, `Gee, I'll sign up for more
suffering?' Many of us suffer enough on our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Adil Shamoo, professor of biochemistry at the University of
Maryland School of Medicine, and editor of the journal
Accountability in Research, said even if researchers are candid
about their intentions, he finds particularly troubling studies
that recruit psychotic patients from emergency rooms for
experiments that either delay antipsychotic medications or
administer psychosis-provoking agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could people give informed consent when they are psychotic
and delusional?'' said Shamoo, whose son suffers from
schizophrenia. ``It is an oxymoron.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

Consent given under

<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Helping to advance research was probably far from Neil Post's
mind when he entered the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed with possible schizophrenia, he was so sick that he
suffered from religious delusions, had illogical thoughts, and
engaged in ritualistic behavior, like writing useless information
on pieces of paper, according to his medical record.

 UNDATED: ... and suicide.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   _There is evidence in researchers' sworn testimony, written
correspondence, citations by the federal Office of Protection from
Research Risks, and patients' own accounts that investigators have
routinely failed to fully disclose the true purposes of their
experiments, and withheld information about risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe's review of informed-consent forms for
symptom-exacerbation studies at the NIMH and four other leading
psychiatric institutions failed to turn up a single one in which
the researchers directly stated that a chemical agent would be used
purposely to exacerbate psychotic symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   When in 1993 researchers at the University of Maryland began
injecting schizophrenic patients with ketamine, the consent form
said only that the experiment's purpose was ``to study a medication
named ketamine for schizophrenia.''
</P>
<P>
   OPRR, the federal agency charged with protecting research
subjects, has found fault with informed consent practices of
psychiatric researchers at the University of Maryland; the
University of California, Los Angeles; and the National Institute
of Mental Health, and has ongoing investigations of the Bronx
Veterans Affairs Medical Center, New York State Psychiatric
Institute, and the University of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Such practices do not typify all psychiatric research. There is
much experimentation that does not put mentally ill subjects at
risk of harm, conducted by physicians who take pains to ensure that
subjects know what they're getting into.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no similar type of experimentation, in which
patients' symptoms are deliberately exacerbated for research
purposes only, on people of sound mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let researchers do things to people with mental illness
that we would never let them do to people with physical illness,''
said George Annas, chairman of the Health Law Department at Boston
University School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schizophrenia resists
</P>
<P>
   divulging its secrets
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As researchers note, schizophrenia is a poorly understood
illness that has resisted giving up its secrets. It afflicts about
one in every 200 adults, typically beginning in early adulthood.
The disease brings on delusions, hallucinations, and bizarre
thoughts (called positive symptoms) and often a striking lack of
outward emotion and extreme social withdrawal (negative symptoms).
It has no consistent course. Some experience an initial psychotic
episode and never relapse; others relapse repeatedly as the disease
becomes chronic.
</P>
<P>
   Symptom-exacerbation experiments were pioneered by Dr. David
Janowsky of Vanderbilt University. In 1974, he reported success in
developing a new tool for studying schizophrenia. He found that
giving schizophrenic patients methylphenidate (Ritalin) caused ``a
dramatic intensification of preexisting symptoms, such as
hallucinations and delusions,'' and that amphetamine also
exacerbated their psychosis. Both drugs are known to release
dopamine, a messenger chemical in the brain, and Janowsky's
experiments provided indirect evidence that the biological
mechanism of psychosis involved an overactive dopamine system.
</P>
<P>
   His work also established the idea that psychosis-inducing drugs
could be used as ``challenge agents'' to turn patients into models
for studying psychotic illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are uniquely human conditions and there is no animal
model for developing treatments,'' said Dr. Stephen Strakowski,
associate professor of psychiatry at University of Cincinnati
Medical School, who has used amphetamine as a challenge agent.
``Challenge tests are used to understand complex disorders, and
without them, we would lose a significant way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, researchers have turned to new types of
psychostimulants to conduct these studies. Their findings,
researchers say, may lead to better drugs. It is this prospect,
they say, that justifies risks to patients, and the psychic
distress they may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also say the psychotic symptoms they induce are
transient, usually lasting only a few hours, and generally cause
patients only modest discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are talking about is very short-lived increases in
symptoms that patients have experienced over years and decades,''
said Dr. David Shore, associate director for clinical research at
NIMH, where ketamine-challenge experiments are underway. ``To say
that increasing a particular symptom _ like hearing voices for a
couple of hours in somebody who has been hearing voices for 10
years _ is causing (suffering) rather seems like a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, who conducted methylphenidate challenge
tests for more than a decade at Hillside Hospital, a division of
Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York, acknowledged that
the induced symptoms are sometimes ``scary and very unpleasant.''
Some patients get worse, he said, ``but in my experience, the
symptoms never exceeded the range of severity that occurred in the
course of their illness previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Appelbaum, chairman of the psychiatry department at the
University of Massachusetts Medical School, said challenge studies
can be justified ``if the question researchers seek to answer is an
important one'' and the research subjects have given ``good
consent, adequate consent.'' Even the use of a drug like ketamine
can be justified, he said, as long as patients have given informed
consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigators (using ketamine) are quite persuasive, from
my discussions, that they are not causing outrageous levels of
harm,'' Appelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   But a different view emerges from the researchers' own medical
journal reports, from people who suffer from mental illness, and
from families of patients who have been in such studies. They tell
of fragile minds filled with pain and suffering, and of lives made
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific literature provides a few glimpses of individual
patients. This 1987 account by researchers at the National
Institute of Mental Health describes a patient with bipolar
disorder who was injected with methylphenidate: ``Within a few
minutes after the infusion, Mr. A experienced nausea and motor
agitation. Soon thereafter he began thrashing about uncontrollably
and appeared to be very angry, displaying facial grimacing,
grunting and shouting ... 15 minutes after the infusion, he
shouted, `It's coming at me again, like getting out of control.
It's stronger than I am.' He slammed his fists into the bed and
table and implored us not to touch him, warning that he might
become assaultive. Gradually over the next half hour, Mr. A calmed
down and began to talk about his experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That is what outside observers could see. Those who have lived
through psychotic episodes describe an interior landscape that can
be filled with fear and terror as delusions and hallucinations
become more florid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are psychotic, there are a lot of unusual processes
going on,'' said Michael Susko of Baltimore, who suffered a
psychotic break when he was 25 years old. He is editor of a book
about schizophrenia, ``Cry of the Invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You might be having death experiences, feeling like you are
dying and melting,'' he said. ``You give somebody a drug that
amplifies that, you run the risk of overwhelming them. It's like a
bad trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Marquit, founder of the National Artists for Mental
Health, has suffered from a variety of mental illnesses, including
manic depression, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive
disorder. Last fall, in preparation for a hearing held by the New
York State Department of Health, he gathered opinions from 25
mental health ``consumers,'' including some with psychotic
disorders, on symptom-exacerbation experiments. All objected
vigorously to the idea that such studies present little danger or
cause only minimal discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have it done to yourself and see how the symptoms are,''
Marquit said. ``Someone who doesn't experience this traumatizing
feeling, how would they know? With panic disorder, I feel like
jumping off the edge of the earth at times, it is so bad. I can't
imagine the rationale for exacerbating symptoms, especially a brain
symptom. If a person had an arrhythmia problem, would you speed the
heart up and say that it is OK because they are used to it?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether symptom-exacerbation experiments and the cutoff of
antipsychotic medication that often accompanies such research cause
long-term harm is a thorny issue. Although these experiments have
been ongoing for 25 years, the question hasn't been studied.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers argue that the temporary increase in psychosis does
not amount to a relapse. Although they acknowledge there is a
growing suspicion that acutely psychotic episodes may be toxic to
the brain, causing a type of scarring of neurons, they do not
believe exacerbation experiments are likely to trigger such damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a risk there,'' said Dr. Stephan Taylor, assistant
professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan, who has used
challenge agents to study anxiety and post-traumatic stress
disorder. ``My sense is that the sort of psychosis that reaches a
toxic level is much more significant than what a few doses of
amphetamine will produce. It's a fairly small risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question, however, is how exacerbation experiments
can be reconciled with a standard of good medical care that runs
contrary to such practices. Psychiatrists agree that patients do
best when physicians catch the psychosis at an early stage and
quickly curb their delusions and hallucinations with medications.
Relapse, often defined as a return of even moderate psychosis, is
seen as a life-threatening event that needs to be prevented. Most
clinicians believe that repeated relapses, particularly for a
person early in the course of the illness, lead to a worse
long-term outcome.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The joke about Bill Clinton is: When he drives
through a car wash in a convertible with the top down, somebody
else gets wet.
</P>
<P>
   The president turned the White House into Motel 1600 for rich
donors, but Al Gore was the first one to get into trouble for
making a few fund-raising calls from his office.
</P>
<P>
   The president had his way with a young intern, but it was Newt
Gingrich who got tossed out.
</P>
<P>
   The president told one of the biggest, fattest lies in history,
but the public wants to impeach the press.
</P>
<P>
   New York magazine took a poll this week and concluded that it is
the journalists covering the scandal who are all wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were justice, Cokie Roberts would resign, too,''
writes Michael Wolfe, in a cover story titled ``Impeach the
Media.'' ``It was her morality and personality that people voted
against.'' (Last I checked,  &UR; she &LR;  wasn't toying with an intern.)
</P>
<P>
   Some talking heads have been giving themselves a lashing. After
the election, George Stephanopoulos, the former Clinton adviser who
is an ABC commentator, apologized, ``We were all wrong, all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase President Clinton, it depends on what you mean by
``were'' and ``wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not smart for journalists to predict at the beginning of
the Lewinsky scandal that the president would be gone within days.
And it was wretched excess for the cable channels in search of
another celebrity death watch to turn into vultures with daily
``White House in Crisis'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   But the obsessiveness of the media does not justify the
wrongheaded, vituperative consensus that has been building in the
wake of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I was heartened by the way the voters weighed in with
common sense and proportionality, reacting allergically to
inquisitions and the prospect of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weeks since the election there has been too much
gloating from the White House and its supporters. And there has
been too much self-lacerating journalistic commentary misconstruing
the public reaction as a vindication of the president. He won. The
press lost. The press should get lost. Game over.
</P>
<P>
   In a nation ruled by polls and ratings, where even newspapers
hire focus groups to see what kind of news readers want, we are
losing sight of something we should have learned as teen-agers:
Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's right.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, the truth is employed only to the extent
that it's useful. When the Monica story broke, the president asked
Dick Morris to do a poll to tell him what would play better, the
truth or a lie.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said that he told his old pal he couldn't tell the truth
and survive, and Clinton replied, ``Well, we'll just have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   New York magazine, which included me among its mug shots, rains
a cascade of poll numbers showing that by big margins the public is
fed up with hearing about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   I know exactly how the public feels. I'm sick of hearing about
it, too.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that the scandal is there, and the president did
what he did and said what he said, and the consequences of what he
did and said have preoccupied the executive, the legislative and
the judicial branches of government for a year.
</P>
<P>
   To pretend otherwise, to submit robotically to the polls, to
take one's professional instructions from the wishes and whims of a
fickle electorate would be to abdicate the role the public says it
wants the press to play: covering the news.
</P>
<P>
   If the president had told the truth immediately, the story would
have died. But it is our job to undo the spin and look into the
lies and go the extra skeptical mile to see that there is no
cover-up. Moreover, all journalists are not like all other
journalists in the wild and woolly and recklessly fast era of the
24-hour news cycle of cable, the Internet and high-decibel
know-it-alls and gossips.
</P>
<P>
   The impure history of American government _ Vietnam, Watergate,
Iran-Contra _ proves that reporters have a duty to dig for the
truth, whatever the public thinks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger of making false equations between popularity
and rightness, between what is liked and what is true. The danger
is that next time, when the cover-up takes place in a less gray
area, reporters will look at the numbers and go home early.
</P>
<P>
   Next time, it may not be about sex and lies. It may be about
life and death.

CO-OP TALES: NAKED CAME THE COWBOY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TRACIE ROZHON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you're president of a co-op board, the
complaints just flood in. ``It's always the little stuff, like the
complaint last week about a guy who goes out in the hall every
morning to get his paper _ wearing nothing but a cowboy hat,'' said
Sylvia Shapiro, board president, lawyer and author of ``The Co-Op
Bible'' (St. Martin's Press), a new book subtitled ``Getting In,
Staying In, Surviving, Thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shapiro, a stylish woman of 48 with dark hair combed
straight up, seems to be thriving in her own red-brick postwar
``cond-op'' (a New York City invention: half condo, half co-op) at
Broadway and 9th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Her apartment, a duplex penthouse she obtained ``through
horse-trading and stealth maneuvering'' (see the introduction to
the book) just as the building was converting from rentals in 1990,
is immaculately appointed in a combination of Empire chaises
covered in claret-colored silk and a lot of Egyptian revival chairs
she found in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Her own building, she said, has few major squabbles. Yes, there
is the fellow in the cowboy hat. ``I haven't witnessed the
spectacle myself, so the matter is pending,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there was all that hate mail about the lack of lights on
our Christmas tree,'' she said ruefully. Ms. Shapiro has very
definite tastes _ this is clear from her apartment _ and she
deplored ``those tacky plastic ornaments we had.'' Aided by the
building superintendent, she hunted down antique mercury glass
balls. ``We called stores as far as Texas,'' she said. She
considered the effect ``splendid and elegant.'' Still the
complaints came: where were the lights?
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had a plastic wreath,'' she recalled. ``We'd just
renovated the lobby, and I didn't want to put nails in the new
walls to hang it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Ms. Shapiro lost on the lights: this Christmas, there will
be strings of pure white bulbs. But she won big on the wreath. ``I
got some designer topiary poinsettias,'' she said, smiling brightly
through her very red lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   With such attention to detail, it's not surprising that Ms.
Shapiro devotes a big section of her book, an $18.95 paperback, to
advising co-op shareholders how to navigate board restrictions on
renovations. One tip: Gain the neighbors' approval for any makeover
in advance. And get all board approvals in writing, even for minor
changes.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the legal-limbo nether region between her
occupancy of the penthouse as a renter and her occupancy as an
owner, Ms. Shapiro, it seems, embarked on a big renovation.
</P>
<P>
   In a subchapter titled ``Getting Away With Murder,'' she tells
how she began ripping up the apartment in what she calls ``not an
act of defiance but of ignorance.'' After she became president, she
says, she learned better.
</P>
<P>
   Although the book is full of legal advice _ with only a few
legalisms _ Ms. Shapiro, in her writing as well as her
conversation, likes to take chances. After a lengthy discourse in
her book on what to do if you are rejected by a co-op _ if
disappointed applicants suspect discrimination, they can turn to
state or municipal human-rights agencies _ she concludes the
chapter with what she now calls tongue-in-cheek advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these strategies seem like sure-fire winners?'' she
asks. ``Why not try a new approach calculated to hit board members
where it hurts (their egos) and sure to bring instant attention to
the cause?''
</P>
<P>
   Only half-kidding, Ms. Shapiro counsels readers who consider
themselves to be victims of co-op board harassment to take their
cause to the news media. If that's not your style, she says, ``slap
on a placard or hand out leaflets in the street in front of the
building.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shapiro's career, although eccentric, reflects a close
acquaintance with the city's bastions of higher learning. After
graduating from Barnard College, she made costumes for
Shakespearean plays. Tiring of that, she took a master's degree at
Columbia University in Renaissance art. Then she went to New York
University Law School and got serious about corporate law,
litigating for Stroock &AMP; Stroock &AMP; Lavan and for Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   But that bored her, too, and she started a business designing
garments intricately embroidered in Morocco and Egypt _ where she
picked up all those chairs, carting them back on planes and boats.
The business folded, and about that time she started remodeling her
apartment and wheeling and dealing for the co-op presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after all that,'' she said, ``I thought, What's left? I
guess I'll write a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she has a title for the sequel: ``The Man in the Cowboy Hat
and Other Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   CO-OP TIPS
</P>
<P>
   A few tips from ``The Co-Op Bible'' on those ghastly board
interviews:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Until these people are your friends (or at least your
neighbors), they are your potential enemies. If they ask you about
your last visit to a lawyer, it's OK to say you went to have a will
drawn up. Assuming they don't already know from their own checking
that you're involved in litigation, better play it close to the
vest or risk being labeled a troublemaker.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Be prepared to talk money, the book suggests. The buyer whose
finances are borderline can use the interview for rehabilitation.
If you can, make the grand gesture of offering to pay six months'
maintenance up front.
</P>
<P>
   _ Play the role. Like it or not, these interviews are often
family affairs. So do what's necessary _ ``bribe your youngsters
with the latest Nintendo game, promise them a pair of Air Jordans,
take them to Disneyland'' _ to insure their best behavior.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Take care not to give responses that are too pat, lest you
reveal that you are a product of your broker's coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Show that you are civic-minded but not power-hungry.'' Offer
to serve on a committee: ``It's hard to argue with someone who's
willing to get down and dirty in the garden.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Whatever you do, DO NOT say you want to run for the board.

TESTING TAKES A HUMAN TOLL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT WHITAKER   AND DOLORES KONG  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The light flickered on for Shalmah Prince one day in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a doctor's office, she spotted an article in ``U.S.
News &AMP; World Report'' on human radiation experiments conducted in
the 1950s. Her mind, she said, raced back to a wrenching experience
from her own past.
</P>
<P>
   She had been in an experiment of some type. Had she too been
used?
</P>
<P>
   Prince, a portrait artist who suffers from manic-depression, dug
into her medical history and documented a chilling story.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, she had been in an experiment in which investigators
withdrew her medication, did nothing as she became increasingly
manic, and then injected her with apomorphine, a chemical that
other researchers suspected could provoke psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   Prince became so delusional that she had to be placed in leather
restraints, a descent into madness that didn't fully subside for 10
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never the same person again,'' Prince said. ``My
perception of myself and who I was completely changed. I had a
sense of shame and embarrassment. Who would have ever thought that
doctors would create psychosis like that?''
</P>
<P>
   Prince's story provides a window into a troubling corner of
psychiatric research that continues to this day. She is one of more
than 2,000 mentally ill patients who over the past 25 years have
been ushered into a disturbing series of experiments by psychiatric
researchers exploring the biology of psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   In their own published accounts, doctors have told of injecting
mentally ill patients with drugs designed to exacerbate their
delusions and hallucinations. In prestigious journals, they have
described studies in which they withheld effective anti-psychotic
medication from desperate patients who stumbled into hospital
emergency rooms. In precise, clinical terms, they have reported how
they deliberately stopped giving medication to stabilized
schizophrenic patients in order to see how quickly they became sick
again.
</P>
<P>
   These studies were designed to gain knowledge that might lead to
improved treatments for schizophrenia and related illnesses. But
the experiments offered no possibility of therapeutic benefit to
the subjects and exposed them to some measure of psychic pain and
risk of long-term harm.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, this controversial line of experimentation has been
marked by repeated instances in which researchers failed to fully
disclose the risks to the mentally ill patients and obscured their
true purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the very themes of the story Shalmah Prince pieced
together:
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 14, 1983, fearing the onset of a manic episode despite
the lithium she had been taking for two years, Prince went to
University Hospital in Cincinnati seeking help. Her medical records
show that she arrived well-groomed, in control of her emotions, and
thinking fairly clearly.
</P>
<P>
   Standard procedure would have been to test the lithium level in
her blood and adjust the dosage, but that's not what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Prince signed a consent form that said she was agreeing to take
part in a study designed to ``clearly diagnose her illness.'' In
their research protocol, however, the psychiatrists said the
purpose of the study was to explore ``schizophrenia subtypes,''
based on the patients' response to apomorphine. The consent form
didn't mention any risks associated with stopping the medication,
even though Dr. David Garver, who ran the study, later acknowledged
in a sworn deposition that without medication, the research
subjects might ``have a delusion that they were capable of flying,
leap out a window, (and) injure themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They assured me they were there to treat me,'' Prince
recalled. ``And I just wanted to be kept safe. I knew that I didn't
have insurance and that I was extremely vulnerable. I needed help
and a regular doctor was $150. So I was really stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   Without her lithium, Prince quickly deteriorated. By the fourth
day she was wildly manic, yelling and threatening suicide. She also
``got in the face'' of another patient, she said, and he started
beating her. Still, she was given no medication.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth day, researchers injected her with apomorphine. Her
manic and delusional behavior soared. During the next three days,
when her friends and family visited, they found her in restraints,
a humiliation that has never left her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything they did to me was for the purposes of their
research,'' she said, her voice tinged with bitterness even today.
``As my medical record shows, when I went into the hospital I was
calm and cooperative. I was just worried and vulnerable. I came out
thinking I was crazy, and my parents thinking I was crazy, and my
friends thinking I was crazy. My family and I believed that every
psychotic feeling and behavior was natural to me, rather than
caused by their experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   The final blow came when she got a hospital bill. Prince was
asked to pay nearly $15,000 for the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Ken Faller, who defended Garver and his coresearcher,
Dr. Jack Hirschowitz, in a lawsuit brought by Prince, sees her
experience differently. ``No one disputes that patients ought to be
given information concerning meaningful risks,'' he said. ``In her
particular case ... we don't believe that there were significant
undisclosed risks involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the judge in Prince's lawsuit said he found the facts
troubling, he dismissed Prince's case, saying she should have filed
her complaint within two years of the experiments. Faller also said
that the hospital forgave more than three-quarters of her bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did receive treatment and the treatment benefited her to
this day,'' he said. ``She was a sick person when she went into the
hospital and she came out seemingly in pretty good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric researchers
</P>
<P>
   called for an accounting
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prince's story, and scores of clinical reports of schizophrenia
studies in scientific journals, evoke troubling echoes of past
stains on American medicine. Perhaps the most notorious are the
post-World War II radiation experiments that Shalmah Price read
about and the 1932 to 1972 Tuskegee syphilis studies in which
infected black men were denied treatment, blots on the remarkable
achievements of US medical researchers in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Even as psychiatric researchers boast they are now gaining
insights into the biology of psychotic illnesses, they are being
asked to account for how that knowledge was gained.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Tuskegee or the Cold War radiation studies, this line
of psychiatric research, much of it federally funded, is ongoing.
This year, according to research protocols obtained by the Globe,
Yale University physicians have been recruiting people with
schizophrenia for experiments in which they will hospitalize them,
stop their medications, and infuse them with tetrahydrocannabinol,
the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia University researchers have been giving amphetamine to
schizophrenic patients so they can take images of their brains
while they are psychotic. At the National Institute of Mental
Health, in Bethesda, Md., researchers have been injecting ketamine,
the chemical cousin of the notorious street drug angel dust, into
unmedicated schizophrenic patients.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberate withdrawal of medication for experimental purposes is
an element in other active schizophrenia studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (these experiments) are in a category that is worse
than Tuskegee and the radiation experiments,'' said Adil Shamoo,
professor of biochemistry at the University of Maryland School of
Medicine and founder of the journal Accountability in Research.
``There are large numbers (of subjects), and these are current
practices. Do they cause harm? Of course they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Shamoo, who has an adult son with schizophrenia, has been a
leading critic of symptom-exacerbation and medication-withdrawal
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe, in a three-month investigation, found a trail of both
harm and deceit.
</P>
<P>
   _Since 1972, psychiatric researchers have used a variety of
agents _ L-dopa, amphetamine, methylphenidate, m-cholorophenyl
piperazine, ketamine, and tetrahydrocannabinol _ to deliberately
provoke psychotic symptoms in more than 1,200 schizophrenia
patients. In some instances, the chemicals drove the psychosis to
levels the researchers called ``severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Symptom-provocation experiments like these have been conducted
by prominent researchers at the National Institute of Mental Health
and at close to a dozen leading medical schools. They have drawn
their psychotic subjects largely from outpatient clinics, Veterans
Affairs hospitals, state mental institutions, and emergency rooms _
settings that regularly provide care to the poor and uninsured. In
the few studies that recorded the ethnic makeup of patients, 54
percent were minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Symptom-exacerbation studies do not appear to have been
conducted in Massachusetts, but prominent researchers here defend
the approach.
</P>
<P>
   _In the '80s and early '90s, researchers conducted experiments
in which they withdrew medications from schizophrenic patients
whose condition was stabilized, including some living in community
settings, and studied them until they had a full relapse. The
prevailing view is that following a relapse, particularly the first
one after a psychotic break, patients may never return to the same
level of functioning. During a relapse, schizophrenic patients are
also at a dramatically higher risk of self-injury and suicide.

<P>
   Thanksgiving is right around the corner, so it's time to start
at least contemplating Christmas baking. Here is our annual
collection of Christmas favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Cowtown's favorite fruitcake: Marty Aronowitz shared this recipe
with the Star-Telegram in 1964. He died in 1986, but we repeat this
recipe every year with memories of all the pounds of fruitcake he
made, and the city made, with his recipe. Don't expect a cakelike
consistency; this is a chewy fruitcake combination.
</P>
<P>
   MARTY ARONOWITZ'S FRUITCAKE
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Keep 'em busy: Here's an easy project to do with the kids over
the long Thanksgiving weekend.
</P>
<P>
   CINNAMON ORNAMENTS
</P>
<P>
   2 cups cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons white glue, see note
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 to 2 cups water (less on humid days)
</P>
<P>
   Note: Elmer's Glue can be used, but don't use Elmer's School
Glue, because it is designed to be washed out of clothes when a
project gets messy.
</P>
<P>
   Combine all ingredients and mix well. Mixture should be a
consistency that can be kneaded.
</P>
<P>
   After kneading, roll out mixture to about 1/4-inch thickness.
Cut with cookie cutters. Dip fingers in water before smoothing any
rough edges. While ornament is still wet, stick a straw near the
top of cut-out shape to make a hole for a ribbon to hang finished
decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Ornaments need to air-dry slowly and should be turned twice a
day. Avoid putting decorations under air vents _ drying too quickly
can cause them to crack. Drying takes 2 days to a week, depending
on humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon ornaments can be decorated with acrylic paint. Don't go
overboard with paint, or you will smother some of the cinnamon
smell.
</P>
<P>
   Ornaments can be saved from one year to the next. Brushing with
cinnamon oil will rejuvenate the cinnamon smell annually. Requests:
</P>
<P>
   Betty Tobin would like a recipe for a fruitcake popular in the
1950s or '60s. It's a light cake that isn't baked and includes
cherries, candied fruit and nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Bailey of Fort Worth would like a recipe for a fudge pie
that was popular in the late 1960s. It's made with cocoa,
evaporated milk, butter and pecans and topped with meringue.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Harrison is trying to track down a hamburger sauce that she
says disappeared in the 1960s. She believes the burger place (in
Fort Worth's Camp Bowie Boulevard area) was called Goff's. The
burgers were cooked over a wood fire and had a great ``secret''
sauce. Can anyone help?

   Many woodworkers frown upon the use of stain for coloring wood.
They feel that it is too often used to disguise inferior and
uninteresting wood (pine or poplar) to make it appear more like
high-quality wood (walnut or mahogany). Still, many professional
cabinet makers and furniture craftsmen find that there are a number
of legitimate reasons to color wood with stain.
</P>
<P>
   Woods often have light colored patches that contrast strongly
against darker areas. Staining can be used to bring the extremes
closer together for greater harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Stain can also be used to subtly alter the tone of wood. Thomas
Chippendale, for example, often used a walnut-colored stain in an
attempt to mute the reddish cast of mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   Stain can also be used to disguise the fact the different woods
have been used to make one piece of furniture, for example, a
Windsor chairs with seats made of soft wood; arm rests, legs and
stretchers of maple; and crests of hickory or white oak. Restorers
often use stain when they make replacement parts, like a drawer
front or leg. They stain the newly fashioned piece so it matches
the hue of the surrounding wood.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, stain can also be an effective wood preservative.
Exterior grade stains can be used to protect wood from the damaging
effects of the ultraviolet rays of the sun and from insect and
fungus attack.
</P>
<P>
   Stain may be loosely defined as any transparent or translucent
agent used to color wood. Unlike paint, which has pigment suspended
in a binder, the coloring agent in stain is a dye that is dissolved
in liquid. Thus, the color penetrates into the wood fibers, rather
than resting in a surface film like paint.
</P>
<P>
   Some stains are simply coloring agents; others are formulated
with polyurethane or varnish so that staining and finishing can be
combined in one operation. One drawback to using finish-stains is
that the some of the color will remain in the finish. If the finish
chips or wears away, the color will go with it, leaving a light
patch that contrasts with the rest of the wood.
</P>
<P>
   The most common type of stain is oil stain. The liquid solvent
is usually a petroleum spirit. Most formulations also have a binder
to hold the pigment in the wood once the solvent has evaporated.
Oil stains should only be applied in one coat; otherwise the binder
will build up and create a varnish-like finish.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of shades and hues can be concocted by mixing
different colors of stain. If you try this, however, avoid mixing
different brands, because the ingredients in oil-based stains are
not always be compatible between brands. Oil-based stains are
readily available in most paint and hardware stores; for that
reason they are usually the first choice for do-it-yourselfers.
</P>
<P>
   Water-based stains are fast drying (this can be a disadvantage
if you are coloring large surfaces) and produce softer colors than
the oil-based stains, but they have a tendency to raise the wood
grain. It is usually necessary to sand the surface after applying
them. Traditional water-based stains do not have a binder and may
be applied in successive coats to create darker hues. New
water-based stains are formulated with acrylic polymer binders.
</P>
<P>
   Aniline dyes are manufactured from coal tar. They are usually
sold in powder form and must be mixed with either petroleum
solvents or water. They are available in a wide range of colors and
can be readily mixed to match almost any existing hue. For this
reason, they are favored by restorers or manufacturers looking to
create dramatic color effects. Aniline dyes have a very short
working time; most professionals apply them by spraying.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to apply stain, but care must be exercised
so the final color is uniform and without streaks. For best
results, stain should brushed on (with a brush reserved exclusively
for stain) in the direction of the grain. Stain the entire surface;
then use a lint-free rag, dipped it in stain and wrung out, to wipe
off the excess. Always work with the grain. Allow the stain to dry
before applying the finish.

   NEW YORK _ The wellness biz is in strapping good health and
growing like a weed _ or rather, a ginkgo tree. These days,
invoking the word ``spa,'' with all of its Rorschach associations _
pampering, cleansing, oases, antitoxins and the leaf of that stinky
tree _ can rejuvenate everything from shampoos and sheets to forks
and furniture, and now the much-anticipated W, a business hotel and
spa set to open Dec. 1 within the shell of the modestly drab Doral
Inn after an $80 million facelift.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty salons and gyms have already discovered the potency of
the S-word. When the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon _ a Manhattan
pilgrimage for women of a certain age since 1910 _ reopened last
year after a $5 million renovation, it was rechristened the
Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon and Spa. The idea was to attract a
hipper, more health-conscious clientele with offerings like the Sea
Spa Pedicure (described as ``a facial for the feet'') and the
forthcoming wellness lecture series.
</P>
<P>
   In early November, the Avon lady hit the ground running with the
20,000-square-foot Avon Centre Spa, Salon and Store in the Trump
Tower, where it is possible to partake of exotic ablutions like the
Aromatherapy Salt Glow Escape. Not to be outpaced, Helena
Rubinstein plans to open a $6 million spa and shop in Soho next
April.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, the wellness theme is showing up in products
and projects well beyond the water's spray. Source Perrier,
purveyors of the elixir water, has unleashed a torrent of home
furnishings, from hurricane lamps to napkins embroidered with, yes,
ginkgo leaves. In October, Wamsutta brought out sheets in what it
described as ``therapeutic colors'' (crystal, spa, aloe, oasis),
``healing fabrics'' (cotton, chenille) and patterns inspired by
nature (again, that leaf). In case you forgot, extract from the
300-million-year-old ginkgo is thought to enhance the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren's spring collection of sea-grass tables and woven
rattan and blond wood beds (described as a ``therapeutic
environment'') was named Spa until his lawyers advised a switch to
something more generically holistic: Naturals. Even J. Peterman,
the mail-order outfit, has designated six ``spa'' pages in its new
catalog for selling diverse items like ``spa storage boxes,''
cashmere sweater sets, chrome shower heads and a limited-run
reprint of a 1920s poster of a Belgian spa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spa concept is traveling at an incredible rate,'' said
Barbara Caplan, a partner in Yankelovich Partners, the research and
consulting company. ``We've been watching it like a hawk. It used
to mean just losing weight _ my mother went to milk farms _ but it
moved on to pampering in the most general sense. We're expecting it
to be marketed to a fare-thee-well.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter W, the boutique hotel at Lexington Avenue and 50th Street,
with a 10,000-square-foot spa and health club. The hotel, by
Starwood Hotels and Resorts, is the most ambitious extension yet of
this all-purpose feel-good brand _ although spending the night
there last week, in the final stages of its renovation, turned out
to be anything but relaxing as jackhammers serenaded guests from
dawn to dusk. While the hotel never closed during construction, it
certainly won't be able to offer its spa services full tilt until
the grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the first things we talked about in brainstorming was
designing the hotel from the spa outward,'' said David Rockwell,
the Manhattan architect, known more for zeal than Zen. ``It
permeates every part of the project.'' For starters, visitors will
be offered a glass of juice on checking in at a front desk
decorated with potted herbs.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the standard personality of the boutique hotel has
been mercilessly chic and darkly atmospheric. W takes the opposite
tack with a double-height lobby with enough pale wood to camouflage
a snow dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotel as evening spot and club has been explored to death,
but the idea of leaving a light and airy hotel feeling better than
when you came _ that's entirely unique in New York,'' Rockwell
said, adding, ``I mean, where do all of us who don't look like
models go?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but will ``We met over juice'' resonate in the business
crowd that is meant to be the core clientele? If the answer is no,
there's also a whiskey bar.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, W goes overboard in the pursuit of spa-ness. Fruits
and vegetables not only will be available at the juice bar, but are
also printed on upholstery, photographically transferred onto
plaster walls, submerged in gigantic aqua bottles and amassed in
Joseph Cornell-like boxes on the lobby wall and in each room
(asthmatics, beware). The ubiquitous ginkgo appears in a two-story
window wall, a balcony, bathroom transoms and elevator ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby hits geological overdrive with its loaded array of
natural materials. The front desk is quarried schist; the wall
dividing the lobby and restaurant (offering healthful fare from
Drew Nieporent) is of limestone. The floors are slabs of Kota
stone; in the bar, sheets of mica are lighted from behind. The
lobby columns are sheathed in billowing silk. Some cocktail tables
look like tree stumps; others have tops of crushed sunflower seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in the hotel was custom-designed by the Rockwell
Group or made by artisans. ``In today's society, we overdesign
everything,'' said Barry Sternlicht, the chairman of Starwood
Hotels and Resorts. ``I kept steering Rockwell to less is more, but
I'm not sure I succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   If the public spaces offer an extreme-sport version of calm, the
bedrooms are an abstinence diet. The rooms _ there are 720, about
70 more than in the Doral; rates range from $279 to $425 a night _
are generally tiny: the width of a queen-size bed and a television
set. There are no bureaus, no bedside tables, no drawers in the
desk. There is a patch of grass on the windowsill and a watering
can.

 NEW YORK: watering can.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bedding is amply plush: a feather bed with a goose-down
comforter whose border is etched with phrases that might have been
penned by an Iron John blissed out after a too-tight seaweed wrap:
``Dance With Abandon,'' ``Sleep With Angels,'' ``Dream With
Lucidity,'' to recite a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent the money on the bed _ it's where we started,''
Sternlicht said. ``I interviewed John Pawson, the minimalist, but I
didn't want people sleeping on rocks. A quiet, clean room with a
great bed and great water pressure _ that's all people really want.
Oh, and good movies on the TV. There's nothing worse than it's 9:55
and four movies to pick from _ there'll be a little spice in the
collection.'' That is, if the New York scene weren't racey enough.
</P>
<P>
   The spa fills a double-height space on the fourth floor but is
not yet finished. Besides saunas and massage rooms, more esoteric
treatments will be on order, including shirodhara, a treatment
involving hot herbal oil dripping on ``the third eye''; Javanese
lulu, a cleansing rub meant for Javanese brides on their wedding
day, and aura-photographic imaging and analysis: ``Gain a new
perspective about your emotions and well-being,'' the brochure
says. How about a new perspective on sagging sales figures?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've bastardized the spa concept,'' said Monica Tuma Brown, a
spa consultant. ``Americans take relaxation too seriously, and we
constantly filter everything through work. So now if you attach the
word `spa' and spend some money, it's OK to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   As the number of companies offering yoga classes and masseuses
increases (at Rockwell Group, there is a part-time ``health and
wellness director'') and as the lines between work and leisure
continue to dissolve, hotels like W, bent on delivering facials as
well as faxes, may become more of a norm.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to Paul Wilmot, a publicity agent for the new
Rubinstein spa. ``We've all become students of spas,'' he said.
``I'm 52, and I work a lot harder than my 52-year-old ancestors.
I've got to go out to dinner three times a week. I fly to Europe
five times a year. I need to feel better! For me, going to a spa is
a near-religious experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caplan, of Yankelovich, has come to believe that the trips
she takes twice a year with her husband to spa country are an
essential luxury. ``It just fits so many needs,'' she said. ``We
won't be seeing the end of this one for quite some while.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ginkgo can survive the Ice Age, it can surely survive all
this.

WEB SITE FOR CRASH VICTIM FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ga., Texas)   (af)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After the crash of Swissair Flight 111, the airline
gave the grieving familes of the victims all the help customarily
offered in such disasters. It brought them to Halifax, booked them
in hotels and bused them to the crash site. But then it gave them
something more unusual: space on the airline's web page to speak
out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on a new different bulletin board, set up on Yahoo, the
families are pouring out their souls about the crash. It is a new
way of grieving that has also been used by families of the victims
of other crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bit strange for me; I don't really know what to
write or how to begin,'' said one posting, by a woman named Mette,
who said her father died in the Sept. 3 crash that took 229 lives.
``I just feel a need to. I want to try all possible ways of dealing
with all the emotions and confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am wondering if there are any other people out there around
my age (19) who lost someone on the flight and would like to
communicate with me,'' Mette continued.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, a woman who lost both her parents on the plane
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Swissair's offer of space on its web site, relatives of
the victims said they ultimately decided to move to Yahoo because
they felt that they needed a more neutral space.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Hawkins, whose cousin, Jay Jasan, died on the flight,
said the Swissair site ``kind of felt funny,'' partly because they
knew Swissair personnel were reading their postings.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Gerety, who lost a brother, Pierce, on the plane, asked
his 13-year-old son to handle the technical aspects of the
bulletein board. The boy created a Yahoo club, a combination of
message boards, chat rooms, e-mail message lists, member lists, a
links area, calendars and archive information.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a 13-year-old,'' said Gerety, who is a public
defender in Connecticut and said he could not have set up the
bulletin board on his own.
</P>
<P>
   The site has a counter to monitor usage: it recently showed 35
members logged in, with a total of 1,019 page views for the day,
and three new members who had joined the club.
</P>
<P>
   For now, everyone can read their postings. But Gerety and Ms.
Hawkins, who are the acting chairman and vice-chair of an
organization of Swissair-disaster families announced early this
month, said they would create a private bulletin board once they
had more relatives signed up.
</P>
<P>
   The organization can be reached at
clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/familiesofswissairflight111. The family
association can be reached by mail at P.O. Box B, Redding Ridge,
Conn. 06876.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives from this crash and previous ones said that some of
the characteristics that are generally seen as e-mail's weaknesses
suddenly become strengths for people trying to cope with a crash,
especially the detached nature of the communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sit down and put your thoughts down,'' said Jane B.
Lathem of Alpharetta, Ga., whose son, Ray W. Lathem, died on the
crash of Valujet Flight 592 in May, 1996. ``People find it easier
to open up when they're not face-to-face. The site is at
flight592.com
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Swissair postings show people grapping both with
grief and a new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I have written a message at this site,
or any other for that matter. I'm really not really sure what to
write, but I feel that I really want to,'' wrote Linda Arnmark,
whose father, Per Spanne, was on the flight. ``Maybe writing to you
all is a good way to deal with what has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   James N. Landrum, of Plano, Texas, whose wife's sister, Terri
Bell, died on the Valujet flight, said he pays $15 a month for the
40 megabytes of disk space it takes to run the site Landrum, a
computer systems engineer, said he is trying to get the transcript
of the National Transportation Safety Board's hearing from a CD-ROM
unto the web site, but the CD-ROM stores the transcript as pictures
of pages, not text files, and converting it is laborious.
</P>
<P>
   Landrum said that message traffic picked up around the second
anniversary of the crash and again when the Swissair plane crashed.

   The Real Mango
</P>
<P>
   Q. In summer 1997, I planted a mango seed in a window box. This
year, to my delight, I have a beautiful plant with light lilac
color flowers that close and fall off, leaving a round bulb with
points or needles. These bulbs (at least seven or eight) are
growing larger in size. Am I growing mangoes?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not even close, I'm afraid. Judging from the lavender
flowers, spiny fruit and spontaneous appearance, you're probably
growing a datura or some other kind of solanacious weed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it is, ``it's certainly no mango,'' said Dr. Richard
Campbell, curator of tropical fruit at Fairchild Tropical Gardens,
a research center and display garden in Coral Gables, Fla. He
continued: ``Mangoes have whitish or yellowish flowers. They take a
long time to fruit, 4 to 10 years. And by then they'll be anywhere
from 7 to 30 feet tall, depending on variety and conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangoes are big trees, he said, ``pretty tough to fruit in a
container.'' They make nice foliage house plants, though, with
broad, shiny leaves and a vigorous though somewhat leggy habit.
(Mangoes will bush out a bit if pinched, but their main thrust is
upward.)
</P>
<P>
   To grow one from seed, start with a domestic mango. Imported
ones are heat treated to be certain they don't bring along alien
pests like fruit flies, and the seeds of treated fruit won't
sprout. Once you have got a likely seed, remove the leathery
coating and plant the seed about 1/2 inch deep in well-drained
potting soil. It doesn't matter whether the seed is lying flat or
standing on edge. Put it in a warm place, 75 to 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Once started, it will grow quickly with a lot of bright light
and a little neglect. Let the soil dry out almost completely
between waterings, and feed sparingly, using only liquid fertilizer
diluted to half strength, to avoid burning the sensitive roots.
</P>
<P>
   Too Much Smothering
</P>
<P>
   Q. Three years ago, I transplanted three rhubarb plants. I
smother them with manure early in spring, during the summer and at
the end of the summer. Yet, all I get are thin stalks, although
they came from a plant that gave my friends wide stalks.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds like you might be smothering them more than they
can stand. Rhubarb is a heavy feeder it's true, and composted
manure is a fine fertilizer, especially if you are using what my
neighbors call ``hen dressing.'' But too much of a good thing is
still too much; one generous application each year should be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Heap it on in late fall, after the plants have gone fully
dormant, or in early spring, before they start active growth. Give
them a side dressing of compost in midspring and a small amount of
balanced commercial fertilizer _ or more composted manure _ when
you are almost done harvesting. Be sure to mulch heavily. Rhubarb
does best when its roots stay cool and get plenty of moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Thin stalks may simply mean that the plants are young and not
yet well established, but they can also indicate overcrowding.
Rhubarb plants should be at least three feet apart in all
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Shade might also be the culprit. Although rhubarb will survive
low-light conditions, it must be grown in full sun to produce
thick, flavorful stalks.

BOOT 'IM OUT FOR ABUSING THE MILITARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As long as Congress is geared up to put Bill Clinton's feet to
the fire in impeachment hearings, here's a suggestion: Instead of
impeaching the president of the United States for his tawdry sexual
proclivities and his pathological aversion to the truth _ both of
which were well-known to voters before they elected him not just
once but twice _ why not impeach Clinton for a high crime and/or
misdemeanor that amounts to something?
</P>
<P>
   Why not impeach the president for aggravated incompetence in his
role as commander in chief of the nation's armed forces?
</P>
<P>
   If members of the House Judiciary Committee truly want to
examine Clinton's fitness for office, why don't they start by
taking a look at the stunt he pulled last weekend _ ordering
military strikes against Iraq and then changing his mind at the
last minute?
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rehashing Clinton's intimate moments with Monica
Lewinsky, why doesn't the committee investigate Clinton's chronic
recklessness in cavalierly deploying U.S. troops to far corners of
the globe for purposes that have nothing to do with national
security? Why don't these congressional patriots who seem to equate
sex acts with acts of treason set aside Ken Starr's salacious
account of Clinton's private life and demand that the president
account for his outrageous misuse of America's fighting forces?
</P>
<P>
   Why doesn't Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde swear in
some military experts who can explain to the country what happens
to morale when soldiers are constantly alerted to expect imminent
combat and then told time and time again to stand down because the
alert was just another false alarm?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Hyde and these other politicians who are screaming for
impeachment could ask the military experts what happens to
preparedness when troops are shipped off to distant outposts for a
one-year tour of duty only to have the tour extended and extended
and extended _ with no clearly defined mission to carry out and no
clue when their thankless assignment might end.
</P>
<P>
   Security-conscious members of Congress are well aware that
morale and readiness have plummeted during Clinton's presidency;
that professional soldiers are abandoning their military careers
for better jobs elsewhere; and that America's enemies and potential
enemies are patiently biding their time until they are confident
that they have nothing to fear from the world's lone remaining
superpower.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant fighting force that President Bush deployed with
such spectacular results in the Persian Gulf War has deteriorated
on Clinton's watch to the point that it's fair to wonder if this
president keeps letting Saddam Hussein off the hook because of a
philosophical antipathy for military action _ or because the
commander in chief knows that the United States is no longer
equipped to carry out significant military objectives.
</P>
<P>
   You want to impeach Bill Clinton? Let's impeach him for the high
crimes and misdemeanors of squandering our nation's status as the
world's boldest defender of freedom; of destroying the morale of
the world's greatest soldiers; of kowtowing to a two-bit dictator;
of abdicating U.S. leadership to appeasement-minded pacifists such
as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insists that this was the last time he intends to let
Saddam slither out of the bull's-eye. If the Iraqi dictator breaks
his promise to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors one more
time, Clinton says, well, no kidding, really, we're gonna let him
have it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope he means it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says that this time was Saddam's last chance. OK. Will
the next time be Clinton's last chance to prove that he's up to the
job that the polls say 70 percent of Americans want him to keep,
despite his detractors' efforts to take it away from him?
</P>
<P>
   One more capitulation to Saddam might have plenty of Americans
thinking that the president should be impeached _ not for having
sex and lying about it, but for felonious failure to do his job.

 &HT;    Crab appetizer should fill the bill come holidays
 &HT;    By Marsha Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a long wait for Cele Bullis of Gainesville, Ga., who
wrote in July asking for a recipe for a crab appetizer she had
enjoyed at Winston's restaurant in Roswell, Ga., which is now
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Few responses came, and none claimed to be Winston's formula.
Most were similar to this one, sent by Judy Abbott of Acworth, Ga.,
who said she tried them at a clambake in Fairview Park, Ohio.
``They were delicious,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullis, meanwhile, doesn't believe Winston's recipe included
cheese, unless it was cream cheese, so we'll keep looking and hope
that in the meantime, she, and you, will enjoy this one. It's easy
to make and freeze, just waiting for drop-by company during the
holidays.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: A HOUSE THAT TRIES TO KEEP UP WITH TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ No matter how many rooms or closets you have
in the house, there is seldom enough space for time. That's one
reason why architecture continues to evolve. Architects have but a
brief interval to go out and greet the present before time slips
away.
</P>
<P>
   In the outskirts of Bordeaux, Rem Koolhaas has designed a house
for the millennium. It is a space for facing the unknown: for risk,
mystery, surprise and suspense, a house where floors and walls
disappear, and inside merges with outside in a sparkling play of
reflections.
</P>
<P>
   The place is haunted by flickering memories of Edgar Allen Poe
and his fearless, youthful descendants, the Hardy Boys, Frank and
Joe. At any minute, Nancy Drew will pull up in her roadster,
looking for her boyfriend, Ned, or to ask directions back to River
Heights, the town she left behind. But the place has already become
a prime destination for architecture fans who look toward Koolhaas
to find a way to the here and now.
</P>
<P>
   To get into the spirit of this building, it helps to go back to
the symbolists, the poets and artists who, at the end of 19th
century, reacted against realism and began exploring moods,
atmospheres, perversities, fears and other subjective realms. The
movement as such did not penetrate far into architecture. The
swirls and tendrils of Art Nouveau designers evoked some symbolist
motifs: Edvard Munch's and Redon's graphic splashes in the waves of
the subconscious. Some later work by Le Corbusier (the chapel at
Ronchamp) and a few landscaped buildings by Luis Barragan are
arguably symbolist in their use of color, light, shadow and form,
to evoke emotional depth.
</P>
<P>
   It is surprising, however, to see such qualities surfacing in a
contemporary house. But this house was conceived under unusual
circumstances. The owner, a newspaper publisher, had already
decided to build his family a new home when he was injured in an
automobile accident that caused internal injuries and cost him the
use of his legs.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the client had already decided to move from a town
house in the center of Bordeaux and had asked several architects to
compete for the design of a new home in the city's lush suburbs.
After the accident, he decided it would be easier to work with one
architect, and awarded the commission to Koolhaas, who is based in
Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The result, though not yet fully
furnished, has already become a mecca, one of those rare buildings
people feel they must visit to see what the present looks like.
</P>
<P>
   You approach the house through a forecourt enclosed on three
sides by Barragan-like walls, thin, horizontal slabs of concrete
pierced by wide rectangular arches. A moon gate is on one wall. In
front of the house, the driveway spirals in on itself and tapers to
a sharp point. The shape brings to mind the Saul Bass title
sequence for a Hitchcock thriller, and if James Stewart got out of
the wrong side of the car he might well swoon, since the ground
drops off abruptly along one edge of the drive.
</P>
<P>
   The house is three stories tall, a glass sandwich served between
two slices of concrete, garnished lightly with furniture and art.
There are two entrances on the ground floor. One leads through a
cavelike hallway of molded concrete to the children's wing
upstairs, the second into a large, open-plan space with a kitchen
and dining area at one end. The floor is lined with a polished,
cool green resin. Here, one also first encounters the building's
most exceptional feature: a large platform the size of a small
room, designed to move at the touch of a button between the three
floors.
</P>
<P>
   This elevator is the core of the house. Furnished with the
owner's desk, the 10{-by-11-foot platform is mounted atop a column
of polished steel and driven by machinery buried beneath the ground
floor. In addition to providing the disabled owner with mobility,
it keeps the house in a state of visual flux. The platform occupies
just enough of the building's floor area so that, when it moves
from one level to another, it changes the house's spatial
composition. The movement alters the dimensions of each floor and
enlarges or impedes the flow of space between them.
</P>
<P>
   The platform is open on three sides, with the fourth enclosed by
glass book shelves that rise through all three floors. Guard panels
slide into place as it ascends from the ground-floor kitchen to the
living area on the second floor and a bedroom on the third. On
whatever level, the desk assumes the symbolic presence of a control
panel for the entire house. The backdrop of books, illuminated by a
skylight and accented by a Gilbert and George painting mounted
between the second and third floors, imply that control will be
brilliantly exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs, partly screening a laundry, ascend from the kitchen to
the main floor, a living area unlike any other: a piano nobile with
a piano mobile. Aluminum panels, buffed to a matte finish, cover
the floor and intensify the light pouring in from three glass
walls. The furniture, a mix of modern classics (Breuer, Bertoia)
and French Provincial comfort pieces, was carefully chosen and just
as carefully disarranged. Along one wall, there is perimeter
seating on a cushioned stone bench that also contains a fireplace.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of this floor is an outdoor terrace, paved with
travertine. An earth berm, banked against the rear of the ground
floor, rises to meet the terrace in a gentle grass slope. The glass
wall facing the slope and the view is mechanized and slides open to
unite the living area with the outdoors. The terrace is sheltered
beneath the concrete slab of the building's top story. A large
cylinder, of concrete wrapped in polished steel, houses a spiral
staircase leading from the floor below to the children's quarters
above while providing structural support. Reflections in its convex
surface dematerialize the column, and a low stack of firewood
stretches along one side of the terrace. The counterpoint between
these materials _ the raw and rustic against the polished
industrial _ gives the terrace the serene simplicity of a Japanese
garden.
</P>
<P>
   On the top floor, concrete walls, stained brown and punctured
only by porthole windows, project the privacy of a harem, so I will
let the floor keep its secrets except to say that the bedrooms are
cozy, that the portholes are not arbitrarily placed but correspond
to the height of the owner, his wife and their three children in
seated, standing and reclining positions.
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing views and light, the windows inject
effervescence into what might otherwise recall a 1960s Brutalist
housing block.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When the curtain goes up on the Thanksgiving table, the turkey _
all golden brown and succulent _ usually steals the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   But, like a catchy show tune that you can't stop singing, it's
often the supporting cast _ the side dishes _ that you remember
long after the feast is over.
</P>
<P>
   Many Thanksgiving cooks have learned the hard way not to tamper
with the traditional favorites that everyone expects and looks
forward to all year.
</P>
<P>
   So while you leave Mama's sweet potato casserole or Aunt Pearl's
ambrosia safely on the menu, what better time is there to add a bit
of excitement to your table than by adding a few new players to the
regular cast of side dishes? Some may very well end up being scene-
stealers and future family favorites.

 &HT;    A microbrew `lite' that's lovely
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There were people who thought Greg Kelly had rocks in
his head, leaving a management job with Guinness to start a
microbrewery in Atlanta. Maybe he did and maybe he didn't. What can
be said with certainty now is that he has stones in his beer.
</P>
<P>
   Stones and fewer calories, too. Kelly's Light may be the first
microbrewed ``light'' beer in the Southeast _ less filling and
tastes, if not great, pretty darned good for what it is. It's also
a bold, innovative step for Atlanta Brewing Co., best known for its
flagship Red Brick Ale.
</P>
<P>
   From its origins in Northern California two decades ago, craft
brewing has been a reaction against the blandness and sameness of
mass-market beers. The early craft brewers wanted to re-create
traditional, full-flavored styles, not make Lite beer.
</P>
<P>
   So did Kelly when he founded Atlanta Brewing Co. in 1993. But
Kelly's Light is a stone-brewed beer, reviving a primitive method
to produce a thoroughly contemporary beer. In Europe, before
technology had advanced beyond wood kettles, white-hot stones the
size of small boulders were somehow hoisted and immersed in the
beer, bringing it to a boil without the use of flames. The Germans
still call this stein (stone) brewing.
</P>
<P>
   Today no one worries about setting a metal brewing tank on fire,
but stone-brewing survives in Germany as a means of quickly
caramelizing fermentable sugars. A method that had to have been
cumbersome has been made easier by modern machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, at the International Brewers Conference in Atlanta,
Kelly and his head brewer, Brian Buckowski, happened to attend a
presentation on the ancient art by Chuck Skypeck of Baltimore's
Brimstone Brewery. ``Greg said, `Hey, we could do that, don't you
think?' '' Buckowski says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they could. It's not fair to ask a person who doesn't
drink light beer what he thinks. But say this much: Buckowski has
worked a minor miracle with this exceptionally clean-tasting brew.
It actually tastes like beer, even if it's not as assertive as some
of us would prefer. This is an ale that has the crispness of a
lager, with a nice, dry finish.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly had been talking about brewing a ``light'' beer for a long
time. A salesman by training and instinct, he knew that many people
would never take to hoppy ales or full-bodied lagers. Traditional
or not, those beers are alien to what many people know. For them,
beer means the neutered stuff they drink from a pop-top aluminum
can or long-neck bottle. This is what the marketing people at the
big breweries have conditioned Americans to think is beer.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, most Americans thought bread was the white
sandwich kind _ degerminated, soft as Charmin _ and anything
heartier than Roman Meal a little weird. Sourdough? Pumpernickel?
Coarse whole grain? Nope, not for us.
</P>
<P>
   I call Lite drinkers the White Bread crowd. They don't really
like beer to begin with, which is no crime. But it's the old story:
They want to fit in. You want to tell them to order a Coke or
ginger ale and not worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   Buckowski's challenge was to brew a light beer that had fewer
calories (98 per bottle), but still had taste. He started by
brewing a lager, using traditional lager hops. Not satisfied, he
tried an ale, using the Ahtanum hop that made Red Brick Summer Brew
a winner. Then he stone-brewed the same beer, using flat,
2-foot-by-6-inch slabs shipped from Ireland. Secured in a canister,
the superheated stones sat in the brew kettle through the full
boil. The result was as zesty as a light beer can be.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a light on the rocks. But what really separates this one
from the others is that it's brewed entirely from malted grains _
95 percent barley and 5 percent rye. None of the corn or rice found
in mass-market beers.
</P>
<P>
   I've always said that if I were stranded at a party where the
only choices were Coke and a Lite, I'd go with the Real Thing. Now
I think I just might ask for a Kelly's.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet persistence pays off. When Dogwood Brewing first fired its
kettle on Chattahoochee Road (Atlanta, Ga.) in 1996, it was one
microbrewery among many. Founder Crawford Moran, a one-time
graduate student in English, began with an English-style pale ale.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later Dogwood is still small, still has no budget
for advertising, but it's slowly becoming Atlanta's premier
producer of bottled beer. Its stout made the Journal-Constitution's
10 Best in Atlanta last year, its pale ale was voted best in
Atlanta by readers of Southern Draft and its summer brew this year
was a delicately spicy Belgian White Ale that compared with any.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it was easy to overlook what Dogwood was accomplishing.
A chance sampling of Dogwood Pale Ale changed that. Moran and head
brewer Matt Speece have not only reformulated the beer, increasing
the amount of Cascade hops, but are also dry-hopping it. Whole hops
are put into the brew during the final brewing stages, imparting a
more floral aroma and more pronounced taste.
</P>
<P>
   None of Atlanta's three breweries makes a pale ale with this
much character. From one style to another, Dogwood keeps getting
better.
</P>
<P>
   And now it has added to its lineup a winter ale made from
barley, wheat, oatmeal and rye. It is not brewed to any one
particular style, but if you're a fan of porters with a slight
smokiness, this is one you'll love.
</P>
<P>
   It's another reason many folks are becoming fans of Dogwood.

 BORDEAUX: housing block.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I would call this house a shelter from shelter, a concept I've
earned the right to defend. I bumped my head in one spot and
scratched my thumb on another, leaving a bloody smear on the light
blue taffeta curtain being fitted for one of the living room's
glass walls. The thought crossed my mind that Koolhaas had designed
a house in which only the disabled could safely live.
</P>
<P>
   But the place brought back memories of ``The Disappearing
Floor,'' a Hardy Brothers mystery that features a nutty inventor
who lives in an old house equipped with such grotesqueries as a
mechanical ghost and a bedroom whose floor drops away, leaving the
furniture suspended in midair.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bordeaux house, you can't completely escape the tension
between the concrete slabs and the light open space between them.
If the platform can descend, why not the roof? Yet, the atmosphere
throughout is breezy, the building's connection to land and sky
arcadian. On the second floor, the general effect is of life lived
as a picnic, and you don't have to run for shelter if it rains.
</P>
<P>
   But there's scant refuge here for normalcy. The building does
much more than accommodate the owner's physical disabilities. It
uses them as a springboard to imagine ways of being in the world.
While Koolhaas uses the industrial materials and uncluttered spaces
favored by architects of the modern movement, he employs them
toward radically different ends. Modernists favored
standardization, the use of structural components and visual forms
that conveyed the rational ethos of industrial mass production.
</P>
<P>
   Koolhaas subverts this entirely. It is the ghost in the machine,
to use the novelist Arthur Koestler's phrase, that haunts him, the
dimensions of human experience that cannot be standardized,
rationalized or predicted. The concrete top floor is supported at
one end by a large black truss, supported on columns, and
stabilized at the other end by a counterweight suspended from a
steel girder mounted atop the roof. This structural arrangement,
while securing the building, also expresses its inherent
instability. It assumes the metaphoric values of conflict and
balance, of stresses met with equipoise and imaginatively resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian formalists analyzed narrative structure as a process
in which a state of equilibrium is disturbed by a series of events
until a heightened sense of balance is finally attained. Anyone who
has visited the Eiffel Tower knows that buildings can create this
kind of narrative. On each stage to the top, you catch your breath
and pass through fear until gaining the summit. (For some of us,
the new state of equilibrium isn't felt until our feet again touch
ground).
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Disappearing Floor,'' the plot is resolved when Joe and
Frank realize that the crazy inventor isn't a villain but rather
the victim of a group of thieves. What they don't fully grasp is
that they themselves are not the pair of normal lads they present
to the reader. They're the Hardy Boys. They're freaks. They're
never going to grow up and have full lives. They're condemned to
forever trying to please their father, Fenton, even though they're
already master crime-busters, while Dad is just a stick that smokes
a pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Koolhaas has embraced the challenge of designing a house for a
disabled man and his family as an opportunity to say something
about this millennial moment. We don't know where we'll be
tomorrow, much less two years hence. Life does throw curves. Floors
do disappear; planes and stock markets go up and down; tycoons and
terrorists conspire; life does not go on as before.
</P>
<P>
   At 53, Rem Koolhaas is also a freak. No architect of his
generation is more extravagantly talented. None have found more
eloquent ways to embody his generation's perplexities and
ambivalences about its own changing times. His career has been a
suspense story that has kept admirers enthralled. The opening of
his retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art three years ago drew
a pop star's turnout. Two of his books, ``Delirious New York'' and
``S,M,L,XL'' (Monicelli Press, 1995), have been critical hits.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also alienated potential clients, written rude
letters to editors, lost out in competitions to architects of
lesser talent, and borne the animosity of those with less-blazing
gifts. He retains his generation's distrust of authority but knows
that architecture is not something you go off and do by yourself in
the woods.
</P>
<P>
   Every realized building has come to seem like a triumph against
great odds: the train station at Euralille, a 469-acre
communications, financial and entertainment hub in northern France,
for which Koolhaas designed the master plan; the Villa dall'Ava in
Paris; the Netherlands Dance Theater in The Hague; the Kunsthal in
Rotterdam.
</P>
<P>
   All of them are courageous, for architect and clients alike, but
the new Bordeaux project conveys particular urgency of Koolhaas'
determination to step into the unknown.

 &HT;    It doesn't matter where you hail from, traditions _ and the
memories they bring to mind of food, family and friends _ make a
holiday special
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Bonnie Kin was growing up in western
Pennsylvania, she always knew Thanksgiving was drawing near when
her mother would retrieve the antique food grinder from the top
shelf of the cupboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was used to grind cranberries for her famous cranberry
salad,'' explains Kin. ``My three brothers and I took turns
grinding the cranberries the night before Thanksgiving every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This tradition continued even after Kin and her brothers grew up
and scattered, and when her mother died seven years ago, Kin
inherited the grinder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kin's daughter, Ashley, 10, ``solemnly stands at the table
each Thanksgiving eve turning the handle of the old grinder year
after year.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fresh cranberries, the salad isn't significantly
different from many others _ chopped celery and nuts, Jell-O and a
mold. But it's the turning of the handle year after year that
endears and endures, like so many Thanksgiving traditions.
</P>
<P>
   When we asked readers _ especially those who've moved here from
other regions of the country _ to share their Thanksgiving recipes,
we found the menu sacred; the variations subtle. No wild rice
souffles from Minnesota or lobster stuffing from Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Folks around here _ whether they are from here or not _ stick
with turkey and dressing, cranberries and pumpkin pie.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that for many the standard menu is but a
starting point. Joseph Brady of Roswell, for instance, often serves
venison and duck along with the turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``My version of my mother's English-style dressing goes well
with all the richer meats,'' said Brady. His mother was
English/Irish and raised in Chicago, his father from Savannah, Ga.
The dressing relies heavily on apples, prunes, sherry and French
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Bautsch of Marietta prefers a dressing rich in pork
sausage and turkey giblets, as her in-laws in New Orleans prepare
every year. ``I had never had anything but regular corn bread
dressing growing up, and this was a big surprise the first
Thanksgiving we had with my husband's family 34 years ago,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   For Susan Kendall of Marietta, Ga., oysters are the key to a
good dressing. She remembers visiting her grandparents in
Hagerstown, Maryland as a child. Her grandfather was a friend of J.
Millard Tawes, who was governor of Maryland for 12 years and owner
of an oyster farm and packing house in Crisfield. Each
Thanksgiving, the Tawes sent her family fresh oysters along with a
gallon tin of shelled oysters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Thanksgiving, there would be oysters on the half shell,
oyster dressing and scalloped oysters,'' said Kendall, who
continues to make oyster dressing each year, without the help of a
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Another Marylander sent us a recipe for peas and carrots in
brown gravy. ``It wouldn't be Thanksgiving for my siblings and me''
without the dish, said Roseanne Bourgeois of Grayson, Ga. She
traces the dish back to her mother's Polish roots.
</P>
<P>
   For Pat Hawthorne of Fayetteville, Ga., who hails from Brooklyn
via Wisconsin, it wouldn't be Thanksgiving without mashed
rutabagas, which she always called turnips until she moved to the
South and we set her straight. They are boiled and then mashed in
turkey stock, cream, nutmeg, salt and butter.
</P>
<P>
   But like Kin, it's cranberries that define Thanksgiving for
Debra Swiggum of Lawrenceville, Ga. She and her family moved to the
Atlanta area eight years ago from Wisconsin, and at that time they
started a new tradition _ her husband cooks the Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   There's one exception. Swiggum makes the desserts _ a pumpkin
pie and a cranberry cake with warm brown sugar sauce. ``I grew up
in a small town surrounded with many cranberry bogs from small
family-owned businesses to the larger Ocean Spray,'' she said. ``So
cranberries were plentiful and very fresh. In fact, every year, my
mother sends me two boxes, farmed locally.''
</P>
<P>
   And many of those tart, crimson jewels end up in a spongy yellow
cake that soaks in the sweet, warm sauce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although our tradition of having the entire meal made by my
husband is relatively new,'' said Swiggum, ``this cake reminds us
all of home in Wisconsin, having dinner at Grandma's house.''

 &HT;    Thanksgiving U.S.A.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ OK, so here's a radical idea for Thanksgiving. How
about roast turkey?
</P>
<P>
   To suggest otherwise would be sacrilege. We know that, of
course. So when we asked folks to send up their regional variations
on this national meal, it came as no surprise that we received
fairly traditional recipes _ though many with touching personal
stories. Recipes of memories, in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rodgers, author of ``Thanksgiving 101,'' said that as he's
traveled the land teaching cooking classes on the holiday meal,
he's been struck by the similarities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain icons on the Thanksgiving table _ Jell-O
salad, green bean bake, canned cranberry sauce, pumpkin pie,'' he
said. ``Stuffing is the main place where differences occur. In
California, people make it with sourdough bread. In Seattle, a lot
of people prefer whole wheat bread. In the South, of course, corn
bread is de rigueur. In Pennsylvania, I've had stuffing made of rye
bread, and in some Italian communities, I've had stuffing that is
made with no bread at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For our part, we've given you four choices for dressing, along
with 11 other recipes that are all regional variations on our old
favorites. So, if you've had exactly the same thing for the past
umpteen years, why not try a dash of Nevada or a pinch of Wisconsin
this year?

   Reader Randa Warren shared this ``foolproof'' method for
roasting a turkey that a friend of hers (Leroy) in Aspen, Colo.,
taught her. It's roasted at high heat, so it cooks quickly, but a
salt treatment the night before helps keep it moist, juicy and
well-seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   1fresh turkey, 12 to 15 pounds
</P>
<P>
   1to 1 1/2 cups salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4cup warm bacon fat or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Boiling water
</P>
<P>
   The night before serving, salt turkey heavily inside and out.
(Heavily enough that you can scrape your fingernail through the
salt.) The next morning, preheat oven to 450 degrees. Wash the bird
thoroughly inside and out with cold water. Have warm bacon fat (or
oil) ready and spread heavily over entire turkey. Place turkey in
deep roasting pan, put in oven and roast at 450 degrees for 1 hour.
Then remove from the oven and fill the pan with boiling water to
the level of the wing elbow. Cover with aluminum foil, seal edges
and return to oven for an additional 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until an
instant-read meat thermometer registers 180 degrees in the thickest
part of the thigh. Time will vary depending on size of turkey.
Allow to cool slightly before slicing.

 &HT;    Success a bit too sweet for Jewel
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pure product of what Joni Mitchell called ``the star-making
machinery,'' 24-year-old vocalist Jewel Kilcher has enjoyed a
peculiarly accelerated career. When her first album, ``Pieces of
You,'' was released in 1995, she flaunted a vagabond image and
talked about sleeping in her car. As her new album arrives, she's a
multi-platinum Lilith Fair alumna who is already the subject of a
best-selling parody (a spoof of her poetry collection, ``A Night
Without Armor'').
</P>
<P>
   No wonder she dedicates ``Spirit'' to her mother, who is also
her manager. But such success exaggerates Jewel's gifts as a
songwriter. She is unbearably trite in the winsome way that only
introspective college-age guitar strummers can be. ``If I could
tell this world one thing,'' she sings in an ever-soothing voice,
``it would be that we're all OK.'' Next stop: ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the advantage of stardom is that you get to spend
lots of money on your records, and ``Spirit'' is resplendent in a
subdued folk-pop-country way. The seductive studio craft lends a
sense of significance to what is ultimately pretty innocuous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spirit''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel. Atlantic. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: I'm OK, you're OK, Jewel's OK. OK?

 &HT;    The Whitney we know and love
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whitney Like You've Never Heard Her Before,'' proclaims the
sticker on Whitney Houston's first studio album in eight years.
Such false advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The singer-actress's return to recording something other than a
soundtrack is actually, often pleasantly, familiar. Pulling from
the gospel roots she displayed breathtakingly well on the
``Preacher's Wife'' soundtrack, Houston joins Lauryn Hill on a
cover version of Stevie Wonder's ``I Was Made To Love (Him),'' a
reworking that's as memorable as her take on ``I Will Always Love
You'' on the ``Bodyguard'' soundtrack. And ``It's Not Right But
It's Okay'' is as sister-girly as all that was ``Waiting to
Exhale,'' the movie and soundtrack featuring Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are such by-the-numbers big ballads as ``I Learned
From the Best,'' ``You'll Never Stand Alone'' and ``When You
Believe,'' her overemoted duet with fellow pop diva Mariah Carey.
You have to expect those exercises in riffs and octaves from a
Grammy favorite who made her rendition of ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' a top seller. The surprise comes when the often
predictable rapper Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott, as guest
producer, tastefully reveals Houston as a sensual being on ``Oh
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   And leave it to Houston's most familiar collaborator, producer
Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds, along with Daryl Simmons, to draw out
one of her most stirring vocal performances on ``Until You Come
Back.'' Proof that Whitney like we've heard her before is really
quite fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Love Is Your Love''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Houston. Arista. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Whitney's new effort is mostly like old times.

 &HT;    Food on film: Feast your eyes on these
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Thanksgiving and Christmas on their way, our thoughts turn
naturally to food, glorious food. Here are a few of the movies'
most memorable meals _ from fabulous feasts to less delectable
chow-downs.
</P>
<P>
   NOURISHING
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Babette's Feast'' (1987): It turns up in every food-movie
roundup, but how could it not? This Oscar-winning film celebrates
the transforming power of art, rendered in mouth-wateringly
gastronomic terms. In the late 1800s, a Frenchwoman (Stephane
Audran) finds refuge from the political upheavals in Paris by
relocating to a remote Danish village. When she wins the lottery,
she repays her benefactors with a repast to remember.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Eat Drink Man Woman'' (1994): A warm, scrumptious comedy
about food and family, fathers and daughters. A master chef seeks
to reconnect with his daughters through the bountiful banquet he
prepares for them every Sunday. It starts out as a kind of
ritualized forced feeding, but things change as the daughters come
to understand their loving if autocratic parent.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Soul Food'' (1997): Pretty much the same idea as ``Eat Drink
Man Woman'' _ food and family in one big stew _ but put through an
African-American filter. Irma P. Hall is the matriarch who fixes
the yummy Sunday dinner that holds the family together. But when
she falls ill, it's up to her children to fix the meal. And
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   BIZARRE
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Beetlejuice'' (1988): A fancy dinner meant to show off the
haunted-house merits of their new home turns into a free-for-all
when everyone (including guest Robert Goulet) is seemingly
possessed by the spirit of Harry Belafonte. All together now:
``Dayo! Daaaa-Yo! Daylight come and me wanna go
</P>
<P>
   home!''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Ref'' (1994): Cat burglar Denis Leary gets more than he
bargained for when he kidnaps a squabbling yuppie couple (Judy
Davis and Kevin Spacey) on Christmas Eve. Including Christmas Eve
dinner a la Davis. Meaning, a traditional Scandinavian banquet in
honor of an obscure Scandinavian saint, with everyone wearing
elaborate ``crowns'' of lighted candles.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Delicatessen'' (1991): Savory sick humor is the point in
this dazzlingly perverse French black comedy. Set in some near
future where eat-or-be-eaten is the rule of thumb (and thigh and
shoulder), the plot focuses on one suspiciously well-stocked deli
where the butcher-landlord and his tenants have devised their own
system for dining in.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover'' (1989): Peter
Greenaway serves up an opulently lush banquet of human depravity in
this tale of a monstrous mobster (Michael Gambon), whose libidinous
wife (Helen Mirren) gets, um, fed up with his abuse. What follows
is as repellent as it is compelling _ a movie that offers food for
thought aimed at our gag reflex.
</P>
<P>
   SEXY
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Tom Jones'' (1963): Perhaps the single sexiest
eat-drink-man-woman scene in all of cinema takes place in Tony
Richardson's marvelously bawdy romp. Albert Finney and Joyce Redman
devour oysters, chicken and you-name-it before devouring each
other. Perils of Filmmaking Note: One of the oysters Redman ate
turned out to be bad and she was sick for days.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Like Water for Chocolate'' (1992): Magical munchies from
Mexico are at the heart of this tale of sauces and sorcery. When a
mother decrees that her youngest daughter, Tita (Lumi Cavazos),
must devote her life to taking care of her, the girl becomes
something of a kitchen magician, channeling her feelings into the
food she prepares.
</P>
<P>
   I THINK, THEREFORE I EAT
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``My Dinner With Andre'' (1981): Theater director Andre
Gregory and playwright-actor Wallace Shawn are the two and only
performers in Louis Malle's comedy of table manners. Actually, it's
little more than two hours of dinner chat about the meaning of life
and other small matters. But after all is said and done and
consumed, you may find their ramblings surprisingly touching.

 &HT;    In `Armageddon,' the sky is falling, but it's nothing to worry
about
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   It's the end of the world as we know it, and producer Jerry
Bruckheimer feels fine. Unlike the relatively somber ``Deep
Impact,'' his gung-ho tale of a Texas-sized asteroid menacing Earth
is like a patriotic video game played by cowboys. The movie never
lets the threat of global annihilation get in the way of the
MTV-edited fun. To its credit, you can see most of its reported
$165 million budget in the special effects and mammoth sets. And
the photogenic Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler star as young lovers in
the middle of the madness. But it's up to Bruce Willis, of course,
to save the planet. He ought to try saving Planet Hollywood first.

 &HT;    Mini movie views
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' (R) _ The kind of movie
you'll love or hate, depending on your mood. Johnny Depp and
Benicio Del Toro tear through the neon desert, high on anything
they can get. Directed with hallucinatory flair by Terry Gilliam
(``12 Monkeys''), it's both a tribute to and a cautionary tale
about excess. With Christina Ricci as a waifish Barbra Streisand
fan who has a bad trip. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Can't Hardly Wait'' (PG-13) _ You won't want to wait. . .
for the movie to end. This teen comedy about an
end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks subtlety whenever a
broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer Love Hewitt plays
Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior class. Ethan Embry
is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries to convince us,
deserves to be her boyfriend. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Land Girls'' (R) _ Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz and
Anna Friel star in this tepid British weepy about three women who
spend World War II in the countryside. There, they help grow food
and fall in and out of tedious romances. Grade: C

PLACES TO GET STARTED ON THE ROAD TO COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Steven R. Knowlton is an associate professor of journalism at
Hofstra University.  
 By STEVEN R. KNOWLTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip Michas and Adrian Gamerello are high-school seniors,
classmates at the prestigious Browning School, just off Park Avenue
in the heart of Manhattan's silk-stocking district. When it came to
picking a college to attend next fall, they had the best help money
could buy: a highly regarded guidance counselor and high-end
computer hardware and software to aid a senior class of only two
dozen.
</P>
<P>
   But for the rest of us, here's the good news: both Michas, whose
``favorite thing in the world is computer stuff,'' and Gamerello,
who prints out every paragraph he writes because he'd rather read
text on paper, said the most valuable help they found in selecting
colleges was available free, 24 hours a day, to anyone with a
computer and a modem.
</P>
<P>
   Both students took the advice of Browning's guidance counselor,
Sanford Pelz, and visited colleges on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all colleges have Web sites, of course, and those sites
have grown increasingly sophisticated over the last two years as
admissions offices have realized that a good Web page can translate
into more applications and more tuition dollars.
</P>
<P>
   It is a good place to start, but the college-bound should think
of the official Web sites as digital versions of the brochures
colleges have published for many years. They are reliable in the
same way brochures about new cars are reliable.
</P>
<P>
   Gamerello combined guidebooks, brochures and Web pages in
looking for a school that valued the arts over athletics and was a
comfortable size and distance from home. He said Web pages ``give
you some of what the place is about, of the school's ideology.''
</P>
<P>
   He mentally adjusted for the pictures ``that are airbrushed and
edited so they're, like, perfect,'' he said, yet still found them
very useful. But there is much, much more available than the sylvan
scene of the campus, the majestic shot of the administration
building, the perfectly posed pictures of a flawlessly diverse
group of students chatting amiably about the joys of calculus, the
thrill of Chaucer.
</P>
<P>
   A different kind of information _ less well ordered but often
more useful _ can be found elsewhere. All over the country,
individual faculty members have built Web pages of their own, where
they post syllabuses, lecture notes, old tests _ the nuts and bolts
of the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, thousands of students have their own Web pages,
where they inveigh for and against all manner of details about life
at college. ``There is a lot of information that has not been
cleansed by the admissions office,'' Pelz said.
</P>
<P>
   Michas, the computer aficionado, couldn't agree more. He settled
on the University of Pennsylvania as his first choice after surfing
the engineering department's pages for computer science courses.
``I could open up old lecture notes, old tests,'' he said with a
note of wonder. ``I found that accessing those notes would tell me
so much about what the courses would really be about.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget college newspapers. The College Press Network
(www.cpnet.com) lists links for more than 300 campus papers,
arranged alphabetically by state. The papers are irreverent,
outraged and often outrageous _ just what a high school student may
need to figure out if everything else about a school is as good a
fit as the academics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.COLLEGEBOARD.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.PETERSONS.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.COLLEGEVIEW.COM &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a college's Web site and the college itself are great
ways to make final choices about where to apply and enroll, but
it's bewildering and too time-consuming to begin the selection
process there. Most professional guidance counselors recommend
putting together a list of 10 to 20 schools, then applying to
perhaps half that number.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the factors in school selection _ where your parents
went and where your heartthrob is going _ are serious concerns but
are not the sort of things computers can help with. But for other
considerations, software can be an enormous help, provided you use
it the right way.
</P>
<P>
   College Search, found at cbweb1. collegeboard.org/csearch or
through a link on www.collegeboard.com, is the College Board's
online version of its software packages for consumers and high
schools. Peterson's, a longtime rival to the College Board in the
big guidebook field, has a search site at www.petersons.com, which
links to its www.collegequest.com site.
</P>
<P>
   College View (www.collegeview. com) is a relative newcomer to
the online collection. The difference between what it offers free
on line and what is on the CD-ROMs it sells to high-school guidance
offices is videos, said the site's managing director, Tim
Loudermilk.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges pay $5,000 to $20,000 and up to be included in the
videos, which can be thought of as digital versions of the slick
brochures, called view books, that colleges put together to sell
themselves. The information on the schools is the same.
</P>
<P>
   The process of looking for a college is largely the same on all
three Web sites. On the positive side, the information on the sites
is in a database, not a narrative, which makes it easy to generate
an endless set of lists sorted by a wide variety of criteria.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a college of more than 10,000 students in a city in
the Northeast, a school with a Division 1A football team, a student
humor magazine and a pep band that accepts only half of its
applicants and offers advanced-placement credit for the AP Latin
exam, a list of colleges meeting all or most of those criteria _
the sites' options vary a bit _ is a few clicks away. It can be
sorted for your convenience by cost or by other criteria important
to you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, searching a database proves that adage
about computers: they do what you tell them to do, not what you
want them to do. If you dream of a small, private, highly selective
liberal arts college in New England and search with those terms in
the College Board's database, you will get exactly zero schools
that meet the criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Bennington is too small _ enrollment of only 450 _ and admits
two-thirds of its applicants, so it is not so selective after all.
Wellesley's 2,200 students make it too big for the ``small''
category, which ranges from 750 to 2,000. Colgate is not in New
England; it is in Hamilton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, Amherst and Williams Colleges are all perfect examples,
but those schools do not provide data on the high-school grades of
their incoming students, so if that was one of your criteria, a
reasonable measure of selectivity, those colleges do not make the
list.
</P>
<P>
   You can tinker with the list until you figure out what went
wrong, but that's going at the problem backward. If you already
want to go to Amherst, then you do not need to search for it. But
if you are not well versed about what schools are out there, you
won't know that you're missing a potentially interesting college
that does not show up on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Don't plan to come up with this list of finalists in one sitting
or to do it without help from the guidance office. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   While some college-selection software carries price tags that
only a school would be likely to manage, the average consumer can
still find CD-ROMs that are affordable and helpful. Like the three
reviewed here, they are often packaged with books or other
software.
</P>
<P>
   With Peterson's College Quest, students enter their personal
selection criteria, then get lists of colleges that meet those
requirements. The basic choices, represented by icons on the
screen, are made according to criteria like region or state,
academic majors and difficulty of entrance standards, or by whether
the schools are public or private.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, icons labeled Tell Me offer good, if standard,
advice on the topic at hand. At any point, the user can click on
any of the colleges listed to call up a full profile of the campus,
the same information that can be found in the pages of the
accompanying book.
</P>
<P>
   The software will also generate e-mail letters of inquiry to any
of the selected schools.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board's huge database, packaged with ``The College
Handbook 1999,'' is called College Explorer. The student types in a
bit more information than with the Peterson's version, rather than
selecting categories, but the process is the same and the
information is very similar.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan, the test-preparation company, packages its search
software differently, in a five-CD set that includes its college
search database, based on ``The Kaplan Newsweek College Catalog
1999'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), along with SAT and ACT test-preparation
software and a scholarship database.
</P>
<P>
   Like most test-preparation software, this uses a multimedia
approach. As perhaps might be expected, the information on the
colleges provided by the Kaplan software is not so thorough as that
provided by Peterson's and the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan does offer links to college Web pages, and the friendly
tour guide recommends that you visit the colleges' Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the big-ticket arena, where packages of CD-ROMs and
phone-book-size guidebooks can cost school guidance offices roughly
$500 a year, there are two major players. One is Expan, affiliated
with the College Board, and the other is a newcomer called College
View.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are on a school board, you probably cannot influence
a given school's decision on whether to buy one of them. But from
the consumer's point of view, in truth, it doesn't matter much
because they are comparable. &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   WWW.FAFSA.ED.GOV &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WWW.ED.GOV/OFFICES/OPE/STUDENTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Software, unfortunately, provides no magic way to get around
paying for college, but the Internet does offer some help. As the
Net matures, however, deceptive practices and outright scams
abound. Best advice: Stick with the known names: Peterson's, the
College Board and College View.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Pelz, a guidance counselor at the Browning School,
recommends the College Board's Web site (www.collegeboard.com) as
the best place to start. Follow its links to the scholarship
search.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, old-fashioned communication seems to still be best
here, combining the best efforts of the high-school guidance office
on the one end and the admissions or financial aid office of the
selected college on the other.

<P>
   Typing ``college scholarship'' into an Internet search engine
and following what comes up is asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that families should be extremely wary of any
service that charges a fee _ even just a couple of dollars _ for
offering to find scholarships. Stay away from businesses that
guarantee scholarships (they can't) and those that offer to write
the application essay or otherwise do most of the work for the
student.
</P>
<P>
   And be especially careful of anyone who talks about unclaimed
scholarships worth huge sums _ $6.6 billion, a wildly inflated
number, is frequently cited.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to get federal student aid forms is directly from
the government's site, www.fafsa.ed.gov. The full federal rundown
on student aid, as well as links to other sites, is available at
www.ed.gov/offices/ope/students, from the Office of Postsecondary
Education of the Federal Department of Education.

   TOKYO _ President Clinton called on Japan to ''take decisive
steps'' to clean up its $1-trillion banking crisis and stimulate
its moribund economy, just hours before arriving here for a
U.S.-Japan summit.
</P>
<P>
   As independent counsel Kenneth Starr takes the stand before the
House Judiciary Committee in Washington on Thursday, Clinton will
be here, in the capital of the world's second-largest economy.
He'll be discussing ways Japan, the region's closest U.S. ally, can
help pull itself, and East Asia more generally, out of a financial
crisis that has shaken markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also expected to pressure Japanese Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi to make good on earlier promises to open markets here
to increased U.S. exports and to accelerate deregulation across a
host of key industrial and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's slumping economy has dampened demand for American goods
and services in this country. One result, a rising trade imbalance,
expected to top $60 billion -- in Japan's favor -- this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a prelude to the likely focus of the summit, Clinton implored
the Japanese government to ''promptly and effectively'' implement a
broad plan for driving the country out of seven years of stagnation
that is hurting the region as well as U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is more important to restoring stability and growth in
Asia than efforts to restart Japan's economy,'' Clinton said in
White House remarks Wednesday, before departing for Tokyo. ''It has
long been Asia's engine of growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has pledged programs to help its banks rid themselves of
an estimated $1 trillion in bad debts that have caused a chronic
credit squeeze that is starving the Japanese economy. Japan has
also promised to inject tens of billions of dollars into public
works and to provide billions of dollars more in tax relief, but
U.S. officials have expressed concern that the pledges might not
materialize quickly enough, or substantially enough, to pull Japan
out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to discussing how Japan can promptly and
effectively implement its commitment to banking reform, stimulate
consumer demand and growth, deregulate key economic sectors and
open its markets to fair trade,'' Clinton said. ``Just as the world
looked to us in America six years ago to put our economic house in
order, today nations look to Japan to take decisive steps to help
the Japanese people, to restore growth in Asia and around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is expected to contract by more than 2
percentage points this year, and economists predict it will grow
little, if any, next year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. dissatisfaction over Japan's economic policies have
strained relations between the United States and Japan, the
cornerstone of U.S. economic and strategic interests in the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ''On macroeconomic policy we have been somewhat at odds, and
rather publicly, with the Japanese government over the past year,
and the result has been a measure of
</P>
<P>
   frustration in (the U.S.) Treasury (Department) and a measure of
resentment in Japan at the frequency and specificity and often
public character of advice,'' from Washington, said former U.S.
Ambassador to Japan, Michael Armacost. ''So there's some
bridge-building to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was due to arrive in Tokyo early Thursday morning (EST),
for a busy schedule spent meeting with Emperor Akihito and Empress
Michiko at the Imperial Palace, holding a business roundtable with
Japanese and American executives and conducting a televised town
hall meeting to communicate directly with the Japanese people.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday evening Clinton is scheduled to meet with Prime
Minister Obuchi before joining him for a state dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to meet with Obuchi most of the day on
Friday, in a wooded retreat near the foot of Mount Fuji, the
highest mountain in Japan and the best known natural symbol of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is the first stop on a five-day Asia swing that will also
take Clinton to South Korea, for talks likely to focus on security
issues surrounding Communist North Korea, and the island of Guam.
</P>
<P>
   He will remain in South Korea until Monday morning. His visit
will include talks with President Kim Dae Jung, a joint news
conference and a roundtable discussion with Koreans. He also will
visit with U.S. troops at the Korea Training Center and at the Osan
Air Force Base. Clinton returns to Washington Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   As he left the White House on Wednesday, Clinton warned of a
''provocative missile program,'' in North Korea, which fired a
medium-range test missile through Japanese air space earlier this
year, sending relations between Japan and North Korea near a
generational low.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered, then aborted, U.S. air strikes over the weekend
against Iraq, to pressure that country to cooperate with a United
Nations program to inspect and dismantle its weapons of mass
destruction program.
</P>
<P>
   He'll spend much of the coming days discussing the need to
strengthen a U.S.-brokered freeze on North Korea's alleged nuclear
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Iraq's weapons of mass destruction have dominated recent
headlines, we must be no less concerned by North Korea's weapons
activities, including its provocative missile program and
developments that could call into question its commitment to freeze
and dismantle its nuclear weapons effort,'' Clinton said. ''This
trip will give us an opportunity to address this critical issue.''

 &HT;    AS TROOP WITHDRAWAL NEARS, WEST BANK ISRAELIS AND ARABS AWAIT
NERVOUSLY
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KADIM, West Bank _ Hava Miller came to this high hilltop with
four other families 14 years ago as a pioneer, simply searching for
``a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she is about to be a reluctant pioneer in the precarious
Middle East peace process and its untested Wye Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old's community, the Israeli Jewish settlement of
Kadim, will likely find itself surrounded by areas controlled by
the Palestinian National Authority within just a few days.
</P>
<P>
   It will be one of the first steps of the Wye peace plan.
Residents wonder whether it will be harder for their children to
get to school an hour away -- a bus trip already escorted by army
patrols. Will their water lines be cut off? Will their community
shrink out of existence as newcomers are scared off?
</P>
<P>
   These are not the extremists who have been staging protests and
threatening to topple the Israeli government if land is ceded.
</P>
<P>
   While the Israeli government encouraged settlements in order to
strengthen its claim to disputed land, the residents of Kadim came
for affordable housing and government tax breaks. They do not say
they came here because God promised them the land, as do others,
and some might leave if compensated -- as a recent poll showed many
of the 170,000 Israeli settlers would.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye Memorandum, which was signed in Washington last month,
outlines the withdrawal of Israeli troops from more West Bank land
captured in the 1967 war. The first phase switches 2 percent of the
West Bank from Israeli to Palestinian control and switches other
land from partial to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   The maps of the exact tranfers are not public yet. Political
leaders have been meeting with settlers, tweeking the maps with
public input similar to how school districts regularly make
adjustments in their school zones.
</P>
<P>
   But most expect Kadim to be an island of Jews among
Palestinian-controlled lands when it becomes a first step under the
Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye deal has been on-again, off-again, almost daily since it
was signed.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was a good day. The Israeli parliament ratified Wye
the night before and meetings started in the long-delayed talks
over the final boundaries of Israel and the Palestinian Authority,
the hardest issues in the Oslo peace process. The Israeli cabinet
votes on approving the first steps of the withdrawal Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But, on the dry ground of the rocky, hilly, West Bank, people
are nervous. Near the Palestinian town of Anata, Palestinian
Rasmiya Ifhidat, 43, watched a bulldozer, guarded by two Israeli
army patrols, cut a road through her land.
</P>
<P>
   The road is intended to make post-Wye life easier for Jews who
live in the West Bank, but it leaves her land as a small island
between an Israeli army base and the new highway. In tones of
desparation, the widow said Israelis have warned that they will
knock down a house her family had started to construct. Currently,
22 relatives live under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Further north, the Israeli army evicted several Jewish settlers
from a hilltop they had taken with trailers -- an attempt to expand
their hold on the disputed land. Just days ago, Israel's Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon had urged settlers to ``seize'' any land they
could before the withdrawals happen.
</P>
<P>
   But, they are not capturing any hills near Kadim.
</P>
<P>
   There are 40 families here now, in small stucco houses with
Spanish tile rooves. They are nestled among pine and fruit trees,
and an olive orchard with a Palestinian farmer who is still allowed
to come in and harvest.
</P>
<P>
   They are mostly secular Jews, many of whom work in high-tech
jobs in cities within an hour's drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the most negotiable settlement in the whole thing,''
said Rick Wienecke, a sculptor who lives in Kadim, noting that the
community is small, moderate and without political clout.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing a building with Wienecke's studio is a chicken
incubating company, owned by an Israeli but run by four
Palestinians. They swap tools with the Israelis and get along, even
as their views differ.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, for example, believe the Jews can keep living
here, but under the rule of the Palestinian Authority, rather than
the Israeli government. The land used to belong to Palestinians and
should be returned, they say. Miller says she would leave if forced
to live under Palestinian rule.
</P>
<P>
   But, in day-to-day life, this basic disagreement rarely
surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This specific settlement is different from the others,'' said
Rida Amriyeh, a Palestinian who buys chickens at the incubator.
``It was always totally peaceful . . . maybe they are a minority.''

   PETROPAVLOVSK-KAMCHATSKY, Russia _ At Public School 17, students
and teachers are bundled in winter coats and thick wool sweaters.
Each breath fogs in the frigid air as they recite grammar lessons.
The potted plants on the window sill, intended to add some life to
the drab classroom, are frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a thick blanket of snow already covers the remote
Kamchatka peninsula in Russia's Far East. Temperatures have been
below freezing for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the school on a recent November morning, the mercury
wasn't much higher, because after weeks of numbing cold, the
heating came on for the first time this season only hours ago.
</P>
<P>
   Winter arrives early and hard in this Pacific port city, and
throughout Russia's remote regions in the Arctic, central Siberia
and the Far East. Russia's economic crisis and the annual arrival
of ice and snow are a dangerous combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live like primitive people. No heat. No lights. No money.
Things are awful. The coming 21st century doesn't matter in
Kamchatka. It matters only in other countries. Here it is the 19th
century,'' complained Oxana Ivanova, 17, a student at P.S. 17.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, fuel shortages cut heat and electricity to
homes, businesses and schools and caused several deaths on
Kamchatka, nine times zones and 5,000 miles east of Moscow. Similar
shortages have hit other remote areas and forced evacuations as the
government in Moscow cannot afford to supply food and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   At Public School 17, perched on a ridge in the shadow of a
dramatic range of snow-peaked volcanic mountains that meet the
Pacific Ocean, heat and lights were restored this week, as they
were to most parts of Kamchatka, a peninsula roughly the size of
California and home to 400,000 Russians.
</P>
<P>
   But for weeks, temperatures inside apartments, classrooms and
offices dipped below 45 degrees as winter storms descended. Lacking
fuel to run two main power plants, electricity was rationed to
three hours a day and the central heating network, which supplies
virtually every building on the peninsula with steam heat, was not
turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about such conditions from my grandfather and now this
year I found myself in such terrible times,'' said Ludmilla
Nanovskaya, an English teacher at P.S. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Adding financial anxiety to the aching cold, the region's
teachers have not been paid since the school year began on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Electricity and heat began flowing -- at least for now -- after
embarrassed authorities in Moscow acknowledged the emergency and
ordered 10,000 tons of fuel oil from the Pacific navy fleet's
reserves to feed the peninsula's power plants.
</P>
<P>
   They were goaded to the task after the local Kamchatka
legislature drafted and threatened to send a direct appeal for
humanitarian assistance to the United Nations. Other strapped and
suffering regions in Russia have made similar appeals, an ominous
and awkward reminder to the Kremlin of the country's vulnerability
as four months of brutal winter begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until this problem is solved we will continue to work from
crisis to crisis,'' said Yevgeny Klochkov, director of
Kamchatskenergo, the local utility that provides heat and
electricity to the peninsula. ``The problem is not resolved for the
entire winter because we do not have the cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian weather forecasters have predicted the harshest winter
in 30 years. This discouraging news came amid last month's report
that Russia's grain harvest was nearly half the levels of 1997 and
the worst in 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the economic crash of August, which sent the ruble
plummeting, has made more than half of all Russians poor. According
to the Russian Center of the Standard of Living, 79 million
Russians now live in poverty, out of a total population of 147
million.
</P>
<P>
   To help alleviate concerns about food supplies, the United
States and Russia last week reached a deal to ship 3.1 million tons
of American food aid, including grain and meat -- about half of it
in the form of direct aid.
</P>
<P>
   Here by the sea in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky there are no food
shortages. But as in much of Russia, food is out of reach with the
country's economy in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has this problem. There are things to buy but no one
is buying because no one can afford it. So people grow their own,''
said Olga Kosmynina, editor of the local Rybak Kamchatsky
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia's economic crisis erupted in mid-August, her paper
has been running a regular ``how to survive'' feature -- such as
tips on how to pickle cabbage for the winter and how to better seal
your windows from the icy winter winds.
</P>
<P>
   The predicament in Kamchatka was caused by a chain reaction that
reflects the paralysis of Russia's economy today, not quite a free
market and not quite the welfare state of Soviet times.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government, virtually bankrupt, cannot pay the
military, the largest single consumer of energy in Kamchatka, which
is dotted with naval and air force bases. Thus, the military cannot
pay the local utility, which has amassed $146 million in debts and
was unable to buy fuel to run its plants.
</P>
<P>
   Until mid-November, people read by candlelight and there was no
hot water. They slept in their parkas and wool caps. The school day
and business hours were cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   This in a country that is the world's premier producer of
natural gas and on a peninsula seething with active volcanoes --
geothermal energy just waiting to be tapped. Plans call for a new
gas pipeline and geothermal plants, but construction has been
hampered by Russia's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The perplexing irony is that if this region were gauged by its
natural resources, geography and educated populace, it would be
rich. The peninsula and the surrounding waters are bountiful in
seafood and deposits of gold, copper and nickel. Kamchatka is
nearer to Tokyo and Anchorage than to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In Soviet times, such outposts were supported by the communist
government, who settled the remote regions to fortify the empire
and exploit the natural resources. But post-Soviet Russia, rife
with corruption, struggling to reform its economy and nearly out of
cash, finds it increasingly difficult to subsidize the regions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian lawmakers have called for the evacuation of over 1
million residents of the worst-hit areas. Heating fuel rations and
electricity cuts also have reached the Yakutia region in
northeastern Siberia and Sakhalin Island, Chukotka and Koryak on
Russia's northern Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Kamchatka and elsewhere, Russians approach the coming winter
with docile forbearance, relying on food they have grown during the
summer to last them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   No one predicts catastrophe, yet no one is happy about their
circumstances either as they cope to combat hunger and cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Russia, we like to emphasize that Russia is so great, so
large,'' said Vladimir Yefimov, director of the local television
station in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. ``But there is less and less
of that. Russia is being whittled away.''

developments that could call into question its commitment to freeze
and dismantle its nuclear weapons effort,'' Clinton said. ''This
trip will give us an opportunity to address this critical issue.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all of their diversity, the streetscapes of New
York City can be boiled down to a few representative elements: a
yellow cab, a hot dog stand and a steaming manhole cover. Throw in
a light-blue and white police car, and the location is fixed beyond
all doubt. Only in New York, kids, only in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that last component of the city's visual
signature will soon go the way of all things. One by one, the
NYPD's familiar patrol cars, Chevrolet Caprices painted white and a
custom shade that the department calls ``grabber blue,'' are being
replaced by lily-white Ford Crown Victorias. By 2000, when the
transition is complete, New York will be a bit more like everywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   The new cars fall in line with a standard used throughout the
nation: factory-painted white cars decorated with reflective
decals, in this case two dark blue racing stripes, the department
shield and a bold ``NYPD.''
</P>
<P>
   The new car is an unlikely award winner. In the 1997 Police
Vehicle Design Contest, sponsored by Law and Order magazine, the
NYPD won second prize, beating a white car with blue stripes from
Little Rock, Ark., but losing to a white car with blue stripes from
Lynnwood, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   William Flynn, executive director of support services for the
Police Department, said the new color scheme was ``primarily an
economic move.'' Each white car is about $800 cheaper to produce
than the blue and white car it replaces, he says. But despite total
savings in the millions of dollars _ the patrol cars' street life
is only three years _ the introduction of the new design has been
something of a stealth campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir approved the new cars in June
1996, and the first 200 or so rolled on to the streets with little
fanfare in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the city's 1,700 patrol cars have now been replaced, but
the new cars are still well below the radar of most New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Adamson, the managing director of the New York office of
Landor Associates, a large graphic design firm responsible for the
corporate identities of Federal Express, Xerox and Delta Air Lines,
suggested that New Yorkers have been slow to notice the change
because the cars were sending the wrong message. ``From a branding
point of view, I think they made a mistake,'' he said. ``You want
an image of toughness, but the new image is more suburban, more
Mayberry. When I call the police in New York, I want Detective
Sipowicz, not Andy Griffith.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the fearsome blue cars were originally part of a
program to make the police more user-friendly. Benjamin Ward,
police commissioner from 1984 to 1989, was serving as deputy
commissioner for human relations when the color was adopted in
1973. ``Probably because the department had been Irish for so long,
we all thought that green would be everybody's favorite color,'' he
said. ``But research showed that baby blue was the most popular
color in America.''
</P>
<P>
   No formal studies were conducted to test public reaction to the
all-white cars, but Hank Seiden, founder of the Seiden Group, a
Manhattan-based marketing and advertising firm, worked with the
department to develop the new look. Seiden also oversaw a more
modest redesign of the patrol car graphics in the early 1990s, when
the police introduced the bubble-headed Caprice but retained the
distinctive grabber blue.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he is sorry to see them go. ``I designed those cars and I
loved them,'' he said. ``The white car starts to look like
thousands of other police forces. But I'm happy with the way they
came out. It's a friendly car. It's like a guy on a white horse
with a white hat.''
</P>
<P>
   But the new cars may be too friendly, and too indistinct. Mark
Lerner, the president of Epic Security, one of the city's largest
private guard services, is concerned that people will mistake his
white, blue-striped fleet for the new white, blue-striped police
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in his academic capacity _ Lerner has a Ph.D. in
criminology and has taught at John Jay College in Manhattan _ he
said that the new cars would probably not make a difference in the
way the police were perceived. But he worried that the department's
distinctive edge had been lost. ``I think the old black, white and
green cars from the 1960s had the most effective look. New York
City should look different than other places.''

EL CHARRO CAFE ADDS SOUTHWESTERN FLAVOR TO THANKSGIVING DINNER  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO IS BEING SENT TO NYTNS CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY WALKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - In some ways, the Thanksgiving dinner that
Carlotta Flores cooks for her family in Tucson is like that of her
childhood memories.
</P>
<P>
   There are the two dressings, and always the mashed potatoes, and
an overflowing colorful abundance of Mexican and American foods.
</P>
<P>
   Carlotta Flores and her husband, Ray, and their family operate
El Charro Cafe in Tucson, which is the oldest Mexican restaurant in
Arizona owned by the same family. Carlotta's great-aunt, Monica
Flin, opened it in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   She was a pistol, Monica Flin. She drank martinis out of
teacups. Carlotta remembers that Monica loved to hunt and that
during quail season, wearing a dress and big hat, she would take
her guns and have someone drive her out to join the men who were
quail-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she loved bingo and she loved to smoke,'' Carlotta said.
``And makeup, she loved makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica's culinary legacy is lovingly explored in Carlotta's new
cookbook, ``El Charro Cafe: The Tastes and Traditions of Tucson,''
published by Fisher Books in Tucson ($24.95). Carlotta selected a
Thanksgiving menu from the cookbook for Arizona Republic'' readers.
</P>
<P>
   There are pumpkin tamales, of course, and two types of
dressings, cooked outside the turkey. One is made with
jalapeno-cheese bread and one is a picadillo, an easy-to-make
ground beef hash with sweet and sour overtones, which has become
traditional at Mexican weddings. Monica always made the picadillo
at Thanksgiving, Carlotta remembers.
</P>
<P>
   When Carlotta was a child, her great-aunt closed the restaurant
only on Christmas Day. So, on Thanksgiving, the family ate at the
restaurant. The children worked with the adults all day to prepare
the feast and helped set the table with Monica's own china, silver
and linens. Other Tucson families joined them and were served
family style, each with their own turkey. Monica always sent them
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, El Charro is closed on Thanksgiving. Carlotta makes a
great abundance of food for anywhere from 25 to 55 people. Her
daughter, Candace, director of special events for the restaurant's
catering division, said one of the family jokes is that everybody
wants to be there at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always another plate,'' Carlotta said. ``There's
always lots of food.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica made lamb as well as turkey for the holiday, Carlotta
said. Other kinds of meats are on the modern menu, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband's not a turkey lover, so it wouldn't be unusual to
do a pastrami for him,'' Carlotta said.
</P>
<P>
   One of her kids wants green beans with french-fried onions;
another likes pearl onions in cream sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Ejotes con Crema y Almendras, String Beans with Cream and
Almonds, from the cookbook, suggests an updated combination of
both. Green beans are cooked, seasoned, napped with sour cream and
sprinkled with a little Mexican or feta cheese, and slivered
almonds. The basic idea can be adapted to other vegetables or
combinations, too, Carlotta says. She includes low-fat variations
with many recipes, reflecting the many low-fat options on El
Charro's menu.
</P>
<P>
   Calabacitas, Carlotta's take on the favorite squash and corn
dish reminiscent of succotash, is also on her suggested menu. She
likes to use zucchini, pattypan or yellow crookneck squash,
separately or in combination.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Mashed Potatoes are served with two salsas, Red and
Green, nestled in wells. The potatoes are mashed and whipped with
15 ounces of evaporated milk and a couple of tablespoons of butter.
Then, a cup of diced, roasted fresh green chiles are folded in. The
flavor is especially good with roasted turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Carlotta rewrote this cookbook from an earlier version she
published herself that had even more family history in it. It's a
well-conceived portrait of a landmark restaurant and a valuable
addition to the written food history of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   El Charro's influence has moved far beyond the state's borders.
Carlotta credits Monica with invention of the chimichanga, the
topopo salad and even the cheese crisp. And El Charro Cafe is the
only restaurant still known to make carne seca in the old way,
drying in the sun 500 pounds of beef daily that are hoisted in a
vast cage above the roof. Because you probably don't want to
sun-dry hundreds of pounds of beef in the sky above your house, you
can't exactly duplicate El Charro's carne seca at home. However,
Carlotta gives a recipe for a good facsimile.
</P>
<P>
   Now nationally famous, the chimichanga at El Charro is made with
the 18-inch white flour tortillas found only in southern Arizona.
The topopo is more of a Tucson dish, served in many Mexican
restaurants there as well as a few in the Valley, such as Los
Olivos in Scottsdale. Monica was inspired by a Mexican volcano to
create the cone-shape mound of salad lined with chicken and cheese
strips.
</P>
<P>
   The cheese crisp is the litmus test for Arizona's Mexican
restaurants, because it's one of those deceptively simple things
that can be sublime or terrible. The local open-face version of the
quesadilla is one of those big flour tortillas crisped in the oven
or on a griddle and covered with melted cheese. And, if the menu
says ``cheese crisp'' instead of ``quesadilla,'' it's not a chain.
</P>
<P>
   The giant flour tortilla may be the basis for much of the
Mexican-American cuisine of southern Arizona, but for Thanksgiving,
Monica, and later Carlotta, always picked up football-shape rolls,
bolillos, at a bakery. These are basically French bread rolls,
Maximilian's gift to Mexican history.
</P>
<P>
   These days, there is more than one El Charro. Three are at
Tucson International Airport and one is on the east side of Tucson
at 6310 E. Broadway Blvd.
</P>
<P>
   The historic downtown location, 311 N. Court Ave., is in the El
Presidio Historic District and is on the National Register of
Historic Places. The black basalt building was built by Monica's
father, Jules Flin, a young French stonemason who moved to Tucson
in 1860. The eight children he and Carlota Brunet, who was also of
French descent, had were bilingual, then trilingual.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the restaurants, Carlotta now operates a factory,
which makes eight kinds of tamales, minichimichangas, chilaquiles,
red and green chili sauces, and four salsas. Most is sold in bulk
to restaurants, although the salsas are sold in gift shops, too.
The sauces are the secrets to her food, Carlotta said. They are her
way to assure the same taste, the consistency, in all her
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Next, this dynamo is looking north. Carlotta said she is
scouting Tempe and downtown Phoenix for the next possible El Charro
spots.
</P>
<P>
   And the world is going to look at Carlotta. The ``Los Angeles
Times'' wrote about her new cookbook for el Dia de los Muertos. And
QVC, the shopping channel, is interested in packaging the salsas
with the cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   History is still being made. &QL;

separate beef and brown it quickly. Add garlic puree, onion,
potato, celery, tomato, raisins, vinegar, ketchup, olives, sugar,
cinnamon and apples. Cook until flavors blend, about 15 minutes,
stirring frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Garlic puree: To make 1/2 cup garlic puree, peel four whole
heads (the entire thing, not four cloves) of garlic by smashing the
cloves with the side of a wide knife; the peels will slip off
easily. Put garlic in blender or food processor with 1/4 cup water,
and puree to the consistency of applesauce. Store in a tightly
closed jar in refrigerator and use within a week.

CARLOTTA'S ROASTED TURKEY &QL; 
(From Carlotta Flores)
</P>
<P>
   Approximate values per serving of turkey with skin and gravy:
647 calories, 36 g fat, 244 mg cholesterol, 2 g carbohydrates, 0.4
g fiber, 73 g protein, 738 mg sodium, 52 percent calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
   12- to 16-pound turkey (reserve neck and gizzard for gravy,
below)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup salt mixed with 2 tablespoons ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion
</P>
<P>
   2 celery ribs
</P>
<P>
   1 medium apple, cut in half
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup finely chopped garlic mixed with 4 tablespoons vegetable
oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup melted margarine
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 475 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Rinse the turkey inside and out, remove any remaining quills,
and pat dry. Season the bird inside and out with salt and pepper
mixture. Place onion, celery and apple in turkey cavity; drizzle
garlic/oil mix over the ingredients in cavity. Pat outside of
turkey, under wings, on legs, underside of bird and breast with
melted margarine.
</P>
<P>
   Wrap foil around the tips of legs. Place turkey on rack in a
roasting pan to allow air circulation, making sure pan is big
enough to hold turkey. Roast turkey in preheated oven at 475
degrees for approximately 35 minutes or until it starts to brown.
Reduce heat to 375 degrees and cover loosely with foil. Baste often
with the natural juices of the turkey and cook for about 1 1/2 to 2
hours or until pop-up thermometer pops, or until thermometer
(placed in thickest part of the breast) reads 175 degrees. Transfer
turkey to platter, cover and let set for 30 minutes before slicing.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: Turkey breasts can be cooked in a separate pan, with
the same process as the turkey, only place the vegetables under the
breasts on the rack, and bake until ready. At times Carlotta has
barbecued the breasts to have a different flavor of the turkey at
the table. She bastes the breasts often, as they tend to dry out if
not handled with a little more care than the whole turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Carlotta keeps a squeeze container of melted margarine to
help with the basting process because she feels the margarine adds
to the overall browning of the turkey with a moistness that is
welcomed by her family.
</P>
<P>
   For gravy: Combine 4 cups water with rinsed and chopped turkey
neck and gizzard. Add 1 celery stalk cut in half; 1 onion,
quartered; 1 tablespoon salt; 1 bay leaf; and 2 garlic cloves. Cook
for about 1 hour, then add 2 cans (14.5 ounces each) low-sodium
chicken broth. Cook half-hour more, strain, and proceed with your
favorite gravy recipe, using the turkey stock for your gravy base.
</P>
<P>
   Carlotta uses Wondra flour for her gravy and has Kitchen Bouquet
on hand in case she thinks the gravy lacks flavor. At this point,
she adds strained chipotle paste (2 to 4 canned chipotle peppers,
pureed) and a 14-ounce jar of warmed prickly pear jam or jelly to
the gravy to give it added zing!
</P>
<P>
   She also dices fresh parsley and adds to the gravy boat.

A NEEDLE IN THE INTERNET HAYSTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to homework assignments, the goal in my household
is to avoid, at all costs, the diorama.
</P>
<P>
   I recognize the value of the dreaded diorama as a fallback
option for families who avoid confronting until the very last
minute the looming deadline of a fourth-grade social studies
project. That said, everything else about the diorama experience _
the tense search for an empty shoe box, the furtive attempt to
remove its price tag before someone asks whether $100 wasn't a lot
of money to spend on lug-sole loafers, the bickering over who used
up all the glue and brown construction paper _ is bleak.
</P>
<P>
   The best you can hope for is that after your child assembles a
phony three-dimensional scene using Popsicle sticks that plausibly
depicts, say, the discovery of fire, the project will survive the
bus ride to school _ but not the bus ride home.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this vicious cycle, my 9-year-old daughter and I went
to the public library the other day to research Algonquin crafts.
But then we saw a sign taped to the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closed for renovation,'' Zoe read darkly. ``I am going to fail
fourth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   My mood matched hers; by the time the library reopened, we would
already be enmeshed in a diorama situation.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, our home computer could save us. In second
grade, the machine had proved an adequate tool for supplementary
research, enabling Zoe to snag information about the history of
copper off an obscure Web site. But this would be a task of a much
broader scope.
</P>
<P>
   At home a half-hour later, it seemed prudent to start slowly.
Why confront the Internet at all if we didn't need to? Had we been
at the public library, Zoe's first step would have been to look up
``Algonquin'' in an encyclopedia. So I handed her the CD-ROM for
the Encarta encyclopedia. After the opening screen appeared, Zoe
intuitively clicked on Find. Then I pointed out the on-screen query
box (participating far more than I would have had to at the
library, by the way, where I could have skulked in a corner reading
back issues of my favorite magazines). She typed ``Algonquin'' in
the search box, selected the first of four matches that appeared,
then read aloud. ``Native North American tribe of the Algonquian
lin-something stock, dwelling originally in the vin ... city of the
Ga ... What is that word, Gadzo River?''
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, she looked up. ``I don't think this has anything
that will help me.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked over her shoulder. ``That's linguistic, vicinity and
Gatineau River,''' I said. If she had been wrong on pronunciation,
Zoe had been right on the bigger issue. Despite its multimedia
format and links to related articles and maps, Encarta gave us the
same general kind of information as an old-fashioned paper
encyclopedia. One difference: a book would not have forced us to
reboot; Encarta crashed the computer when I inserted its second
disk.
</P>
<P>
   At the library, the next step would have been to find a
reference librarian. So we logged on to America Online, then
connected to its Ask a Teacher feature (keyword: homework). Zoe
typed a query to one of AOL's social studies specialists: ``How can
I learn about Algonquin crafts?''
</P>
<P>
   An on-screen message informed us that ``teachers will read your
e-mail and attempt to provide an answer by e-mail.'' (Three days
later, we were still waiting.) In the meantime, we tried AOL's
other features. We searched its articles database (keyword:
elibrary) but got only irrelevant responses, like a list of
sleep-away summer camps in Minnesota. Then we tried the social
studies tutoring room on the Kids Only channel (click on Homework
Help, then Discuss It). The tutoring room was closed, although,
according to the posted hours, it should have been open.
</P>
<P>
   Trying not to lose heart, we decided to conduct rudimentary Web
searches on www.hotbot.com and www.yahoo.com. Although her query _
``Algonquin crafts'' _ returned screens of responses, none of the
first 20 on either site seemed useful (after 20, we gave up).
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two uproductive hours, the Internet seemed like
just another form of diorama, a vast collection of useless facts
that is a simulacrum of real knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But since I don't want my daughter to think it is OK to be
defeated by adversity _ or technical perversity _ as a last resort
we queried a children's search engine, Ask Jeeves for Kids
(www.ajkids.com). Zoe clicked on a response and the screen filled
with gold. At www.civilization.ca/membrs/fph/stones/engfrm.htm, we
found descriptions of American Indian musical instruments, toys,
crafts, articles of clothing. Zoe decided to build a version of a
cradleboard that had once carried an Algonquin child's doll.
</P>
<P>
   So what was the biggest difference between old-fashioned library
research and computer research? The odds. At the library, we would
have found information in some children's reference book or
another. It might not have been exhilarating, but it would have
been adequate. Using the computer, however, was an all-or-nothing
experience. This time, it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never could have found this list at the library,'' Zoe
said. That was the good news. The bad news? To make the
cradleboard, we needed a shoe box.

MAYOR WANTS JUSTICE FOR ACCUSED PIE-THROWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown said three people accused of
plastering him with pies should face ``whatever justice is
appropriate'' to discourage more such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are charged with battery and misdemeanor assault on
a public official. Four days before the Nov. 7 attack on the mayor,
San Francisco Supervisor Gavin Newsom was struck by a pie during
his election-night victory party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unpleasant experience,'' Brown said Tuesday. ``They
should be used as an example so that the conduct ceases to occur. I
don't want anyone else victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 64, hurt his right ankle and bruised his right knee when
he tackled one of the pie throwers and held him on the ground until
the police arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Brown told a news conference that the ankle was severely
sprained and would cause discomfort for four to six weeks. The
mayor said he had agreed to increased police protection and would
make it easier for his bodyguards to do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've interfered more than I should have,'' he said, noting he
has at times gone without a bodyguard against the advice of the
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``They promised to do the job as discreetly as possible,'' he
said. ``But they hope to not allow anyone to get that close to me
again.''
</P>
<P>
   John Shanley, spokesman for District Attorney Terence Hallinan,
said the three defendants are scheduled for trial Jan. 8 on the two
misdemeanor charges, which carry a maximum sentence of one year in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Shanley said that depending on the severity of the mayor's
injuries, the charges could be bumped up to felonies. He said
investigators from Hallinan's office would interview the mayor and
would seek his medical records.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a closed deal,'' Shanley said. ``A serious injury
would warrant felony charges. People shouldn't interpret the
misdemeanor charges as us not taking it seriously. We take this
case very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever justice is appropriate for people who assault people
in a cowardly way,'' Brown said when asked if the charges against
the pie throwers should be felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Members of group calling itself the Biotic Baking Brigade have
said they hit the mayor with pies to call attention to his policies
on homelessness. The pies were intended to make a statement through
humor and were never meant to hurt anyone, members of the group
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor defended the right to protest. However, he said, ``the
right to protest stops at another person's physical presence. You
don't have the right to punch me in my face with your fist or a
pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he was struck with a tin pie plate in the face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half an inch lower and it wouldn't have been an ankle injury,
it would have been an eye injury,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, if a patient was thought to have a fever, a
nurse or doctor might well have wedged a mercury thermometer a foot
and a half long into the patient's armpit and waited. And waited.
</P>
<P>
   When doctors started using mercury thermometers in the mid-19th
century, the instruments were so large that the mercury typically
took almost a half-hour to heat up for a temperature reading _
unthinkable for people today, who have become accustomed to getting
a temperature reading in just seconds with an instant ear
thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of ear thermometers say the ear is the best place
to measure body temperature because the eardrum is a couple of
inches from the hypothalamus, the area of the brain that, among its
many duties, regulates body temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The ear thermometers are slowly replacing mercury thermometers _
the gag-provoking oral thermometer and the squirm-inducing rectal
one. These two types, also known as contact thermometers, can get
inaccurate temperature readings because of breathing or saliva, in
the case of oral thermometers, or poor circulation in the torso, in
the case of rectal thermometers. But how does an ear thermometer,
whose probe never actually touches the surface of its target, the
eardrum, achieve an accurate reading? And how does it do so without
using a drop of mercury?
</P>
<P>
   When something is warm, it gives off energy. The hotter an
object, the higher the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation
it gives off. Very hot objects, like light bulbs, radiate what
people call light _ electromagnetic radiation in the visible
portion of the spectrum, from violet to red, or 350 to 400
nanometers to 750 or 800 nanometers (a nanometer is a billionth of
a meter). The hotter a light bulb filament gets, the greater the
intensity of the light. Reducing the heat changes the color of the
light. Dimming a light bulb, for example, changes the color of the
light from yellowish to reddish.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the filament of a light bulb, the human body radiates
heat, which can be detected as infrared radiation, or infrared
light. Although infrared light cannot be seen by the human eye, it
can be detected by sensors designed to measure the radiation
frequencies below the visible range.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to determine someone's temperature by measuring
the amount of infrared radiation being emitted.
</P>
<P>
   Ear thermometers operate on this principle, calculating
temperatures by measuring the infrared radiation that emanates from
the eardrum and its surrounding tissue. The most widely sold ear
thermometers for home use contain something called a pyroelectric
sensor, a detection device that responds to infrared radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The first pyroelectric ear thermometer, called the Thermoscan,
was invented by Dr. Jacob Fraden, a biomedical electronic engineer
in San Diego, and introduced to hospitals and doctors' offices in
1990. Now they are in wide use by professionals and in the homes of
happy parents who never want to pick up another fragile tube
containing mercury. Of course, the new thermometers can cost three
times as much as the mercury ones, or more.
</P>
<P>
   A pyroelectric ear thermometer works like this: When you insert
the probe into the ear canal and press the trigger button, a
shutter in the probe (like a camera shutter) snaps open. When the
shutter opens, infrared heat from the eardrum zigzags down the
barrel of the probe and hits the pyroelectric sensor; the
absorption of the infrared energy warms the sensor and changes its
electrical conductivity. The sensor then sends an electrical signal
indicating the amount of heat to a circuit board, where it is
amplified, converted into a digital signal and sent to a
microprocessor, which ultimately turns it into a digital
temperature readout.
</P>
<P>
   Another kind of sensor used in ear thermometers, called a
thermopile, performs a continuous measurement of emitted infrared
energy, rather than taking a snapshot. Because a thermopile sensor
takes an average of five temperature readings, it must be left in
the ear several seconds longer than necessary with a pyroelectric
ear thermometer.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of thermopile thermometers say they are more
accurate because they conduct several temperature scans.
Pyroelectric thermometer manufacturers, however, say that as long
as the probe is pointing directly at the eardrum when it is in the
ear canal, several scans are not necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what type of sensor is used to determine body
temperature, every ear thermometer contains either a four-bit or
eight-bit microprocessor. Using a complex mathematical approach
that takes into account the ambient temperature, the microprocessor
converts the signal measuring the infrared radiation into degrees
Fahrenheit or Celsius, and displays the number on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   The new thermometers have made life easier for sick children and
are now helping sick animals, too. After Fraden sold Thermoscan to
Gillette Co. in 1995, he developed a veterinary version, now
marketed by Advanced Monitors Corp., The thermometer's probe is
longer because horses, cows and dogs, for example, have deeper ear
canals than humans (as well as body temperatures that average
several degrees higher than humans').

NEW PUPPY MEANS IT'S HOWDY DOODY TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It's 2 a.m., and I'm sitting on my couch in the living
room in the dark, wearing only a sweat shirt and my underwear. I
have a stuffed fleece alligator in my right hand and am shaking it
at the growling creature stalking my feet. Neither my husband nor I
have had a full night's sleep in a week.
</P>
<P>
   It is completely our fault and we know it. We bought into the
dream, refinancing our patience and sanity to do it. When we
spotted the puppy in a wet cage at the pound, she was soaked,
crying and shaking. As she licked our fingers through the wire, her
coat dripping and matted, we knew we had to save her and take her
home.
</P>
<P>
   After she had been spayed the next day, we went to retrieve her
and were presented a sweet, lolling puppy with the words, ``Here's
your dog. Don't wash her for 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good dog,'' my husband said as we watched her sleep
that night in her newly prepared wicker bed. We both marveled at
how lucky we were to have such a calm, well-dispositioned puppy.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, however, my husband frantically woke me up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's something wrong with that dog,'' he said. ``I
think we got a rabid one. She keeps biting me and growling, and I'm
about to name her `Foamy' and take her out to the barn to put her
down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK,'' I said, getting out of bed. ``She's just coming
around, getting used to us. All puppies bite and play.''
</P>
<P>
   But when we entered the living room, it was covered in small,
white flecks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't here a minute ago,'' my husband said, picking up a
shredded piece of toilet paper from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my fault,'' I admitted. ``I shouldn't have left it on the
coffee table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you leave the Tootsie Rolls from Halloween out, too?'' he
asked, lifting up his foot to display the chocolate prize that had
lodged between his toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want me to say yes,'' I said slowly, ``or tell you the
truth that we didn't have any left?''
</P>
<P>
   That was when we realized that the puppy wasn't GOOD when we
brought her home, she was just SEDATED.
</P>
<P>
   The commercials for Puppy Chow don't show this part of dog
babyhood on TV, I learned over the next couple of days. They don't
show that after you spend 40 bucks on puppy toys, her favorite
playthings will actually consist of an empty toilet paper roll and
a plastic tampon applicator she wrestled out of the box.
</P>
<P>
   They don't show the puppy lunging for my ears like Mike Tyson,
or that she can miraculously produce two sounds at the same time, a
growl and a primal scream, like a Tibetan monk.
</P>
<P>
   They don't show the already existing pets in the house ducking
for cover under beds, in closets and behind bathtubs, fearful that
her puppy teeth will mutilate their private parts _ the only part
of them she can reach.
</P>
<P>
   They don't show that new-puppy parents should always wear hiking
boots or face the wrath of those same teeth gnawing at their ankles
like a paw stuck in a trap.
</P>
<P>
   They don't show that she will try to claw her way to freedom via
your recently refinished wood floors, or that you will smell doody
everywhere but won't find it until it's attached to you.
</P>
<P>
   They don't show that she doesn't even like Puppy Chow and
prefers to fish her meals out of the deposits left in the kitty
box.
</P>
<P>
   I think that someone should have the responsibility of telling
you this before you get a new puppy, because people forget. It's
been 11 years since the last time I brought a fuzzy creature home,
the same creature who is now a graying, chunky old lady who looks
at me from behind the pillows on the couch with disgust out of her
one good eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you have been so stupid?'' she seems to be saying to
me. ``I thought you guys were being `careful.' I don't know how
this happened; I sleep at the foot of the bed and I'm with you ALL
THE TIME. Now I've got this dog that wants to nurse on me, and I'm
77 years old! Look at you, you've got a smashed Tootsie Roll stuck
to your shoe.''
</P>
<P>
   The cat's sentiments were easily as abhorrent: ``I hate you more
now than I did yesterday,'' was the message he sent me. ``I'm going
to pee on something you just bought!''
</P>
<P>
   They were right. We had completely lost control of our house,
relinquished it to a 3-pound hairball of terror who caused my
husband to speculate aloud, ``I think at night . . . IT FLIES.''
</P>
<P>
   How were we supposed to know about the dangers? There certainly
wasn't a sign posted outside her cage that read, ``This puppy will
cost you 742 hours of sleep, six fights with your spouse, the
respect of your other pets and $3,000 to repair valuable antiques
and will think for a very long time that `no-no' means `Good girl!
Do it again!' ''
</P>
<P>
   After taking her to the vet and confirming that she was not
rabid or an infant grizzly bear left at the pound by mistake, my
husband decided to try his own method of reclaiming control.
</P>
<P>
   ``GRRRR! GRRRR!'' he mimicked as he played with the puppy on the
couch last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you should do that,'' I snapped. ``You're
teaching her to be vicious!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't pick at your ankle scabs. The smell of fresh blood
excites her,'' he whispered back. ``GRRRR! I'm teaching her that
I'm in charge. I am the Alpha Dog!''
</P>
<P>
   The puppy backed down for a minute, rolled onto her back and
grew quiet.
</P>
<P>
   He looked up and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``See?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, then, I'm not going to bother making dinner,'' I said.
``The cat just had a bowel movement big enough for the both of
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``GRRRR,'' he said, lunging for my ankle. &QL;

WEB ROBOTS OFFER HAND-ON EXPERIENCE FROM AFAR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Wis., Va.)  (Eds: Please note subslug for CIR-PAINTING-ROBOT)  
 (af)  
 By DAVID KUSHNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The artist dipped his brush into a can of red paint. With one
motion, he swiped a thick, fierce stripe across the middle of the
canvas: a gooey, abstract landscape in primary colors. It had been
a long afternoon, and the floor was covered with drips and splats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good thing I don't have to clean up,'' the painter (this
reporter) thought as he logged off. Such is the luxury of painting
with a Web robot, a remote telerobotic device that is operated via
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, an aspiring Jackson Pollock in Brooklyn (or
anywhere on the planet) can make a masterpiece using PumaPaint, a
six-foot, one-armed, 500-pound robot at Wilkes University in
Wilkes-Barre, Pa. yugo.mme.wilkes.edu/ villanov/).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works. Click on one of the four paint-bucket icons
_ each representing a different color _ click again to dip the
brush, roll the mouse to move it. A live, though slow and choppy,
video clip shows the PumaPaint robot responding, reproducing your
strokes on an actual canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Leave an e-mail address and Matthew R. Stein, the associate
professor who started offering the robot's services this summer,
will send you your masterpiece for no charge, at least for the time
being. It's point and paint.
</P>
<P>
   From San Francisco to Japan, Web robots run the gamut, from the
sublime (painting) to the mundane (toy trains). One allowed
students to interact with robots at the site of the Titanic
wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Another was developed so NASA scientists could control the
Pathfinder mission on Mars from around the world. In fact, the Web
robot world is mature enough to have critical mass: in October, the
first international conference in the field was held in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Web robots' roots date to the early days of the Internet, when
academics in England pointed a digital camera at a coffeepot and
updated images to the Web every few minutes. Soon, Web-cams grew
more interactive, allowing surfers to aim them in different
directions and at varied subjects: street corners, animals and,
yes, bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   If Web-cams took the central nervous system of the Internet and
gave it eyes, then Web robots have completed the body. With the
increased sophistication of Internet programs like CGI, which is
used to update Web page information rapidly, and Java, which can
relay tiny packets of information between computers, it became
easier for a home PC to issue complex commands to a machine
somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the first two Web robots started up almost
simultaneously (although independently) in 1994. One was a
six-legged robot bearing a camera at the University of Western
Australia, the other a robot arm with a camera that dug buried
artifacts out of a sandbox at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   A third Web robot, called the Tele-Garden, achieved a measure of
Internet fame in 1995 for its founder, Ken Goldberg, an associate
professor of engineering who was behind the 1994 Berkeley project.
</P>
<P>
   The Tele-Garden (telegarden.aec.at) is a six-foot-wide planter
in Austria that can be seeded using a robotic arm. More than a
half-million commands were sent to the robot in the first six
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our objectives is to explore the attention span of Web
surfers,'' Goldberg wrote via e-mail. ``When you plant a seed, it
takes several days to see a result. Those who stick around create
an interesting community, or culture, that's based on patience and
a bit of caring. But we don't intend the Tele-Garden as a utopian
vision of the future of gardening but more as a dystopian reminder
about the pleasures of real gardens.''
</P>
<P>
   For his most recent Web robot, Goldberg created an art project
entitled ``Dislocation of Intimacy.'' In October, a black steel box
at a San Francisco gallery was connected to the Internet. Visitors
to the site (www.dislocation.net) could control motors, lights, and
two fans within the box, causing the box to appear as if it were
breathing. An electronic camera updated the results every two
seconds to the Web. At the same time, visitors to the museum could
see the results in person.
</P>
<P>
   Humanizing the Net with this sort of interactive art is also the
ambition behind PumaPaint, the Web robot at Wilkes University.
Stein, an associate professor of mechanical engineering, initiated
the project after creating an online telerobotic exercise between
his students and a group at the University of Wisconsin. Then,
Stein said in a telephone interview, ``I became curious about what
we as a community of Web surfers would do with a blank canvas and
the ability to paint it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to PumaPaint have left everything from smiley faces to
a surprisingly discernible portrait of Vincent Van Gogh. Randy
Robertson, a PumaPainter in Virginia, wrote via e-mail that the
device offered him more than just a good time. He felt as though he
had glimpsed a Jetsons-like future, when workers might be able to
manufacture goods at a factory from the comforts of their own home.
</P>
<P>
   ``As applications like PumaPaint are developed,'' Robertson
wrote, ``the advantages of rural relocation will greatly outweigh
the disadvantages.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrinking the global village has been on the minds of web robot
developers like Roland Siegwart of the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland. Siegwart has focused his work
on creating mobile robots that might one day roam the halls of the
museums or the streets of New York. On his current site, users
guide five miniature vehicles named Alice through a city-like maze
(dmtwww.epfl.ch/isr/asl/projects/alicepj.html).
</P>
<P>
   Web robot developers remain a small but dedicated group.
Siegwart invited two dozen leaders in the field to convene at the
conference in Canada in October. Those attending, including Stein
and Goldberg, as well as Web robot developers from Germany and
Japan, presented their recent findings about robot Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Y. Taylor of the University of Western Australia said
that a survey of users showed that 95 percent of his Web robot
visitors were male. The majority of visitors stayed for just a
brief period of time, though some remained for hours. Many users
reported being frustrated with the time delay, a problem that will
presumably will ease as bandwidth on the Internet increases over
time.
</P>
<P>
   At Carnegie Mellon University, a popular web robot named Xavier
has provided lessons about how humans interact with remote
machines. Xavier www.cs.cmu.edu/Xavier) is a mobile robot that can
be deployed throughout a university building. Using a
text-to-speech program, Xavier can be instructed by a Web surfer
to, for example, go down to the X-ray lab and tell a knock-knock
joke.
</P>
<P>
   Though surfers have enjoyed the novelty, there have been
problems. Batteries in Xavier can die out. Worse, the radio
communication system used for robot is limited in bandwidth, thus
limiting the potential interactivity. Surfers can get an e-mailed
report that their mission had been completed, but they are unable
to witness the punch lines being delivered.
</P>
<P>
   A list of other Web-robot sites can be found at the site 
dir.yahoo.com/ComputersandInternet/Internet/InterestingDevicesConnec
tedtotheNet/Robots/
</P>
<P>
   For now, the experiments are mostly recreational in nature, but
developers hope to one day perfect practical applications.
``Telerobotics has a fairly long history in hazardous environments
i.e. nuclear, space and undersea,'' Taylor wrote, ``Web
telerobotics can be used in all of these at lower cost than
traditional techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, kinder, gentler robots like PumaPaint await
your instruction _ 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Soon, Stein
might have to invent another robot: one that mops.

SHEDDING LIGHT ON IMMIGRANT FOLK ART 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ore., Ill., Conn.)   (bl)  
 By MITCHELL OWENS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Miniseries and documentaries have long explored the
immigrant experience in the United States. But few if any scholars
have addressed the connection between immigration and America's
esthetic history. Luckily, until they do, there is the Fall
Antiques Show.
</P>
<P>
   Opening Thursday at the 7th Regiment Armory on Park Avenue (67th
Street), and running through Sunday, this 20th annual exhibition of
America's top dealers in rustic antiques and folk art sheds new
light on a dim corner in the history of American decorative arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immigrants brought their talents with them, along with their
cultures, and it showed up in home handiwork,'' said Howard Stein
of the dealers Linda &AMP; Howard Stein. ``Foreign expressions are at
the heart of what we now call folk art.''
</P>
<P>
   The master work that the Steins have brought to Manhattan proves
his point. Though made in Wisconsin at the turn of the century, the
Steins' 6-foot-tall armoire is as Swiss as the anonymous carpenter
who made it. Whoever he was, he laboriously carved six-pointed
stars and fish-scale-like patterns into pine planks and then
stained them brilliant red and orange. At the base of the armoire,
which is priced at $7,500, are carved representations of the
emblems of Switzerland's cantons, or provinces, as well as the
country's totemic red cross.
</P>
<P>
   An especially spectacular entry is a 10-piece suite of furniture
_ including a desk, several chairs and magazine racks _ made by a
patriotic immigrant, Christopher Moe. Moe, who died in his 80s, in
1941, was a Norwegian carpenter who came to America on July 4,
1886, settled in Portland, Ore., and proceeded to celebrate his
newly minted citizenship by declaring his allegiance through the
wonders of marquetry.
</P>
<P>
   Using more than 10,000 tidbits of sycamore, rosewood, mahogany
and biron, an Alaskan hardwood, Moe highlighted America's rich
maritime, political and social history in a collection of
Mission-style furniture decorated _ nay, encrusted _ with pictorial
fascinations. One of the magazine racks is inlaid with a clipper
ship, while on the back of a chair a covered wagon eternally
crosses the Great Plains.
</P>
<P>
   And Moe's sprawling desk _ the furniture was made for his own
use between 1918 and 1931 and later left to the family that cared
for him in his declining years _ is a home-office hymn to World War
I, its broad flat top emblazoned with the flags of the Allied
nations, dates of great battles and the insignia of U.S. Army
units.
</P>
<P>
   Most bizarre of all is the floor lamp, a giant honey-colored
gewgaw whose umbrella-like wooden shade protects a Mount Rushmore
of three-dimensional landmarks like the White House, the Capitol
and the Statue of Liberty holding a flame-shaped light bulb in her
right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an album of America,'' said Allan Katz, a dealer from
Woodbridge, Conn., who pulled out an old newspaper clipping of the
mustachioed, bespectacled Moe for inspection. ``He looks like
Gepetto, doesn't he?'' Katz and his wife, Penny, are offering the
collection for $115,000.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of the recent focus on folk art has been dominated
by the eccentric creations of ``outsider'' craftsmen _ untrained
and often mentally troubled _ the Carl Hammer Gallery, which is
exhibiting in space A-11, features an armchair whose history and
design neatly combine prideful immigrant status with religious
zealotry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to belong to Barbara Johnson, one of the great
American folk art collectors,'' Hammer said. Priced at $16,000, the
circa-1915 chair is attributed to Jonas Bergren, a genius carpenter
and citizen of Bishop Hill, Ill., a radical religious utopia
settled by Swedish immigrants in the 19th century. It collapsed
after its prophet-leader was murdered by a disgruntled follower.
</P>
<P>
   Stained, varnished and gilded, the dark and brooding chair looks
like an early 19th-century Russian bergere channeled through a Ken
Burns documentary: fat gilded snakes straight out of a parlor at
the Pavlovsk Palace twist around uprights carved to resemble Indian
braves, and the back of the chair is a farrago of carved fringed
curtains and mysterious arabesques.
</P>
<P>
   Equally inventive and just as stylistically bold is the early
19th-century Grecian-style sofa offered by Hallem &AMP; Swope, a
gallery in Hudson, N.Y. Made around 1815, probably in southern
Canada, the elegant cane-seated piece nonetheless makes a folk art
statement, thanks to the ferocious-looking rooster heads that
ornament its arms. Though light years away in technical execution,
the sofa ($19,000) would work well alongside Hammer's Bergren
armchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough of the original gilding remains to give a sense of how
rich it would have been,'' said Jonathan Hallem, a partner in the
firm. ``And just look at the cockerels. They're fierce, like
fighting cocks, not gentle looking at all.''

Q &AMP; A: PARTITIONING A HARD DRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What does it mean to partition a hard drive? Is it advisable
to do so?
</P>
<P>
   A. Partitioning your hard drive means dividing one large space
into smaller units, or partitions. Think of a lovely old house that
was once a four-story single-family dwelling in the early part of
the century. Now envision that the house is sold a few decades
later, and the new owner puts up walls and doors and turns the
single-family dwelling into eight apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they are all part of the same big drive, each new
partition is assigned its own drive letter under Windows; if you
divide a Macintosh drive, you see separate icons on the desktop for
each partition.
</P>
<P>
   Partitioning is best done when you initially format a new hard
drive; to do it later is time-consuming because you must first save
and then reinstall all your files and programs.
</P>
<P>
   Why would you want to divide your hard drive? One of the main
reasons is that partitioning a multigigabyte hard drive can make it
work faster. When you are working on a file in a particular
segment, the computer doesn't have to look all over the hard drive
for the file's data, just in that one area.

NEW SHOW'S LOSS IS SAD COMMENTARY

   UNDATED - I first read about Keith Olbermann jumping ship from
MSNBC to Fox Sports News last week in the sports section of the
newspaper. I read a follow-up story in the features section.
</P>
<P>
   Fitting, because for his fans, his quitting as host of ``The Big
Show'' resonates across all sorts of boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   True, he is merely jumping from one cable network to another
after making a name for himself at a third _ ESPN, where he was
co-host of the ``SportsCenter'' highlight show. But Olbermann is
someone who can talk about most anything intelligently, the sort of
quasi-Renaissance man who puts a lie to the myth that sports guys
can't cover anything not involving first downs and three-point
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Others came before him in that regard, of course. Bob Costas'
star never shined so brightly, for my money, as when he hosted
``Later,'' a late, late-night talk show. Costas has a nearly
encyclopedic knowledge of pop culture, and he brought it to bear in
a smart, understated way _ nothing like the 38-ounce Louisville
Slugger he hits baseball fans over the head with when he's calling
games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Monica, Monica, Monica
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But hopes were so high for Olbermann. Not only was he
intelligent in his sports work at ESPN, he also had a nice little
smart-aleck streak. He seemed a natural to move on to a wider
canvas.
</P>
<P>
   So when he began ``The Big Show,'' which was to be a news show
with the Olbermann twist, at MSNBC last summer, the future looked
bright. It took him a while to get his MSNBC legs, but he improved.
He always entertains. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying he's
George Will or Sam Donaldson. I'm saying he's better.
</P>
<P>
   Then a funny thing happened in the White House, and, soon,
Olbermann might as well have been host of ``The Big Lewinsky Show''
because that's just about the only subject he ever covered.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he did a bad job of it. It's just that when it
comes to topics, Olbermann is like a shark. He has to keep moving
to survive. Sticking him with one subject was a losing proposition.
</P>
<P>
   He says now that the Monica Lewinsky quagmire was ``tangential''
to his leaving MSNBC, but no one much believes him _ especially
after he made comments such as this during the commencement address
at his alma mater, Cornell, in May: ``There are days now when my
line of work makes me ashamed, makes me depressed, makes me cry. .
. . About three weeks ago, I awakened from my stupor on this
subject and told my employers that I simply could not continue
doing this show about the endless investigation and the
investigation of the investigation, and the investigation of the
investigation of the investigation.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Uh-oh, another logo
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the thing is, he was right. Not just about the Lewinsky
story but about the way so many stories are covered. You can't
watch television news stories without first seeing a splashy logo _
``White House in Crisis'' or ``Showdown With Iraq'' or some such.
And a logo is a guarantee the story will be done to death.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet that when the people who design these things sit down
to eat in the morning, they intone in a James Earl Jones baritone,
``English muffin vs. Bagel: The Battle for Breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Every news show, be it ``Talk Back Live'' or ``Burden of Proof''
or ``News Chat,'' is now basically the same. They line up a couple
of ``experts'' who think Bill Clinton is a cloven-hoofed satyr and
square them off against a couple of others who spend their spare
time shining Clinton's halo. (The characters change, but the format
doesn't; when things heat up with Iraq, simply substitute ``Saddam
Hussein'' for ``Bill Clinton'' in the preceding sentence.)
</P>
<P>
   We don't learn anything. Nothing we can't learn from throwing
two dogs one bone, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the maddening thing for Olbermann was that, despite
the American public's well-documented distaste concerning the
Lewinsky affair, the story was a ratings booster for his show.
</P>
<P>
   So now he's back in sports, where the headlines change hourly.
It's honorable, I suppose, that unlike so many TV types who would
give up a knuckle for a Nielsen point, he can walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for us he felt like he had to. &QL;

MONITORS GET SKINNIER, AND A PHONE FOR YOUR TIE 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS, Nev. _ The Comdex trade show is the largest gathering
of computer buyers and sellers in North America. In an annual
ritual that dates back to the earliest days of the PC industry,
more than 200,000 people are gathered here in the desert to see the
latest technologies put on display by hundreds of companies.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, it seems as if everything at Comdex is shrinking,
except for the hotels, room rates and cab lines. Many of the bigger
names in the computer industry have pulled out of Comdex or reduced
their presence in an effort to save money and avoid being lost in
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The computer giants IBM, Compaq and Dell limited their presence
to private hotel suites or meeting rooms _ Apple has never been a
big player at Comdex _ as did the major chip makers Intel and AMD.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of the big PC names, the show seems a bit
thin, a bit flat, a bit smaller than in years past. And that's
perfectly appropriate, because the computers themselves are getting
smaller, cheaper, thinner and flatter.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, consumer electronics companies like Sony,
Panasonic, Philips and Toshiba have expanded into some of the space
the big computer companies vacated, bringing with them not only a
fresh collection of computers but also an invigorating infusion of
electronic toys including smart telephones, digital cameras, stereo
speakers and a diverse array of hand-held gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, many of the big computer companies that skipped
Comdex announced that they would resurface at the annual Consumer
Electronics Shows here in January, the better to show off their
low-cost computers and peripherals that they hope will impress the
home audience. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about the trends of the show itself. People come here
to see today's and tomorrow's hot products, and to try to predict
where the fast-paced computer industry is headed in the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   Several trends were apparent. The Internet is the driving force
for the industry today. Several companies, including Dell and
Compaq, will soon begin offering desktop PCs that are prepared at
the factory for high-speed (big bandwidth) connections to the net
through cable modems or a new type of phone connection called DSL,
for digital subscriber line.
</P>
<P>
   These new types of connections are many times faster than
dial-up modems or even ISDN, and, besides reducing the frustrations
of slow access to the Web, they create the opportunity for new (to
consumers, at least) applications like video conferencing.
</P>
<P>
   Mobility is going to be a major theme in the year to come,
ranging from smaller and lighter notebook computers to the creating
of all sorts of devices for retrieving information on the go,
including electronic mail and web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Portable computers are proliferating, in a wide range of sizes,
shapes, weights and prices. Some of them are being used as
replacements for desktop PCs, but most of the action here was in
the so-called companion PC categories.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Kaldor, an analyst at International Data Corp., noted that
he has in his kitchen an oven, a toaster oven, a microwave and a
toaster. All of them perform some specialized variation on the
general function of heating food.
</P>
<P>
   He sees it as logical, then, that some consumers might have a
desktop computer, a notebook, subnotebook or ultraportable
computer, and some sort of Palm Pilot-like hand-held computer.
</P>
<P>
   In the smaller category, several companies have been
demonstrating the new class of ``Jupiter'' notebook computers,
which are based on the latest version of the Windows CE operating
system, code-named Jupiter. They are useful only if one already has
a desktop computer to feed it files and applications.
</P>
<P>
   These machines typically cost less than $1,000 and weigh about 2
pounds. Of the ones I saw, I liked Hewlett-Packard's Jornada, NEC's
MobilePro 800 and Vadem's Clio.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Jupiters have a slightly smaller keyboard, about 90 percent
the size of a regular notebook keyboard, but they are still very
useable for word processing, browsing the Web, handling electronic
mail, and doing other basic tasks. Battery life is said to be more
than twice that of conventional notebooks (some claim to work 10
hours on a charge), and, unlike portables based on Windows 98, they
switch on and off instantly, eliminating the annoying wait for
Windows to boot.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do work in cramped spaces, like airline seats, and
who do not mind giving up some of the functionality of Windows 98,
the Jupiters are ideal.
</P>
<P>
   For those who decline to give up their true Windows
applications, but who still want a light notebook, there were
several options in a category now generally called ultraportable or
super-slim notebooks. Two that I saw and liked were the Sony Vaio
505FX, which is the latest version of the original super-slim
computer, and the Toshiba Portege 3010CT.
</P>
<P>
   The Portege 3010CT weighs just less than 3 pounds and is the
size of a stack of paper three-quarters of an inch thick. The
$1,999 computer, which will be in stores in December, comes with a
266-megahertz Pentium processor with MMX technology, 32 megabytes
of RAM, a 4.3-gigabyte hard disk, a 56K modem, an external diskette
drive and a 10.4-inch active matrix TFT screen.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba asserts it will run 4 hours on a battery charge. It has
a Universal Serial Bus port and two Type II PC card expansion
slots, which allows for the attachment of an optional, external
CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   The trend to thinness was also apparent in desktop computers.
Toshiba's Equium 100, which costs about $3,000 for a basic version,
consists of a thin Pentium II computer with an attached, 15-inch
flat panel display that pivots to either landscape (wide) or
portrait (tall) positions. The entire computer takes up less than
10 inches of desk space from front to back, basically half the
space of a conventional 17-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Flat-panel monitors are everywhere. If money were no object,
flat-panel displays would replace most conventional, cathode ray
tube monitors overnight. But since money is an object, especially
in this town, most people here could only gaze enviously at Nokia's
new 800Xi display, an 18-inch model that will go on sale next month
for about $3,400. It is a bright, crisp and sturdy analogue
display, comparable to a 20-inch conventional monitor, and it
offers a wider and therefore better viewing angle than other flat
panels I've seen.
</P>
<P>
   For fans of flatness, there are affordable alternatives. Several
companies were showing off flat computer speakers, which are less
than one inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite was a $129 set of Berwin flat-panel speakers from
Kwong Quest. The twin flat panels are approximately 5 inches wide
and 7 inches tall each, and about half an inch thick. A subwoofer
cube, about four inches square, completes the set.
</P>
<P>
   A conclusive recommendation will have to await the chance to
test these stylish beauties far away from the din of Comdex, where
the background noise is about 100 decibels, with gusts up to 150
decibels when nearby booths launch into their usual garish skits or
decide to demonstrate their new speakers and sound cards.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is here with a new cell phone so small and lightweight
(2.7 ounces) that it can be clipped to a scarf or necktie. Destined
to be the new status totem of the ``mine is smaller than yours''
crowd of cell phone users, the StarTac V3620 is about the size of
an inch-thick stack of business cards.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to cost $500 to $700 when it becomes available
early next year. The V3620 packs a lot of features into its
diminutive form, including a built-in digital answering machine (a
chip, actually) that stores either four minutes of messages or, in
a clever twist, up to four minutes of dictated notes, or some
combination of voice mail and dictation.
</P>
<P>
   One might use it, for example, to record the location of one's
rental car in the vast parking lots around this convention center.
</P>
<P>
   There were many more interesting products being demonstrated
here that will not be available to the public until later next
year. This column will discuss some of these prototypes next week.

BATTERY CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rechargeable batteries used in laptops, camcorders,
telephones and other portable electronic gadgets come in several
types. Here are the most common:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nickel cadmium, or nicad, batteries are the most common and
most durable. The basic technology dates back to developments made
in the electrical systems of America's first manned space flight
programs. The battery is quick to charge and works well in extreme
temperatures. It can take 700 to 750 charge and discharge cycles
before losing battery life.
</P>
<P>
   These batteries are, however, subject to ``memory effect,'' a
condition that severely shortens battery life if the battery is not
completely drained of power before recharging it. For example, if a
four-hour nickel cadmium battery is repeatedly recharged after only
one hour of use, it will eventually run for only an hour before it
needs to be recharged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nickel metal hydride, or NiM,H batteries can run 75 percent
longer for each charge than nickel cadmium batteries. They are less
likely to suffer the memory effect and pose less of an
environmental problem than nickel cadmium batteries. The life
expectancy of a NiMH battery may be from 500 to 1,000 charges and
discharge cycles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lithium ion, or Li-Ion, batteries are the newest on the
market. Depending on how they are used, they can run longer on a
charge than comparable-size nickel metal hydride batteries. They
are not prone to memory effect and will last for about 400 charges.
A Li-Ion battery can cost as much as four times what a nickel
cadmium battery would cost. It requires a special recharger.

TRUCK MAINTENANCE OFTEN GETS BACK SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies TRUCKS-SAFETY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After trucker Tom Angerer made the down
payment on his shiny new black 18-wheeler, he had $30 left in his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just like most of the other guys who get started in this
business as owner-operators,'' he said. ``I put all I had into the
truck, then went on the road to try to make some money so I could
feed my family and make the payments on the rig.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance, he said, had to take a back seat.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the problem with many 18-wheelers plying the
highways and byways of the United States, safety experts say. One
in three big rigs inspected on Texas highways is considered so
unsafe that it is ordered out of service until repairs are made.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the repairs can be as simple as spending five minutes
with a wrench to adjust the brakes. For others, it might mean
spending $3,600 or more to replace all 18 tires.
</P>
<P>
   Owner-operators often must make difficult choices when it comes
to keeping their vehicles in good shape, drivers said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Do I buy new tires this week and skip the mortgage payment on
my home, or do I try to make another run or two on these old tires
before spending more money on the truck?' That's the question a lot
of us have to ask ourselves,'' said Angerer, a Seal Beach, Calif.,
resident who regularly hauls commodities into the Fort Worth area.
</P>
<P>
   Many truckers have a difficult time making it financially,
Angerer said, although he said he has been driving long enough _ 25
years _ that those days are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive the newest and best vehicle on the road, and I keep it
up immaculately,'' he said. ``I've learned the secret: If you make
enough money, you can afford to play the game right.''
</P>
<P>
   One-truck operations often are lax in their maintenance,
primarily for economic reasons. But such problems also occur among
trucking companies with many vehicles, said Bill Webb, spokesman
for the Texas Motor Transportation Association, which represents
23,000 trucking companies _ including owner-operators _ doing
business in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people doing things well, but there always
will be those who try to cut corners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brakes are probably the biggest safety issue, Webb said. It's
not uncommon for an inspector to find that a significant number of
the brakes on a truck are out of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want those trucks off the road if they shouldn't be on the
road,'' Webb said. ``We believe in enforcement if it's fair and
consistent, and for the most part it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government sets inspection criteria for large trucks
and buses, and it certifies officers who do the inspections, said
Randy Moseley, a safety investigator for the Federal Highway
Administration's regional Office of Motor Carriers in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The most thorough roadside check, a Level 1 inspection, takes
two officers, Moseley said. The officers crawl over, under and
through the truck and the trailer, looking for bad brakes, bald
tires, loose lug nuts, cracks in the frame, improperly secured
loads and other infractions, said trooper Don Stewart, one of five
Hurst-based truck inspectors for the Texas Department of Public
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also take a look at the driver,'' he said. ``Is he
medically qualified? Is his logbook up-to-date? Has he been driving
longer than the maximum 10 (consecutive) hours allowed by law?''
</P>
<P>
   When troopers find violations serious enough to take a truck or
a driver off the road, the driver is usually cited and the truck
must be parked, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, three Hurst troopers conducted random
inspections of trucks on Farm Road 156 just north of Northeast Loop
820, ordering them into a Texas Department of Transportation
maintenance yard, away from traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The first one inspected, a flatbed semi-trailer truck hauling a
backhoe, was ordered off the road because of its weight: 92,000
pounds. The maximum allowed without a special permit is 80,000
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to leave it parked until he gets a permit,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver also was issued a citation, which carries a minimum
fine of $1,000, the trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Heller of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who drives for a large
company, said the inspectors are ``too strict on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many regulations that an inspector could go out
there and find something to write up on every truck here,'' he
said, referring to the dozens of trucks parked at a Weatherford
truck stop while he was refueling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even got written up once because my fire extinguisher wasn't
in working condition,'' he said. ``That might be important on a
gasoline truck, but I'm hauling groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller, who has been driving 14 years, said he has ``just about
had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't enjoy it anymore,'' he said. ``I'll just do it
until I make enough money to retire.''

GARLAND, Texas: problem is growing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1997, 486 people _ one of every 10 killed in Texas traffic
accidents that year _ died in collisions that involved large
trucks, the DPS reported. That was an increase of 36 from the 450
killed in accidents involving large trucks in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Why do other drivers share the road with so many unsafe trucks?
</P>
<P>
   Truckers complain that pressure from shippers to keep goods
moving, as well as the high cost of maintaining their vehicles,
sometimes forces them to delay repairs and drive unsafe vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the time, truckers are just barely making it,'' Leslie
Marion, a Memphis, Tenn., trucker, said recently while refueling
his rig at a popular Weatherford truck stop along Interstate 20.
``It takes time to keep one of these trucks fixed, and you really
need to go over it carefully after every trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even at big companies like the one I drive for, the
pressure is there to keep going, take another load, and don't stop
for anything. I've been driving for 30 years, and it gets harder
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas has fewer truck inspectors than the federal
government would like, the state is in compliance with the
regulations covering oversight of commercial vehicles, said Dave
Martin, regional director of the Federal Highway Administration's
Office of Motor Carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas leads the nation in truck-related traffic
fatalities, the state is part of the federal agency's Big 10
project, a concentrated effort to reduce truck fatalities by 20
percent during the next 10 years in the 10 states with the highest
number, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the list, in order according to the number of 1997
fatalities, are California, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given all of those states some additional grant money
so they can try to reduce fatalities, and we have encouraged them
to work more in the high-traffic corridors through the Dallas-Fort
Worth and Houston areas,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tarrant, Denton and Cooke counties _ the entire area from
the south Tarrant County line to the Oklahoma border _ the DPS has
assigned five motor carrier officers.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that territory is a 120-mile stretch of Interstate
35/35W, the nation's busiest north-south trucking route, and
shorter sections of Interstates 20 and 30, two of the nation's
busiest east-west truck routes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Stewart and his four co-workers, the truck inspection
troopers assigned to the area from the Hurst DPS office, say they
sometimes believe that they aren't making a difference in weeding
out unsafe vehicles and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, Stewart and his partner can inspect about 10
trucks, he said. Statewide, about 350 trucks are inspected daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of trucks out there that we just can't get
to,'' he said. ``While we're inspecting one, dozens more with the
same problems are driving by. They're everywhere, and they carry
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's saving us is that the vast majority of trucks and
drivers are safe and conscientious,'' Stewart said. ``We're out
looking for the ones that aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The DPS plans to ask the Legislature next year for money to hire
57 more troopers to police the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Fines for safety violations can be $1,000 or more per
infraction, but most of that money goes into the state's general
fund, not toward the program that is supposed to keep dangerous
trucks off the road, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the DPS must make do with the officers it has,
Burroughs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're No. 1 in fatal accidents, and we always want to see that
situation get better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be comfortable until we put ourselves out of
business, but that is an unrealistic goal.''
</P>
<P>
   _

LACK OF TRUCK INSPECTION OFFICERS KEEPS TEXAS ON DANGEROUS COURSE

<P>
   GARLAND, Texas _ The 18-wheeler just wouldn't stop, despite the
red lights flashing and siren blasting on the highway patrol car
riding close behind it.
</P>
<P>
   The truck continued for a mile or two, gradually slowing.
Finally, when it was down to a crawl, the driver jumped out and
threw a log in front of the rear wheels, stopping the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No brakes,'' the driver said sheepishly, shrugging as the two
troopers approached. He was driving a fully loaded pulpwood hauler
_ 40 tons of truck and cargo.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was outrageous, said Capt. Larry Marshall,
commander of the Texas Department of Public Safety's regional Motor
Carrier Bureau in Garland.
</P>
<P>
   But the most unusual aspect, he said, is that the truck with the
faulty brakes was pulled over at all.
</P>
<P>
   Texas leads the nation in fatalities involving large trucks, yet
almost all big trucks get a free pass through the state.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is so short on officers assigned to inspect commercial
trucks that fewer than one of every thousand on the road each day
face inspection, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Of trucks that are pulled over for inspection, one in three has
safety defects so serious _ such as bad brakes, bald tires or
unsecured loads _ that the vehicle is immediately ordered out of
service until repairs are made, said Maj. Lester Mills, director of
the state Department of Public Safety division responsible for
truck safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're hitting the bad characters, but when you pull
over a truck and inspect it, 50 or 60 more drive by that don't get
looked at,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to safety defects found during inspections, one in
six drivers is not allowed to continue because he or she is not
qualified, said Capt. Bob Burroughs at the DPS Motor Carrier Bureau
headquarters in Austin. The most common reason a driver is
disqualified is for driving more than the 10 consecutive hours
allowed by federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The state has 371 DPS officers assigned to truck safety
inspections, but they are responsible for more than 1 million
commercial trucks and 32,000 trucking companies, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only other state our size _ California _ has at least
three times as many officers inspecting trucks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is purely financial, said David Willis, president of
AAA's Foundation for Traffic Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has given a higher priority to the problem than
Texas has, and it spends a lot more money on truck inspections,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   California receives the same amount of federal funds for truck
inspections that Texas does _ $3.955 million this year, said Dick
Henderson, director of governmental affairs for the Commercial
Vehicle Safety Alliance in Washington, a coalition of truck safety
enforcement agencies in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is that Texas doesn't add state funds to
that,'' he said. ``California contributes another $6 million to $8
million a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the problem in Texas is the huge increase in truck
traffic since Congress approved the North American Free Trade
Agreement. The flow of trucks along the state's major north-south
highways _ including Interstate 35W through Tarrant County _ has
tripled, state officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that new trade from Mexico has to come through the big
metropolitan areas of Texas _ San Antonio, Austin, Dallas-Fort
Worth and Houston,'' Burroughs said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the state's urban areas, which have the most trucks, also
have the fewest inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not where we need to be, especially in the inner-city
areas where people are not looking at trucks much. Some of those
might never be inspected because we concentrate on rural highways,
not cities,'' Burroughs said.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are short-handed, DPS officials say, they leave
urban vehicle inspections to city police departments. But in the
Metroplex, only Arlington, Dallas, Garland, Irving and Plano have
police officers certified to inspect trucks. In Arlington, two
officers are assigned to truck inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a big gap in our coverage,'' Mills said, ``and all we
can do is try to have some enforcement presence out there and hope
that, for the most part, truckers will voluntarily comply with the
safety standards.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   An overweight rock hauler with faulty brakes, whose driver ran a
red light, was blamed in a December 1994 Southlake accident that
killed a pregnant woman and seriously injured her 3-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas woman lost her husband and her father-in-law in 1993
when a novice truck driver who had been on the road for 22 hours
ran over the men's car with his tractor-trailer in Mesquite. Police
said he misapplied the brake, causing the truck to jackknife.
</P>
<P>
   Safety defects are the most common cause of fatal accidents
involving commercial trucks, highway safety experts say. And the
problem is growing.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 486 people _ one of every 10 killed in Texas traffic
accidents that year _ died in collisions that involved large
trucks, the DPS reported. That was an increase of 36 from the 450
killed in accidents involving large trucks in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Why do other drivers share the road with so many unsafe trucks?
</P>
<P>
   Truckers complain that pressure from shippers to keep goods
moving, as well as the high cost of maintaining their vehicles,
sometimes forces them to delay repairs and drive unsafe vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half the time, truckers are just barely making it,'' Leslie
Marion, a Memphis, Tenn., trucker, said recently while refueling
his rig at a popular Weatherford truck stop along Interstate 20.
``It takes time to keep one of these trucks fixed, and you really
need to go over it carefully after every trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``But even at big companies like the one I drive for, the
pressure is there to keep going, take another load, and don't stop
for anything. I've been driving for 30 years, and it gets harder
every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Texas has fewer truck inspectors than the federal
government would like, the state is in compliance with the
regulations covering oversight of commercial vehicles, said Dave
Martin, regional director of the Federal Highway Administration's
Office of Motor Carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Because Texas leads the nation in truck-related traffic
fatalities, the state is part of the federal agency's Big 10
project, a concentrated effort to reduce truck fatalities by 20
percent during the next 10 years in the 10 states with the highest
number, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the list, in order according to the number of 1997
fatalities, are California, Florida, Georgia, Ohio, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Illinois, New York and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given all of those states some additional grant money
so they can try to reduce fatalities, and we have encouraged them
to work more in the high-traffic corridors through the Dallas-Fort
Worth and Houston areas,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Tarrant, Denton and Cooke counties _ the entire area from
the south Tarrant County line to the Oklahoma border _ the DPS has
assigned five motor carrier officers.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that territory is a 120-mile stretch of Interstate
35/35W, the nation's busiest north-south trucking route, and
shorter sections of Interstates 20 and 30, two of the nation's
busiest east-west truck routes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Don Stewart and his four co-workers, the truck inspection
troopers assigned to the area from the Hurst DPS office, say they
sometimes believe that they aren't making a difference in weeding
out unsafe vehicles and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, Stewart and his partner can inspect about 10
trucks, he said. Statewide, about 350 trucks are inspected daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of trucks out there that we just can't get
to,'' he said. ``While we're inspecting one, dozens more with the
same problems are driving by. They're everywhere, and they carry
everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's saving us is that the vast majority of trucks and
drivers are safe and conscientious,'' Stewart said. ``We're out
looking for the ones that aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   The DPS plans to ask the Legislature next year for money to hire
57 more troopers to police the trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Fines for safety violations can be $1,000 or more per
infraction, but most of that money goes into the state's general
fund, not toward the program that is supposed to keep dangerous
trucks off the road, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the DPS must make do with the officers it has,
Burroughs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're No. 1 in fatal accidents, and we always want to see that
situation get better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't be comfortable until we put ourselves out of
business, but that is an unrealistic goal.''

UNITED INSTALLS PASSENGER-FRIENDLY EQUIPMENT AT DOMESTIC AIRPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (fb)  
 By JANE L. LEVERE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Airlines is installing new customer-friendly equipment at
a number of U.S. airports as part of a $200 million, three-year
program to improve airport processes and make travel easier for its
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco International Airport, the carrier is currently
testing a small, mobile check-in podium that it deploys when there
are long lines at check-in counters, flights are canceled or other
bottlenecks with passengers occur. Custom-made for United, the
equipment is battery-powered and has access to the carrier's data
base by radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, a subsidiary of the UAL Corp., is now trying out
four of these units in San Francisco, and will introduce others in
the first quarter of next year at Los Angeles International
Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport and La Guardia
Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime late this year or early in 1999, United will put up
large video screens in gate areas that will flash information on
flight delays and cancellations, and alternative plans travelers
may make. For example, Greg Couper, United's director of customer
services planning, said that if a United flight were canceled, the
screen could list other flights offered by AMR's American Airlines,
Delta Air Lines or Continental Airlines where passengers could be
accommodated. These screens will be installed first at O'Hare, then
at other airports that have not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, since the beginning of November, United has installed
metal templates on X-ray machines at O'Hare and Los Angeles that
measure whether a piece of luggage is small enough to be carried
on, rather than checked. If the luggage is too large, customer
service agents posted at the machines will take it from the
traveler and check it.
</P>
<P>
   Couper said United would install templates on X-ray machines at
as many as 50 additional domestic airports within the next several
months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Torture Test
</P>
<P>
   The December issue of PC Computing magazine contains the
publication's first ``hand-held PC torture test,'' with editors
rating 13 machines for performance, battery life, usability, and
survival through baking, freezing, dropping and dousing with
coffee, cream and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine gave 3Com's Palm III Connected Organizer, with an
estimated price of $369, its highest rating of five stars, praising
its design, usability, battery life and price. This machine's
disadvantages, the magazine said, are a screen that can be
difficult to read and awkward data entry from the touch screen.
</P>
<P>
   Four-star ratings went to Casio's Cassiopeia E-10 palm-size PC;
Compaq Computer's C-Series 2010C; Hewlett-Packard's HP660LX Palmtop
PC; IBM's Workpad PC Companion; Philips Electronics' Nino 300, and
Psion's Series 5.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also discusses the next generation of hand-held
equipment, including Qualcomm's new pdQ Smartphone, an all-in-one
digital phone and pen-based organizer that will offer paging,
E-mail and World Wide Web browsing; a shirt-pocket size device from
Symbian that will let users browse the Web and read E-mail and
files, and a machine from Bluetooth that will allow wireless
communication via radio frequency. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Update
</P>
<P>
   Radisson Hotels Worldwide, a unit of the Carlson Companies, is
giving travelers who book a reservation on the company's Web site
(www.radisson.com) 2,000 miles in American Airlines' frequent-flier
program. Reservations must be made by Feb. 28, 1999, and travel
completed by March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Hilton Hotels Corp. is installing 24-hour automated business
centers, operated by Business Anywhere USA, at up to 100 of its
U.S. hotels by mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ritz-Carlton Chicago has a ``compcierge'' to help guests with
computer-related problems on weekdays from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.,
including providing surge protectors, universal power converters,
power plugs and outlets, and other devices.

TRUCK MAINTENANCE OFTEN GETS BACK SEAT
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies TRUCKS-SAFETY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After trucker Tom Angerer made the down
payment on his shiny new black 18-wheeler, he had $30 left in his
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just like most of the other guys who get started in this
business as owner-operators,'' he said. ``I put all I had into the
truck, then went on the road to try to make some money so I could
feed my family and make the payments on the rig.''
</P>
<P>
   Maintenance, he said, had to take a back seat.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the problem with many 18-wheelers plying the
highways and byways of the United States, safety experts say. One
in three big rigs inspected on Texas highways is considered so
unsafe that it is ordered out of service until repairs are made.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the repairs can be as simple as spending five minutes
with a wrench to adjust the brakes. For others, it might mean
spending $3,600 or more to replace all 18 tires.
</P>
<P>
   Owner-operators often must make difficult choices when it comes
to keeping their vehicles in good shape, drivers said.
</P>
<P>
   ```Do I buy new tires this week and skip the mortgage payment on
my home, or do I try to make another run or two on these old tires
before spending more money on the truck?' That's the question a lot
of us have to ask ourselves,'' said Angerer, a Seal Beach, Calif.,
resident who regularly hauls commodities into the Fort Worth area.
</P>
<P>
   Many truckers have a difficult time making it financially,
Angerer said, although he said he has been driving long enough _ 25
years _ that those days are behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive the newest and best vehicle on the road, and I keep it
up immaculately,'' he said. ``I've learned the secret: If you make
enough money, you can afford to play the game right.''
</P>
<P>
   One-truck operations often are lax in their maintenance,
primarily for economic reasons. But such problems also occur among
trucking companies with many vehicles, said Bill Webb, spokesman
for the Texas Motor Transportation Association, which represents
23,000 trucking companies _ including owner-operators _ doing
business in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people doing things well, but there always
will be those who try to cut corners,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brakes are probably the biggest safety issue, Webb said. It's
not uncommon for an inspector to find that a significant number of
the brakes on a truck are out of adjustment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want those trucks off the road if they shouldn't be on the
road,'' Webb said. ``We believe in enforcement if it's fair and
consistent, and for the most part it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government sets inspection criteria for large trucks
and buses, and it certifies officers who do the inspections, said
Randy Moseley, a safety investigator for the Federal Highway
Administration's regional Office of Motor Carriers in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The most thorough roadside check, a Level 1 inspection, takes
two officers, Moseley said. The officers crawl over, under and
through the truck and the trailer, looking for bad brakes, bald
tires, loose lug nuts, cracks in the frame, improperly secured
loads and other infractions, said trooper Don Stewart, one of five
Hurst-based truck inspectors for the Texas Department of Public
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also take a look at the driver,'' he said. ``Is he
medically qualified? Is his logbook up-to-date? Has he been driving
longer than the maximum 10 (consecutive) hours allowed by law?''
</P>
<P>
   When troopers find violations serious enough to take a truck or
a driver off the road, the driver is usually cited and the truck
must be parked, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   One recent day, three Hurst troopers conducted random
inspections of trucks on Farm Road 156 just north of Northeast Loop
820, ordering them into a Texas Department of Transportation
maintenance yard, away from traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The first one inspected, a flatbed semi-trailer truck hauling a
backhoe, was ordered off the road because of its weight: 92,000
pounds. The maximum allowed without a special permit is 80,000
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to leave it parked until he gets a permit,''
Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver also was issued a citation, which carries a minimum
fine of $1,000, the trooper said.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Heller of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who drives for a large
company, said the inspectors are ``too strict on us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many regulations that an inspector could go out
there and find something to write up on every truck here,'' he
said, referring to the dozens of trucks parked at a Weatherford
truck stop while he was refueling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even got written up once because my fire extinguisher wasn't
in working condition,'' he said. ``That might be important on a
gasoline truck, but I'm hauling groceries.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller, who has been driving 14 years, said he has ``just about
had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't enjoy it anymore,'' he said. ``I'll just do it
until I make enough money to retire.''

JUST CALL WARREN JONES THE PIANO MAN
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of folks camm him the world's greatest accompanist.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not a title that Warren Jones, 46, accepts _ at least
not without an argument.
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``accompanist'' part he objects to.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so he plays the piano while the reigning superstars of the
voice world _ Marilyn Horne, Kiri Te Kanawa, Carol Vaness, Hakan
Hagegard _ stand in front of the piano and sing.
</P>
<P>
   But don't call him an accompanist _ or a ``collaborator.''
</P>
<P>
   So what does one call a pianist who does what he does?
</P>
<P>
   ``How about `pianist'?'' Jones says. ``A violinist who plays in
an orchestra is still a violinist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to be perplexed at the mania to categorize pianists
_ as nightclub pianists, or chamber music pianists, or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth music fans first got to know Jones when he appeared
with bassist Samuel Ramey in the first performance on the Cliburn
Foundation vocal recital series at Ed Landreth Auditorium in
February 1992. The pair returned in the Cliburn series to the
Meyerson Symphony Center in Dallas in January 1995, when Jones
stunned the audience by performing the entire recital, including
the encores, from memory. Any doubts that he is a singer's greatest
partner _ or whatever you call it _ were erased at that point. He
doesn't always play from memory, and that in itself is not a sign
of musical greatness anyway. But in Jones' case, it reflects the
extraordinary knowledge and involvement he brings to a performance.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' background is somewhat unusual for someone so deeply
involved in classical music. The son of a filling station owner in
the small town of High Point, N.C. (there's still a definite
Carolina inflection in his speech), Jones had begun studying the
piano at age 5 with a teacher in Thomasville, N.C. Early on, he
displayed extraordinary talent, including perfect pitch and easy,
flawless memory.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones didn't see a live opera until he was 16. Touring in
Europe that year as pianist for a choir of teen-agers, he stumbled
into a performance of ``Lucia'' in Florence, Italy. He was
astounded by the whole spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager, Jones worked at the family gas station before
moving away to attend the New England Conservatory, already with a
strong inkling that he would never be a soloist. He was good enough
to perform a Mozart concerto with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston
Pops, but he says, ``I knew I didn't have the peculiar personality
for the solitude that a soloist experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   After several years as assistant conductor of the San Francisco
Opera and then of the Metropolitan Opera, Jones began performing as
a pianist with singers. Eventually, that became his main job.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Jones tours regularly with several renowned singers,
but only those he respects and who regard him as an equal partner.
He teaches piano at the Manhattan School of Music and appears
annually with a favorite chamber music group in San Antonio. He
served on the jury of the Van Cliburn Piano Competition in Fort
Worth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to be the best of his kind _ whatever it's called _ has
also involved learning some nonmusical lessons, Jones admits,
particularly when it comes to working with some of the most
finicky, notoriously temperamental performers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always had an overwhelming desire to be right,'' he
says. ``But I have learned that I am not always right. I have
trained myself to say, `Let's try that.' And, when I'm flexible, my
partner is flexible, too.'' .MDBR/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

REAL QUEASINESS IN VIRTUAL REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Jannick P. Rolland was participating in a test of the
physical side effects of head-mounted video devices intended for
surgeons. The experiment went fine, and she could see and function
in the augmented reality the gadget presented. Test done, she
picked up a can of soda and brought it to her lips. Well, actually
to her forehead _ she tipped the can back and nearly poured soda
down her face.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rolland, then a researcher at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill, had just proved that technology is
unpredictable. As the makers and users of technology like virtual
reality systems and pulsating graphics on Web pages are
discovering, interactive cyberenvironments can make you try to
drink with your forehead or throw up or, in rare instances, cause
more serious trouble, like epileptic seizures.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last December, several hundred people in Japan,
most of them children, were happily watching their favorite cartoon
on television one minute and hospitalized with seizures the next.
One sequence of the show, called ``Pocket Monsters,'' which is a
cartoon based on a Nintendo game, showed alternating flashes of
blue and red light that induced nausea and dizziness in thousands
and seizures in others predisposed to so-called photosensitive
epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year's incident, several Japanese television stations
have adopted strict standards for television programs. When the
show, then called ``Pokeman,'' made its debut in the United States
last September, the harmful episode was discarded and all others
scrutinized. ``Before it aired in the U.S., every series, every
episode was reviewed frame by frame,'' said Alfred Kahn, chief
executive of 4 Kids Entertainment in New York, the U.S. distributor
of the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident underscored the problem: Technology can make
you sick. The kinds of problems it can cause, however, predate
modern technology. It has long been known that certain lighting
effects can trigger seizures in people with photosensitive
epilepsy. The first documented case occurred in 125 A.D., when a
Roman, Apuleius, noted that a person had an epileptic seizure when
a potter's wheel was rotated in front of his eyes. The flickering
light produced by the rotation triggered the seizure.
</P>
<P>
   How interactive technology makes people ill and what can be done
about it are problems that makers of games, for instance, have to
confront.
</P>
<P>
   Video game manufacturers are well aware of the problems that
interactive technology can cause: joystick thumb, eyestrain,
migraines and other kinds of headaches, fatigue, motion sickness
and seizures. For the past several years, game manufacturers like
Nintendo, Sega and Sony have included warnings with their
documentation to alert users to the dangers that lurk behind the
fun. Web sites with flashing lights and strobe effects might cause
similar problems, but none have been documented.
</P>
<P>
   The head of an industry association for video and computer
games, Douglas Lowenstein, said seizures were rare. Lowenstein,
president of the Interactive Digital Software Association in
Washington, said, ``There have been at most only about 50
documented cases of video-game-induced seizures in history.''
</P>
<P>
   There is concern beyond the video game industry. Perhaps because
of the incident in Japan, officials at the Epilepsy Foundation, in
Landover, Md., report a heightened awareness among companies and
consumers alike. ``We've gotten calls from advertising companies
saying they want to use an effect in an ad, asking for some
guidance,'' said Peter Van Haverbeke, a spokesman for the epilepsy
group.
</P>
<P>
   Van Haverbeke said he had also received calls from people
concerned about the flashing visual displays that now adorn many
Web pages. ``As people go online more and more to purchase from
online catalogs, one could imagine that the technology to attract
attention would be put to greater use,'' Van Haverbeke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that people with epilepsy understand their
risks, which are minimal,'' said Dr. Eli M. Mizrahi, a professor of
neurology and pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston
and chairman of the Epilepsy Foundation's advisory board. He said
only those people with photosensitive epilepsy, which accounts for
about 2 percent of epilepsy patients, were at risk and that such
people should beware of rapidly flashing and intense light. ``It's
also important that people with epilepsy not be afraid of
technology,'' he said

   A far more common malady, experienced most often in the
simulated environments of virtual reality, is motion sickness. It
is caused by what virtual reality experts call scene delay _ a
discrepancy between visual cues and the movement perceived by the
inner ear. ``Scene delay is one of our really big problems because
of the enormous amount of computation that the computer has to make
each time the subjects move their heads,'' said Donald E. Parker, a
researcher at the University of Washington's Human Interface
Technology Laboratory in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the queasiest stomachs are produced by large-format
films, like those in Imax theaters, where the screens are often 70
feet wide and 100 feet high. Such movies, which often focus on
high-altitude, high-risk undertakings, specialize in giving the
audience the illusion of participation. ``People joke that the
movies are only 40 minutes long because no one can take it for
longer than that,'' said Judith Rubin, a publicist with the Large
Format Cinema Association, an industry group based in Stockton,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``These movies have the ability to make you nauseated in a way
that real life would make you nauseated,'' said Byron B. Reeves, a
communication professor at Stanford University who studies
physiological and psychological effects of interactive media and
television. ``Visual cues and peripheral vision are disturbed
enough to upset one's sense of balance, inducing nausea, much as a
bobbing sailboat would.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous stomach-jolting film was ``Energy!
Energy!'' which was shown at the 1982 World's Fair in Knoxville,
Tenn. The film included an aerial shot above the Manhattan Bridge
that induced vertigo in most of the audience. ``People were
literally throwing up in the theater,'' said Bayley Silleck, a
filmmaker in New York who was one of the film's directors.
</P>
<P>
   Such a large-scale outbreak of inner ear imbalance caused by a
movie has not recurred, partly, experts say, because audiences have
become more accustomed to viewing such films. Still, milder
queasiness is common. For example, a large-format film about Mount
Everest released last spring in Imax theaters contains a dramatic
rock-climbing vignette that had many of those in the audience
averting their eyes to save their stomachs. ``You're seeing what
the climber is seeing as you look down and that has made people
kind of gasp,''' said Lori Rick, director of marketing for
MacGillivray Freeman Films, which produced the distributed the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Still worse are the virtual reality experiences that resemble
amusement rides and are called motion simulation films. Two popular
ones are the Star Tours ride at Walt Disney World and Back to the
Future: The Ride. In these rides, sight is tightly coupled with
motion as viewers' seats lurch and roll with the action on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside the industry,'' Ms. Rubin said, ``lots of people tell
you out of the side of their mouth that they hate getting into
those simulators.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there are symptoms like those experienced by Dr. Rolland,
who is now an assistant professor in the School of Optics at the
University of Central Florida in Orlando. She nearly dumped a soda
on her face after she used a video see-through display mounted on
her head because her hand-eye coordination went out of synch.
</P>
<P>
   The augmented reality system allowed surgeons to see a
three-dimensional X-ray view of bones, organs and tissue that
appeared to be superimposed on the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Testing showed the need for careful scrutiny of potential side
effects. ``It showed us that the body had adapted to the point
where it's miscalibrated to the real world,'' Dr. Rolland said. Her
findings led to a new approach toward designing such systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you connect more of the body to the computer, the chances
for physiological reactions increase,'' said Frank Biocca, director
of the Media Interface and Network Design Laboratory at Michigan
State University in East Lansing, who collaborated with Dr. Rolland
on the University of North Carolina experiment.
</P>
<P>
   In the extreme, someone leaving a virtual environment can fall
or even experience an inversion of the visual field. Biocca said a
test pilot who had been in a flight simulator was driving his car
when he suddenly saw the world upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If exposure is sufficiently long, people adapt, then you get
post-exposure effects due to the adaptation itself,'' said Parker,
of the University of Washington. ``It's very comparable to being on
an oceangoing vessel and coming back and having the wobbles. It's
been observed since the Romans were shipping people around and
trying to keep their legions well enough to fight when they got off
the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Biocca, who devotes much of his work to spotting negative
physiological and psychological reactions to interactive media,
like computer games and simulations, said more research on their
effects was needed. Biocca pointed out that there was a wide range
of issues that arise from using interactive devices. ``With more
information, we can be more precise about where exactly the
problems are, if there are any,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, of Stanford, said he was more concerned about less
visible symptoms. ``What constitutes a physical effect?'' he said.
``We generally think of throwing up or having your eyesight
impaired. But there are numerous, more subtle changes. Your heart
rate can change; electrical activity in your brain can change.''
</P>
<P>
   As high-definition television sets begin to show up, researchers
are beginning to pay attention to their possible physical effects.
Reeves said he was interested in looking into the possible effects
of viewing a very large picture, which is commonplace in the new
format, in the average-size living room. ``Big really makes a
difference,'' he said. ``Rocket ships are bigger, monsters are
bigger. It just fills a room more.''
</P>
<P>
   Biocca said most people born since the early 1950s would spend
as much as seven years of their lives watching television. For
children born today, ``as new interactive media replace the
telephone, the television set and other amusements, if you combine
all those media, you may get a situation where people are inside
these environments for as long as 15 to 20 years of their lives,
over a 70-year life span,'' he said. ``There has to be some
consideration of the long-term psychophysiological effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The only way to understand the long-term effects of such
technologies will be over time. ``There are no potential animal
models for studying the human effects of media like TV and virtual
reality,'' Biocca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals can be used to test some lower-level perceptual
phenomena,'' he continued, ``but can't be used to test more subtle
social and psychological effects.'' For that, the only study
subjects are humans.

 &HT;    BIDEN WARNS LAWMAKERS TO HEED PUBLIC'S VIEWS ABOUT CLINTON
 &HT;    370 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers who want to remove President Clinton from
office must ``bend over backwards'' to show the American people the
impeachment proceedings are fair, Sen. Joseph Biden said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member and former chair of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Biden, D-Del., said though lawmakers are elected to
exercise their own judgment and not shift with the political winds,
they still should take seriously the views of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're trying to decide whether an offense is a breach of
the public trust, it is important to know what the public thinks,''
he said at a National Press Club luncheon. ``If the American people
don't think they have made a mistake in electing Bill Clinton, we
in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden said the best way to ensure the inquiry is conducted
properly is for lawmakers to proceed in a manner that is fair and
consistent with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Democrats and Republicans to disregard their party
affiliation, and he warned them not to base their decision on
whether they agree with Clinton's political or personal views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should they fail to do this, the risk they face is the chance
that they will inflict more damage on our system of government and
induce more cynicism and disgust with politics than anything
President Clinton has done thus far,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's comments come amid continued bickering in Congress
as independent counsel Kenneth Starr prepares to present
allegations against the president at impeachment proceedings
Thursday. While Democrats are complaining about plans to call
additional witnesses, Republicans are warning them not to launch an
attack against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who want to vote against impeachment should not think
it is an approval of the president's actions, Biden said. Other
alternatives to impeachment exist, including criminal charges once
the president has left office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to impeach, even failure to proceed with criminal
action, does not mean the president has not paid for his immoral
behavior,'' Biden said. ``He has already been sentenced to a
hundred years of shame in the history books, which is not an
insignificant penalty.''

CIRCLING THE (STATION) WAGONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jan and Dean sang its praises, and it was once the chosen method
of transportation for summer vacations, tailgate parties and
surfing pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that was back when when surfing meant waves, not Web
sites. The American station wagon, the family-packed Sherman tank
of the interstate highway, isn't seen much on the road these days,
thanks to the proliferation of minivans and the almost
dainty-sounding sport utility vehicles. But these classic machines
of yesteryear can still be found cruising the infobahn if you're
looking for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Online Home of the Station Wagon (www.stationwagon.com) has
scads of material for serious wagon wonks, with such regularly
updated sections as Station Wagons in the News, which tracks press
sightings on the subject, and a hefty collection of Web links to
pages celebrating wagons of all kinds. The site contains a Facts
and Trivia page, a Frequently Asked Questions area and a section
where interested parties can buy and sell station wagons.
</P>
<P>
   One of the subsets of the station-wagon faithful is the
wooden-body crowd, who revel in the glory days before auto makers
built cars with all-steel bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The 1953 Buick Roadmaster is often cited as the last of the
``woodies.'' The National Woodie Club, at
www.classicar.com/clubs/woodie/woodhome.htm, offers a site to
discuss the distinctive cars, dispense tips, recruit new members
and announce events. There's even a poetry page on the site
featuring a heartfelt composition called ``My Old Dodge Woodie.''
</P>
<P>
   Referred to as ``cargo ships'' by the Webmaster of the Land
Yacht Marina site, (members.aol.com/landyacht9/cargo.html) station
wagons also have their own section in the Marina. The page displays
many lovingly photographed wagons from many different years and
makers and serves up plenty of links, lore and facts.
</P>
<P>
   The main Land Yacht Marina site
(www.voicenet.com/perches/landycht.html), as one might guess from
the name, is an electronic monument to the glory days of large
cars, some of which seemed bigger than many New York City
apartments. Those fuel-hungry eight-cylinder behemoths that once
threatened to shove the pocket-size Pintos and Pacers off the
asphalt are back in style here. Billing itself as ``a friendly port
of call for all devotees of the great American land yacht, the
long, cushy and powerful road cruisers of the '50s, '60s and
'70s,'' the Land Yacht Marina rounds up a generous helping of
big-car bytes with an engaging sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Another motoring monolith that has inspired a great number of
Web odes is the Volkswagen microbus. Thom's Vintage VW Bus Site
focuses only on models that were made from 1949 to 1967
(www.vintagebus.com).
</P>
<P>
   Comprehensive in its scope, the Vintage Bus site has more than
15 different sections, including a FAQ, galleries devoted to
photographs and art, wiring diagrams and technical specifications.
It even has a Hall of Shame with pictures of rusted and abandoned
microbuses.
</P>
<P>
   As the real things are a rare sight these days, Vintage Bus just
might be the best way to remember the noble Volkswagen van. It
definitely beats being stuck behind one for 10 miles of two-lane
highway.

   You're on a cross-country flight and your tray table is a nest
of spreadsheets and scribbled notes, raw material for a
due-yesterday report that you are banging out on your laptop
computer. Then, somewhere over Ohio, the computer's batteries give
out.
</P>
<P>
   Or you're attending your child's school musical and when Junior
finally takes center stage, the camcorder sputters, flashes a ``low
batteries'' message, then goes dark.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the time your car gets a flat tire on some remote
stretch of highway and you reach into the glove compartment for
your cellular telephone. There is no dial tone. The phone's
batteries are as flat as your punctured radial.
</P>
<P>
   Batteries _ cells, packs and button-size disks that people can't
live without _ are dying like flies. Or so it seems when you need
them. And people in the electronics industry agree that batteries
are a weak point in portable technology. A common consumer
complaint is that they don't last long enough, or they don't last
as long as battery manufacturers suggest they should.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like driving a car and never really knowing when you are
going to run out of gas,'' said Christopher Policano of New York,
whose work in public relations requires him to carry a pager, a
cellular phone and a personal digital assistant to keep track of
appointments and contacts. ``I always have a beeper on and it is
interesting to me that I can buy the same kinds of batteries and
one set will last a couple of weeks and another set will get me a
low cell signal on my beeper after just two days. I don't
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Batteries, which have been around since the era of steam
engines, are practically everywhere, in the low- and high-tech
devices we carry on us, from pocket radios to palmtop computers.
They are also in devices we carry inside us, like cardiac
pacemakers and ultratiny hearing aids, and in devices we hardly
notice, like smoke detectors and keyless hotel door locks, and in
devices we hardly ever see, like interplanetary probes hurtling
through deep space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you imagine Christmas morning with all the types of toys
and devices and having all of them plugged into the wall?'' said
Paul Cheeseman, vice president of technology for Rayovac, a battery
maker based in Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 to 15 years there have been significant
advancements in some batteries, especially alkalines, the most
popular type, and newer types of rechargeable ones, including some
alkalines. But in an industry that has $4.3 billion in annual sales
in the United States alone, those improvements have lagged far
behind the blazingly fast evolution of the electronic components
that drive the most popular high-tech devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battery is not keeping up,'' said Ken Hawk, founder and
chief executive of 1-800-Batteries, a mail-order and online battery
retailer in Reno, Nev. He said manufacturers are increasingly
introducing products like DVD players and Pentium II-powered
laptops that are making higher and higher energy demands on
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the disparity, say battery makers and retailers,
is that batteries are the products of chemistry while
microprocessors, on the other hand, are the offspring of physics.
And while the microprocessor industry has steadily found ways to
greatly shrink the size of chips and boost their performance
(Moore's Law states that chip power doubles every 18 months),
battery manufacturers have been hard pressed, after more than two
centuries of working at it, to improve at anywhere near that rate
the battery's electrochemical process that produces electricity.
</P>
<P>
   While batteries will improve, and there are always new
developments on the horizon, no eight-day, one-ounce laptop battery
is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Batteries are a lot more complicated than they seem,'' said
Hawk, who ought to know. His company sells 7,000 kinds.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, all modern batteries, whether primary (the
disposable kind ) or secondary (the rechargeable kind), generate
electricity by use of an electrochemical reaction. This is
accomplished by inserting two electrodes _ one positive (a cathode)
and one negative (an anode) _ into a material called an
electrolyte, which helps the flow of energy between the electrodes.
The electrolyte can be a liquid, as in many rechargeable batteries,
or a solid, in the case of ``dry cells.''
</P>
<P>
   When a battery runs down, the anode and the cathode, which go
through electrochemical changes as the battery produces
electricity, reach a state in which they can longer pass electrons
between them. The voltage drops. The battery dies.
</P>
<P>
   But that explanation is deceptively simple. For example, the
common AA alkaline battery, the kind that would commonly power a
portable cassette player, contains more than two dozen components
and materials, requires 40 manufacturing steps to assemble and
involves more than 15 different chemical and electrochemical
reactions to produce one spark of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   And rechargeable batteries that typically power high-drain,
high-tech devices like mini disk players and hand-held televisions
are even more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The first practical battery is believed to have been developed
in the 1790s and first documented in 1800 in a letter to the Royal
Society in London. A chain of advances in battery technology in the
19th century yielded zinc-carbon batteries. These batteries, cheap
and low-powered, are still in limited use (and likely to come in
devices in which batteries are included).
</P>
<P>
   Zinc-carbon batteries have given way to alkaline batteries; they
use an alkaline electrolyte, which reduces corrosion and gives a
longer life.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, batteries do not store electricity.
They store energy, which is translated into an electric current by
chemical reactions in the batteries, using over the years
substances like manganese dioxide, zinc, nickel, lithium salts,
hydrogen-absorbing alloys and potassium hydroxide.
</P>
<P>
   It is the recalcitrance of chemical reactions that makes
improvement in batteries difficult. Changes in materials _ new
combinations of more refined chemicals _ have produced improvements
by making battery components lighter, thinner and more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   A result has been stronger and longer-lasting batteries, said
Linnea Brush, senior research analyst for the Darnell Group, a
publishing and market research company in Norco, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-like circuitry is even showing up in some batteries,
particularly those high-end rechargeables that power some laptop
computers, camcorders and cellular phones. These so-called smart
batteries started coming into use in the mid 1990s. They perform a
range of duties, from keeping the battery from being improperly
charged to reporting its energy levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pay a little more, but smart batteries take the guesswork
out,'' said Ms. Brush, who added that the use of these batteries is
growing at an annual rate of 47 percent worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But most batteries remain, as Ms. Brush called them, ``dumb.''
And problems more often arise with these rechargeable batteries
when they are used in electronic devices.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One puzzling problem is variability. How to know how long a
charge will last? While batteries are extensively tested against
standards set by the American National Standards Institute, a
nonprofit, nonregulatory body in Washington, battery makers are
reluctant to guarantee that a given battery will work for a given
number of hours.
</P>
<P>
   Battery manufacturers often speak of their battery's capacities
in terms of voltage and milliampere-hours, which is practically
meaningless to most consumers. Sometimes battery potency simply
comes down to a marketing claim like ``longer lasting.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, many battery makers and retailers say, a mountain
of variables makes it next to impossible to predict the battery
life in the myriad of modern devices that routinely gobble them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People use things differently,'' said John Grady, general
manager for technology for Eveready Battery Co., based in St.
Louis. A major influence on how a battery will perform is whether
the device, a cellular phone, for instance, is used continuously or
intermittently, as when a motorist uses it only to call for help.
In the case of a cellular phone, continuous use is generally more
taxing on batteries.
</P>
<P>
   But choose the wrong batteries and even that truism can be spun
on its head. High-power batteries, like nickel cadmium ones, are
best suited for short bursts of energy. For more sustained power,
high-energy batteries, like nickel metal hydride and lithium ion,
are better suited, Ms. Brush said. Mix them up and disappointment
is very likely to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Other variables include the design and efficiency of the device
being used and the conditions under which they are used. Heat, for
example, like the kind produced in many laptops, is a well-known
slayer of batteries, battery makers say. So are digital cameras,
which have earned a reputation for quickly depleting batteries
because of their high-power demands.
</P>
<P>
   After buying an Apple Quick Take 200 digital camera last year,
Andy Baird, an interface designer for the Educational Testing
Service in Princeton, N.J., said he was forced to become a
self-taught batteries expert to slow his camera's ravenous
consumption of batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can get a lot more usefulness out of their batteries if
they know a little about the kinds of batteries there are and how
they should be used,'' said Baird, who publishes a battery guide at
members.home.com/andybaird/batteries.html.
</P>
<P>
   He suggests, for example, that frequent users of digital cameras
should use nickel metal hydride or high-capacity nickel cadmium
batteries and save money by recharging them. He cautions, however,
that alkaline and especially lithium batteries should be kept as
emergency back-ups because they maintain their charge for many
years, unlike rechargeable ones, when they are not in use. For the
occasional birthdays-and-holidays-only photographer, Baird suggests
sticking with lithium batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Even though batteries do not change as much as other aspects of
high technology, there are at least two significant developments on
the horizon. One is a new variation on lithium ion batteries, the
most sophisticated and expensive of rechargeable batteries. It is
the lithium ion polymer rechargeable battery.
</P>
<P>
   This battery promises to be powerful, yet lightweight and
environmentally safe. Its designers note that the battery's body is
thin and flexible unlike conventional batteries and it manages at
least 500 charge and discharge cycles. Most of all, Ms. Brush said,
the lithium ion polymer battery is much safer than its predecessor,
which has been known to ``vent flames'' while recharging.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Carcone, vice president of the Sanyo Energy (U.S.A.)
Corp., said lithium ion polymer batteries will appear sometime next
year. Yet another battery, the zinc-air cell, is lighter and has a
higher energy density than the lithium batteries, Ms. Brush said,
but it is aimed at computer manufacturers and is not generally
available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Duracell introduced an improved alkaline battery
called the Duracell Ultra that the company says is 50 percent
longer lasting than its previous alkaline batteries. (It's also 20
percent more expensive. A four-pack of AA Ultra costs about $5.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Eveready, whose strategy is to shy away
from rechargeable batteries and concentrate on making disposable
batteries that can handle high-tech devices, introduced its
highest-capacity battery, the Energizer Advanced Formula. Grady
said it represents a 100 percent performance improvement over
Energizer's standard batteries in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The battery industry is highly competitive, with each advance by
a manufacturer often matched or surpassed by others. And that,
battery makers agree, is likely to continue for some time because
battery dependency is likely to continue to grow in coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on widespread use of solar-powered personal stereos,
telephones and computers anytime soon, battery developers say. If
something uses electricity and it is mobile, it probably runs on
batteries, from a musical greeting card to the Space Shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   The average household bought 36 batteries in 1997, 40 percent
more than it did a decade earlier, according to a recent A.C.
Nielsen study of American buying habits. And quite naturally, the
study found, battery purchasing peaks during the winter holiday
season to power gifts for which batteries are often not included.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for batteries, especially in all their many new
shapes and permutations, has strained traditional retailers like
supermarkets to keep in stock all the kinds of batteries consumers
say they need.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to reach more consumers, Rayovac and
1-800-Batteries announced last month an exclusive agreement to
create a telephone ordering help line for consumers who have
difficulty finding batteries and accessories in traditional stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming increasingly harder for stores to stock the
growing array of batteries for today's sophisticated electronic
devices, resulting in disappointed consumers and lost sales,'' said
Dave Jones, Rayovac's chairman and chief executive, in a company
statement. ``The hotline and Internet sales are a win-win for
all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Hawk said, ``everybody needs batteries.''

ANGST AND ANGER JAPANESE-STYLE, WITH A WINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By J.D. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shogo calls to mind the old advertising slogan for Reese's
Peanut Butter Cups: Two great tastes that taste great together.
Take the game play of a first-person shooter like Unreal or Quake.
Add the narrative and esthetic conventions of Japanese animation.
Swirl together and voila, a pulse-pounding blast-o-rama with giant
robots, huge-eyed heroes, omnipotent corporations and
interplanetary war, interwoven with romantic themes and family
psychodrama.
</P>
<P>
   As Sanjuro Makabe, a soldier employed by the United Corporate
Authority, your mission is to quash a rebellion on the planet
Cronus, where your last mission went disastrously awry, claiming
the lives of your girlfriend and your brother. (In the world of
Japanese animation, otherwise known as anime, siblings are always
assigned to the same military unit; families stick together, even
on commando missions.)
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, you blame yourself, and all of this guilt and angst
justifies the destructive spree that is soon to follow; Shogo's
designers have gleefully embraced Japanimation's singular
combination of high-tech violence and unabashed melodrama. ``I've
lost too much to this war,'' Sanjuro declares as the story opens.
``My brother Toshiro. Kura, the woman I loved. Baku, my childhood
friend. I can't bring them back _ but I can avenge them. Every
rebel CMC soldier and fanatical Fallen terrorist I wipe off the
face of Cronus brings me one step closer to peace. That, and
Kathryn, Kura's sister, whom I've been dating for the past several
months. ... It's kind of complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, the plot twists and swerves through anime's
conventional roller coaster of sudden revelations and wrenching
moral choices. In the 40 or 50 hours it takes to complete this
game, you discover the truth (gasp!) about your girlfriend's death,
the United Corporate Authority's nefarious motives (no!) and the
identity of Cronus' mysterious rebel leader (it can't be!).
</P>
<P>
   All the while, there's a full-scale war in progress. So you're
piloting a 40-foot transformable robot under heavy fire while you
make these decisions. But that's anime: Sturm und Drang in the
cockpit of a cutting-edge vehicle. From ``Speed Racer'' to
``Robotech,'' Japanimation has never been a stranger to camp.
</P>
<P>
   And it's high camp, as opposed to American cartoons, whose
lantern-jawed heroes have no idea how ridiculous they look running
around in tights. Anime knows it's overblown, and viewers are in on
the joke. That's why Astro Boy is more fun than Superman. And
that's why anime conventions frame the first-person shooter more
cleverly than the cybergoth esthetic. Anime winks at the viewer,
and a Japanimation video game winks at the player. It says: This
stuff doesn't really make sense, but doesn't it look cool?
</P>
<P>
   There is no real logic in piloting a big robot that has hands
and holds guns. But your MCA (mobile combat armor), a 40-foot
mechanical exoskeleton, doesn't have rocket launchers attached. It
picks up a gun that fires rockets. It walks, even though that makes
no sense either, especially since the vehicle transforms into a
hovercraft.
</P>
<P>
   But that's beside the point. Anime is not about function. It's
all about style. It's about the dark cloud swirling over the raised
fists of a demonic villain. It's about the action heroine's perfect
spiky hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   In Shogo, you see the same stylistic flourishes. ``Instead of
putting the camera in a standard Hollywood place, we might stick it
way under their chin, creating this huge angle,'' said Shogo's
producer, Jason Hall. ``Or like, a lot of times in anime, before a
character destroys another character, they always hit this pose,
and there's a sound, and a little gleam off their sword or
something. So even though it doesn't make sense, we wanted to put
in the poses. And _ this is a perfect example _ when things are
about to explode, the bigger the explosion, the longer they just
sit there and glisten.''
</P>
<P>
   The anime conventions are so over the top _ and so pitch perfect
_ that they throw computer game conventions into high relief. They
set off the cartoonishness of first-person shooters, with their
hyperbolic explosions, surreal lighting effects, landscapes
littered with gigantic firearms and cairns of conveniently placed
ammunition. Dressed up as anime, the first-person shooter becomes
high camp as well. Shogo plays the genre for laughs.
</P>
<P>
   On a military installation, for instance, you run into a crying
woman. She says she lost her kitty cat. Could you please help her
find it? You don't really have time for this because you're on a
seek-and-destroy mission behind enemy lines. But you agree because
this woman controls a crucial access gate. So she hands you the
kitty cat's favorite squeaky toy, and pretty soon you're running
around the military base squeezing this doll that screams, ``Magic
claw! Magic claw!''
</P>
<P>
   Every time you do that, enemies can hear you. So you end up
switching between weapons and the squeaky toy, trying to run down
this cat. Enemy robots turn to face you. Switch to pulse rifle and
blast them to smithereens. Grab the squeaky toy and sprint down the
alley (``magic claw!''). More enemies round the corner. Switch to
laser canon (boom! boom! boom!). Whip out the squeaky toy (``magic
claw!''). Sprint for the cat in John Woo slow motion.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to take Quake seriously after this. But it also makes
you realize that the genre's limitations may be its great strength.
First-person shooters are like sharks. They have stopped evolving
because they work so well. Of course, the production values keep
getting better _ you can always pump up the resolution as
technology improves. But the underlying game play has become a
formula. And that formula is not going to change significantly
because it hits gamers in the right spot (whatever that spot may
be).
</P>
<P>
   We tend to think of this design straightjacket as a liability.
But it may in fact be an asset because it makes the first-person
shooter into a kind of blank canvas for anyone who wants to
experiment with esthetics. If the game mechanics are identical
under the surface, it gives you the opportunity to test the limits
of the skin, the visual surface, and how much difference that can
make.
</P>
<P>
   If enemies are enemies, does it matter what they look like? Does
it make a difference if the enemies are human? What if they're
aliens? What if they're demons from hell? What if they're foreign
soldiers? What if they're terrorists? Cops? Pets? Kids? Because
these images are not structural decisions. They're esthetic
decisions. So the question is: If the basic code is held constant,
do the surface decisions matter, and how much, and to whom?
</P>
<P>
   When does it stop being the same game?
</P>

NAIL-BITING TIME IN THE GAME ARENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kurt Shimada is shaking with joy, disbelief and
a twinge of guilt. Moments ago, in the preliminary round of the
computer game championships, he didn't just beat but demolished
Dennis Fong, who happens to be the Michael Jordan of computer
games.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt is unprepared for this good fortune. ``Dude, I'm totally
shaking,'' says this terribly nice 15-year-old, who turns savage
when wielding a mouse-controlled virtual rocket launcher in a game
called Quake II. ``I thought I was going to get spanked.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the Professional Gamers' League championships, a
three-day competition to determine the king of the keyboard
jockeys. Until Kurt Shimada came along, Fong had seemed invincible.
But the challenger's victory in the early round has set the stage
for the pair to meet again in a heavyweight showdown here at
Club-i, a downtown cybercafe, amid about 150 spectators. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A professional computer game league may sound a bit
contradictory in terms, but there is more than $100,000 at stake
here in cash and prizes _ which makes these games very serious
business. The final match is the culmination of a four-month
regular season, with the earlier rounds having been played entirely
over the Internet. Some 1,700 contestants worldwide were pared down
to 32 finalists in three different games: Quake II, a Quake II team
competition and Starcraft, a strategy game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quake II, a post-apocalyptic shoot-'em-up, is considered the
marquee event, a meeting of the best action players akin to the top
card on fight night. Whether playing over the Internet or here in
the championship, the players sit at separate computers.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting is done by the avatars they control in a virtual
arena on screen. The idea is to roam the arena, more like an
abandoned building, picking up weapons and then hunting down and
killing the other avatar. It's called a ``death match'' _ and it is
where reputations are made and lost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Fong, 21, has owned these competitions,
earning $100,000 a year in endorsements alone. But the chance for
fame and money has brought talented foes like Kurt Shimada, whose
aim with a weapon called a rail gun is legendary and who is thought
to have a real chance to dethrone Fong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Computer game fans can't contain their excitement over the final
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is incredible,'' says Serena Wong, owner of the Club-i,
as she considers the prospect of a Shimada-Fong final death match.
</P>
<P>
   The Total Entertainment Network, a San Francisco-based Internet
game company, created the Professional Gamers' League (www.pgl.com)
last year, and this is the third championship (a ``season'' lasts
three months). The league is slowly gaining credibility among
gamers and sponsors; it has attracted $2 to $3 million in
sponsorships from high-tech companies that subsidize the contest,
fly out the finalists and pay for the prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Lundberg, executive producer of the league, said he thought
it had the potential to become enormous, because it allowed anyone
to play, whether they are ``weak, short, tall or handicapped.''
There is, however, one clear sticking point: The games are far less
enjoyable for spectators than for players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the final rounds here, the players sit on an elevated stage,
cordoned off from the fans by a rope. Some spectators crane their
necks to watch them, which isn't particularly riveting, since even
in the heat of a pitched battle, only the players' fingers move.
</P>
<P>
   So most spectators watch the frenetic avatars on a big-screen
monitor that hangs from the ceiling, although it is only possible
to see one player's perspective at a time.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the fans _ mostly high-school and college
students _ don't seem to mind a bit. They gasp and scream when
players score a kill. ``Great shot!'' rings out in the room at one
point, as if Evander Holyfield had just hit Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   The die-hard fans can learn about their favorite players from
another trademark of the sporting world: player trading cards. The
cards, which are handed out at the door, include action photos,
biographical information and player aliases like Lord-187,
Mastakilla and the Insane Frog. On the card for Fong, whose
nickname is Thresh, it notes that his hometown is Berkeley, Calif.,
and his favorite weapon is a rocket launcher. His central
processing unit speed? A healthy 400 megahertz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are a handful of parents, too, who flew in to watch their
sons take a shot at the title. They seem nervous and hopeful. ``My
guy is Lord-187,'' says Mike Buxton of his 15-year-old son, Mark,
who has come here from Clearwater, Fla. ``On the plane over here, I
told him that no matter what happens, `You're a winner.''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tempting as it might be to stereotype the players as
mouse-toting recluses, they don't fit into one mold. True, they are
mostly adolescent boys _ all the competitors in the championship
are males _ and many seem thinner than a PC modem card. But there
are also some good athletes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They come to the tournament with their own equipment: keyboard,
mouse and the ever-important mouse pad. (``You wouldn't go to a
tennis tournament without your own racquet,'' a player explains.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And they are exceedingly friendly. While the games themselves
might be highly violent, the players are more cordial to one
another than combatants in a senior croquet tournament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say there is no competitive spirit. Players love
to trash-talk over the Internet; during games, the good ones are
quick enough to type in taunts to one another, like ``Come and get
me'' and ``I own you,'' as well as some expletive-charged
epithets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They don't at all like to lose. Iain Girdwood, also known as
TillerMan, appeared quite dejected when he lost both of his first
matches in the preliminary round of the strategy game category,
called Starcraft. Girdwood had been flown in from Scotland to
compete and had been widely considered the favorite in that game. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a loser,'' he says, wasting no words. ``Put that in your
article.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The contest occurs against the backdrop of a raging debate here
over whether great video gamers are born or made.
</P>
<P>
   Some players say it is necessary to practice hour upon hour to
become a professional. Those who disagree say Fong is the best
evidence that there is something else is involved in greatness
besides mere practice. In awed tones, some speak of ``Thresh ESP.''
They say Fong has such acute senses he can tell whether another
player is in the Quake II maze even without seeing the player.
</P>
<P>
   Fong himself just shrugs, unable to explain his knack. But
clearly, he has something going for him. He has won the two
previous PGL championships, has netted a red Ferrari in a separate
tournament and in all has taken home hundreds of thousands of
dollars in cash and prizes. He has been written about in countless
national and international magazines.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me know if you want to talk to him,'' says Peter Kim, a
24-year-old friend and business associate of Fong. ``I'm his
agent.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Shimada, whose nickname is Immortal, is a high-school
sophomore from Pleasanton, Calif. He started with Sega in fourth
grade and graduated to computer games when he was 10. He and Fong
have become friendly, despite their rivalry. Nowadays, he says he
practices for only a couple of hours a day. His secret? ``I just
take it one match at a time,'' he says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The final game takes place two days after Kurt's initial victory
over Fong, on a Saturday afternoon. The winner will walk away with
$8,500 in cash and a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd is hyped up, which may explain why fisticuffs briefly
broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immortal has great aim, but you can't count Thresh out,'' says
a fired-up Robert Villasana, one of the PGL announcers. ``It's that
close.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kurt says he is feeling good, noting that he has the odds in his
favor. When the king and the kid sit down for the final contest,
Fong will have his work cut out for him. Since the champion had
come through the loser's bracket in the double-elimination
tournament, he would have to beat Kurt twice consecutively to
retain his title.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Kurt sn't sure how he feels about the idea of
dethroning Fong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to say,'' he says. ``I want to win really
bad. But he's my friend. I don't want to take everything from
him.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he need not have worried. Despite the excitement
engendered by the early upset, it isn't even a contest.
</P>
<P>
   Fong, who _ Thresh ESP notwithstanding _ says he put in hours of
practice after losing to Kurt in the early round, jumps out to an
early lead, and then absolutely crushes the young gun. The final
score is Thresh 46, Immortal 0. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Fong pumps his fist in the air, gives a jubilant
smile and lets out a relaxed exhale. ``I honestly didn't think I
could take him,'' he confides. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the two players shake hands and exchange supportive
words. Fong tells Kurt not to worry about his future as a
competitive gamer. ``Nobody has aim like him,'' he says.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then Fong is engulfed by well-wishers, several of whom ask him
to autograph his trading card.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard so much about him, I just had to see him,'' says
Aaron Melius, who drove more than an hour to attend the match and
is waiting for Fong to sign the card. ``He's the gold standard.''

   Holiday Shopping on the Web? Probably Not
</P>
<P>
   Americans who let their keyboards do the walking when they go
shopping remain a decided minority, two studies have found. Based
on a survey of 2,500 households, the San Francisco-based marketing
firm Odyssey estimates that 88 percent of all U.S. households won't
buy anything through the Internet this year. Even 57 percent of
families with online access will pass on cyber shopping. ``For all
of the hoopla surrounding E-commerce it is still a retailing method
in its infancy,'' said Nick Donatiello, Odyssey's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Another study by the Boston Consulting Group for Shop.org, an
association of online retailers, used data from 127 vendors and
other sources to calculate that Americans spent $4.4 billion buying
stuff through the Net during the first six months of this year.
That sounds impressive but it represents less than 1 percent of
total retail spending in the country during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with technology consumers' reluctance to send their
credit-card numbers through the Internet are obvious limits to
expanding Internet shopping, both reports indicate. But both
Donatiello and David Pecaut, a senior vice president at Boston
Consulting, say that retailers themselves are often a large part of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Donatiello is critical of retailers who offer
their goods on the Web at conventional store prices but then tack
on substantial delivery charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that people will just suck up the shipping is just
not so,'' he said. ``That's a cost of doing business like real
estate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pecaut added that many companies still haven't adequately
addressed privacy issues or adopted a ``Good Housekeeping type of
seal of approval'' for their payment systems to ease worries about
security.

   Let Your Microphone Be Your Mouse And Sit Back and Relax
</P>
<P>
   It's handy, it's dandy and it's at least four tools in one. No,
not a new Popeil Pocket Fisherman, but a device for your computer
that is a new example of convergence, the morphing of several
separate consumer electronic devices into one.
</P>
<P>
   Called Speech Mike, this slender and ergonomically correct
hand-held device by Philips Electronics is at first glance a
microphone for personal computers, which might be especially useful
as voice-recognition and other speech applications become more
widespread in homes and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Mullen, a Philips spokesman, said the microphone, which
is connected by a cord to a serial port, gives users a ``kick your
feet up laid back'' option to huddling over a computer to speak to
it. It also has a built-in speaker so users can discreetly listen
to the computer from a distance.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Mullen noted, the Speech Mike has a built-in
trackball with left and right click buttons so, again at a
distance, users can control their computers, including browsing the
Internet or given a presentation. The device can also be placed on
a flat surface for use as a conventional mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Speech Mike has been sold only online since the summer, but
is scheduled to arrive on retail shelves early next year and cost
about $70, Mullen said. The Speech Mike Pro, for about $150, will
offer six programmable keys, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mouse is a tool of the '80s, much less the millennium,''
Mullen said. ``This is a tool people are going to be more
comfortable with.''

   Program Notifies You of E-mail As Long as You're Not on the
Phone
</P>
<P>
   Are you eager to know when an important e-mail has arrived but
frustrated at having to repeatedly dial into your Internet service
to check for messages? If so, Mailpush Express might calm your
nerves.
</P>
<P>
   The service, offered by New Email Communications Systems, gives
e-mail users with dial-in modems a feature that's standard
equipment for those constantly connected to the net by T1 lines or
cable modems _ a new mail notice that pops up on their computer
screens. Mailpush's trick is that it works even when its users are
offline.
</P>
<P>
   Users must first register e-mail services vital statistics,
including their password, on NECS' website
(www.express.mailpush.com) before downloading the company's $19.95
software. After that, Mailpush computers automatically check-in
with the customer's ISP every 10 minutes. When the hunt finds new
mail, a phone call to the customer's computer turns on a green mail
logo in their Windows task bar and, if the computer has a sound
card, sets off a voice prompt. To actually read the e-mail, the
customer still must connect dail in to the service provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get used to having it, it's a very addictive
service,'' said Zvika Eadan, general manager of NECS, which is
based in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   At least he hopes so, since there is also a monthly charge to
use the service, which Eadan estimated would be about $3.
</P>
<P>
   The system is not flawless. If the modem's phone line is being
used for conversation or faxing, the Mailpush prompt cannot get
through. Also, the current system does not work with popular
Web-based e-mail services, like Yahoo, although NECS plans to
introduce a program for Microsoft's Hotmail shortly.
</P>
<P>
   While Mailpush is just becoming available in the United States,
Eadan said the company had about 12,000 customers in Israel. To his
surprise, a large portion of them are not hyperactive e-mail
addicts but people who get one message every few days. Those long
dry spells had meant that many of them had lost interest in
checking in for messages.

   Can't Get Enough Talk on TV and Radio? Try Tuning In to the Web
</P>
<P>
   Talk shows are undeniably successful staples of television and
radio. So it's not surprising that Talkspot is attempting to adapt
the format for the Web. Following the lead of Web-based audio
services offering music, Talkspot (www.talkspot.com) offers four
channels aimed at different tastes that are delivered using Real
Audio.
</P>
<P>
   The topics are familiar to even a casual talk show listener:
astrology, politics (mostly conservative), parenting advice, weight
loss and, on Channel Z, off-color shock jock humor ``where
everything is politically incorrect and proud of it!''
</P>
<P>
   James Golden, Talkspot's vice president for programming and host
of two shows, acknowledged that one potential attraction of Web
talk was that it cannot be curbed by the FCC. ``Much of Channel Z
pushes the borders,'' said Golden, a former producer of Rush
Limbaugh's radio show who appeared on air under the name Bo
Snerdly. ``However, we have standards here too. We do not encourage
the gratuitous use of dirty words.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site have the option of receiving audio only or
logging into Web pages that display graphics related to a program's
topic along with a primitive video image from the studio. Below,
the page displays a text-based chat room that is mined by the
on-air hosts for comments. As in conventional broadcasting,
listeners can also pitch their views or question guests through
toll-free phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Talkspot is the creation of Ken Williams, the founder and former
chief executive of Sierra On-Line, an interactive gaming service.
His new company plans to sustain its site through advertising and,
according to Golden, plans to offer up to 100 different channels,
mostly from outside suppliers.

   Sony Offers On-Line Juke Box With Unlimited Play in 24 Hours
</P>
<P>
   The jukebox is back _ on the Internet. Sony Music Online's new
site _ a partnership with RealNetworks Inc. _ has a ``pay as you
play'' structure, allowing users to choose songs and play them
through their computers. The songs selected from the site
(www.sonymusic.com/jukebox) can be played an unlimited number of
times in a 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   Users with credit cards can purchase ``tokens'' at 10 for $2.50,
22 for $5 or 50 for $10. The songs (about 200 online currently; up
to 500 promised in the future) are all from the Sony catalog, and
range from pop favorites by Michael Jackson and Bob Dylan to
chestnuts from Mott the Hoople's ``All the Young Dudes'' and
``Nature's Way'' by Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The site will allow Sony to track users according to time of
day, music type and ZIP code. Sony's vice president for new
technology and business development, David Waldman, said that the
data would be used to determine listening patterns.

   Another Case of Users Being Way Ahead of the PC Industry
</P>
<P>
   The computer industry has recently been pushing to make its
products also serve as TV sets. Windows 98 was designed to help
support TV drivers and Panasonic and Compaq have just released a
tuner card that even allows PCs to display High Definition
Television programs. Their customers, however, may have already
found a less complicated, often cheaper, answer.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 10,000 homes by Media Matrix, a company that tracks
computer use, discovered that 47 percent of computer users run
their Windows-based PC and have on a television in the same room at
the same time. That's up from 40 percent in a similar survey last
year.

COOPER-HEWITT MUSEUM: MAKING GOOD DESIGN ACCESSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA FLANAGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The irony is rich. That's what makes the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum of the Smithsonian Institution
different from other arty museums in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the dark and pompous Andrew Carnegie mansion on
Manhattan's Upper East Side was turned into a bright public
showplace for the usable arts of daily life. Here were exhibitions
that talked straight, with a voice that was gutsy and sharp, yet
highly refined. (In a current show, sketches of Disneyland are
framed like Palladios.)
</P>
<P>
   But not all irony is nice. One of the Cooper-Hewitt's crueler
facts of life is that its director, Dianne Pilgrim, who has
multiple sclerosis, could not enter the front door of the museum
she had run for 10 years. Her wheelchair was not designed for steep
palace staircases.
</P>
<P>
   This year Ms. Pilgrim solved that problem _ for herself and for
thousands of others who had trouble climbing those granite steps
and heaving open massive glass-and-bronze doors made for butlers.
The museum has just completed a $20 million, four-year expansion
and renovation, including a new ramp, which have shrunk many
barriers that have kept it from serving its purpose: showing the
biggest possible audience that utility, done well, can move the
soul.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least brighten your day. Perfectly timed with that
reopening is a major exhibition, ``Unlimited by Design,'' which is
all about taking the needless barriers and discomforts out of
everyone's daily routine _ not just in museum mansions, but in
ordinary places like the home office, bathroom, kitchen and garden.
</P>
<P>
   To that end the museum has transformed a room into a playground
and set up a modern workplace with talking-and-listening computers,
a streamlined bathroom and, most remarkably, two futuristic yet
buildable kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   There are 150 services and products featured. Some are on sale
in the museum store, like the responsive ``Wiggly Giggly'' balls
that help vision-impaired children. Others, like the pop-up
mini-dishwashers and pasta-cooking stations, are waiting for
manufacturers to propel them into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've wanted to do since I became director,''
Ms. Pilgrim said. The show promotes universal design, a term coined
in the 1970s by the late Ronald Mace, an architect who championed a
new perspective: that making the world easier for the disabled
actually makes life easier for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 20 years, Mace and others worked to make universal
design as acceptable as public safety. What was required was common
sense and the infiltration of the comfy world of smug young people,
where fear and denial about aging and infirmity are strong. When
making a sidewalk, for example, why not cut the curb down for
mothers wheeling strollers, for travelers with baggage, for anyone
using wheelchairs. In 1990, the Americans With Disabilities Act
made curb cuts mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Although the message about accessibility has traveled widely
over the last five years, the Cooper-Hewitt claims that it is the
first museum to hold such a show. ``Unlimited by Design'' had as
its curators Bruce Hannah and George A. Covington, the authors of
``Access by Design'' (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1997). Hannah is an
industrial designer who teaches at Pratt Institute; Covington, who
is legally blind, is a writer and lawyer known as an advocate for
universal design.
</P>
<P>
   Covington said, ``It's not a `crip' show,'' meaning a show only
for people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The guest curators were aided by manufacturers and teams of
researchers. For example, the Rhode Island School of Design spent
five years on its universal kitchen project, under the direction of
Jane Langmuir, an architect. Two kitchens shaped by that research
are making their debut here.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in presenting these universal designs is thorny,
however. How do you tell a engaging, hands-on story about a serious
mission? (In fact, many hand-ons features of the universal kitchens
had to be ``utilities off,'' for insurance reasons: no water, no
gas.)
</P>
<P>
   A limitation of the ``Unlimited'' show is that the inventions
are too numerous to label and often too subtle to see. The Metaform
bathroom, for example, is packed with solutions designers have
sought for decades. One ingenious prototype is from Gianfranco
Zaccai of Design Continuum, which erases the shower threshold, a
detail vexing to those in wheelchairs. Only a contractor could
discern the hidden invention: a plastic perforated floor is placed
over the drain. The Metaform streamlined plastic toilet flips up to
save space; when closed, it cleans itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted this to be a beautiful design show,'' said the
exhibition's director, Donald Albrecht.
</P>
<P>
   In that, he has succeeded, perhaps too well. The irony lies in
the etiquette of it all. By taking great pains to prove that
accessible design can be beautiful, the show has collected lots of
beautiful design, presented it beautifully and made it look, well,
sort of inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   But all this ends up being compatible with the politely
provocative tradition of the Cooper-Hewitt. What ``Unlimited by
Design'' shows is the highly romanticized relationship most
designers have with design. Few of them like confronting the
messiness of daily life _ and the unesthetic needs of actual
people. It is easier to serve an ideal than to wrestle with all the
permutations of body types and biological functions. Globally, most
``good design'' is lovely to look at and delightful to touch but
conceived for an idealized client who chucks utility for style.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty is thin stuff. And inner beauty (that is, functions that
spur better patterns of living) is not always pretty.
Photogenically, the two universal kitchens in the exhibition would
be shelter magazine rejects. The beauty they create is in the
reorganized, retooled, refreshed life of the person using them.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Langmuir doesn't brag about it, the RISD crew did
what designers seldom dare. They blew up preconceptions about what
a kitchen should be _ stacks of costly steel and wood boxes _ and
started from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they poured their ideas into two kitchens _ each a
universe of its own. The Maxi is for families and those who
entertain; the Mini suits the cooking-for-one style of dorms,
studios and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The students and researchers cooked together, videotaped the
chaos, did time-and-motion studies, sketched and, best of all,
asked thrillingly mundane questions: if everyone eats pasta, they
said, isn't there an easier way to cook it?
</P>
<P>
   They designed a pasta basket that looks like a deep-fryer, then
fitted that into a basin that fills with water in the Maxi kitchen.
The contraption makes it possible to cook the pasta and drain it
without moving it. That way, there's no dumping heavy pots of
scalding water.
</P>
<P>
   And pasta-making was just the beginning. The kitchen's main
event is a ``wet island'' _ with interchangeable functions that can
be customized and combined in many ways. The island contains a long
work surface that lets you wash, chop, discard, cook, clean and
juggle dishes in a series of continuous motions. Behind the narrow
ribbon of work surface are three dishwashers (one for glasses, one
for dishes, one for pots), which pop up for easy loading or sink
out of view to create extra work surfaces. ``The idea is to clean
as you cook,'' Ms. Langmuir said.
</P>
<P>
   The sink is not the usual giant tub but a shallow basin equipped
with a pull sprayer and lined with ribbons of water activated by
infrared sensors. Cantilevered from the island is a wooden counter
that recognizes the way American families actually dine and snack:
on the run.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, Ms. Langmuir showed a small visitor, a 9-year-old
budding chef thwarted by grown-up kitchen counters, how the
universal kitchen can change shape to suit the people using it.
``You press this button and an electric motor moves the counter
down to 28 inches, or up to 40,'' Ms. Langmuir said. The little
girl, an ebullient cook who struggles at 38-inch-high counters at
home, watched the counter sink slowly. When it stopped, she beamed
an empowered grin, the kind Girl Scout leaders live for. All it
took was a few inches of change and suddenly the girl's aspirations
meshed with a reachable world, like an elevator opening onto a
penthouse panorama.
</P>
<P>
   How do you unlock somebody's aspirations? Sometimes, all you
need is a gnarled little electric motor. It's not pretty, but it
moves things along in a meaningful way.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's beautiful.

<P>
   L'ANSE DE'PRIEN NOIR, La. _ Alphonse (Bois Sec) Ardoin, 82, an
accordion player and farmer, is checking his hogs on a muggy,
mosquito-ripe autumn afternoon. ``Allez, cochons,'' Ardoin chants
as dragonflies dart above the hog pens. ``Allez.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking past his swaybacked barn, his dog, Sunshine, trailing
after, Ardoin says: ``Me? I got eight acres and three hogs.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he should add, a new album on Rounder Records, ``Allons
Danser,'' made with the Cajun band Balfa Toujours, which is led by
Christine Balfa, the daughter of Ardoin's friend the fiddler Dewey
Balfa, who died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The album is a heartfelt cry redolent of a time before radio and
television, traditional French music from South Louisiana powered
by Ardoin's bluesy, black Creole singing and accordion playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to me, having a new record out,'' says Ardoin,
who had not recorded in 20 years. ``But I play music to be with
other people. You need other people for the music to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude is why Ms. Balfa and her husband, Dirk Powell,
also a member of Balfa Toujours, have driven the hour or so north
of Lafayette _ past fields of sugar cane and rice, past crawfish
farms, past cypress knees poking out of the bayous _ to Ardoin's
place here in Evangeline Parish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to playing with Bois Sec at least once a month,
just for fun,'' Ms. Balfa says.
</P>
<P>
   For Ardoin, Ms. Balfa, Powell and others in their community,
music has never been a career; it has meant living and breathing.
The vital French music of the region _ 22 parishes called Acadiana
_ hasn't been shunted to the museum, to be occasionally dusted off
and propped on a sterile stage.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun and black Creole music features fiddles and accordions
complemented by the haunting, high-pitched singing of French
lyrics; the main difference is that the Creole fiddler or singer is
bluesier than his Cajun brother.
</P>
<P>
   Zydeco takes the rural tradition of the black Creoles and
marries it to rhythm-and-blues, creating a louder, more urban dance
music in which the groove is all important.
</P>
<P>
   French music thrived here because of South Louisiana's
isolation, both physical and cultural. But what happened here is
not an isolated event. Often damned for its take-no-prisoners mass
culture, the United States has always found room for local, often
country, musics: the strong fiddling tradition that grew up around
Galax, Va.; the African-American fife-and-drum bands of Northern
Mississippi; the Mexican-American conjunto born along the
Texas-Mexico border.
</P>
<P>
   And the omnivorous popular culture has never been shy about
borrowing (stealing?) from the locals, as Cajuns know. Hank
Williams's ``Jambalaya (On the Bayou)'' was a country hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Cajuns Jimmy C. Newman and Doug Kershaw made it to the Grand
Ole Opry with pale versions of their childhood music. As the fad
for all things Louisianan bloomed in the 1980s, Paul Simon dabbled
in the sounds of Acadiana and the 1987 movie ``The Big Easy''
featured a Cajun detective and a soundtrack of Louisiana music. And
isn't that a rowdy zydeco accordion heard on the occasional
Budweiser television commercial?
</P>
<P>
   But so what? South Louisiana's French-speaking culture has not
only survived the broader culture's disdain and lack of interest
(then annoying obsession) but has also reached the late 1990s
healthy and intact. No mean feat in these days of cultural
cannibalism.
</P>
<P>
   And on this day it seems that Ardoin, Ms. Balfa and Powell are
celebrating that good fortune, doing their bit for cultural
renewal. The threesome play for a good two hours, Ms. Balfa on
guitar, Powell on fiddle and Ardoin, accordion balanced on his
right knee as his feet tap time: ``Donnez Mon Chapeau,'' ``Valse a
Canray,'' ``Duralde Ramble.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has played Carnegie Hall and has played worldwide,
it's understood that Ardoin is just as happy making homemade music
with his friends and family, maybe happier. He is a farmer who
plays music (and who has brought up 14 children), not a musician
who plays at farming. Yes, he received a National Heritage
Fellowship award in 1986, but in 1992 he was the grand marshal of
the Louisiana Swine Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Ardoin, who was born in the house next to his small farm, pauses
between songs. ``I could play day and night when I was young,'' he
says. ``But the last two days I've been cutting tall grass. My back
and arms hurt, and the mosquitoes were eating me, too.'' He laughs;
the music surges on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allons Danser'' grew out of Ms. Balfa and Powell's musical
get-togethers with Ardoin, whose last album, ``The Ardoin Family
Orchestra With Dewey Balfa: A Couple of Cajuns,'' had been made
with Ms. Balfa's father, whom he had known since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Balfa recalls that as they played at Ardoin's farm one day,
she said: ``Hey, you remember that record you did with Daddy? I
think it's time we turned it around and made `Bois Sec Ardoin With
Balfa Toujours.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Balfa says, ``And Bois Sec said, `Don't say that if you
don't mean it, no.'''
</P>
<P>
   Of his new album, Ardoin says, ``It still feels good to hear
yourself on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Petty thievery was crucial in Ardoin's learning how to play
accordion as a boy. ``These white boys I knew would steal an
accordion from their parents, and then we'd go sit by the canal and
I'd play,'' Ardoin remembers. He also used to pinch his brother
Houston's accordion, hide in the hayloft of the family barn and
practice.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the time his brother found out, Ardoin played so well that
Houston gave him the instrument. ``My brother said: `I can't even
play one song. Here, you take it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And that nickname? Ardoin didn't like working in the rain as a
boy, and he knew of a hollow tree where he could hide when he felt
the raindrops. That kind of tree was called ``bois sec,'' or dry
wood, and the name stuck.
</P>
<P>
   As Ardoin, Powell, 29, and Ms. Balfa, 30, jam in Ardoin's
kitchen, it's hard to believe that in the late 90s their music
still makes some in their community angry. But it is so. ``There
are people saying, `I can't believe Christine recorded with that
black man,''' Ms. Balfa says.
</P>
<P>
   Balfa Toujours had to grapple directly with questions of race
and ethnic identity last January when, on Martin Luther King Day,
they were dismissed from a job by a dance club in Basile, Ms.
Balfa's hometown, because of their friendship with Geno Delafose, a
black zydeco musician.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Balfa says the club's owner was worried that Delafose might
join her band onstage and offend his customers.
</P>
<P>
   Of her friendship with Delafose, Ms. Balfa says, ``It seems we
can share the stage together all around the country and the world,
yet we can't do it where we grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Balfa Toujours's run-in with racism is a haunting reminder of
what happened to Amede Ardoin, a cousin of Bois Sec's and one of
the region's most important and influential musicians, at a dance
in the early 40s. All Amede Ardoin did was wipe his sweat away with
a handkerchief given him by a Cajun woman. After the dance, he was
nearly beaten to death by white men enraged that a black man would
use a white woman's handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Reed, 55, a white accordion player who grew up on a farm
next to Bois Sec Ardoin's, finds such racism bewildering. ``When I
was a boy, we were color-blind,'' he says. ``We always just
considered ourselves to be poor people. Everybody used to go to the
country store in the afternoon after cutting rice. I used to play
harmonica while Bois Sec was playing. A lot of songs I play today
are his style.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the music would be at Ardoin's farm _ music, and
more. ``Bois Sec was always known for his boucherie,'' Reed says.
``He'd butcher pigs twice a year, and everyone was welcome, white
and black. There'd be boudin, cracklins, pork roast, andouille.''
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the front door of Ms. Balfa and Powell's house on
Bayou Teche in La Pointe, a button accordion _ ``made in
Louisiana'' _ sits on a bench as if waiting for the right player, a
bayou Excalibur. ``That belonged to my father,'' says Ms. Balfa of
Dewey Balfa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's made out of cypress,'' Powell adds. ``It's light but
hard, and water doesn't affect it. This house is made of cypress.''
</P>
<P>
   As is, perhaps, Balfa's reputation. ``He's a constant presence
in our lives,'' Ms. Balfa says of her father. ``We're trying to
carry on his message. I always feel his presence when we play.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 Balfa, the fiddling son of a sharecropper who also drove
a school bus and sold insurance, was a late replacement at that
year's folk music festival in Newport, R.I. A local newspaper,
however, considered Balfa's invitation to play Cajun music an
embarrassment, especially to those trying to put their country
roots behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy had never seen more than 200 people together at one time
before,'' Ms. Balfa says. ``And 17,000 people gave him a standing
ovation after the first song. And that changed his life. He became
a strong advocate for Cajun culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell adds: ``We still get cards and letters from people who
have Dewey dreams. As Christine's cousin, Courtney Granger, got
ready to record his first album, he had a dream that Dewey was in
the room with him, and that Dewey had touched his heart, and he
cried as he told us the story. That gave Courtney such a sense of
emotion when he went to make his record.''
</P>
<P>
   But as much as Balfa Toujours honors the past _ and the past is
never past in Louisiana _ it is careful not to turn its music into
mere waltzing with ghosts. ``Music has to be a part of people's
lives,'' Ms. Balfa says. ``And as a musician, you have to make that
connection with people when you play.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's latest album, ``La Pointe,'' recorded in Ms. Balfa
and Powell's living room and kitchen, mixes traditional songs like
``Pa Janvier'' and ``Le Reel de Courville'' with their own
compositions. ``We're always looking deeper into the tradition,
into the center of it rather than outside it,'' Powell says.
``There's so much richness in it as far as writing original
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell, an old-time musician whose family and musical roots
stretch back to the mountains of Eastern Kentucky, has found
Louisiana's French-speaking culture congenial. ``Almost everyone
has been accepting,'' he says. ``People are flattered that someone
from outside wants to play their music. In clubs it's never an
issue. The only test is whether you're playing it right or not.
People will come up and ask for a song that was recorded 40 years
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   So, how did Powell learn all those songs? ``I listened a lot,
and I used to play the accordion while I was driving,'' he says.
``When I was dating Christine, I'd travel between Maryland and
Louisiana, and I'd drive with my knees on those long interstate
stretches.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Louisiana, music is still passed generation to
generation, a quilt made up of fiddles, guitars and accordions.
Especially accordions: Powell estimates that there are more than 50
accordion makers in the region. In the Basile-Mamou area, Ardoins
and Balfas have been making music since at least the 19th century;
this year three generations each of Balfas and Ardoins performed
together in London.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two high school students lead the youngest generation. Courtney
Granger (who plays fiddle) is completing his first album with the
help of Balfa Toujours, while Chris Ardoin, whose grandfather is
Bois Sec, leads a popular zydeco band, Double Clutchin', which also
features his brother Sean. On the band's 1997 album, ``Gon' Be Jus'
Fine,'' it recorded songs by both Bois Sec and Amede Ardoin.
</P>
<P>
   In the album's liner notes, Chris's father, Lawrence, says
Double Clutchin' remade the 1930 recording of ``Amede Two Step''
into ``Ardoin Two Step.'' ``Chris plays it just like Amede.'' his
father said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a steamy Louisiana Saturday night, and at the Bourques
Club, a dance hall in Lewisburg (pop. 300). The accordion player
Horace Trahan and the Ossun Express hold court. Couples of all ages
glide, waltz and two-step to the hard-driving accordion, the
sobbing fiddle. ``Of course the old people dance,'' Ms. Balfa says.
``It's what they do. It keeps them young.''
</P>
<P>
   Dancing is a birthright here, a good time on a Saturday night
after a hard week's work: dim lights, thick smoke and loud, loud
music. Red tablecloths (cigarette-scarred, patched and repatched)
disguise plank tables, the jukebox offers tunes by the Louisiana
Aces, the Balfa Brothers and Le Band Passpartout, and for tonight
anyway Bud is indeed the King of Beers.
</P>
<P>
   The band, helped by Ms. Balfa and Powell (Trahan is a carpenter
who sometimes works on their house), is lighted by one naked,
bug-sticky bulb; after playing for four hours, each band member
will be paid $50 to $70.
</P>
<P>
   As the Ossun Express finishes a song, someone shouts, ``Un autre
'tit bout!'' (``Another little bit!'') The dancer liked the song so
much that he wants to dance to it a little longer. ``In this music
the line between the band and the audience is almost nonexistent,''
Powell says. ``You can go up and meet the biggest star in this
music and shake his hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominick Cross, editor and publisher of In Tune, a Lafayette
magazine that covers South Louisiana music, says (in between
dancing): ``The music is so important here. In Lafayette there are
15 or so clubs, and every town has a dance hall. It's part of the
culture. There's a lack of influence from white-bread America.
People here don't talk about culture. They live it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, two French friends of Ms. Balfa and Powell's show up. The
friends, Bruno Catheline and Michel Salmon, have a Cajun band back
home in Brittany, so Trahan, as he would for any local player,
invites them to sit in with his band.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the world shrinks, centuries fall away: the original
Acadians left Brittany and Normandy and arrived in what became Nova
Scotia in 1604, taking their music with them. By the mid-1700s,
many Acadians had arrived in Louisiana, Ms. Balfa's descendants
included, exiled by the British. Now, two musicians from Brittany
are playing Cajun music in a Louisiana dance hall, music whose
roots are buried deep in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Cajun music,'' says Catheline, who plays and builds
accordions. ``And to play with the Cajuns is magnificent. I stayed
up all night after I heard Dewey Balfa play in Brittany in 1992.''
</P>
<P>
   Trahan introduces his guests, then cries: ``Allons, danser!'' A
touch of Dewey Balfa in his voice, a Bois Sec Ardoin quiver.
</P>
<P>
   The dance floor fills. Ghosts waltz. The tradition lives.

 &HT;    JAVA RULING A POTENTIAL LONG-TERM THREAT FOR MICROSOFT
 &HT;    420&AMP;add. With MICROSOFT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A judge's order forcing Microsoft Corp. to hew to
the Java programming standard in Windows 98 may be more than a
short-term headache for Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say the programming language developed by
rival Sun Microsystems Inc. is poised to become an industry
standard and threatens the dominance of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   That could give Gates a long-term pain in the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte in San Jose,
Calif., issued a preliminary judgment, giving Microsoft three
months to make its Java-based products _ including the hugely
popular Windows 98 _ compatible with Sun's technical standards.
Otherwise, it will have to stop selling them.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Microsoft had licensed Sun's technology, but then
tailored the Java language so that some programs would run only on
Windows. That's likely to be a violation of the company's licensing
agreement with Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge victory for us,'' said Michael Morris, Sun's
vice president and general counsel. ``There's a momentum behind
Java. ...This backs the proposition that Java is becoming the de
facto industry standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts expect Microsoft to appeal the decision, but a
company executive said Wednesday it had not decided its next move.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said consumers would not be affected by the
ruling, and that products on the market would not be recalled.
What's more, consumers will hardly notice a difference once changes
are made, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has no impact on our customers or our developers,'' said
Tod Nielsen, Microsoft's general manager of developer relations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said the injunction isn't likely to create
business interruptions for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But an eventual victory by Sun in an upcoming trial could cause
long-term problems for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loosening of Microsoft's grip on standard-setting
abilities in the industry is a strategic longer term negative,''
said Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Microsoft could simply include Sun's pure
Java language in its products, which include the Windows 98 and
Windows NT operating system and the Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long term, company officials have hinted that they
may move away from Java, instead using Hewlett-Packard Co.'s clone
of Java Virtual Machine technology. This ``clean-room'' version of
Java doesn't rely on Sun technology.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The debate between the Microsoft and Sun erupted two years ago
when Microsoft licensed Sun's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Sun executives have grumbled that Microsoft is
trying to ``pollute'' Java _ licensed to hundreds of companies and
compatible with all major operating systems _ by changing it so
that some programs run only on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken Sun's property and changed it,'' fumed Morris.
``From now on, they'll have to comply with the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, Microsoft executives were spinning the
West Coast development differently.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the federal district court here, Microsoft is duking it
out with the Justice Department over whether the software giant is
using its market dominance to corner the Internet browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But on the courthouse steps, Microsoft's Nielson said it was
ironic that Sun appeared to want to create its own monopoly _ with
Java. ``Microsoft wants to compete in that world, but Sun doesn't
want the competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absurd,'' retorted Sun's Morris, pointing out that Java
is licensed to hundreds of companies to be used on their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, a former senior Justice Department official who is
now a Brookings Institution scholar, he didn't expect the
Microsoft-Sun spat to have relevance in the federal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's just a preliminary ruling,'' Litan said. ``But
these kinds of dirty tricks _ if established in court _ again show
bad intent on the part of Microsoft to entrench itself as a
monopoly.''

THEATERS GO AROUND THE CRITICS AND STRAIGHT TO THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Flavorless marshmallow of a musical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sickening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A dispiritingly bland and juvenile spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   Such were some of the reviews that producers awakened to the
morning after the musical ``Footloose'' opened in October.
</P>
<P>
   But they did not crawl under a rock and hide or contemplate new
careers. Michael David of Dodger Endemol Theatricals, which
produced ``Footloose,'' said that such reviews, while painful, no
longer cut as deeply as they once did, largely because he and his
colleagues have developed ways to succeed in spite of them.
</P>
<P>
   The strategies are all part of a newly invigorated, bulked-up
form of marketing on Broadway that takes credit for providing life
support to more than one critically pummeled show. ``It has never
made a lot of sense to us to spend our short lives and the amount
of sweat equity and money involved investing in things we then
empower someone else to make breathe or not,'' David said. ``As
much as the critical community is one indicator of your success,
there are so many others.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, marketing has always been part of selling a
show. The flamboyant producer David Merrick, for example, was known
for his attention-getting gimmicks, like taking out full-page ads
contesting critical reviews of his plays. But while marketing
budgets have not greatly increased, remaining at about 10 percent
of a production's potential weekly gross, promotion has come to
play an increasingly important role on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Several theatrical producers and the artistic director Gregory
Mosher are involving themselves in marketing. Independent companies
have sprung up to develop promotional maneuvers like advertising on
Food Emporium shopping bags in exchange for tickets for management.
Among other recent examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ Such offers as buy one ticket to ``Jekyll and Hyde'' and get a
free round-trip bus fare on New Jersey Transit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seeking a three-minute spot on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Advertising on airport luggage carts and subway clocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spreading leaflets at a Baptist ministers' conference in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to have the general manager and the press agent,''
said Jed Bernstein, executive director of the League of American
Theaters and Producers, the trade group for Broadway productions.
``Now virtually every production has a marketing consultant as part
of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a big change from theater publicity of yore, which
largely consisted of playing up good reviews and praying to weather
bad ones. Now producers are increasingly trying to proceed without
the critics altogether. Indeed, they spend a lot of their time and
energy cultivating audiences that don't pay attention to reviews.
The tools of choice: advertising, media attention and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of ways to reach these people now,'' said Nancy
Coyne of the theatrical ad agency Serino Coyne Inc., which is
marketing ``Footloose'' in part with ads on MTV and VH-1 featuring
dancing feet. ``It's been so long since I based a campaign on
critical response.''
</P>
<P>
   With many kinds of entertainment competing for consumer
attention and corporate newcomers to Broadway like Disney and
Livent upping the ante with attention-getting marketing, marketing
has become a matter of Broadway's survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, an ad meeting consisted of an ad agent and a
press agent,'' said Nick Scandalios, executive vice president of
the Nederlander Organization. ``Last week at an ad meeting for
`Peter Pan,' there were 13 people in the room. We're an industry
that really in the last five years has woken up to what marketing
means.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is enthusiastic about phenomena like Disney's shop
at the New Amsterdam Theater filled with ``Lion King'' merchandise.
Veteran Broadway producer Alexander H. Cohen, for example, said he
has held fast to a policy of selling no merchandise for his shows,
not even a poster. ``I don't believe in that; I find it common,''
he said. ``But I'm terribly old fashioned in that regard. No coffee
cups, no T-shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen went on to say, however, that other kinds of marketing
were appropriate and important. Sure enough, producers who once
shied away from market research now unabashedly study their
audiences through frequent focus groups and surveys; George
Wachtel, president of Audience Research and Analysis, a
performing-arts market-research concern, said his business had
mushroomed since he started it three years ago. Theaters are
pitching their shows to specific age groups, ethnic groups or ZIP
codes by visiting neighborhood institutions and using direct mail,
often buying subscription lists from theaters like the Manhattan
Theater Club and the Roundabout Theater Company, which can be
expensive. A mailing of 100,000 can run about $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Of necessity, off-Broadway theaters have led the pack in finding
new ways to target audiences because they cannot afford expensive
advertising nor the wait for reviews.
</P>
<P>
   With more people seeking a piece of this new promotion pie, the
worlds of marketing and theater are drawing on each other's
expertise. The producers of hip shows like ``Rent'' and ``Chicago''
turned to Spotco, which specializes in graphics for record albums
and movies, to give their productions an up-to-the-minute look.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein spent 16 years in advertising before becoming head of
the league three years ago. Since then it has developed such
marketing deals as a Broadway Visa card and making Continental
Airlines the ``official'' airline of Broadway. Nancy Richards left
producing two years ago to start her marketing company, the
Richards Group. Similarly, Randall L. Wreghitt, one of the
producers of ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' recently started his
own promotions company, Promarketing.
</P>
<P>
   And in October, Gregory Mosher, the former artistic director of
Lincoln Center Theater and the Goodman Theater in Chicago, joined
the theatrical advertising agency LeDonne, Wilner &AMP; Weiner as a
consultant.

   WASHINGTON _ A judge's order forcing Microsoft Corp. to hew to
the Java programming standard in Windows 98 may be more than a
short-term headache for Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers say the programming language developed by
rival Sun Microsystems Inc. is poised to become an industry
standard and threatens the dominance of Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   That could give Gates a long-term pain in the wallet.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Ronald M. Whyte in San Jose,
Calif., issued a preliminary judgment, giving Microsoft three
months to make its Java-based products _ including the hugely
popular Windows 98 _ compatible with Sun's technical standards.
Otherwise, it will have to stop selling them.
</P>
<P>
   The reason: Microsoft had licensed Sun's technology, but then
tailored the Java language so that some programs would run only on
Windows. That's likely to be a violation of the company's licensing
agreement with Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge victory for us,'' said Michael Morris, Sun's
vice president and general counsel. ``There's a momentum behind
Java. ...This backs the proposition that Java is becoming the de
facto industry standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts expect Microsoft to appeal the decision, but a
company executive said Wednesday it had not decided its next move.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said consumers would not be affected by the
ruling, and that products on the market would not be recalled.
What's more, consumers will hardly notice a difference once changes
are made, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has no impact on our customers or our developers,'' said
Tod Nielsen, Microsoft's general manager of developer relations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also said the injunction isn't likely to create
business interruptions for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   But an eventual victory by Sun in an upcoming trial could cause
long-term problems for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any loosening of Microsoft's grip on standard-setting
abilities in the industry is a strategic longer term negative,''
said Rick Sherlund of Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   In the short term, Microsoft could simply include Sun's pure
Java language in its products, which include the Windows 98 and
Windows NT operating system and the Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long term, company officials have hinted that they
may move away from Java, instead using Hewlett-Packard Co.'s clone
of Java Virtual Machine technology. This ``clean-room'' version of
Java doesn't rely on Sun technology.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The debate between the Microsoft and Sun erupted two years ago
when Microsoft licensed Sun's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Sun executives have grumbled that Microsoft is
trying to ``pollute'' Java _ licensed to hundreds of companies and
compatible with all major operating systems _ by changing it so
that some programs run only on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've taken Sun's property and changed it,'' fumed Morris.
``From now on, they'll have to comply with the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, Microsoft executives were spinning the
West Coast development differently.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the federal district court here, Microsoft is duking it
out with the Justice Department over whether the software giant is
using its market dominance to corner the Internet browser market.
</P>
<P>
   But on the courthouse steps, Microsoft's Nielson said it was
ironic that Sun appeared to want to create its own monopoly _ with
Java. ``Microsoft wants to compete in that world, but Sun doesn't
want the competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absurd,'' retorted Sun's Morris, pointing out that Java
is licensed to hundreds of companies to be used on their systems.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Litan, a former senior Justice Department official who is
now a Brookings Institution scholar, he didn't expect the
Microsoft-Sun spat to have relevance in the federal case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's just a preliminary ruling,'' Litan said. ``But
these kinds of dirty tricks _ if established in court _ again show
bad intent on the part of Microsoft to entrench itself as a
monopoly.''

 NEW YORK: a consultant.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mosher, who continues to produce and direct, said it was his
success luring young people and Latinos as one of the producers of
``Freak,'' John Leguizamo's one-man show, which moved to Broadway,
that made him realize there were important ways of reaching new
audiences. The efforts, which included a minimum ticket price of
$17.50, paid off. Mosher said 75 percent of the audience at
``Freak'' was under 35, and 55 percent had never seen a Broadway
show.
</P>
<P>
   Given the traditional mode of marketing, which he described as
trying ``to massage reviews into as much audience as you can,''
Mosher said he was eager to help producers like himself come up
with new methods. Rethinking the splashy campaign for ``Ragtime''
was one of his first assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Although some shows have run despite poor reviews, last season
such survivors were particularly abundant, and theater veterans say
it was in large part because of effective marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, last week, ``Footloose'' grossed $559,000, up
$83,000 from the week before, and was playing at 91 percent
capacity with no tickets at the half-price booth. ``Twenty years
ago that wouldn't have happened,'' said longtime Broadway producer
James M. Nederlander. ``They would have closed on Saturday night.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that audiences can be snowed by glitzy advertising or
promotional gimmicks, producers say, it's that people like
different shows for different reasons. For instance, some people
just want to take the children to a theatrical spectacle or tap
their feet and have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Critics have become increasingly less representative of the
people who are buying the tickets,'' Ms. Coyne said. ``As that has
happened, marketing has become more important.''
</P>
<P>
   For proof, producers say, just stroll down Broadway and look at
the marquees. Critics called ``Jekyll and Hyde'' ``a pseudo-serious
potboiler'' and a ``plastic monster assembly kit of a musical.''
``The Sound of Music'' was labeled ``uninspired'' and ``the same
old cup of treacle.'' ``Titanic'': ``Sinks like a stone.'' Yet all
these shows are still running and ``Titanic'' won five Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   To market ``Jekyll and Hyde,'' Ms. Coyne said, her ad campaign
emphasized gothic romance. ``It's a bodice ripper,'' she said. Thus
the advertising line: ``This is the man one woman loves and the
monster one woman fears. This is the musical that grabs Broadway by
the throat.'' (By contrast, the critic John Simon observed in New
York magazine that not even when Hyde and his paramour embrace ``is
there anything to incur so much as an R rating.'')
</P>
<P>
   One could be forgiven for losing track of ``The Scarlet
Pimpernel's'' marketing incarnations. That, in the view of
Cablevision, which recently bought the show and revised it, was a
big part of why it almost closed last spring. Frank Pellegrino, who
heads the theater division at Grey Advertising and worked on
``Pimpernel,'' said he tried various concepts _ from intrigue (who
 &UR; is &LR;  the Scarlet Pimpernel?) to romance (come fall for the Scarlet
Pimpernel) to swashbuckling (ah, the adventure!)
</P>
<P>
   The latest campaign seems like a quirky combination of the
three: ``Blackmail. Murder. Seduction. Bring Your Mother!''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of such marketing varies considerably. Producing a
television ad, for example, can run from $3,500 for flashing a few
quotations or audience testimonials to $35,000 for featuring a
musical number from the show.
</P>
<P>
   The average Broadway musical allots $300,000 to $1 million for
preopening publicity and spends $50,000 to $75,000 a week on
marketing, ad executives say. Straight plays allot $20,000 to
$35,000 a week and off-Broadway shows $5,000 to $20,000 a week.
</P>
<P>
   As the cost of producing plays has increased, advertisers say,
so has the expense of marketing, particularly when producers have
to sustain a show's substantial losses while spending a lot to save
it. After opening to mixed reviews in 1996, the musical ``State
Fair'' spent $475,000 in one month on top of its $165,000 weekly
advertising budget to try to find an audience. It failed.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewd marketing can give even acclaimed shows a lift, creating
the buzz all producers crave. ``There are shows you design from the
beginning to not be about the critics,'' said Drew Hodges, the
creative director of Spotco. ``If you do more publicity early on,
you can get an idea in a person's mind before the critic puts an
idea in a person's mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the success of many marketing efforts, some shows can't
be salvaged, sometimes even with good reviews. Many point to ``Side
Show,'' last season's critically praised musical about Siamese
twins, which quickly closed; audiences found the subject matter a
turnoff.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are reviews for plays like this season's ``More
to Love: A Big Fat Comedy'' featuring the stand-up comedian Rob
Bartlett, which make early death seem all but inevitable. ``A big
fat mess,'' said one critic. ``Suggests a variation on those
light-bulb jokes `How many producers does it take to convince an
audience that a good stand-up show is really a play?''' said
another.
</P>
<P>
   The producers did not even attempt a rescue and pulled the plug
two days after the play opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when it's too grim,'' said Pellegrino of Grey
Advertising, who did not work on the Bartlett play. ``And you bite
the bullet and tell the client, `The best thing you can do is close
the show.'''

`ONE RENEGADE CELL': THE CANCER BATTLE: A REVOLUTION STILL IN
PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Book notes are at end of review) 
(af)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What causes cancer? Almost anyone today could tell you that
among them are carcinogens, viruses, heredity or the body simply
wearing itself down: anything that prompts living cells to grow
uncontrollably and choke off the health of their host.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But what exactly causes this to happen? In his fascinating
new book, ``One Renegade Cell: How Cancer Begins,'' Robert A.
Weinberg explains the exciting discoveries in the field that have
taken place in the last few decades, including work at the Oncology
Research Laboratory at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical
Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he is
the director. (He is also a professor of biology at MIT.)
</P>
<P>
   A distillation and update of his earlier book, ``Racing to the
Beginning of the Road: The Search for the Origin of Cancer,'' ``One
Renegade Cell'' not only presents a clear and comprehensive
overview of where cancer research stands today; it also offers a
breathtaking picture, both wonderful and frightening, of the
fantastic intricacy of aberrant cellular functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer is a disease of damaged genes,'' Weinberg asserts. This
is the ``major insight'' afforded by ``the scientific revolution
that began two decades ago'' and ``continues to this day,''
revealing ``the invisible forces that create human cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   What damages the genes? In the mid-1970s, at the beginning of
the revolution, the answer was fought over by two warring camps,
one of which had evidence that carcinogenic chemicals caused genes
to mutate and spur out-of-control cellular growth, and the other of
which knew that viruses caused tumors to develop. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Eventually, in 1982, what Weinberg calls ``a common thread''
was found. Both carcinogens and viruses turned out to produce
cancer genes called oncogenes, echoing ``the term oncology, which
refers to the specialty of treating tumors, and the Greek word
onkos, meaning a lump or mass.'' Weinberg concludes, ``The cell,
responding to the orders issued by the oncogene, began a program of
unconstrained proliferation.'' That seemed all there was to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But others, pointing to epidemiological data, found this
explanation too simple. If all it took to produce cancer was a
single trigger, then how did one account for the steeply rising
age-dependent curve of cancer incidence, which indicated ``that a
multitude of events, happening in succession one after another,
must occur before a result is achieved, in this case a diagnosed
tumor''?
</P>
<P>
   So in what follows, Weinberg unfolds the intricate details of
what is now known about this assuredly complex process. What it
comes down to is not only genetic events that stimulate the harmful
growth of cells but also events that inhibit the beneficial
prevention of that growth, like a loss of the cells' ability to
commit assisted suicide, or apoptotic death, when surrounding cells
are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to what is now understood, the author is able to account
for forms of the disease related to frequent cell growth, like
colon cancer, which may result in part from the rapid turnover of
the colonic epithelial cells, or breast cancer, which he says may
be on the rise because of ``modern nutrition and reproductive
habits, which have collaborated to increase the number of menstrual
cycles that women experience during their lifetimes.''
</P>
<P>
   But any summary of ``One Renegade Cell'' is bound to distort
Weinberg's marvelously compact explication. Little grounding in
biology is required to comprehend it, yet it makes clear everything
from how cells communicate by means of protein, to DNA replication
and the way an apparatus within the cell copy edits the results.
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly striking is the analogy Weinberg draws
between cancer cell growth and Darwinian survival of the fittest.
The only glitch is that sooner or later, evolving cancer cell
populations ``kill the host organism'' that is ``vital to their own
survival.''
</P>
<P>
   In Weinberg's estimate, such cancer cell growth will afflict 40
percent of the American population at some point in their lives.
``Half of these people will be cured and the other half will
eventually die of this disease.'' What benefits will the
developments he describes here so succinctly yield?
</P>
<P>
   In his concluding chapter, ``An End to the Scourge: Using the
Knowledge of Cancer's Causes to Develop New Cures,'' he comes out
first for prevention, the identification and elimination of
discrete causes of the disease, in particular certain aspects of
diet and behavior. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Surprisingly, he exonerates Western industrialism, pointing
out that ``the rates of most kinds of cancers have held steady over
half a century, a time when environmental pollution has increased
substantially.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite this rise, he writes, ``it seems that nearly half of
current cancer could be prevented through avoidance of tobacco use
and high-fat, high-meat diets.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest, Weinberg foresees new methods of early
detection and smarter, less harmful drugs resulting from
``increasingly detailed information on the metabolisms of normal
and cancerous cells.''
</P>
<P>
   He concludes: ``Those who engineer these successes will view the
discoveries of the last quarter of the 20th century as little more
than historical curiosities. But for the moment, we allow ourselves
to see things quite differently. We can glory in having lived while
the foundations were being laid. We have moved from substantial
ignorance to deep insight. We have lived through times of great
excitement!''
</P>
<P>
   Something of this excitement is conveyed in the details of ``One
Renegade Cell.''

Sugar, spice and Chemical X, that's what Powerpuff Girls are made
of 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you have children, you watch Cartoon Network. There are other
kid-centric cable channels you probably check out with your
darlings, such as Nickelodeon or _ have mercy on your soul _ the
Disney Channel. But neither of those has animation on demand, 24-7,
and you, as a parent, never know when you'll need an emergency
cartoon injection to distract your children so you can read a book
or enjoy a parental nerve-calming beverage.
</P>
<P>
   Because you are forced to watch, you appreciate CN's mix of
classic 'toons (''The Tex Avery Show, Scooby-Doo),'' but long for
the new stuff, like ``Johnny Bravo'' or ``Cow and Chicken.'' The
new shows _ especially the network's most popular series,
``Dexter's Laboratory'' _ maintain an arch consciousness that winks
at our cartoonish expectations even as a new generation of bad guys
survives multiple dynamite explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Cartoon Network's latest offering, ``The Powerpuff Girls,''
debuting at 7 tonight, is perhaps the best of the new 'toon breed.
(Sincere apologies go out to rabid fans of the sweet but hopelessly
innocuous ``Rugrats'' on Nickelodeon.) ``TPG'' concerns three
superpowered sisters _ Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup _ who were
created in the lab by their ``father,'' Professor Utonium, in an
attempt to produce the world's first ``perfect'' little girls. The
prof accidentally added Chemical X to his mixture of sugar, spice
and everything nice, which caused the newly created girls to fight
crime with superhuman powers in addition to their daily Everygirl
routines. Rather serious biogenetic ethical issues aside, this
accidental creation is a blessing for Townsville, USA, which needs
help fighting evil beings like Fuzzy Lumpkins, Him, Roach Coach,
The Boogie Man (a disco-dancing villain) and Mojo Jojo. The show is
perfectly explained by its catch phrase: ``The Powerpuff Girls:
Saving the world before bedtime!''
</P>
<P>
   Like live-action TV shows, cartoons often need time to find
their groove _ witness the Disney Channel's ``Rolie Polie Olie,''
which gets better every week. ``The Powerpuff Girls'' seemingly
will have no such growing pains. From the beginning, the roles are
clear (Blossom is the leader, Bubbles the tomboy, Buttercup the
Barbie-saves-the-whales goody-two-shoes). The humor is right on,
too: silly enough for kids and clever enough for parents. The cute
stuff _ one gal throws Powerpuff punches in her sleep; they fly
through the house to escape getting ready for bed _ is never
cloying. There's even one ``very'' sly, very adult joke in this
week's episode, just as the professor goes off on a date with Ima
Goodlady. (Trust me, the kids won't get it, and it happens so fast,
I had to rewind the tape twice to figure it out.)
</P>
<P>
   This is creator/writer/producer Craig McCracken's second
breakout hit for Cartoon Network, although he only served as art
director for ``Dexter's Laboratory.'' The 27-year-old took the idea
for ``The Powerpuff Girls'' from his student short, ``The Whoopa--
Girls.'' The series' title may be a little more benign, but the
finished product is not.

   CURTAIN RISES ON IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid bitter partisan rancor, the House on Thursday
opens long-awaited impeachment hearings against President Clinton
for alleged perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica
Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was scheduled as the day's
lone witness before the House Judiciary Committee. The majority
Republicans may meet Friday to decide whether to call additional
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating scenarios with different configurations of witnesses
have marked the confused Republican planning for the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., and other
Republicans have urged Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., to call other key figures in the Lewinsky matter,
including Clinton's personal secretary Betty Currie, White House
lawyer Bruce Lindsey and presidential confidant Vernon Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible witness urged by some Republicans was John
Huang, former Democratic National Committee fundraiser who was at
the center of congressional probes into financing Clinton's 1996
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After opening statements by Hyde and Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.,
the top Democrat on the committee, Starr gets the floor for up to
two hours to address the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then will be questioned by Republican committee lawyers,
White House lawyers and then each of the committee's 37 members _
21 Republicans and 16 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is expected to go well outside the four corners of
Clinton's efforts to hide his 18-month relationship with Lewinsky
and instead will try to show that Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky
affair was part of a wider pattern of presidential obstruction of
Starr's investigation, which began in 1994 as a look at Bill and
Hillary Clinton's roles as investors in the ill-fated Whitewater
land development scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told reporters he wouldn't stop Starr from ranging beyond
the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I?'' Hyde asked. ``Because the Democrats would like
that? The Democrats want to stick to Monica Lewinsky. We want to
look at everything. That's the big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats left no doubt they intend to shift
attention away from Clinton's behavior and focus their fire on
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr's conduct and the actions of his staff bear directly on
credibility of the inquiry itself,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for
Judiciary Committee Democrats. There are serious questions about
the investigation and about how the issue ended up in Starr's
office in the first place, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said Democrats would ask Starr about allegations that he
or his aides threatened Lewinsky; leaked grand jury materials; were
in contact with lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual
harassment civil lawsuit against Clinton; and started investigating
the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship before obtaining court
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charged that the last-minute uncertainty about the
witness list illustrated how Republicans were in disarray in the
face of polls showing little public enthusiasm for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``thought they were going to ride this impeachment
horse all the way home, (but) the horse is now in terrible shape,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a Judiciary member. ``They've got
two choices: They can shoot it and send it to the dog-food factory,
or they can paint stripes on it and tell everyone its a zebra... I
don't think they know yet what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, at least, Republicans said they would focus on
Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress citing 11 grounds for
impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to hearing Ken Starr's side of the
investigation,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a Judiciary
member. ``The administration and its spokespeople have savaged Ken
Starr daily and ... he has not been allowed to speak publicly about
what he has found. So, for the first time he will be able to speak
for himself and speak candidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith dismissed Democratic plans to put Starr on trial Thursday
and charges of faulty GOP leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence Ken Starr will successfully keep the focus
on whether the president committed impeachable crimes,'' he said.
``I'm sure the Democrats would like to change the subject, but
there's only one subject at hand: Whether the president committed
these crimes or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP members of the committee expressed concern about
Starr's ability to withstand the expected Democratic barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough forum for Starr,'' said Hutchinson.
``The Democrats are champing at the bit for this opportunity and
it's going to be hard for him to look good.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the White House on Wednesday conceded defeat
in its effort to expand the time its lawyers would have Thursday to
question Starr. After receiving Hyde's initial offer of 30 minutes,
White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff on Tuesday insisted the time
be expanded to 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde turned down the request. On Wednesday, Ruff sent Hyde a
letter saying ``we will proceed within the time allotted'' even
though in his view 30 minutes ``is not consistent with the standard
of fairness that the committee has sought to achieve.'' The
president's personal lawyer, David Kendall, will use that slot to
question Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told reporters Wednesday he would be ``liberal and
tolerant'' in extending the White House's cross-examination period,
``if they're on a line of questioning and they need more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, the committee's chief counsel, Tom Mooney,
wrote to Ruff imploring him to respond to a list of 81
Lewinsky-related questions sent by Hyde to Clinton on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a promise to get the answers back to the committee by
Nov. 13, the White House has failed to forward them, Mooney wrote.
``We are dismayed that you have missed your own self-imposed
deadline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week Starr has delivered additional boxes of
evidence to the committee. One set involves Kathleen Willey, the
former White House volunteer who claimed Clinton kissed and groped
her during an Oval Office encounter in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The other involves Webster Hubbell, former Justice Department
official and close Clinton pal indicted last week for lying to
Congress and federal banking regulators about work he did for the
now-insolvent Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan, owned by Clinton
Whitewater partner James McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hubbell and Willey documents could prove to be wild
cards in the hearings, though it was unclear whether either case
would come up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will mark only the third time in U.S. history that the
House Judiciary Committee has conducted an impeachment inquiry into
the actions of a president. The previous occasions were the 1867
and 1868 proceedings against President Andrew Johnson and the 1974
hearings on President Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal.

 UNDATED: ... consumer group.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She warns consumers to make sure they understand the particulars
of individual dial-around services, which now come with a wide
array of terms and conditions. Some are better for longer calls but
worse on short calls. A few dial-around carriers push very low
rates but require minimum calling times. Some have higher weekday
daytime rates and others special promotions, in which calls made
before Jan. 1 are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a 15-minute weekend call between Boston and Los
Angeles costs $1.94 using 10-10-321 (12 cents for the first minute
and 13 cents for each additional minute). But it would cost only 99
cents with 10-10-220 (which bills 99 cents for the first 20
minutes, then 10 cents for each additional minute).
</P>
<P>
   The same weekend call using an AT&AMP;T Simple Minute Plan (10 cents
a minute no matter how long the call), costs $1.50.  &UR;  &LR; However, AT&AMP;T
and MCI are promoting calling plans charging 5 cents a minute on
Sundays. So the bi-coastal call, if made on Sunday, would total
only 75 cents, but the calling plan carries a $4.95 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   For callers who make infrequent daytime weekday calls, but stay
on the phone a while, dial-around can be less expensive. For
example, a 30-minute weekday call with 10-10-321 (27 cents for the
first minute and 28 cents a minute afterward) &UR;  &LR; costs  &UR;  &LR; $8.39. But
with 10-10-220, it costs only $1.99. AT&AMP;T will charge $7.50 under
its Simple Minute Plan for the same call.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Jacobs, who spends about $45 a month on long-distance calls
to the West Coast and Washington, D.C., through an AT&AMP;T calling
plan, says he fears that dial-around services have too many hidden
charges.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``Consumers should not be misled into believing that quick-fix
`10-10' numbers are a substitute for researching which
long-distance plan offers the best savings,'' adds Scott M.
Stringer, a New York State assembly member from Manhattan. He plans
to file legislation in Albany requiring that all 10-10 services
play a recorded message before each call is connected, providing
full disclosure of rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee Group estimates that nearly 40 percent of all
dial-around users are in the 45- to 64-year-old age group and about
25 percent of the callers have incomes under $25,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular of the dial-around services is 10-10-321 from
Telecom USA, a subsidiary of MCI. &UR;  &LR; That service is also the most
expensive among dial-arounds for calls shorter than 20 minutes. Its
time-of-day rates, which vary on weekdays and weekends, are
slightly lower than AT&AMP;T's basic rates, but signficantly higher
than either Lucky Dog or New Dimeline, which charge 10 cents a
minute for interstate calls any time.
</P>
<P>
   For calls up to 20 minutes, Telecom USA's newest dial-around
service _ 10-10-220 _ charges 99 cents for a 20-minute call, or a
low 5 cents a minute. However, if you dial the wrong number or get
an answering machine, you still spend 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
   MCI's success with 10-10-321 prompted AT&AMP;T, which had once
dismissed the dial-around business, to hastily enter the market
last month with the introduction of its Lucky Dog 10-10-345
service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did not think customers would spend the time to dial
the extra digits,'' says Howard McNally, president of Lucky Dog,
the AT&AMP;T subsidiary whose 10-10 rates are low enough to siphon
customers from the company's established calling plans.
</P>
<P>
   Adds his boss, C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T chairman, ``We were
simply late.''

KUNG FU SHOW ADDS STAR, HOPING FOR A HIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Martial Law,'' a cartoonish kung fu series on
CBS, has been one of the odder and more successful experiments on
network television this fall, but now it is embarking on yet
another experiment that speaks volumes about the immense pressures
on the networks to conjure up hits: the show is undergoing the sort
of midseason surgery previously reserved for dying shows, by adding
the onetime talk show host Arsenio Hall as the co-star.
</P>
<P>
   It is an attempt to make everything about the show large, its
humor, its action scenes and, if the television gods approve, its
ratings. And so Hall, who will play a cop named Terrell, made his
entry on the set the other day in an appropriate fashion _ by lying
down on the show's unlikely star, Sammo Hung.
</P>
<P>
   Hung had been chasing some assassins at a huge outdoor party
when Terrell leaped to his aid and the two ended up in a heap. Hung
wrestled free and exclaimed, ``You saved my life!''
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're not the caterer, are you?'' Hall asked.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, just who will be on top in the cast of this series, one
of the bigger surprises of an otherwise dismal fall season, and who
is really saving whom, is the question as ``Martial Law'' takes
another leap into the unknown this Saturday, when Hall makes his
debut.
</P>
<P>
   The evolution of ``Martial Law'' is as good an illustration as
any of just how the process of developing shows has been
transformed into a much more nervous and hands-on process by the
new hardball economics of television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martial Law'' was an unlikely bet from the start. It was
thrown together in a mere seven weeks last spring, compared with a
year or so for most new shows, in an effort by CBS to attract the
coveted young male audience with kung fu antics and over-the-top
humor; indeed, in a recent episode Hung fights off a pack of
security guards while wearing a huge chicken suit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hung has been a movie director rather than an actor
in recent years, speaks only a modest amount of English, and, with
his girth, looks more like Danny DeVito than Bruce Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In most weeks, ``Martial Law'' has been the most successful new
one-hour series of the season, though it is not a breakout hit by
any stretch. It ranked 53rd last week, with 11.3 million viewers,
according to Nielsen Media Research, but is winning its Saturday
time slot for the most part.
</P>
<P>
   Although the show is running slightly behind last year's ratings
for ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' the CBS drama it replaced, it is
more than 40 percent ahead in terms of its male audience.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is delighted with the performance of ``Martial Law,''
underscoring an important fact about network television: the
greatest profits come from luring what is perceived to be the
biggest-spending, hardest-to-attract slice of the audience, younger
men.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, CBS recently announced that it had ordered 9 more
episodes, bringing the total to 21. And yet CBS and the producers
are tinkering with it by adding Hall. (Technically, Hall has been
signed as a guest star for three episodes, but all concerned hope
the job will be permanent.)
</P>
<P>
   Hall has failed to create a hit in two previous shows, but this
is a risk everyone seems gung-ho about to improve the odds of a
long shot, or, as Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television,
put it, ``stacking the deck.''
</P>
<P>
   The producers are now frantically revising scripts and
struggling to turn a fish-out-of-water show into a buddy cop show
with a larger component of humor.
</P>
<P>
   Series surgery brings mixed results. ``Men Behaving Badly,'' for
instance, underwent major revisions last year, but they could not
save a show that had been struggling. Some successful shows,
however, like ``Homicide'' and ``N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' have had big cast
changes over the years and still done well afterward.
</P>
<P>
   As luck would have it, the producers of ``Martial Law'' are
transforming the show into a close cousin, if not a copy, of one of
the biggest breakout hit movies of the fall, ``Rush Hour,'' which
happens to have a kung fu star, Jackie Chan, and a black comic,
Chris Tucker, as loopy cops.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Martial Law'' producers insist they had the idea of
combining an African-American detective and a Chinese martial arts
expert long before the movie's returns stunned Hollywood, but they
do concede that, at the least, the film legitimized the concept.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tong, an executive producer of the show, said that, in
fact, the producers had suggested such a pairing initially and that
CBS had hesitated for fear the show would be ``too ethnic.''
</P>
<P>
   Most important, at a time when the profitability of the networks
has all but evaporated and the success rate of new shows has
dwindled, the producers and the network are working in greater
haste than they once might have to create a major hit. It is
analogous to the situation in the movie business, where theaters
are generally reluctant to continue to run films unless they
produce a huge first weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be in the old days you had a whole system to let a
show find itself and work out the bugs,'' said Terry Botwick, a CBS
senior vice president in charge of dramas. ``The creative process
works differently now. The spotlight is so big and the competition
is so intense that you rarely have a show break out right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, the president of 20th Century Fox Television, the
News Corp. unit that helps produce ``Martial Law,'' also emphasized
that if a show is going to survive, it has to be given a big push
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a world where, if you're not moving forward, you're
moving backward,'' Grushow said. ``Instant hits are just about a
thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Normally, when you do a makeover on a show you're
trying to salvage it. We have an interesting animal on our hands
here. The show has performed very well. It's on the cusp of
becoming a real hit, we think. Our feeling was and is that we have
a real opportunity with Arsenio to take it up to the next level.
And to do that quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of introducing Hall came from 20th Century Fox
Television, which made an unsuccessful pilot for CBS with Hall last
spring. The show, ``Skip Chasers,'' was a drama about bounty
hunters. Moonves said that though CBS rejected the pilot, he had
been convinced Hall was a success waiting to happen. The suggestion
to pair him with Hung, even if that meant reinventing the story
arc, was enthusiastically received.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just felt Arsenio brings a new dimension to this,'' Moonves
said. ``Adding to the comedy would certainly help our female
numbers on a male-oriented show.''
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, the delicate subject of how to sell the idea
to both Hall and Hung. Hall was used to creating and being the sole
star of his shows, and Hung had built ``Martial Law'' and now faced
the prospect of getting second billing. No one involved would
disclose salaries, but it was also clear that Hall would be paid
close to twice as much per episode as Hung, in the range of $80,000
per episode, according to some industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I wouldn't do something that I wasn't the star
of,'' Hall said. ``They kind of floated the idea carefully to see
what I would do. But I said, `No, it's not like that.' Look, I want
to act. I love it. I don't want audiences to see me and think,
`former talk show host.' I want them to see me as an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   At least initially, the actors are embracing the changes as a
way of lifting the show up a notch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammo's still the star,'' Tong said. ``I don't think he would
agree to change that. And we don't want to do that. Arsenio was
very honest about that and fair to Sammo. He was cool about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall concurred. ``It's Sammo's show,'' he said.

IN POLITICS, THE NAME OF THE GAME IS OFTEN THE NAME ITSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 22)   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chances are the contest for the presidency in 2000
will be a showdown between the son of a former U.S. senator,
wearing the Democratic label, and the son of a former U.S.
president, wearing the Republican insignia.
</P>
<P>
   We Americans long ago severed our ties with English royalty and
rejected the granting of titles of nobility. But we continue to be
enthralled by political dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in a name?'' the fair Juliet asked an ardent Romeo.
``That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as
sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Juliet's concern was the bloody rivalry between her family, the
Capulets, and Romeo's family, the Montagues, in Italy nearly 700
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was no America then, she could not have imagined the
kind of politics in which the name of the game very often is the
name itself.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming presidential showdown, the two leading
contestants, Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee and George W. Bush of
Texas, are attractive, talented baby boomers whose fathers preceded
them as victors at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father and namesake, Vice President Al Gore served in
the House and Senate. Governor Bush's father also was a congressman
and served in such important appointive posts as Republican Party
chairman, CIA director and U.S. envoy to China before becoming
Ronald Reagan's vice president in 1981 and president in 1989.
President Bush's father, Prescott Bush, was a senator from
Connecticut in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes. There are few more important legacies in politics
than a strong bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, our two most illustrious dynasties have been
the Roosevelts and the Kennedys. It would appear, however, that
they may be joined by the Bushes, whose current generation also
includes the governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 3 election saw three other prominent families replenish
their hold on public office.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio Robert A. Taft III was elected governor. In Colorado and
New Mexico two young men bearing the name of one of Arizona's most
distinguished families, Udall, were elected to Congress. In
Indiana, Evan Bayh, a former governor and son of onetime senator
and presidential hopeful Birch Bayh, was elected to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Taft's great grandfather, William Howard Taft, and his
grandfather, Robert A. Taft, both were embroiled earlier in the
century in ideological battles that threatened to tear the
Republican Party to shreds.
</P>
<P>
   In 1912, when William Howard Taft was nearing the end of his
four-year term as president, his onetime mentor and close friend,
Theodore Roosevelt, challenged him for the GOP nomination. Taft won
that fight, but Roosevelt ran on the Progressive ticket and split
the Republican Party. The result: Democrat Woodrow Wilson won the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, Taft's son Robert, an Ohio senator known
universally as ``Mr. Republican,'' launched his third bid for the
presidency. But his staunchly conservative, isolationist policies
were anathema to moderate Republicans, who persuaded the popular
Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower to run.
</P>
<P>
   In a bitter showdown, Eisenhower won the GOP nomination and the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The Udall prominence in Arizona began with Levi Udall, who
served as chief justice of the state supreme court. His eldest son,
Stewart, served in the House in the 1950s. When John F. Kennedy was
elected president, he became Interior secretary and held that post
for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart Udall moved to the Cabinet, his brother Morris, a
former professional basketball player known as ``Mo,'' won the
seat. He later became chairman of the House Interior Committee and
an unsuccessful aspirant for the Democratic presidential nomination
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stewart's son Tom is a congressman-elect from New Mexico
and Mo's son Mark enjoys similar status in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   After a successful eight-year tenure as governor of Indiana,
Evan Bayh will take over a Senate seat previously held by
Republicans, including Dan Quayle. Bayh could one day become a
presidential contender.
</P>
<P>
   New York Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's announcement
that he will retire in two years has sparked speculation that one
of the contenders for his seat will be Housing Secretary Andrew
Cuomo, whose father Mario served three terms as governor and whose
wife Kerry is a Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   There now is a Kennedy in the Senate, in the House and in the
lieutenant governorhip of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   But being the son or daughter of a distinguished family does not
guarantee success at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Hubert Humphrey III, son of the former vice
president and 1968 Democratic presidential nominee, won the party's
gubernatorial nomination this year over the sons of two of his
father's closest allies, former senator and 1984 presidential
nominee Walter Mondale and former governor and U.S. agriculture
secretary Orville Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   But being nominated is not the same as being elected. When the
votes were counted in Minnesota, neither Humphrey nor his
Republican opponent, Norm Coleman, had the governorship. The winner
was Jesse Ventura, a colorful onetime professional wrestler who ran
as a tax-cutting, antigovernment libertarian.
</P>
<P>
   Dynasties, like everything else in our lives, eventually die
out.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Roosevelt family produced two of the most dynamic
presidents in our history, Republican Theodore and Democrat
Franklin, none of the current generation is active in public
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Other dynasties have all but vanished: the Lodges of
Massachusetts, the Stevensons of Illinois, the Longs of Louisiana,
the Byrds of Virginia and the Talmadges of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But in politics a rose by any other name still does not smell as
sweet.

PACIFIC RIM LEADERS PLEDGE TO REVIVE REGION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ With an almost palpable sigh of relief,
the leaders of Malaysia and 20 other Pacific Rim countries wrapped
up a contentious summit meeting here Wednesday by pledging to
revive a region they said had been set back decades by the Asian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a communique short on concrete proposals, the leaders agreed
to pursue a ``cooperative growth strategy'' that would draw on
billions of dollars in fresh financing from the United States,
Japan, and agencies including the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But cooperation was notably absent from this year's Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum, as the United States and Malaysia
engaged in a war of words over a speech by Vice President Al Gore.
Gore accused the host country of suppressing freedom and threw his
support behind protesters who are demanding the ouster of Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir had the last word at a news conference late Wednesday,
but he steadfastly refused to criticize the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever comments needed to be made about that speech have
already been made,'' Mahathir said, in a subdued appearance. ``I
don't see any need to comment further.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Malaysia's foreign minister, Abdullah Ahmad Badawi,
condemned the United States for an ``abhorrent'' attempt to incite
the overthrow of Malaysia's constitutionally elected government.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, though, there were efforts on both sides to heal the
rift. Mahathir said the vice president's speech would not affect
relations between Malaysia and the United States, and the White
House made no further mention of Anwar Ibrahim, the former deputy
prime minister, whose ouster and arrest ignited the protest
movement against Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a senior Clinton administration official said Malaysia
had displayed ``vision'' in setting the agenda for the meeting and
praised Malaysian officials for being `` willing to listen to the
ideas of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Gore criticized its human-rights record, Malaysia
had been a contentious site for the summit. In September, Mahathir
imposed sweeping controls on Malaysia's currency and stock markets
_ effectively digging a moat around this country of 20 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia did not win an endorsement of capital controls in
Wednesday's communique, and other Asian leaders said they would not
impose controls on their markets. But the countries called for
changes in the international financial markets to avoid
``destructive disruptions'' in the ebb and flow of global capital.
</P>
<P>
   And Mahathir did manage to insert a passage calling for a review
of one of his pet peeves: agencies like Standard &AMP; Poors and
Moody's Investor Services, which rate the creditworthiness of
corporate and government debt. He has criticized them for what he
believes are sloppy judgments that drive up a country's cost of
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps another victory for Mahathir, none of the
demonstrations against his government this week erupted into
violence, as some political analysts here predicted. With only
scattered protests that petered out quickly, Kuala Lumpur hardly
seemed a city on the edge of anarchy. As he has before, Mahathir
blamed the foreign news media for exaggerating the extent of civil
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The government discouraged would-be protesters by mobilizing
hundreds of riot police and parking water-cannon trucks behind
trees at the hotels where the leaders stayed. And with Gore and
other leaders now gone, some people here fear that Mahathir will
crack down on the dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, however, the prime minister seemed
almost mellow. He acknowledged, for example, that Asian countries
deserved some responsibility for the crisis _ a striking departure
for someone who has vilified foreign currency traders for causing
the meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Asian governments are now aware of their own
weaknesses, and have undertaken to correct those weaknesses,'' he
observed. ``So because of that, I think investors will feel much
more confident to come into the region.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were any concrete steps at this summit, they were in
the area of reviving Asia's financially moribund corporate sector.
On Monday, the United States and Japan announced that they would
join in a plan to contribute $10 billion in trade financing to help
countries recapitalize debt-swamped companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's nothing concrete, but nonetheless it is
important because the U.S. and Japan are the linchpins in the
region,'' said Razak Baginda, the executive director of the
Malaysian Strategic Research Center, a think tank here.
</P>
<P>
   The countries also committed to create stronger social safety
nets. That issue seemed especially urgent this week after recent
violence and looting in economically strapped Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   American officials noted that the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank would both multiply their aid for social programs
in the region. The total by both agencies will be $6 billion
between 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, the big disappointment of the meeting was in
trade negotiations. Japan balked at a sweeping deal to lower trade
tariffs in Asia, forcing the countries to defer the package to the
World Trade Organization. There is no guarantee that Japan will not
resist the tariff cuts there, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials from the United States labored to portray
this compromise in a positive light, Mahathir felt no need to gild
the lily. ``Being urgent is one thing, getting things done in the
international community is another thing,'' he said in the tone of
a man happy to have his week in the spotlight behind him.

`CRY RAPE': EASIER TO PUNISH THAN TO UNDERSTAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (Eds: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(mk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the language of the law, guilt was ordained. The four high
school seniors charged with having sexual relations with three
14-year-old freshmen girls had committed statutory rape, and the
prosecutor was only doing the state's duty in enforcing the law.
But ``Cry Rape,'' Thursday night's ``48 Hours,'' gives a more
nuanced account of the events that led these young men and women
(boys and girls?) into the situation that damaged them all.
</P>
<P>
   As reported by Bill Lagattuta, the case offers a glimpse of sex
conventions at Grosse Point North High School in Michigan. A
swinging set of seniors in this upscale community appears to have
been competing to see how many virgins they could bring to bed
before graduation. The three girls in question succumbed, how
voluntarily remains at issue.
</P>
<P>
   Two of them say they were, to use the melodramatic language that
seems to suit the offense, plied with alcohol and then forced to
submit to sex.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence suggests a degree of compliancy if not
complicity; they evidently returned for more of the same.
Apparently, little sympathy for them has been forthcoming from the
community.
</P>
<P>
   The third girl, who still harbors warm feelings for her main
seducer, says, no, the sex was not forced; on the other hand, it
was not exactly consensual. She says, ``It was, like, sex.'' Of the
participants in the episode, she seems to be the frankest about her
confused feelings. ``I still think guys are hot,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The picture presented is of teen-age partying, no physical force
required, with a mix of alcohol, desires and easy opportunities.
Everybody in this privileged group was fooling around.
</P>
<P>
   If one is inclined to be judgmental, the seniors, big men on
campus, were predators; the girls were flattered to be selected for
the attentions of such important social figures. As the prosecutor
holds, 14-year-olds, whatever their own silliness or because of it,
should be protected even against 17- or 18-year-olds, and the law
calls the offense statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
   Few viewers are likely to leave ``Cry Rape'' with any particular
admiration for the young men. (One says the girls forced themselves
on him.) Yet you may feel that significant elements of the story
could never be sorted out in a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   For example, we meet the parents of one of the young men and two
of the girls; they seem not to have had a clue about what their
children were up to. In the school, these youngsters were leaders,
trend-setters, and, as at least one of them recognizes, they were
very much part of a culture that celebrates youthful sex. The
wonder is that many more of the students didn't find themselves in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The program ends with the main protagonist, a sometime class
president and valedictorian, being sentenced to jail for a few
months. The law requires it; he has earned it. But the debt he is
paying resolves little about how he and the others got into this
fix. What ``Cry Rape'' suggests is that when this sort of sexual
assault _ insofar as it can be called assault _ becomes a case at
law, punishment is much more common than insight.

   BIG BENEFITS IN OATS, NUTS
</P>
<P>
   Oats and nuts can help prevent heart disease, according to
studies presented last week at the American Heart Association's
71st Scientific Sessions in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Eating a low-calorie diet rich in oats significantly reduces
blood pressure and cholesterol, researchers from Tufts University
reported. The benefits of oats are attributed to its soluble fiber,
the type of dietary fiber that dissolves in water.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-linolenic acid, a nutrient found in nuts, as well as in
unhydrogenated canola and soybean oils, flaxseed and flaxseed oil,
is credited with protecting the heart. Nuts help prevent a rhythm
disturbance called ventricular fibrillation that causes sudden
death, researchers from Harvard University reported.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKE-FREE ON THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   If it takes a village, then there's a village waiting in
cyberspace to help people kick smoking, even if for only one day,
during the American Cancer Society's Great American Smokeout on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Health Channel at www.ivillage.com will host a
special 24-hour Kick Butt Marathon to encourage smokers to quit,
beginning at midnight Thursday. ``Smoke-free'' chat rooms are
available all day for nonsmoking breaks. Chats will focus on such
subjects as ``Getting Over the Morning Craving.''
</P>
<P>
   FREE VIDEO ON ALLERGIES
</P>
<P>
   Everything you ever wanted to know about your child's sneezing,
sniffling and watery eyes is available on a new video available in
the free rental section of 4,400 Blockbuster Video stores
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatric allergist Susan Wynn, of Fort Worth Allergy and Asthma
Associates, stars in the video, ``Children and Allergy: Recognizing
and Treating Childhood Allergies,'' financed through a grant from
Schering Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The video is designed to help parents differentiate between the
similar symptoms of colds and allergies, and it explains the kinds
of medical help available, Wynn says.
</P>
<P>
   She estimates that 2 million school days are lost each year as a
result of children's allergies.

ANALYSIS: LIVENT'S BANKRUPTCY PRODS BROADWAY TO RETHINK THE RULES

 (bl)  
 By ROBIN POGREBIN and JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given Livent Inc.'s financial predicament, filing for
bankruptcy protection _ a step taken Wednesday after much agonizing
_ may in some ways be the best thing that could have happened to
it.
</P>
<P>
   With a mountain of debt, its stock frozen and shareholders
clamoring for redress, Chapter 11 reorganization buys the troubled
company behind the musical ``Ragtime'' breathing space to try to
get its house in order and keep its creditors at bay.
</P>
<P>
   And although the Toronto-based Livent canceled the remainder of
the ``Ragtime'' road tour Wednesday, it appears that its new
works-in-progress have enough money to proceed as planned. These
include ``Parade,'' a new musical jointly produced by Lincoln
Center Theater that is now in previews and ``Fosse: A Celebration
in Song and Dance,'' due to open on Broadway in January.
</P>
<P>
   But Livent's raising of the financial white flag also
underscores larger questions about the future viability of a
company that helped define the outer reaches of theater
extravagance and about whether there are cautionary lessons for the
rest of Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Did Livent go too far in trying to promote shows like
``Ragtime'' and ``Showboat'' and quickly clone road companies
around the country? Should the fall of Garth Drabinsky, Livent's
former creative director, serve as an object lesson in the pitfalls
of lavish producing? Or are Livent's travails simply the result of
one renegade impresario run amok?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was a special case,'' said Jujamcyn Theaters
president Rocco Landesman. ``Garth lived on Fantasy Island all
those years and still does. I don't think he was ever realistic
about how he was going to recover expenditures he made. Too much
was not enough, that was the motto.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most Broadway producers say they saw this coming, that
with running frequent expensive full-page ads in The New York Times
and the costly refurbishing of the Ford Center for the Performing
Arts, Livent was clearly heading for a fall. But they also say
Drabinsky deserves credit for trying to redefine Broadway, for
attempting a new financial construct _ raising capital internally
as a public company rather than tapping individual investors _ and
for creating fireworks in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garth has contributed excitement, and flamboyant showmanship,
and true detail to the creative process,'' said veteran Broadway
producer Alexander H. Cohen. ``It is unfortunate, however, that he
didn't seem to have a close enough eye to the costs.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just that Drabinsky spent too much, producers say, it's
that he tried a different model of fund-raising that was ultimately
flawed. In what he called ``vertical integration,'' Drabinsky
wanted to bring all the producing functions inside the company,
including investment. But because theater has historically been a
risky investment at best, the strategy proved misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 15 and 20 percent of shows recoup their investment, so
why would you want to set up a structure where you did 100 percent
of investing in your own shows?'' Landesman said. ``Producers for
50 years have known better. That's why they go out and raise money.
The model was illogical.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Gersten, the executive producer of Lincoln Center
Theater, which is splitting the cost of the $5.2 million ``Parade''
_ now in previews _ with Livent, said Drabinsky's approach could
not be so easily dismissed. ``He changed the rules in an
interesting way,'' Gersten said. ``He did it the way auto companies
do, he raised capital and he put on shows. The problem is, it was
predicated upon on an unreasonable requirement that you produce
hits in the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Livent's current projects seem protected. Gersten said
the company had met all of its obligations on ``Parade'' except
paying a reserve against possible losses during previews, which is
due Nov. 30. ``I expect that payment will be made in a timely
fashion,'' Gersten said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fosse'' is currently being performed in Los Angeles and is due
to begin previews in New York next month.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Livent held a workshop in Manhattan of ``Sweet Smell of
Success,'' a new musical with music by Marvin Hamlisch and a book
by John Guare. And ``Ragtime'' led Broadway grosses last week, with
reported sales of $848,825, according to Variety.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people in the theater expressed confidence in the
company's new management _ namely Michael Ovitz, the former
president of Walt Disney Co. who controls Livent's board, and Roy
Furman, the chairman and chief executive _ even though the officers
failed to identify financial irregularities when they took over the
company last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they'll come out of this with great success,'' said
David Richenthal, a producer who said he has discussed the
possibility of future projects with Furman and Livent's artistic
director, Todd Haimes. ``They both have great theater judgment and
great business judgment and they have enormous credibility in the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, some producers said, seeking Chapter 11 protection
was long overdue. ``The only mistake Furman and Ovitz made was not
doing this sooner,'' Landesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not `The Producers' with Mel Brooks,'' added Cohen.
``This seems to me to be a time for the company to emerge stronger.
I think they'll be able to attract new investors through the
offices of Mr. Furman and Mr. Ovitz, who are plenty experienced in
raising money. I am totally unconcerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, questions remain, particularly given that Livent
has at this point canceled the last two cities on its ``Ragtime''
tour _ Boston and Seattle _ although the cast and crew will finish
the run in Minneapolis. Will Livent continue to support its Chicago
company of ``Ragtime,'' its touring company of ``Showboat'' and its
Toronto production of ``Phantom of the Opera''? The company
recently dropped plans to develop the historic Times Square Theater
on 42nd Street and canceled plans for a new 1,400-seat theater in
downtown Toronto. And its Ford Centers in Toronto and Vancouver are
reportedly struggling to attract audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ovitz and his team ultimately determine that Livent is not
worth saving and simply decide to sell? What will be the result of
investigations by securities regulators in the United States and
Canada, where the company is based, into the company's books? Or
the outcome of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's criminal
investigation?
</P>
<P>
   Livent's stock has not traded on exchanges in the United States
or Canada since Aug. 10, when the company announced that it had
discovered millions of dollars in accounting errors and suspended
Drabinsky, along with the company's co-founder, Myron Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Livent dismissed Drabinsky and Gottlieb as employees
and asked for their resignations as directors. Both men refused to
resign. Livent also filed a lawsuit against them alleging breach of
contract and fraud among other things. The lawsuit, filed in
Toronto, seeks $64.5 million from each man, $9.6 million from a
company Gottlieb controlled and $6.4 million in punitive damages
from the two men and that company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Drabinsky and Gottlieb, who have denied any
wrongdoing, are back in an an office in Toronto about two blocks
from Livent's headquarters under MyGar Partnership, their former
corporate name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some suggest that Broadway may not have seen the end of
Drabinsky, or at least that his impact will be lasting. ``He may
have been ahead of his time,'' Gersten said. ``And maybe what he
set out to do will be accomplished at a later moment by someone
else who will be more thoughtful and more careful.''

`THE MISER': MOLIERE COMEDY IS STILL UP TO THE MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A dinner party at Harpagon's house probably wouldn't
be a good time. Preparing for such a gathering in Act II of ``The
Miser,'' he instructs one servant to pour the wine ``but only when
people are thirsty'' _ that is, when ``they have asked several
times.'' And, he adds, put water in it. As for the food: ``Prepare
for eight,'' he tells the cook, ``and there's always plenty for
10.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpagon, after all, is a man who whispers sweet nothings to the
cash box he keeps hidden in the garden and is eager to marry his
daughter off to the first man who says he'll take her without a
dowry. Never mind that the man is twice her age and that she's
secretly in love with one of the servants, who is secretly a member
of Neapolitan nobility. Of course, Harpagon's biggest problem is
that he and his son want to marry the same young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Many Moliere admirers consider ``The Miser'' one of his lesser
works _ or at least a particularly odd one, since the title
character is undeniably pathological. But for those of us willing
to consider the possibility of dark farce, the production is a
delight, and the Pearl Theater Company shows off all the comedy's
best features.
</P>
<P>
   For a play that had its premiere in 1668, ``The Miser'' contains
a lot of up-to-date observations. Harpagon (Robert Hock,
appropriately appalling) comments on the credentials of guests:
``The world is full of self-styled nobility these days.'' Elise
(Patricia Dalen), the beautiful daughter, is skeptical about her
suitor's vows: ``Men are all alike in their promises,'' she says,
and differ only in their deeds. That suitor, Valere (Bo Foxworth),
assures her that he knows how to handle characters like her father.
``Pretend to agree with them,'' he explains. ``The most cunning of
men are most easily deceived.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleante (Christopher Moore), the foppish son, doesn't comment so
much on human behavior, but he makes a spectacular entrance wearing
bright blue and mustard yellow and shoulder-length golden curls. He
is carrying two hatboxes (one yellow, one blue) and what appears to
be a garment bag (lavender). He, like many of the characters,
virtually prances across the stage. There is plenty to prance
about: borrowing and lending, stealing and returning, disinheriting
and cursing. There are even reunions of long-lost family members.
</P>
<P>
   Murell Horton's off-kilter, attic-clutter set is clever, and his
costumes are vivid and attractive. It is an interesting choice,
though, amid a stageful of 17th-century styles, to have some
characters dressed out of period.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Frosine (Robin Leslie Brown), the matchmaker,
wearing ostrich feathers and a short black lace skirt, might have
wandered in from the Weimar Republic. And the gown worn by Marianne
(Lauren Stamile) could have come from a Neiman Marcus catalog. But
Ms. Stamile, who is making her New York acting debut, is such a
vision of brainless loveliness that it really doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miser,'' ebulliently directed by David Schechter continues
through Dec. 6.

   BIG BENEFITS IN OATS, NUTS
</P>
<P>
   Oats and nuts can help prevent heart disease, according to
studies presented last week at the American Heart Association's
71st Scientific Sessions in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Eating a low-calorie diet rich in oats significantly reduces
blood pressure and cholesterol, researchers from Tufts University
reported. The benefits of oats are attributed to its soluble fiber,
the type of dietary fiber that dissolves in water.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha-linolenic acid, a nutrient found in nuts, as well as in
unhydrogenated canola and soybean oils, flaxseed and flaxseed oil,
is credited with protecting the heart. Nuts help prevent a rhythm
disturbance called ventricular fibrillation that causes sudden
death, researchers from Harvard University reported.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKE-FREE ON THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   If it takes a village, then there's a village waiting in
cyberspace to help people kick smoking, even if for only one day,
during the American Cancer Society's Great American Smokeout on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Better Health Channel at www.ivillage.com will host a
special 24-hour Kick Butt Marathon to encourage smokers to quit,
beginning at midnight Thursday. ``Smoke-free'' chat rooms are
available all day for nonsmoking breaks. Chats will focus on such
subjects as ``Getting Over the Morning Craving.''
</P>
<P>
   FREE VIDEO ON ALLERGIES
</P>
<P>
   Everything you ever wanted to know about your child's sneezing,
sniffling and watery eyes is available on a new video available in
the free rental section of 4,400 Blockbuster Video stores
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Pediatric allergist Susan Wynn, of Fort Worth Allergy and Asthma
Associates, stars in the video, ``Children and Allergy: Recognizing
and Treating Childhood Allergies,'' financed through a grant from
Schering Laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The video is designed to help parents differentiate between the
similar symptoms of colds and allergies, and it explains the kinds
of medical help available, Wynn says.
</P>
<P>
   She estimates that 2 million school days are lost each year as a
result of children's allergies.

`THE SHOEMAKER'S PRODIGIOUS WIFE': UNEXPECTED LAUGHTER FROM GARCIA
LORCA 
</HEADLINE>
   (rl)  
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWE YORK _ Max Ferra, the artistic director of Intar Hispanic
American Arts Center, pays a nice tribute to Federico Garcia Lorca
by including his 1929 farce, ``The Shoemaker's Prodigious Wife,''
on a bill of three works marking the playwright's centenary. Its 90
minutes of laughter is unexpected from a man usually associated
with tragedy onstage and in life.
</P>
<P>
   A shoemaker (Bill Torres), who is 53, marries an 18-year-old
woman (Denise Casano), to the delight of the town gossips, whom she
enjoys answering with hilarious public scorn. She also delights in
taunting her husband with tales of the young suitors she could have
married, and that's her undoing. He walks out, and she is reduced
to turning his shoeshop into a bar to make a living. Local
lotharios fill the place, but she fends them off, protesting she
loves only the missing shoemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she pours out her heart to an itinerant puppeteer who,
overcome by her fidelity, reveals himself as her husband in
disguise. That does it. After a moment of ecstasy, she's back to
her old self, denouncing him to the town as ``crook, scoundrel,
this riffraff.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferra's direction makes this little comedy as fresh and
lingering as a tart sorbet, and the production team gives it a
bright fairy-tale appearance _ especially Katherine B. Roth, the
costume designer, and Ralph Lee, the puppeteer and mask maker. For
a mischievously talkative child, they have created a mask and
costume that turn an adult actor (Doris DiFarnecio) into an
improbably small puppet.
</P>
<P>
   And they've transformed the townsmen lusting after the wife into
animals: the ridiculously hopeful old  &UR; m &LR; ayor (Carlos Rafart)
barely conceals a wolf's gray tail under his frock coat; a young
Mirlo (Oscar de la Fe Colon) sprouts a few crow feathers from under
his collar and his nose is beaky; two small horns peak out from the
hair of another youth (Carlos Orizondo), who thinks he's
irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   By herself, Miriam Cruz, called the Woman in Red, could make up
a town full of snoopy gossips, but she gets help from a pair of
garish life-size puppets and from Colon and Orizondo in the guise
of scandal-mongering, and much scandalized, women. The delight the
whole cast takes in this concoction of sophisticated silliness is a
needed reminder that Garcia Lorca, who knew how to reveal appalling
darkness in the soul, was known to his friends as a young man with
a singular passion for laughter.

EXPANDING SPAIN'S TREASURE CHEST, THE PRADO MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 BY AL GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ The government finally unveiled the winning
design for the most controversial part of the long-delayed
expansion of the Prado Museum, but on the day of the announcement
last week, the winner, Rafael Moneo, was out of town.
</P>
<P>
   He was in New York to present his addition for the Museum of
Fine Arts in Houston, one of his big U.S. projects, which also
include the $100 million Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral under
construction in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Moneo, 61, is arguably Spain's best-known architect, and now he
must enlarge Spain's most famous museum, a treasure chest of art
plagued by years of official indecision over modernization. He says
he and the museum are a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have visited the Prado since I was a child and know well its
problems, so for me it's a great source of satisfaction and
responsibility,'' he said on a recent one-day stopover in Madrid
before flying to Rome to receive an award. ``I'd like to put my
architectural experience at the service of this project.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prado's project, after two decades of debate, is more modest
than earlier drafts. But it still aims to expand the 179-year-old
museum from two buildings to five in the next several years, in
hopes of better showcasing its unparalleled collection of
Velazquez, Goya, El Greco, Rubens and Hieronymus Bosch. It will
also allow the museum to display &UR;  &LR; hundreds of paintings now in
storage.
</P>
<P>
   After a revolving-door succession of museum directors, the
parliament promised in 1995 to remove politics from the state-run
Prado and to start by fixing the leaky roof of the neo-classical
rectangular main building. It was designed by Juan de Villanueva
and has been used since the museum opened in 1819.
</P>
<P>
   The $14 million roof work has forced the 1656 Velazquez
masterpiece ``Las Meninas,'' a star attraction at the Prado, to
change galleries twice. But in the process, new space was created
on the remote third floor to exhibit 18th-century European art.
</P>
<P>
   Moneo will guide the expansion's most closely scrutinized phase,
to cost at least $25 million. In the first major addition in
decades to the main building, he will add, along the red-brick rear
facade, a glass-roofed foyer that will contain the museum's shops
and cafeteria, removing them from the main building to make more
room for galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The wedge-shaped foyer, in turn, will connect the main building
to Moneo's planned Prado addition on the street behind, up a gentle
slope. That new structure, with two underground levels topped by a
four-story cube of red brick, will house temporary exhibitions, the
library and the restoration workshops.
</P>
<P>
   The addition will incorporate the stone ruins of the
17th-century cloisters that Spanish royalty once used as a
spiritual retreat. The Roman Catholic Church ceded the cloisters to
the museum, but the adjacent Jeronimos Church will stay open for
worship and for royal ceremonies and society weddings.
</P>
<P>
   The architectural competition's jury lauded Moneo's plan as
``discreet and controlled'' in linking the main building to the
cloisters in the aristocratic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Moneo has designed half a dozen other museums, including the
rehabilitation in Madrid of the Villahermosa Palace for the
Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, a spacious building the Prado once
coveted for its own expansion. He beat eight other competitors in
the contest run by the conservative government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like him, they were finalists in the international design
contest for the Prado started by the former Socialist government.
Despite 480 entries, the jury declared there was no winner. After
that, the once-grandiose plans were scaled back, and the Prado
board later set new expansion guidelines, which some architects
complained were too restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   But not Moneo. In 1996 he defended his ``ambitious'' plan that
included an elevated glass walkway for the Prado expansion. But
this time he said he found liberty within the rigorous rules, and
he designed ``something more realistic.'' He must submit his final
plans in the coming months; construction could take a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Angel Cortes, the secretary of state for culture, who
oversees the Prado, said the museum had entered ``a stable
horizon,'' even as the other work continues that does not involve
Moneo. In July, for instance, the Prado annex in the nearby
17th-century Cason del Buen Retiro was closed for a $10 million
two-year overhaul that will include three new underground levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Cason has displayed the 19th-century collection and, until
1992, Picasso's ``Guernica,'' which the Prado lost to the
20th-century collection of the Queen Sofia Art Center.
</P>
<P>
   The final part of the Prado's expansion program involves the
neighboring Palacio del Buen Retiro, home to the Army Museum. When
all the projects are complete, the Prado wants at least 2,600 of
its most valuable 4,500 paintings to be on permanent display, up
from just 1,200 on view now. The Prado also has nearly 1,000
sculptures among its collection of 20,000 artworks, including
sketches and decorative arts or paintings on loan to Spanish
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Moneo said his focus was to move auxiliary services out of the
original Villanueva building, making it the centerpiece for the
permanent collection, which last year had 1.7 million visitors,
down from the 2 million several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prado is the Villanueva building,'' Moneo said. ``I don't
want to lose that.''

TRIAL AND ERROR

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Talk about legal briefs.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Perry Mason and Della Street's day, you wouldn't see
legal eaglets like Ally McBeal arguing a case in a short skirt and
sandals.
</P>
<P>
   No way. But then ``Perry Mason'' was a TV drama, and ``Ally
McBeal'' is, after all, a comedy about a ditsy girl who wears
miniskirts by day and sheep-print pajamas by night.
</P>
<P>
   As unrealistic as the hit show may be, Fox's ``Ally McBeal'' has
started a major fashion trend among young women that's got the
legal community buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Karen Newlove, the marketing director of O'Melveny
&AMP; Myers, the oldest law practice in Los Angeles, ``It's a favorite
program around here, and it's sort of frightening, since we're a
very conservative firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Burbank's Senior Assistant City Attorney Carolyn Barnes works in
the more liberal public sector, and she also holds ``Ally McBeal''
in contempt of court. Says Barnes, ``We wear contemporary styles
with short skirts _ but not that short.''
</P>
<P>
   Even younger members of firms _ such as the Woodland Hills-based
civil law firm of Bollington, Stilz, Bloesser &AMP; Curry, which has a
reputation for its attractive female attorneys _ stop short of
short skirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally is a very modern look that's being copied by law students
... but I find it silly,'' says the firm's Wendy LaBarge, who has
been practicing law for nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-worker Laura Russo, with only three years under her belt,
agrees. ``No attorney in her right mind would wear a skirt shorter
than 4 inches above the knee. I don't care how good your legs
look,'' she comments.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how she thought a client would react to an attorney in the
``Ally McBeal'' uniform, Russo laughs. ``A male client would
certainly look at her but not take her seriously. And a woman
client would be catty. Neither would be able to focus on what the
attorney could do for them,'' she adds.
</P>
<P>
   While LaBarge and Russo's office has no carved-in-stone rules
about appropriate attire, O'Melveny &AMP; Myers does.
</P>
<P>
   The company has an employee manual that prohibits such casual
Friday favorites as khaki pants and a sweater or sport coat, denim
clothing, open-toed shoes and sneakers, and long hair or earrings
on men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an attorney is a conservative endeavor. You are going to
get a client out from under a problem from hell, and that client
wants a person who can dress themselves accordingly to do it,''
says Newlove.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly? O'Melveny &AMP; Myers has 650 attorneys who handle all
kinds of cases, so the dress code will vary. According to Newlove,
a bank attorney might wear a blue shirt with white collar and cuffs
under a dark blue suit, while an entertainment or fashion industry
attorney might wear a dark shirt and tie with the latest Italian
suit or even dare to wear red. And senior litigators with a lot of
confidence often wear gray pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   Russo and LaBarge are still rookies, but they love pinstripes.
Says Russo, ``It was the first item I bought, because I think it's
such a serious business look.''
</P>
<P>
   Both women have accumulated several pinstriped suits in their
wardrobes, but they still pull out a navy number for closing
arguments. ``Navy is both serious and sincere,'' explains Russo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why it's also a favorite choice for job
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   For more ideas on winning looks, both attorneys watch ABC's
``The Practice.'' Although the prime-time program features numerous
attorneys, they both focus on actress Lara Flynn Boyle, commenting
that her dark sweater worn under a suit jacket, the Coach handbag
and single strand of pearls are great looks. ``Unlike some jewelry,
pearls personify sincerity,'' LaBarge says.
</P>
<P>
   Their amusement over ``Ally McBeal'' and their respect for ``The
Practice'' is no surprise to Loree Parral, since she's the costumer
who set the fashion pace for both TV series, which were created by
David E. Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   In defense of ``Ally McBeal,'' Parral says, ``We tried to make a
young lawyer look a little different with shorter skirts. She
(Calista Flockhart) has great legs, so it worked well and looked
cute, especially with a longer jacket. For me, it was the epitome
of the Ally wardrobe, but it wasn't meant to be a reality-based
look like ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, ``Ally'' has a new costumer, Rachel Stanley, who
says the star will be wearing more colorful suits in hues such as
lavender and green, but she'll continue to show plenty of thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Parral works to keep the ``The Practice'' fashions
fresh but courtroom-savvy. To do both, Parral says she observes a
lot of real-life courtroom dramas and then creates a color palette
for the show. ``In real life, you might have both attorneys showing
up in navy blue, but on television you've got to have variety, so
this season it's a dark, cool, serious palette with different
shades and styles used to define each character,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Lara Flynn Boyle, who plays a deputy district
attorney with sophisticated taste but little money, wears all tones
of gray, sometimes accented with black.
</P>
<P>
   Another high-profile member of ``The Practice'' has pushed the
envelope much like ``Ally McBeal'' and the jury is still out. Only
this time the subject is pantsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, women don't go to court in pantsuits, but
Eleanor, the character played by Camryn Manheim, is a rebel ... and
no one questions her authority in pants,'' says Parral.
</P>
<P>
   Although LaBarge, Russo and Barnes say they'd never wear pants
to court, Parral has been known to set major fashion trends among
attorneys. Remember that surplice (wrap-front) blouse worn by Susan
Dey in ``Law and Order''?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea it would become so popular. We just wanted the
character to look strong and sexy ... and be able to hammer a
strong point in the courtroom ... and that blouse worked,'' Parral
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   The right skirt and blouse, the perfect pumps and the designer
haircut all help, but even on TV it doesn't always win the case.
</P>
<P>

THE ARTLESS ART OF PAINTING WITH NO-MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (fb)  
 (Kay Larson, an art critic, has practiced Zen for several years.)  
 By KAY LARSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember ``Zen and the Art of Archery''? At the peak moment of
this perennially popular book by the German philosopher Eugen
Herrigel, the Zen archer hits the bull's-eye, although he shoots
the arrow in total darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melodramatic'' is how the composer John Cage assessed this
story, and he offered another. A Japanese friend, he said, told him
of a highly esteemed archer who had never hit the bull's-eye even
in broad daylight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   West subtly meets East in these two anecdotes. In the German
view, success is the goal and the arts are supporting players to
the ego's yearning for mastery. In Zen, success is considered a
figment of the ego. Ultimately nothing is gained, so the goal
disappears. There is only the moment, which calls the master
archer's whole being into play. If you're truly one with the
target, why bother to release the arrow? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Art of 20th-Century Zen,'' an exhibition at the Japan
Society, gives a personal face to these issues by focusing on 14
contemporary Japanese Zen masters who are also master
calligrapher-painters. The curator, Audrey Yoshiko Seo of the
College of William and Mary in Virginia, has enlisted the help of
the Asian scholar Stephen Addiss. In fact, it was Mr. Addiss's 1989
exhibition, ``The Art of Zen,'' covering the period 1600 to 1925,
that gave Seo the idea. Addiss had invited Keido Fukushima, abbot
of Tofuku-ji monastery in Kyoto and a noted calligrapher, to come
to the Spencer Museum at the University of Kansas to give a brush
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing an actual Zen master do brushwork was very inspiring,
because you're seeing it as an actual practice,'' Seo says. Her
show, which will be on view through Jan. 10 and will then travel to
three other museums, begins with the turn-of-the-century reformer
Nantenbo Nakahara, who died in 1925. It ends with Fukushima. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although calligraphy is part of a Zen master's bag of skills _
Fukushima receives more than 3,000 requests a year for his
brushwork _ some masters are particularly adept at it. Among them
was his teacher, Zenkei Shibayama, a friend of D.T. Suzuki, the
scholar and pioneer of Zen in the West. (The two older men
collaborated on a graceful painting here, centered on the word myo,
meaning wondrous.) In 1964, Suzuki persuaded Shibayama to leave his
monastery, Nanzen-ji, to lecture in the United States, a mission
his successor has inherited. Fukushima now tours America once a
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zen came to the West mostly by way of scholars and popularizers
like Suzuki and Alan Watts, who infused it with a philosophical
bent that has been hard to shake. In Japan, Seo says, Zen is not a
philosophy but a monastic practice, which culminates in the
transmission ceremony in which teacher acknowledges disciple. (The
catalogue doubles as an excellent summary of these vivid masters
and their daunting training.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On one recent American tour, Fukushima gave a dramatic
calligraphy demonstration at Columbia University in New York.
Sitting on the floor, accompanied by an alert young assistant, he
chatted freely with the audience. Suddenly he stopped talking. He
meditated for a few moments, seeming to reach deep within himself.
Then he picked up a thick, chunky brush and paused. Strike! The
deed was done: a dense black circle. He gave it away. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a Zen-master-to-be, the struggle to let go of the self is
relentless. Decades of rigorous training _ rising well before dawn,
meditating motionless for hours, laboring in the monastery, facing
the teacher _ are summed up in the phrase ``A dragon gives birth to
another dragon.'' The ceaseless process of emptying oneself of
conceptual and emotional baggage raises one's awareness of one's
``dragon nature.'' The new Zen master joins the lineage of those
who act out of mu-shin _ literally ``no-mind,'' but also
``enlightened mind'' _ the same mind with which they will paint,
sit, pour tea and teach.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zen brush is wielded by everything you are, and most
particularly the zero point where ``you'' are not. Nonstriving is
true realization, Addiss writes. He quotes Dogen Zenji, the
13th-century founder of one of the two major branches of Zen: ``To
study the Way is to study the self. To study the self is to forget
the self. To forget the self is to be enlightened by all things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The momentous complexities of being truly simple are apparent in
Fukushima's painting ``Mountain Is Mountain.'' The three characters
of the title materialize in thick black ink strokes. The repeated
character ``mountain'' includes streaks of ``flying white,'' the
spots where the brush moved so fast it left bare paper. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The word mountain has special significance in Zen. It refers to
the world of form _ the phenomena of daily life. It is also a
favorite synonym for a Zen master, who sits like a mountain amid
worldly tumult. And it signifies the dharma, or cosmic order,
itself _ that which moves mountains. ``The Zen master is the world
is the dharma,'' in a phrase. But the two characters for
``mountain,'' deliberately differ from each other. All is One, yet
each thing is also purely itself. One dragon is not another. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in truth, each master has his own style. (The lone female
abbot in the show, Kendo Kojima, a fighter for the rights of women
in Japanese Zen, is pointedly a token figure.) Humor and
lighthearted play are as common as ferocity. Stories from the Zen
lore naturally abound. One frequently painted figure is Bodhidharma
_ Daruma, in Japanese _ the first patriarch of Zen, who is said to
have brought Buddhism from India to China in the sixth century A.D.
The master Gentatsu Yuzen _ who presided over a small rural temple
during a period when Buddhism was being persecuted in the mid-19th
century and nearly obliterated by the state-supported advocates of
the Shinto religion _ painted Daruma as a wistful, brooding,
mournful Kojak look-alike. His successor, Mokurai Takeda, in a more
buoyant era, indicated Daruma's strong shoulders with a single
heavy ink stroke, into which the patriarch's pale, bald head seems
to sink like a stone, presumably from the weight of his nine years
of unbroken zazen (meditation) before a wall in a Shaolin temple in
China. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even when appearing realistic, Zen calligraphy verges on the
not-there. The nearly blind Zen master Gempo Sohan created a ``One
Stroke Daruma'': The master meditator is sketched in a dashingly
bare line that coils back on itself like a snail shell. Lacking
head or limbs, Daruma has become nothing but his robe. After so
many years facing the wall, ``he'' is no longer there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the Zen brush, Yuzen wrote, ``To make a painting
requires a lot of zazen.'' The same spirit helps in appreciating
it. Knowing the meaning of characters is not really necessary.
Intellectual understanding is not important in Zen. It may even get
you whacked with the kyosaku (the training stick). It is better,
perhaps, to recall a poem addressed to Zen archers:
</P>
<P>
   The enemy is yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The target is your own ego.
</P>
<P>
   One shot. One life.
</P>
<P>
   Self-centered people will never hit the mark.
</P>
<P>
   The spirit of the Zen brush involves embracing contradiction:
just the pure intensity of being ``mountain'' and immovable, yet
moving lightly _ and as fiercely as lightning.

SOLVING ALL YOUR PRR-OBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've tried the patch. You've tried hypnosis. Maybe you've even
tried chewing that dreadful nicotine gum.
</P>
<P>
   None of it worked, did it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, here's the latest, sure-fire way to beat the smoking
habit: Pet sounds.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the Beach Boys album; I'm talking about the actual
sounds that pets make.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs barking. Cats purring. Birds tweeting. Fish ... well, I'm
not sure what sound fish make, but you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that pet ownership can help lower blood
pressure, fight depression and just generally reduce stress. And
since few things are more stressful than quitting smoking, the
American Pet Products Manufacturers Association came up with the
idea of using pet sounds to help people kick the filthy habit.
</P>
<P>
   To participate in the ``Pets Can Help You Quit Smoking
Program,'' you send in a pack of your favorite coffin nails and
receive, in return, a free Pet Starter Kit that consists of a
4-minute audio cassette tape filled with ``soothing and relaxing
pet sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   The thinking here, apparently, is that the nightmarish symptoms
of nicotine withdrawal will be alleviated by the steady yapping of
a Shih Tzu or the yowling of a Siamese. If the APPMA is lucky, the
cassette tapes will de-stress you to the point that you decide to
acquire a pet of your very own, preferably one with a taste for the
bowls, leashes, food and other pet paraphernalia endorsed by APPMA.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pet Starter Kit is more than a marketing gimmick. (Not a
lot more, admittedly, but somewhat more.) It is the first time, to
my knowledge, that pets have ventured into the lucrative field of
alternative medicine. Forget about valerian, ginseng and St. John's
wort; if you want to achieve ``wellness,'' simply slip on a pair of
headphones and listen to the soothing sounds of a $150 tropical
fish floating belly-up to the surface of its aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, the term ``dog and cat clinic'' may take on a
whole new meaning. Instead of taking your pet in for medical
treatment, you receive medical treatment from your pet. I wouldn't
be surprised if scientists and/or marketers soon discover that
pets' therapeutic powers extend far beyond a simple ``bow-wow'' or
``meow.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, we may come to realize that dogs that dig holes in
your back yard deep enough to bury the Starr Report are good for
dry skin and congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Cats that drop the head of a squirrel on your lap with the same
pride a fisherman might display a trophy bass may serve as a remedy
for baldness, toenail fungus and hemorrhoids.
</P>
<P>
   Giant pet iguanas that leap on your neck and sink their claws
into your carotid may cure drowsiness, depression and feelings of
low self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   We already know that pets can help improve your circulation,
such as when you chase your dog around the living room trying to
retrieve your slipper, and also help reduce your cholesterol, such
as when your cat eats your lasagna while you're busy talking on the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   If they can help you quit smoking, too, that would be an added
bonus.

   ANATOMY OF A CRASH
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529 was only a little
propeller-driven plane that fell in an obscure hayfield in west
Georgia: 10 people died, 19 survived.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of lives lost, certainly it was not on scale with TWA
Flight 800 and Swissair Flight 111. More than 200 people died in
each of those crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ASA crash is writ large across many lives. Nearly
two-thirds of the people aboard survived _ a miracle gift _ and so
this crash is not only about death, but life.
</P>
<P>
   For nine months, award-winning Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter Gary M. Pomerantz trekked thousands of miles _ from
Georgia to Maine to Texas to Alaska _ to track down and interview
survivors of ASA Flight 529. He also canvassed investigative files
of the National Transportation Safety Board and testimony taken
during the ensuing litigation.

   Pomerantz vivdly describes the 9 minutes and 20 seconds of
horror aboard that doomed aircraft as it fell to earth, the fire
that consumed the broken fuselage, as well as how the tragedy has
reshaped lives.

   DAY 5

   CRASH-ATTENDANT _ Robin Fech had tried once to get back into an

jump seat near the door.
</P>

   She kept that door open _ and left through it when fear overcame

   Her psychotherapist's plan was to slowly desensitize Fech to an
airplane so she could fly again. First she did nothing more than
park at the Macon airport to watch planes take off and land. Next
she walked into the terminal. The first time she moved onto the
tarmac, she cried.
</P>
<P>
   It was so unlike the person she had been, so full of sass and
moxie that she once explained her nature with the laugh line, ``I
don't get my panties in a wad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now each step toward recovery revived the terror. She couldn't
so much as use a curling iron without being reminded of the smell
of fire.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a month passed before Fech could step into an empty
Brasilia identical to the crash plane and stay awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, she did a necessary thing. She sat in each of the 30
seats. Closing her eyes, she tried to become the passengers who
fell from the sky with her.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to know what they had felt in the last nine minutes
and 20 seconds of Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529.

CULTURE NOTES: SPOLETO FESTIVAL USA; GLIMMERGLASS OPERA PREMIERE;
MORE THAN A MUSE TO PICASSO; CAROL BURNETT TROVE TO UCLA; AMERICAN
ACADEMY OF ARTS AND LETTERS CENTENARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., S.C.)  (js) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Winter hasn't arrived yet, but in Charleston, S.C., spring _ in
the form of the Spoleto Festival USA _ is just around the corner.
Nigel Redden, the general director of the 23rd festival, from May
28 to June 13, is already announcing its highlights, including the
opening attraction, ``Il Trittico,'' Puccini's triple bill of
one-act operas. The first weekend will also bring the U.S. premiere
of Kurt Weill's opera ``Die Burgschaft,'' and the festival has
commissioned a new work by the performance artist Laurie Anderson.

   Where can you find ``Central Park'' (note those quotation marks)
next summer? Try Cooperstown, N.Y., where the Glimmerglass Opera
will offer the world premiere of a work of that title. Consisting
of three one-act operas unified by their setting, it opens July 24.
The librettos are by the playwrights Terrence McNally, Wendy
Wasserstein and A.R. Gurney, and the scores are by Robert Beaser,
Deborah Drattell and Michael Torke. The production, directed by
Mark Lamos, is headed for the New York City Opera in the 1999-2000
season. The Glimmerglass season opens on July 1 with a new staging
of Mozart's ``Abduction From the Seraglio,'' followed by a new
production of Verdi's ``Rigoletto'' and Monteverdi's rarely staged
``Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria.''

   More Maar
</P>
<P>
   Before Dora Maar became model and muse for Pablo Picasso after
their meeting in 1936, she was an established photographer and an
acknowledged member of the Surrealist movement. In Paris on Friday,
Dora Maar's photographs will be auctioned at Drouot-Montaigne. Next
Thursday, her paintings will be sold at an auction called
``L''Atelier de Dora Maar.''

<P>
   Gift of Laughter
</P>
<P>
   Carol Burnett has donated 145 videotapes to UCLA containing some
290 episodes of ``The Carol Burnett Show,'' which was broadcast on
CBS from 1967 to 1978 and won 25 Emmy Awards. She also donated
scripts and music from the show and other Burnett vehicles, like
the musical ``Once Upon a Mattress.''

   NEW YORK _ In an exhibition beginning Thursday, the American
Academy of Arts and Letters will celebrate its 100-year history and
its collection. On view in the show, ``A Century of Arts and
Letters: The Centennial Exhibition of the American Academy of Arts
and Letters,'' are a Mark Twain manuscript; correspondence from
Tennessee Williams and Dorothy Parker; paintings by Childe Hassam
and William Merritt Chase; and letters to the academy from Thomas
Eakins, e.e. cummings and Gore Vidal rejecting election to
membership. The exhibition at the academy, on Audubon Terrace at
633 W. 155th St., continues through Dec. 13.

ONE AMERICAN EXPATRIATE PLAYS ANOTHER: GAYLE HUNNICUTT AS EDITH
WHARTON
</HEADLINE>

By PERRY STEWART 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Edith Wharton was little more than a name in
an American Lit textbook to Gayle Hunnicutt when the latter was a
Kappa Kappa Gamma at Texas Christian University during the
mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton, who lived from 1862 to 1937, was an American who
resided mostly in Europe while writing incisive novels about the
Manhattan upper class she was born into. Hunnicutt, Fort
Worth-born, left TCU for UCLA and Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   At UCLA, Hunnicutt was coached and encouraged by legendary
director Jean Renoir _ who may or may not have counseled her to
mask her natural warmth with patrician aloofness. In any case,
Hunnicutt adopted that device in some film portrayals, and it
served her well. Her initial Hollywood phase (1968-73) paired the
Texas newcomer with such stars as George Peppard (''P.J.''), James
Garner (''Marlowe'') and Michael Sarrazin (''Eye of the Cat'').
</P>
<P>
   A move to London in 1969, with then-husband David Hemmings,
slowed her Hollywood output, but the 1980s found Hunnicutt in at
least one memorable big-screen opus: ``Target,'' in which director
Arthur Penn cast her as the abducted wife of Gene Hackman and
mother of Matt Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   SUNRISE, SUNSET: Gayle Hunnicutt is back on campus portraying
Edith Wharton in a sagacious and witty play titled ``The Life and
Loves of Edith Wharton.'' It was performed at TCU on Nov. 15 at 8
p.m. as part of a regional conference.
</P>
<P>
   The show will travel to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New
York Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of the play is Wharton's friendship with author
Henry James, also an American who spent the bulk of his creative
life abroad. Portraying James and other men (and women) in
Wharton's life is English actor Frank Barrie, an alumnus of the
Bristol Old Vic and of the National Theatre under the artistic
directorship of Sir Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank and I go back to 1977, when we did `Twelfth Night' and
`The Admirable Crichton,' '' Hunnicutt said. ``I always asked Frank
to come to shows I've been involved in.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked him to have a look at ``Edith Wharton at Home,'' an
earlier play in which Hunnicutt starred. The look led to ``The Life
and Loves of Edith Wharton,'' which Barrie wrote _ working from
research and a first draft by Katrina Hendry. It premiered in 1994
at England's Chichester Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Barrie is also the director of ``Life and Loves.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrie prowled the stage one afternoon last week, stroking his
chin like a road company Sherlock Holmes as he visualized various
ways to reblock his staging. He concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to busk it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Wing it, he meant, like the buskers who entertain for theater
queues in Britain.)
</P>
<P>
   Barrie and Hunnicutt are superb together in ``Life and Loves''
(which also played in Austin early this month). The loving
friendship of Wharton and James is realized particularly well. In
addition to their literary link, the two shared a devout and
unabashed snobbery about their native country. Consider this
exchange in the play:
</P>
<P>
   EDITH: ``The American landscape has no foreground.''
</P>
<P>
   HENRY: ``Yes, and the American mind has no background.''
</P>
<P>
   Married since 1978 to English journalist Simon Jenkins,
Hunnicutt works regularly in her second homeland. A particularly
important project for her was the 1972 dramatization of Henry
James' ``The Golden Bowl,'' which Hunnicutt did for BBC-TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``That production really launched my career in Britain,'' she
said. ``Later I spent my honeymoon night at Lamb House in Rye,
where James wrote `The Golden Bowl.' So I seem to have the links in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although James was Wharton's literary mentor, he was not her
equal in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was known as the master, but he didn't sell very well,''
Hunnicutt said. ``And Edith sold phenomenally well. She was a
best-selling author from the very beginning of her literary career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toward the end of her life she was sometimes known as `Miss'
Edith Wharton. She was very offended by that. She so did not want
any touch of spinsterhood to be attached to her reputation. She so
wanted people to know she had had a sexual life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Edith's sexual self was not as Mrs. Edward Wharton. It was
as the lover of Morton Fullerton, an awakening that occurred when
the novelist was 46.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very odd to live to age 46, and have been married since
you were in your 20s and are a virgin,'' Hunnicutt said. ``We do
very much touch on that in the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting when you read her novels to understand how
anyone could write so profoundly about the human heart and human
relationships who had come from such a strangulated world of that
old Dutch New York side, who looked down on the Astors and the
Vanderbilts as the nouveau riche.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much the world she writes about. She was Edith
Newbold Jones. The expression, `keeping up with the Joneses,' comes
from her family.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure will move northeast over the northern Great Lakes
Thursday. A conveyor belt of cold, moist air to the northwest of
the low's track will cause moderate to heavy snow over northern
Minnesota to persist into the afternoon. An additional few inches
of snow will accumulate after sunrise, bringing storm totals to
nearly a foot in some places. Patchy light snow and flurries will
linger over the eastern Dakotas and the rest of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front extending south from the low will cross the Ohio
and middle Mississippi valleys. Scattered showers and isolated
thunderstorms will precede the front. Given that moist air from the
Gulf of Mexico is limited, heavy rain is unlikely and rainfall
totals will generally remain below one half inch.
</P>
<P>
   Milder air surging north ahead of the front will encounter
stubborn chilly air in the northern Appalachians. As the warm air
is forced to rise above the cooler air near the ground, clouds and
pockets of drizzle will develop over the Northeastern states, aided
by damp air penetrating inland from the Atlantic. Showers will
develop Thursday night as the front approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Although a rogue shower is possible, most of the Southeast will
remain dry through Thursday evening. Florida will be partly sunny
and very warm, with near record warmth in southern sections.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of mild, moist air from the Pacific Ocean will direct
an area of rain onto the Northwest coast with snow falling in the
Cascades. Meanwhile, high pressure over the Great Basin will
sponsor sunny, tranquil conditions from the central Rockies to
southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Eye Protection
</P>
<P>
   For three hours on Tuesday, no images were received from the
satellite that normally provides constant coverage for most of
North America and the Atlantic. Technicians had repositioned the
mirror that is used to make images of the earth so that the
fusillade of tiny particles from the Leonid meteor shower would be
less likely to damage the eye in the sky. There are five
geostationary satellites spaced approximately 70 degrees of
longitude apart that are essential tools for monitoring global
weather changes. All of these satellites came through Tuesday's
meteor shower unscathed.

TREVANIAN RETURNS WITH A BANG

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Incident at Twenty-Mile''
</P>
<P>
   Trevanian
</P>
<P>
   Western fiction
</P>
<P>
   St. Martin's Press, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   The publisher's hype seems somewhat overblown.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the author calling himself Trevanian is a mystery man who
penned four well-received novels (''The Eiger Sanction'' and
``Summer of Katya'' are the best known), then vanished from the
publishing ranks. Now he's back, and St. Martin's Press would have
us believe that this is not unlike J.D. Salinger returning from
self-imposed writing exile.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Trevanian was always workmanlike rather than inspired,
more Mary Higgins Clark than Tom Wolfe. That is precisely why
``Incident at Twenty-Mile'' is such a surprise. It is an inspired
remodeling of the hoary Old West yarn; the author serves up the
generic cast of characters _ mysterious young drifter, nasty gang
led by a psychotic killer, pretty girl stuck in a nowhere town _
and brilliantly scrambles the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-Mile is a crumbling collection of buildings halfway up a
Wyoming mountain. Its seedy general store, boardinghouse and
bar/bordello serve the weekend needs of workers on the mountaintop
silver mine. The mine is playing out. Twenty-Mile's few remaining
residents know that sooner rather than later, there will be no
further reason for their town to remain. Meanwhile, they
reluctantly coexist, disliking one another almost as much as they
do the outside world they each have, for various reasons,
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   When Matthew Dubchek shows up, reinventing his name and past to
suit each person he meets, Twenty-Mile's chemistry is altered. The
young man wants to stay, and he cajoles work out of reluctant
employers. He is expert at playing on individual weaknesses,
failing only to impress the drunken, carousing Leroy Hibbard, who
supports his sinful ways by preaching to the miners on Sundays, and
Olga Bjorkvist, the tight-fisted shrew who runs the boardinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Matthew arrives, three killers make their way into
town. Hamilton Lieder and his two followers have escaped from
prison. Lieder is a sadistic lunatic who decides to amuse himself
in Twenty-Mile while waiting to rob the silver-laden mine train
when it makes its weekly stop in town to drop off the workers. When
the bad guys start tormenting the townspeople, Trevanian has
succeeded in setting the stage for classic western drama.
Obviously, Matthew will somehow rise to the occasion, blast the bad
guys away, marry the pretty girl and ride with her into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Trevanian seems to make most of that happen. There are bloody
gun battles, lots of hold-your-breath scenes, and, finally, the
triumph of decency over evil. Except the author doesn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he allows the story to play out much as life itself
would probably do. We learn how everyone, including the loose woman
with a heart of gold, ends differently than western rote would lead
readers to expect. Trevanian further muddies the waters by
revaling that he may have based this novel on real places and
people. Probably he's making all that up, but Trevanian makes a
persuasive case by telling how he met an old man who told him a
story. ... Adding this final, unnerving note ends ``Incident at
Twenty-Mile'' with just the right flourish.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Incident at Twenty-Mile'' is indicative of Trevanian's real
gifts as a writer, then maybe we ought to be celebrating his return
to the bestseller lists after all.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Jakarta belonged to the students Wednesday
as traffic stopped and security forces fell back to allow two large
processions to mourn some 16 students killed by gunfire last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   To the sad notes of an anthem called ``Falling Flowers,'' and in
the shiver of a sudden evening breeze, members of one procession
stepped through a line of stolid riot policemen to lay red paper
flowers at the gates of the parliament building.
</P>
<P>
   This had been the destination of a student demonstration that
was halted a mile away on Friday by volleys of gunfire, tear gas
and beatings. A second procession Wednesday laid wreaths outside
Atmajaya University, where most of the killings took place.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfire on Friday has shocked Indonesia at a time when hopes
were rising for a less repressive government after President
Suharto's resignation in May.
</P>
<P>
   And the anger of the students has challenged a dawning consensus
between the government and its political opponents to move slowly
toward democratic reforms and general elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   While the killings have shaken the reputation of the
already-unpopular military, they have raised the moral standing of
Indonesia's politically restive students.
</P>
<P>
   Having helped force Suharto out, the students are gaining
momentum in their demands for more political change, in particular
a reduction of the pervasive political role of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one force the government cannot control,'' said
Daniel S. Lev, an expert on Indonesia at the University of
Wisconsin, speaking of the students. ``They are dangerous because
everyone understands that they are the one group that is not out
for themselves, and they seem to have the fate of Indonesia in
mind. The army is afraid of them. In a sense, the whole elite is
afraid of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In full retreat now, Wiranto, the chief of the military, placed
an advertisement of ``sincere condolences'' in several newspapers
Wednesday over the Friday killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that their souls are accepted at God's side,'' he
wrote of the student victims, ``and for all the families that they
left behind, may God give them patience and strengthen their souls
to face this hardest of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all its momentum, the student movement remains an enigma
here. With no unified leadership, without a clear agenda, without
allegiance to any political faction, it seems an undirected,
unfocused force of nature, like a typhoon.
</P>
<P>
   After years of quiescence under Suharto's repressive rule, the
student movement was only beginning to coalesce on Indonesian
campuses in May. Perhaps, some people say, it succeeded too quickly
in pushing him from office and its gales have yet to blow
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Some people see the students now as spoilers of Indonesia's
fragile stability, with their insistence on rapid, disruptive
change at a time of emerging tentative consensus within the
political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   One foreign diplomat spoke with exasperation of the students'
``myth of purity'' in which no compromise of ideals is acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students, on the other hand, speak passionately
about the need for true reforms in a nation where the only concrete
change so far is the removal of one man, Suharto. His entire
government structure has been left in place, promising to reform
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not a real victory, only an illusion of victory,''
said Ki Joyo Sardo, 22, a political science student at the
University of Indonesia. ``The old system is still here. The new
regime is still controlled by the old regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewi Astuti, 20, a history major at the university, said she had
joined the demonstrations because ``I see that our political system
is not right; I don't see any democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   She conceded that the government of President B.J. Habibie had
taken some steps toward democracy and openness but said: ``They
only made those changes because we pushed them. And anyway, the
changes are only on the surface. Fundamentally nothing has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aity Sukidjo, 21, a psychology student at Atmajaya University,
said most students place little faith in the electoral process that
is being put in place by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students are afraid that most seats are going to be bought
off by the Habibie and Suharto supporters,'' she said. ``Before we
elect them, they'll be paid off. That's why we won't have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to a program for the future, the picture
becomes more complicated. Like almost everything else here in the
post-Suharto era, the students are fragmenting into ever smaller
slices of opinion, from those who support the measured reform
agenda of Habibie to those who want to hang him.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant demands are the abolition of the military's
political role and an investigation and trial of Suharto. Many
students are calling for an interim council and new presidential
elections to replace Habibie's government.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be beside the point to try to pin down a specific
political agenda. Like most student movements, this one is driven
more by passion than calculation.
</P>
<P>
   As they dance and chant on the roofs of their slow-moving,
overcrowded buses, the students suggest a more optimistic future
for the country than the holdover politicians in their
parliamentary meetings, calibrating the necessary tradeoffs between
reforms and personal power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want democracy; we want freedom!'' Ega Arsilla, 18, said,
summing up her political views as she marched Wednesday with her
friends from the freshman class at the Jakarta Institute of
Management.
</P>
<P>
   She said her aspirations in life were ``to be a successful
woman; to be someone useful.''
</P>
<P>
   If the police begin shooting again, she said, ``we'll run!''
</P>
<P>
   As they walked, the students sang an army marching song, with
derisive new words: ``The army is useless. Dismiss them. Better to
replace them with Boy Scouts. They never pay on the bus. They never
pay at food stalls. They rape people's wives and they beat people
in the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seemed they could not stay angry for long.
</P>
<P>
   After laying flowers in front of the Parliament building, at the
feet of the riot policemen whose comrades had shot at them last
Friday, the students turned ebullient again.
</P>
<P>
   They exchanged cigarettes with soldiers and shook their hands,
and one group of freshmen gathered around a police officer to have
him autograph their blue school jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aqil,'' he signed, laughing in surprise, as the students
handed him a black marker pen.
</P>
<P>
   Why did they want his signature on this day of mourning?
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be friends with the police,'' said Yoke Rosaline,
20, an accounting student. ``Especially this one. He's nice. And
he's good looking.''

   CONGRESS-REPUBS (Washington) _ Congressional Republicans select
their leaders: Livingston as speaker; Armey as majority leader, on
a third ballot; and Delay, who was unopposed, as whip. By Katharine
Q. Seeley.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-REPUBS (Washington) _ On the eve of the high-stakes
appearance of Kenneth Starr before the House Judiciary Committee,
House Republicans are expressing anguish, doubts and outright
opposition to the panel's inquiry, which the public overwhelmingly
wants it to end. With only an 11-vote margin in the current
Congress, which will dwindle to six votes in the next Congress, it
would take only a few other Republicans among those who say they
are wavering to kill any chance of impeaching Clinton. By Eric
Schmitt.

   IRAQ (Washington) _ After stepping back from a massive bombing
campaign of Iraq, the United States and Britain are redoubling
their support for Iraqi opposition groups as an alternative means
of ousting the Iraqi dictator, but administration officials say the
existing dissident organizations are weak, divided and, in many
cases, thoroughly penetrated by Iraqi agents. By James Risen.

<P>
   CHINA-PHARMACEUTICALS (Beijing) _ Imported Western
pharmaceuticals have taken China by storm, straining pocketbooks as
they hold out promises of cure. Sales have been bouyed by a new and
unlikely symbiosis: Western drug companies have been aggressively
courting China's doctors and hospitals not only with new pills but
also with gifts, money and even kickbacks, practices that are often
banned in the United States. By Elisabeth Rosenthal.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT FACES MULTI-SIDED CHALLENGE
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT-JAVA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With its $280 billion market capitalization at
risk, an embattled Microsoft Corp. fought Wednesday to defend its
formidable Windows franchise on several legal and political fronts.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth week of a historic antitrust trial, Microsoft
lawyers sought to turn the tables on the government prosecutors by
charging that some of the biggest names in the software industry,
led by IBM Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., had recently formed a
secret pact to promote the Java programming language in a bid to
break Microsoft's Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial probably has many more weeks to run, Microsoft
has seemingly decided that its best defense is a strong offense.
</P>
<P>
   That decision may have been reinforced by a ruling Tuesday in
another federal courtroom 3,000 miles away, one that obliges that
company to rewrite parts of Windows 98 code to conform to Sun's
``write once, use many'' version of Java.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
promptly branded the Java ruling a major victory for the Justice
Department's separate antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that senior executives at Microsoft will begin to see
that, in the end, the facts and the law will prevail over its
public relations campaign and muddled defenses,'' Hatch said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Hatch had blasted Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in a
contentious hearing. Hatch has told several Senate colleagues that
he plans to sponsor a similar set of Senate hearings once the trial
here ends.
</P>
<P>
   That trial became even more contentious Wednesday when Microsoft
lawyer Steve Holley concluded his cross-examination of John
Soyring, a government witness from IBM, by asking him: ``Do you
think it's appropriate for IBM and Sun, who hold themselves out to
be major competitors, to collude with one another?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Objection,'' thundered Steve Houck, as assistant attorney
general from New York, who was handling this aspect of the massive
case on behalf of the 20 states that have joined the Justice
Department in challenging Microsoft's business conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustained,'' said U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
who is trying the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-bounds comment was based on an e-mail that Microsoft
had unearthed from John Thompson of IBM, the firm's top software
gun, to Scott McNealy, the top figure at Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must engage our other partners to bundle (Netscape)
Navigator and/or Java compatible JVM's (Java virtual machines) with
their products,'' Thompson wrote on Aug. 13, two months before the
Microsoft trial began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should start with Oracle and Novell,'' he added, citing two
other industry powerhouses. ``Novell ships 20 million Netware
clients per year. I will call Eric Schmidt (of Novell) if you will
call Larry Ellison (of Oracle) to start the conversation. Perhaps
Larry could help us with Apple'' Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Holley asked IBM's Soyring whether the combined
power of the half-dozen companies cited in the IBM note to Sun ``do
not in every respect dwarf that of Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In every respect but market capitalization,'' Soyring said.
</P>
<P>
   (Microsoft's capitalization fell slightly on Wednesday when its
common stock closed on the Nasdaq exchange at $111.87 a share, down
$2.12 for the day.)
</P>
<P>
   With five witnesses already under its belt, the government is
now set to move to the heart of its antitrust case by calling as
its top expert witness Frederick Warren-Boulton, a consultant who
served as the Justice Department's chief antitrust economist during
the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will be significantly harmed if Microsoft succeeds
in crushing the cross-platform threat that independent browsers
pose to the Windows operating system monopoly,'' Warren-Boulton
wrote in an 89-page statement released as his direct testimony in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee, of course, that independent browsers
will bring these benefits or reduce the monopoly power of Microsoft
in the operating system market, even if Microsoft did not engage in
exclusionary conduct. That is a matter for the market _ not
monopolists or engineers or economists _ to decide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point is that the market should not be prevented
by Microsoft's anti-competitive practices from making that
decision,'' Warren-Boulton concluded.

   ``There is no guarantee, of course, that independent browsers
will bring these benefits or reduce the monopoly power of Microsoft
in the operating system market, even if Microsoft did not engage in
exclusionary conduct. That is a matter for the market _ not
monopolists or engineers or economists _ to decide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point is that the market should not be prevented
by Microsoft's anti-competitive practices from making that
decision,'' Warren-Boulton concluded.

ITALY, TURKEY AT ODDS OVER EXTRADITION OF KURDISH REBEL  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader
wanted by Turkey has soured relations between the normally close
allies, and as government leaders in Rome and Ankara traded angry
words Wednesday, the United States added to the pressure by also
calling for extradition of the Kurd, Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe he should be extradited and brought to justice,''
the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said in Washington
Wednesday. ``And we hope a way will be found to extradite him to
Turkey, consistent with international and Italian law.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema has been in a quandary over what
to do with Ocalan, leader of the separatist Kurdistan Workers
Party, since he was arrested last week trying to enter Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Italian law forbids the extradition of prisoners to countries
that have a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Alema, a former Communist, is also under pressure from
leftists in his coalition to grant Ocalan political asylum. He has
not ruled it out, saying instead that if Ocalan's pledges to
renounce terrorism are sincere, Italy will consider his case.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey views Ocalan as a terrorist. Wednesday, Prime Minister
Mesut Yilmaz told the Turkish Parliament that if Italy fails to
extradite Ocalan, ``not only will it remain as a stain on their
record but they will become accomplices to every murder ever
committed'' by the Kurdistan Workers Party.
</P>
<P>
   Yilmaz added, ``No government of the Turkish republic would ever
forget this.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night D'Alema sternly rebutted Yilmaz. Calling the
comment on Italy ``unacceptable,'' D'Alema said: ``Italy does not
justify terrorism and will not be an accomplice to it. Those who
dare to make this link are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, who is being held in an undisclosed hospital near Rome,
was adding his own form of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have abandoned terrorism and are ready for a peace
accord,'' he wrote to the daily newspaper La Repubblica in answer
to the newspaper's written questions. ``My presence here testifies
to a change in the strategy of the Kurdish national movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry demonstrations for and against Ocalan have spread across
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year-old Kurd set himself on fire Wednesday in Rome. In
Moscow on Tuesday, two supporters of the rebel leader set
themselves on fire; one died. The other protester in Moscow and the
man in Rome were hospitalized. Kurdish demonstrators in Turkey also
set themselves on fire this week.
</P>
<P>
   Passions also run high on the other side. In Brussels, Turkish
demonstrators set fire to two houses in a neighborhood with many
Kurdish residents. Italian television Wednesday night showed
Turkish demonstrators in Istanbul holding rallies, burning Kurdish
flags and calling for a boycott of Italian goods, including Versace
and Armani designer clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Italy, which exported $3.14 billion worth of goods to Turkey in
the first nine months of this year, could ill afford such a
boycott.
</P>
<P>
   Any hope the Italian government harbored that Germany would take
Ocalan off its hands, moreover, has dimmed. Germany, which issued a
warrant for Ocalan's arrest on homicide charges in 1990, has not
requested his extradition, which Italy could more easily grant
because Germany has no death penalty. But Germany has a huge
Turkish population and a strong Kurdish one, and is apparently
reluctant to make a move that would inevitably generate fresh
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night D'Alema hinted that he felt isolated and would
welcome some support from his European colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about Italy and Turkey,'' the prime minister said.
``It involves all of Europe, from which we expect total solidarity.
We've already gotten signs of encouragement, and we are expecting
more tangible political gestures.''

 &HT;    GATORS AND SPURRIER
 &HT;    ATTN: SPORTS EDITORS
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE _ Imagine being a traffic cop at rush hour in
Manhattan or a commodities trader during a big sell-off on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Now double this amount of anxiety and you have an idea of what
it's like to be near Florida coach Steve Spurrier every time the
Gators have the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very stressful time,'' receivers coach Dwayne Dixon
said. ``And you do it about 70 times every game.''
</P>
<P>
   The process starts and ends with Spurrier, who, even before the
play is over, is thinking about his next call. Once he knows the
down and distance, he quickly decides on a formation and a play.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier then verbally gives the call to backup quarterback
Billy Young, who sends in the information to quarterback Doug
Johnson using strange-looking hand signals. Meanwhile, Dixon
handles substitutions by telling which players to go in and holding
up a card with a number to tell which player/players to come out.
</P>
<P>
   All this, in about 15 seconds. That way, Johnson has time to
change the play at the line of scrimmage _ with Spurrier's help, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty chaotic,'' said Young, who's been sending in the
signals the past two seasons. ``When I first started, it was pretty
intense because everything was going so fast. Now that I've done it
a while, it doesn't seem like it's too fast; it's just the way we
do things.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier prefers to look at the system as organized chaos. He
says for it to work, one thing must happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's crucial is the quarterback knows the plays,'' Spurrier
said. ``Once we get started, he can anticipate what's coming next.
That's what's been happening with Doug the last few games.''
</P>
<P>
   The art of sending in plays from the sideline takes on a more
special meaning Saturday when the fourth-ranked Gators travel to
No. 5 Florida State, with a shot at the national title possibly on
the line. Because these teams know each other so well _ this will
be their seventh meeting in the past five years thanks to a pair of
rematches in the Sugar Bowl _ trying to make sure the defense also
doesn't know the signals is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   This issue was avoided last year when Spurrier rotated Johnson
and Noah Brindise at quarterback, eliminating the need for Young as
the middle man. Even so, Johnson suspected FSU's cornerbacks had
stolen their audible calls, so with FSU leading 29-25 late in the
game, Johnson used a hand signal for Jacquez Green to run a curl _
then deftly added another hand motion to change it to a
curl-and-go. The play resulted in a 63-yard pass that set up Fred
Taylor's winning touchdown in Florida's 32-29 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll go to some phony audibles if we think the other team
knows our signals,'' Spurrier said. ``I don't know how much they
(FSU) know our signals. Obviously, we have been playing them for
nine years now and our signals haven't changed much.''
</P>
<P>
   But expect the Gators to tweak their signals Saturday. They
could have two players signal in the plays (one would send in
``dummy'' signals), or they could have more players stand near
Young to block the view from the FSU sideline, or they could add
different signals for just this game.
</P>
<P>
   All of which adds some pressure to Young, a 5-foot-8 junior who
is UF's fourth-string quarterback. With some of the weird motions
he has to make, he had better have a good memory and a small ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put in a funny signal for LSU last year, and my mom saw it
and thought I was brushing my teeth,'' Young said. ``My friends
think I'm doing aerobics.''
</P>
<P>
   The process doesn't end after Young has signalled in the play.
Spurrier studies the defensive alignment once his team reaches the
line of scrimmage and will either motion for Johnson to run the
play or yell for an audible. Actually, Dixon is the one yelling
because his baritone voice is much louder than Spurrier's
high-pitched Tennessee twang, which will come in handy Saturday at
deafening Doak Campbell Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you can do that a lot easier at home or at stadiums
like Vandy, that are real quiet,'' Spurrier said of his sideline
audibles. ``But, shoot, we yelled a bunch of them in at the
Superdome (in '96 when Gators beat FSU 52-20 to win the national
title).''
</P>
<P>
   Once the audible is yelled in, Spurrier can relax. For about
three seconds. Then the pressure-packed process starts all over
again.

CLINTON VOWS TO PRESS JAPAN ON TRADE, REFORMS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES BENNET    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Leaving Washington for an abbreviated five-day trip to
Asia, President Clinton vowed Wednesday to press Japan to take
``decisive steps'' to open its markets and revive its economy in
hopes of easing the global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the cool if not downright suspicious reception that
the Clinton administration has given to the $195 billion package of
tax cuts and spending announced here Monday, the president did not
even mention the package. Instead he emphasized the need for
follow-through on longstanding commitments to such policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is more important to restoring stability and growth in
Asia than efforts to restart Japan's economy,'' Clinton said before
boarding a helicopter on the South Lawn of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that the economy here has been ``stalled for five
years,'' he said he looked forward to ``discussing how Japan can
promptly and effectively implement its commitment'' to reforming
its banking system, opening protected industries to foreign
competitors and priming consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton canceled the first part of the trip, to the annual
summit meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
organization, held this year in Malaysia, as he planned and then
aborted a military assault on Iraq. He sent Vice President Al Gore
instead and then left to complete the other legs of the trip, to
Japan, South Korea and Guam.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to make the rest of the stops had the incidental
benefit of placing Clinton out of the country as Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr testifies before the House Judiciary
Committee, which is weighing possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials hope that the trip will display Clinton
as pointedly removed from Washington wrangling, conducting
high-minded business _ confronting economic and security worries _
as Starr squares off with friendly Republicans and hostile
Democrats. But the trip was long planned, and White House aides
dismissed as preposterous any suggestion that Clinton was fleeing
at Starr's approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international financial issues have been at the top of the
president's agenda, and this trip offers him the chance to go and
make the case for the new global financial architecture that he's
been talking about, directly to the people of Japan and Korea,''
said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton will probably not avoid unpleasant matters at home
altogether. He plans to answer reporters' questions Saturday, in a
joint appearance with President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea. White
House aides said Clinton was highly unlikely to take more than two
questions, however, insisting that the Koreans had set the ground
rules.
</P>
<P>
   As always Clinton tried Wednesday to emphasize the stakes for
Americans in his financial negotiating abroad. ``If people overseas
lose their jobs,'' he said, ``they can't afford American products,
and our workers and farmers pay the price.''
</P>
<P>
   That thought seemed also to reflect the administration's
increasing worry about the possibility of rising protectionist
sentiment. Although the U.S. trade deficit with Japan fell $1.3
billion, to $14.03 billion, in September, that decline was from
record levels. In particular, the administration has come under
great pressure from the U.S. steel industry and steel workers to
address a surge in steel imports from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there has been a surge and that that
is certainly causing pain, real pain, in some steel communities in
this country,'' said Gene Sperling, Clinton's national economics
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to take his economic message directly to the
Japanese people Thursday. He is to hold a televised town-hall
meeting with what the White House is billing as a cross-section of
young Japanese, from 20 to 40.
</P>
<P>
   In South Korea, where the administration is pleased with
economic steps that the government has taken, Clinton is planning
to deliver a gentler message of encouragement. But he said
Wednesday that he would also press Kim to reform South Korea's
banks and the huge conglomerates, whose debt is dragging down the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan and South Korea Clinton is planning to discuss growing
concerns in the region and in Washington over North Korea. After
some tentative signs of lessening tensions on the Korean Peninsula,
North Korea is resisting U.S. demands to allow the inspection of a
vast new site that the CIA suspects could be a nascent plant for
nuclear weapons. Officials in Japan and South Korea worry that the
administration, distracted by Iraq and domestic politics, has been
paying too little attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton said, ``If Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
have dominated recent headlines, we must be no less concerned by
North Korea's weapons activities.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited ``its provocative missile program and developments that
could call into question its commitment to freeze and dismantle its
nuclear-weapons effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Clinton plans to visit at least two U.S. military bases
in South Korea, in a reminder of the U.S. security commitment
there. But Joel Witt, a senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson
Center, a military research organization in Washington, said that
Japan and South Korea also wanted ``to hear from the president that
he's committed to seeking peaceful resolution of our differences
with the North.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving South Korea on Monday morning, Clinton is to give
two speeches to residents of Guam before returning to the White
House on Monday night.

HIP-HOP'S HUMPTY-HUMP IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Just in case the sexy beats and rowdy antics didn't
get every last person in Wetlands dancing on Sunday night, Digital
Underground had plenty of gimmicks. The veteran hip-hop group's
comic and musical mastermind, Shock G, and his mates tossed out
``party packs'' _ sandwich bags full of potato chips, breath mints,
noisemakers and condoms _ during the anthem to earthly pleasure,
``Doowutchyalike.'' Then members showered everyone with Silly
String and movie-theater popcorn. Free beer was offered from a
cooler onstage. It was chaos as usual for this crew.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Digital Underground declared itself the
hip-hop progeny of funk legend George Clinton and his P-Funk
collective and set out to inspire the scene with earthy wisdom and
mind-altering joy. The group followed up this lofty claim with a
series of inspired hits, from ``The Humpty Dance'' to ``Kiss You
Back,'' which this reconstituted assemblage performed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Underground also presented material from its new album,
``Who Got the Gravy?'' (Jake/Seagram); the new songs had their
moments, although they didn't match their predecessors. The group's
sound still draws heavily from P-Funk, augmented by other
borrowings, both obvious (the Artist) and up-to-date (Lauryn Hill).
Two turntablists replaced the original DJ Fuze. They never
approached his artfulness, but Shock G, who also played a strap-on
keyboard, still orchestrated a lively commotion. Two new rappers
impressed, fortifying the interplay of Shock G and fellow group
founder Money B: Esinchill did a witty deadpan turn on the gangsta
pose, and Mystik added a no-nonsense female viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   The group's shenanigans included some dirty dancing with female
fans during the lascivious ``Freaks of the Industry,'' and the
return of Humpty-Hump, Shock G's Jerry Lewis-esque alter ego. There
was also a moment of appreciation for Tupac Shakur, who began his
career as part of this Oakland-based group. Shock G turned mourning
into deliverance by leading the crowd in a two-minute-long yowling
session banishing all demons from the room. It seemed to work:
throughout the show, good spirits prevailed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Rick Rodgers cooks Thanksgiving dinner, he
sometimes feels like a juggler at a circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is a balancing act,'' said the self-taught cook and
author of the recently released ``Thanksgiving 101,'' cookbook
(Broadway Books; $15), who is often referred to as Mr.
Thanksgiving. Balance, for instance, in make-ahead vs. last-minute
dishes; homemade vs. store-bought; colorful vs. drab-looking food. &QL; 
?7
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers' balancing act takes place more than once a year. He has
prepared more than 30 Thanksgiving dinners at home and for cooking
classes during the last eight years.
</P>
<P>
   As owner of a Manhattan catering company in the late 1980s, he
had to juggle several different menu items. ``I tried to do one
Thanksgiving menu to sell to everybody, but forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   His customers had other ideas, so Rodgers ended up offering five
different stuffings and eight different desserts. ``It was trial by
fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His new Thanksgiving book, his 15th cookbook, grew out of that
experience and his classes. It includes tips, advice and secrets to
take the anxiety _ but not the joy _ out of the treasured day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made Thanksgiving so many different ways over the last
20 years since I moved to New York in 1977. I love it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers quit catering in 1989 (``catering is really, really hard
work,'' he said) to write cookbooks and become a food consultant.
In 1990 he wrote his first cookbook, ``The Turkey Cookbook
(HarperCollins),'' and became a media spokesman for turkey products
made by Perdue Farms, one of the East Coast's largest poultry
producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned everything there is to know about turkey, spending
lots of time on turkey farms and in the kitchen,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   That's where he found out that he prefers fresh turkeys _ which,
he says, yield the best flavor results _ and where he discovered
there is no difference in flavor or tenderness between toms (14 to
26 pounds) and hens (8 to 16 pounds).``Buy a fresh turkey no
earlier than two days before roasting,'' he advised.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, fresh turkeys are available at most markets so you
rarely have to special order them, but check ahead to confirm.
You'll need about 1 pound per person, which allows for seconds or
leftovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frozen turkeys are the least expensive, but freezing dries out
the meat and more moisture is lost down the drain during
defrosting,'' Rodgers said. He suggests that consumers avoid birds
that have been pumped with artificial flavors and preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about deep-fried turkey (directions are included on page
8), which seems to have its fans these days, Rodgers said, ``My
honest opinion is that even though it is fast (takes only 45
minutes), it is not worth the trouble. I am not saying it is not
good, but it is dangerous, especially with kids and dogs running
around _ and it doesn't give the Norman Rockwell traditional look.
The result is a fried chicken look _ golden as opposed to a rich
golden brown of an oven-roasted turkey.''

<P>
   Special equipment for frying cost him $200 plus $30 for the oil
at a discount store. ``My friends didn't like it because it had no
stuffing and no gravy. They said it was definitely not worth the
trouble from a taste standpoint.'' Also you can deep-fry only up to
a 12-pound bird. ``People refuse to believe roasting a delicious
turkey can be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem confronting Thanksgiving cooks is lack of
organization and meal planning, noted Rodgers, who has found in his
cooking classes that people need the most hand-holding when cooking
for holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas. Cooks need to make a
timetable and plot it out on paper to assist in getting all of the
food on the table at once. Consider the logistics _ oven and
stove-top space, baking and cooking times, refrigerator space, etc.
(see page 2 for Rodgers' help in planning a successful dinner).
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers never uses paper plates or paper napkins because this is
a special holiday. If necessary, he picks up inexpensive plates at
a restaurant supply or dish shop.
</P>
<P>
   In the decorating realm, Rodgers subscribes to the philosophy of
``less is more.'' Some of his ideas: Roll up napkins and tie with a
piece of raffia straw and an autumn leaf; use foil-wrapped
chocolate turkeys, lighted candles in the shape of pilgrims,
turkeys, etc.) or turkey or leaf-shaped cookies iced with guests'
names at each place setting; a floating candle in a glass bowl with
cranberries in the water or a basket of autumn foods (persimmons,
grapes, apples, nuts) entwined with French wired ribbon for a
centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I have learned about Thanksgiving it that the dinner
guests are the most polite audience in the world. We have all had
some pretty bad Thanksgiving dinners, but people never admit
Thanksgiving is bad. They just hope they don't get invited next
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers likes traditional as well as more sophisticated menus.
``If I am cooking Thanksgiving for my family, I make a traditional
dinner with a capital T.'' That means the menu he grew up with,
including green bean bake, canned yams with marshmallows, canned
cranberry sauce, herb and celery stuffing, roast turkey and three
pies _ pumpkin, lemon meringue and chocolate banana cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opening up this book is like seeing old friends,'' he said,
adding that among his favorite recipes are Scalloped Yams With
Praline Topping, and Spinach and Persimmon Salad. Rodgers is not
embarrassed to use Jell-O, and cream of mushroom or chicken soup in
his recipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to fight city hall,'' he said, adding these
ingredients are an important part of our Thanksgiving heritage.
``In my family, if we don't have grandma's layered Jell-O salad
with lemon and orange layers, there's a revolution _ I love it. I
live to eat this salad on Thanksgiving at my mom's house in
California.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Rodgers will be eating Jell-O salad at his home in
New York, where he'll be cooking dinnerfor friends from recipes in
the book. He plans to make Glittering Spiced Walnuts; Hot Crab
Salsa Dip; Sweet Potato and Peanut Soup; Roast Turkey with Cider
Gravy; Sausage and Apple Stuffing; Cranberry, Ginger and Lemon
Chutney; or a cranberry orange Jell-O mold as a nod to tradition.
He'll also serve Maque-Choux and Green Beans With Portobello
Mushrooms and Bacon to brighten up the side-dish choices.
</P>
<P>
   Desserts will include Berkshire Pumpkin Pie, Caramel Cashew Tart
dizzled with melted chocolate and his grandmother's Steamed
Persimmon Pudding. He'll be making his own pie crust _ ``the sign
of a good cook is a good pie crust'' _ which includes Crisco to
keep the pastry flaky and butter to give it color and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always serve appetizers because many of my friends skip
breakfast and lunch that day as they know we're going to have a big
meal that will be served around 4:30 or 5 p.m.'' He also serves
ramos fizzes and virgin Mary's with vodka on the side to friends
who come at noon to help. With dinner he serves hard cider or wine.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers tested the book's recipes himself (``I want to be
responsible because my name is on the book,'' he said) but admits
to having help in shopping, prepping and cleanup. Students of all
skill levels want doable recipes, and Rodgers appeals to the basics
and more in ``Thanksgiving 101.'' Several recipes were inspired by
friends and students while Rodgers had collected some of the others
over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now Rodgers shares the following creations from his book to help
you plan and serve a winning menu this year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
GLITTERING SPICED WALNUTS &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ASIAN SPICE MIXTURE:
</P>
<P>
   1 whole star anise (OR use 6 OR 7 ``points'' if pods are broken)
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground coriander seeds
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon Szechwan peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
</P>
<P>
   4 whole cloves
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper &QL; 
NUT MIXTURE:
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for deep-frying
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   1 pound walnut halves
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt for sprinkling (fine sea OR iodized)
</P>
<P>
   For Asian Mixture, finely grind all spices in a spice or
electric grinder. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Place one baking sheet next to stove. Line a second baking sheet
with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   For Nut Mixture, in a deep Dutch oven over high heat, heat
enough vegetable oil to come 3 inches up sides to 365 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil over high
heat. Add walnuts and cook 1 minute; water does not have to return
to a boil. (This warms walnuts and removes excess bitterness.)
Drain in a large colander. Do not rinse. Immediately toss walnuts
in colander with sugar until hot water, clinging to walnuts, melts
sugar to form a thin glaze.
</P>
<P>
   In two batches, deep-fry walnuts until golden, about 3 minutes.
Using a large skimmer, transfer walnuts to unlined baking sheet
(hot walnuts would stick to paper towels) and cool completely. When
cooked, transfer walnuts to paper towel-lined sheet to drain excess
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Place walnuts in a bowl. While tossing nuts, sift spice mixture
through a fine-meshed wire sieve over them. Discard hulls in sieve.
Season with salt. Walnuts can be prepared up to 1 week ahead and
stored in an airtight food container at room temperature. Makes 4
cups, 6 to 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: If you want to make more than one batch, have extra oil on
hand. The sugar on nuts ``caramelizes'' oil after deep-frying a
pound or two and makes it necessary to use fresh oil. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOT CRAB SALSA DIP
</P>
<P>
   Here's an update of an old favorite that my guests can't get
enough of. For the best flavor, use fresh crab meat instead of
pasteurized or canned.
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chunky tomato salsa
</P>
<P>
   2 packages (8 ounces EACH) cream cheese, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh lump crab meat, picked over to remove shells and
cartilage and flaked
</P>
<P>
   Hot red pepper sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup fresh bread crumbs, preferably from day-old French OR
Italian bread
</P>
<P>
   Tortilla chips and assorted fresh vegetables for serving
</P>
<P>
   Lightly butter a round 1-quart baking dish.
</P>
<P>
   Drain salsa in a sieve to remove excess liquid. Place drained
salsa in a medium bowl and add cream cheese, mayonnaise and
Worcestershire sauce. Using a rubber spatula, work ingredients
until combined. Stir in crab meat. Season with hot pepper sauce to
taste.
</P>
<P>
   Spread evenly in baking dish. Dip can be prepared up to 8 hours
ahead, covered tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle bread crumbs over dip.
</P>
<P>
   Bake on center rack in preheated 350-degree oven about 30
minutes, or until dip is bubbling. Serve hot, with tortilla chips
and vegetables. Makes 12 to 16 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MAQUE-CHOUX
</P>
<P>
   This Cajun side dish adds a welcome splash of color to the
Thanksgiving menu.
</P>
<P>
   6 strips thick-sliced bacon
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium red bell pepper, cored, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 medium celery ribs, chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 cups thawed frozen corn kernels (don't use fresh)
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning
</P>
<P>
   2 large ripe tomatoes, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Cook bacon in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, turning
occasionally, until crisp and brown, about 5 minutes. Using a
slotted spatula, transfer to paper towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   Pour out all except 3 tablespoons bacon fat from skillet. Add
onion, bell pepper and celery to skillet and cook until onion is
golden brown, about 10 minutes. Add corn, garlic and Cajun
seasoning and cook, stirring frequently, until corn is heated
through, about 5 minutes. (Maque-choux can be prepared up to this
point 1 day ahead, cooled, covered and refrigerated. Reheat gently
in a large skillet over low heat, stirring often.)
</P>
<P>
   Stir in tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until heated
through, about 5 minutes. Chop bacon and stir into maque-choux.
Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately. Makes 8 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SPICED CRANBERRY-ORANGE JELL-O MOLD
</P>
<P>
   One of Jell-O's most requested recipes, this graces countless
Thanksgiving tables every year.
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   2 packages (3 ounces EACH) cherry flavor gelatin dessert
</P>
<P>
   1 can (16 ounces) whole-berry cranberry sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   1 seedless navel orange, peeled, sectioned and cut into 1/2-inch
cubes
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped walnuts
</P>
<P>
   In a medium bowl, stir 1 1/2 cups boiling water into gelatin and
continue to stir until gelatin is completely dissolved, about 2
minutes. Stir in cranberry sauce, 1 cup cold water, lemon juice,
cinnamon and cloves.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerate until thickened and almost set (a spoon drawn
through mixture will leave a definite impression), about 1 1/2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in orange cubes and walnuts. Spoon into a 5-cup mold. Cover
and refrigerate until firm, at least 4 hours or overnight. (Mold
can be prepared up to 2 days ahead.)
</P>
<P>
   To unmold, dip mold into a large bowl of hot water and hold 5
seconds. Dry outside of mold and invert onto a serving dish. Makes
10 servings. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SCALLOPED YAMS WITH PRALINE TOPPING
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I make this dish, it never fails that someone remarks
``I don't even like yams, but I could eat a whole dish of these!''
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup finely chopped pecans
</P>
<P>
   Salted water
</P>
<P>
   6 medium yams (about 3 pounds), peeled and cut into
1/2-inch-thick rounds
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups whipping cream, heated
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, using your fingers, work brown sugar, butter
and flour together until well combined, then work in pecans. Set
aside. Praline topping can be prepared up to 8 hours ahead and
stored at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high
heat. Add yams and cook just until crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.
Do not overcook _ they should be able to hold their shape when
drained. Drain and rinse under cold running water.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly butter a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange yams,
overlapping in vertical rows, in prepared dish. (Yams can be
arranged in baking dish up to 8 hours before baking, covered
tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerated.)
</P>
<P>
   Pour cream over yams. Bake in preheated 375-degree oven 20
minutes. Crumble pecan mixture over yams and continue baking until
yams are tender and topping is browned, 20 to 30 more minutes.
Serve hot. Makes 8 to 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE AHEAD: Yams can be parboiled up to 8 hours before baking,
praline topping can be prepared up to 8 hours ahead. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
MAKE-AHEAD MASHED POTATO CASSEROLE
</P>
<P>
   I was a mashed potato snob who held tight to the belief that
mashed potatoes are only worth eating when they were freshly made,
until caterer Katy Keck gave me this recipe.
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   5 pounds baking potatoes (such as russet, Idaho, Burbank OR
Eastern)
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   1 package (8 ounces) cream cheese, cut into chunks, at room
temperature
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dairy sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup milk, heated
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon freshly milled white pepper
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh chives OR parsley (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Fill a large pot (at least 5 quarts) halfway with cold water.
Peel potatoes, cut into chunks about 1 1/2 inches square and drop
into pot. Add more cold water to cover potatoes by 1 to 2 inches.
Potatoes can be prepared to this point up to 4 hours ahead and
stored at cool room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in enough salt until water tastes mildly salted. Cover
tightly and bring to a full boil over high heat, about 20 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium-low and set lid askew. Cook at a moderate
boil until potatoes are tender when pierced with tip of a small
sharp knife, 15 to 20 minutes. Add more boiling water, if needed,
to keep potatoes covered. Do not overcook potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Drain potatoes well and return to warm pot. Add cream cheese.
Using a hand-held electric mixer, mash potatoes until cream cheese
melts. Beat in sour cream and milk. Season with 1 teaspoon salt and
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to a buttered 9x13-inch baking dish. Cool completely.
Potatoes can be prepared up to 4 hours ahead, covered loosely with
plastic wrap and stored at cool room temperature; or, cool, cover
tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 1 day.
</P>
<P>
   Bake in preheated 375-degree oven 30 to 40 minutes or until
potatoes are heated through. Serve hot, sprinkled with chives.
Makes 8 to 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE AHEAD: Casserole can be prepared up to 1 day ahead. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CRANBERRY-PINEAPPLE SALSA
</P>
<P>
   1 bag (12 ounces) fresh cranberries
</P>
<P>
   1/2 medium pineapple, peeled, cored and coarsely chopped (about
2 packed cups)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 green onion (white and green parts), coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint OR cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 to 2 jalapenos, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 garlic clove, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Place all ingredients in a food processor fitted with a metal
blade. Pulse until cranberries are coarsely chopped.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to a serving dish and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
Refrigerate at least 30 minutes but no longer than 2 hours. Serve
chilled. Makes about 3 1/2 cups, 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE AHEAD: Salsa is best prepared no longer than 2 hours before
serving. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ITALIAN STUFFING WITH SAUSAGE AND PARMESAN CHEESE
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 medium celery ribs with leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 medium red bell peppers, cored, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound sweet OR hot Italian sausage, casings removed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried basil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon crushed hot red pepper
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces day-old crusty Italian bread, cut into 1-inch cubes
(about 7 cups)
</P>
<P>
   1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (about 4 ounces)
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups OR as needed Homemade Turkey Stock (recipe follows)
OR canned reduced-sodium chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion,
celery, bell peppers and garlic. Cook, stirring often, until
softened, about 5 minutes. Add sausage and cook, breaking up meat
with a spoon, until it loses its pink color, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir
in basil, oregano, salt and crushed red pepper. Transfer to a large
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Add bread and cheese and mix well. Stir in butter, wine and
enough of stock to moisten dressing, about 1 cup. Use to stuff a
turkey or place in a buttered baking dish, drizzle with an
additional 1/2 cup stock, cover and bake as a side dish (350-degree
oven about 30 to 40 minutes or until hot throughout). Makes 10
cups.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Stuffing should be made just before using. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
HOMEMADE TURKEY STOCK 101
</P>
<P>
   Every Thanksgiving eve, I put on a big pot of stock to simmer
overnight. Then I use it all Thanksgiving Day long. Any leftovers
can be frozen or used the next day to make a terrific soup.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey parts with lots of bone, like wings and backs, make the
best stock. Use the turkey neck, heart and gizzard in the stock,
but not the liver. (Liver makes the stock bitter.)
</P>
<P>
   Never let stock come to a rolling boil or it will become cloudy
and have a less refined flavor. Cook the stock uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   Add the herbs to the stock after you've skimmed it.
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds turkey wings
</P>
<P>
   Turkey neck and giblets
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium carrot, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 medium celery rib with leaves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   6 parsley sprigs
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon black peppercorns
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   Using a heavy cleaver, chop wings and neck into 2-inch pieces.
(If necessary, ask butcher to do this for you.) Using a sharp
knife, trim away any membranes from giblets.
</P>
<P>
   In a large pot, heat oil over medium-high heat. In batches, add
turkey wings, neck and giblets and cook, turning occasionally,
until browned on all sides, about 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer to a
plate. Add onion, carrot and celery to pot and cook, stirring
often, until softened, about 6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Return turkey to pot. Add enough cold water to cover turkey by 2
inches. Bring to a boil, skimming off foam that rises to surface.
Add parsley, thyme, peppercorns and bay leaf. Reduce heat to low.
Cook at a bare simmer at least 2 and up to 12 hours. As needed, add
more water to pot to keep bones covered.
</P>
<P>
   Strain stock through a colander into a large bowl. Let stand 5
minutes, then skim off clear yellow fat that rises to surface. If
desired, remove giblets, cook, finely chop and refrigerate for use
in gravy. Neck meat can be removed in strips, chopped and reserved
as well. Cool stock completely before refrigerating or freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey stock can be prepared up to 3 days ahead, cooled, covered
and refrigerated. It can also be frozen in airtight food containers
up to 3 months. Makes about 2 1/2 quarts. &QL;

 &QL; 
PERFECT ROAST TURKEY WITH BEST-EVER GRAVY
</P>
<P>
   After trying every turkey roasting method under the sun, this is
the one I come back to and the one I always teach at my cooking
classes. Instructions here are for an average-sized 18-pound
turkey, but this recipe can be adapted to the size of your bird.
</P>
<P>
   1 (18-pound) fresh turkey
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   About 12 cups of your favorite stuffing
</P>
<P>
   8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted buttered, at room temperature,
plus additional melted unsalted butter, if needed
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly milled black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 1/2 quarts Homemade Turkey Stock (recipe above)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup bourbon, port OR dry sherry (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Reserve turkey neck and giblets to use in gravy or stock. Rinse
turkey inside and out with cold water. Pat turkey skin dry. Turn
turkey on its breast.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely fill neck cavity with stuffing. Using a thin wooden or
metal skewer, pin neck skin to back. Fold turkey's wings akimbo
behind back or tie to body with kitchen string. Loosely fill large
body cavity with stuffing. Place any remaining stuffing in a
lightly buttered casserole, cover and refrigerate to bake as a side
dish. Place drumsticks in hock lock or tie together with kitchen
string.
</P>
<P>
   Place turkey, breast side up, on a rack in a good-quality, heavy
roasting pan. Rub all over with softened butter. Season with salt
and pepper. Tightly cover breast area with foil. Pour 2 cups
Homemade Turkey Stock into bottom of pan.
</P>
<P>
   Roast turkey on lowest oven rack in preheated 325-degree oven,
basting all over every 30 minutes with juices on bottom of pan
(lift up foil to reach breast area), until a meat thermometer
inserted in meaty part of thigh (but not touching a bone) reads 180
degrees F and stuffing is at least 160 degrees F, about 4 1/2
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever drippings evaporate, add stock to moisten, about 1 1/2
cups at a time. Remove foil during last hour to allow breast skin
to brown.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer turkey to a large serving platter and let stand at
least 20 minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Increase oven temperature to 350 degrees F. Drizzle 1/2 cup
turkey stock over stuffing in casserole, cover and bake until
heated through, about 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pour drippings from roasting pan into a heat-proof
glass bowl or large measuring cup. Let stand 5 minutes, then skim
off and reserve clear yellow fat that has risen to top. Measure 3/4
cup fat, adding melted butter, if needed. Add enough turkey stock
to skimmed drippings to make 8 cups total.
</P>
<P>
   Place roasting pan on 2 stove burners over low heat and add
turkey fat. Whisk in flour, scraping up browned bits on bottom of
pan and cook until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Whisk in
turkey stock and bourbon. Cook, whisking often, until gravy has
thickened and no trace of raw flour taste remains, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer gravy to a warmed gravy boat. Carve turkey and serve
gravy and stuffing alongside. Makes about 18 servings, with about 7
cups gravy. &QL;

GRANDMA'S STEAMED PERSIMMON PUDDING
</P>
<P>
   Of all my holiday dessert recipes, this is the one my friends
always ask me to be sure and include on the menu. Pudding molds are
available at kitchenware stores and by mail order from Sur la Table
(800) 243-0852.
</P>
<P>
   2 very ripe, medium Hachiya persimmons
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons baking soda
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Sweetened whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Generously butter inside of a 1 1/2- to 2-quart fluted tube
pudding mold. Dust inside of mold lightly with flour and tap out
excess.
</P>
<P>
   Cut stems from persimmons. Cut up persimmons and remove any
large seeds in pulp. In a food processor or blender, puree unpeeled
persimmons. You should have 1 cup puree. Place in a medium bowl and
whisk in baking soda. (For some reason, mixing persimmon with
baking soda improves texture of pudding and keeps it from getting
gummy _ a common problem with persimmon desserts.) Whisk in sugar,
milk, melted butter and egg.
</P>
<P>
   Sift together flour, cinnamon and salt. Add to persimmon mixture
and whisk until smooth. Scrape mixture into prepared pudding mold
and smooth top. Cover mold with its lid or a double thickness of
foil.
</P>
<P>
   Place a collapsible vegetable steamer in a pot large enough to
hold mold and put mold on steamer. Pour enough boiling water into
pot to almost, but not quite, touch bottom of steamer.
</P>
<P>
   Bring to a boil over high heat, cover pot and reduce heat to
medium-low. Steam pudding, adding more boiling water as needed,
until pudding is dark brown and a toothpick inserted in center
comes out clean, about 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Let pudding stand 10 minutes. (Pudding can stay in its mold up
to 45 minutes.) Run a sharp knife around inside of mold and invert
pudding onto a platter. Slice and serve warm with sweetened whipped
cream. Makes 8 servings.
</P>
<P>
   NOTE: Recipe can be doubled and steamed in a 10- to 12-cup
fluted tube pan. Cover pan tightly with foil. To lift pan in and
out of kettle, tie pan with kitchen string, like a package.
Double-batch recipe can also be cooked in oven. Place pan in a
roasting pan, add enough hot water to come 1 inch up sides of pan
and bake until a toothpick inserted in pudding comes out clean,
about 2 1/2 hours. &QL;

CARAMEL CASHEW TART
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Tart Dough (recipe follows)
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup whipping cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   Water
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   Sweetened whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Position a rack in center of oven and place a baking sheet on
rack. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly butter a 9-inch round tart pan.
</P>
<P>
   Press Sweet Tart Dough evenly into bottom and up sides of
prepared tart pan. Using a fork, prick dough a few times. Line
dough with foil and weight with pie weights, dried beans or raw
rice.
</P>
<P>
   Place pan on hot baking sheet. Bake until pastry seems set,
about 10 minutes. Lift up and remove foil and weights. Continue
baking until tart shell is lightly browned, about 8 more minutes.
Cool tart shell on a wire cake rack while you make filling. Remove
baking sheet from oven and keep oven at 400 degrees F.
</P>
<P>
   In a small saucepan, heat cream over medium heat until small
bubbles appear around edges. (Or, heat cream in a microwave oven,
being careful that it doesn't boil over.) Set hot cream aside.
</P>
<P>
   In a tall medium saucepan over high heat, bring sugar and 1/4
cup water to a boil, stirring constantly to dissolve sugar. As soon
as sugar comes to a boil, stop stirring. (Don't stir a boiling
sugar syrup or it will crystallize into a thick glop.) Boil syrup
until it turns deep amber, 3 to 5 minutes. While syrup is boiling,
occasionally swirl pan by handle to mix and wash down any sugar
crystals that form on sides of pan by dipping a large pastry brush
in cold water and rubbing wet brush against crystals. When syrup is
dark amber, reduce heat to low.
</P>
<P>
   Being very careful, slowly stir in hot cream. Mixture will
bubble dramatically but eventually subside. Simmer, stirring often,
until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Pour into a medium bowl
and place on another cake rack or a trivet. Caramel will cool more
quickly if air can circulate under bowl. Cool, stirring often,
until tepid, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Using side of a large knife, coarsely crush about 1 cup cashews
and spread in tart shell. Top with remaining whole cashews. Whisk
melted butter, egg and vanilla into tepid caramel. Pour caramel
mixture over cashews.
</P>
<P>
   Place tart on a cool baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes. Reduce oven
temperature to 350 degrees F and continue baking until filling is
bubbling in center, about 15 more minutes. Cool tart completely on
a wire cake rack. Tart can be baked 1 day ahead. Cover cooled tart
with plastic wrap and store at room temperature. Serve with
sweetened whipped cream. Makes 8 to 12 servings.
</P>
<P>
   SWEET TART DOUGH: In a food processor, pulse 1 cup all-purpose
flour, 3 tablespoons sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt to combine. Add 6
tablespoons (3/4 stick) unsalted butter, chilled, and pulse 10 to
15 seconds until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add 1 large egg
yolk and 2 tablespoons water through feed tube with machine
running; process just until dough is moistened. It will look
crumbly but should hold together when pressed. Do not over
process. &UR; !end! &LR;

NOVICES, DON'T SWEAT THANKSGIVING DINNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You've agreed to host Thanksgiving dinner at your
house this year, but now you're filled with fear and trepidation.
You're a novice. You're wondering how you'll ever get dinner on the
table. Arm yourself with these 10 tips from Rick Rodgers, author of
``Thanksgiving 101,'' and you're bound for success.
</P>
<P>
   1. The No. 1 rule is to be yourself. ``Know your cooking
strengths and play them up. If you're a great baker, concentrate on
desserts. If you're a guy who likes to grill, try grilling or
smoking the turkey. Don't get sucked into televisionitis - meaning
you see so many cooking shows that you think it looks easy and you
overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're new to the Thanksgiving routine, teach yourself to
cook one new dish every year, he advised. This year, it might be
turkey and gravy next year, you might hone your sweet potato
technique. Also, rely on some convenience items - i.e. pie dough,
ready-made pies store-bought dinner rolls. And make simple
appetizers like a green salad topped with cooked, peeled shrimp
from the seafood department of the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   2. Plan your menu in advance. (Three weeks is the best-case
scenario. For this year, plan NOW.) Plot it out on paper, advised
Rodgers, ``and you'll be one giant step closer to serving a perfect
meal. The happiest Thanksgiving cook is the most organized.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Make lists - the more the better. You can never have too many
lists, said Rodgers. Make a guest list, grocery list, prep list,
utensil list and a list of the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Spread out the shopping. The grocery list should include a list
of non-perishable items (i.e., soap, candles, napkins, film, foil,
paper towels and other incidentals) that can be purchased a week or
more before the dinner; a list of perishable items that can be
picked up a week before the meal (produce that will keep a week,
such as onions, garlic, potatoes, yams, carrots, lemons and limes;
dairy items such as cheese, eggs and butter; beverages, including
mixers and nonalcoholic and alcoholic drinks; spices and canned
items); and a list of last-minute items that you'll need to buy on
Tuesday or Wednesday, including the fresh turkey, cream, milk,
veggies, fruit, ice, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Order the turkey and other meat or seafood items a week before
the dinner, if necessary. And don't forget to reserve pies and
dinner rolls at the bakery if you don't plan to bake them yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The prep lists should include cooking chores that can be done
ahead of time as well as cleanup time. ``Be realistic about how
much time it will take you to make each dish,'' noted Rodgers, who
isn't partial to freezing items ahead (except for stock and perhaps
some pie crusts).
</P>
<P>
   Utensil lists should include all pots, pans, roasting racks and
other things required in the recipes you're making and you'll need
to get dinner on the table. The tableware list should include all
of the serving dishes and utensils needed. Silver should be
polished, linens cleaned and pressed, and dishes washed well in
advance of Thanksgiving Day. Rodgers also favors using dishes and
silverware and avoiding paper plates and napkins and plastic
utensils. If you don't have enough plates or utensils, borrow from
friends or head to a restaurant supply store where you can purchase
them inexpensively.
</P>
<P>
   Figure out what will fit on the table with the centerpiece and
where you plan to serve the meal (from a separate sideboard or
table) as well as if you need to borrow chairs or move any
furniture to make extra room in the serving and dining area.
</P>
<P>
   4. Although it sounds silly, tape your complete menu (including
beverages and appetizers) on the fridge (and refer to it!) to be
sure you serve everything you make, advised Rodgers. ``There are
lots of dishes served on Thanksgiving, and it's easy to forget
something.'' More than once, after the meal, Rodgers has found a
bowl of cranberry sauce hidden in the refrigerator, as his guests
have been too polite to ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   5. Consider logistics, oven, stove-top and refrigerator space.
Make a cooking timetable, advised Rodgers. ``Nothing is more
satisfying than marking something off the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Balance your menu with dishes that need to be reheated in the
oven and items that can be made on top of the stove or in the
microwave. ``People often forget that if you have just one oven,
you can't cram six casseroles in it.'' Rodgers recalled the last
time, four years ago, that he was cooking Thanksgiving dinner at
his parents' house in Castro Valley, Calif. ``People thought they
were being helpful by bringing dishes - and everything had to be
done in the oven.'' Rodgers made the best of the situation and
reheated his brother's green bean bake in a skillet stove-top, then
returned the mixture to the casserole, added the topping and
broiled it to make it look like it had been baked.
</P>
<P>
   6. Always serve a colorful menu - liven up some of the dishes
with some bright reds and greens - with different textures and
flavors, noted Rodgers. Also keep the garnishes simple. ``I do
edible garnishes - like placing the turkey on raw curly kale and
decorating it with lady apples, baby pears and tiny Indian corn or
gourds. Don't try to carve the bird with the garnishes on the
platter,'' he cautioned, adding that you should set them aside
first.
</P>
<P>
   7. Take the garnished turkey to the table to show it off prior
to returning to the kitchen and carving it. Remember to let the
bird rest at least 30 minutes before carving to allow the juices to
retract back into the meat and keep the oven free for reheating
those casseroles your friends brought. Rodgers prefers to serve the
white and dark on separate platters.
</P>
<P>
   8. People think turkeys take forever to cook, noted Rodgers,
adding that it is not true. ``A turkey takes about 15 minutes a
pound to roast at 325 degrees F. So, even if you have a 25-pounder
and want to serve dinner at 4 p.m., you can shove it in the oven at
9 a.m. and still have plenty of time for roasting and the resting
period.''
</P>
<P>
   9. Use a fresh turkey. ``There is only one kind of turkey - a
fresh turkey - as far as I'm concerned,'' pointed out Rodgers. ``I
have tasted many turkeys side by side, and frozen turkeys are
usually much drier because turkeys are very lean and don't freeze
as well as chickens. If you're a really good cook, fresh is the way
to go. If you're an inexperienced cook, it is hard to mess up a
self-basting, fresh turkey.'' However, Rodgers is quick to point
out that you must avoid overcooking a turkey. And by all means
don't torture the turkey by steaming it in a cooking bag. Rodgers'
Perfect Roast Turkey recipe solves the problem of the lean turkey
breast drying out by covering it with foil to protect it from the
oven heat.
</P>
<P>
   10. Let your friends help you. ``Even if they're not good cooks,
they can help you set the table,'' advised Rodgers. Although
Rodgers isn't fond of potluck-style contributions (he prefers to be
in complete charge of the menu), if you must go this route and want
people to bring items, be as specific as possible to avoid having
people bring anything and changing their minds at the last minute.
For instance, ``tell a friend to bring two bottles of cabernet
sauvignon and don't spend more than $10 a bottle. Don't just say
bring wine.''
</P>
<P>
   If people want to cook, assign them a dish according to their
cooking skills and give them the actual recipe. Friends will be
relieved, as they don't have to fret about their contribution.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ When top executives of Lightspeed
International, a maker of software to manage voice transmission
over data networks, walked into the headquarters of Cisco Systems
Inc. last December, they were expecting to discuss a deal to let
Cisco license two of the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   But Michelangelo Volpi, vice president for business development
at Cisco _ the leading maker of electronic routers and other
devices that make up the complex hidden plumbing of the Internet _
had something else in mind. He wanted to buy Lightspeed.
</P>
<P>
   With the fresh backing of Cisco chief executive John Chambers,
who had earlier opposed a takeover of the company, Volpi cut right
to the chase. Within three hours both sides had agreed to terms.
And Lightspeed's managers did not even bother to tell other suitors
before the buyout was announced a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't feel the need to go to anyone else,'' said Lev
Volftsun, then Lightspeed's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   And why would they? After all, not only is Volpi, who is just
31, uncommonly aggressive in going after what he wants; he is also
dealing in one of the most valuable currencies in the technology
business today _ Cisco stock. The shares Volftsun and his
colleagues received in return for selling their company, worth $160
million when they announced the deal, are now valued at more than
$320 million. Indeed, Cisco's performance in the market the last
few years has been nothing short of phenomenal: It is up 467
percent since the beginning of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That has made Volpi one of the most influential deal-makers in
technology, in many ways more powerful than the myriad investment
bankers and venture capitalists plying their trade in Silicon
Valley. He has been instrumental in negotiations for 27 of the 29
companies acquired since 1993 by Cisco _ one of the most active
companies in pursuing acquisitions. You can bet his phone calls are
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Investment banks peddle him clients, venture capitalists bring
start-ups to his attention, and entrepreneurs happily trade
autonomy for a little piece of Cisco. ``His interest or noninterest
means a lot to people,'' said Vinod Khosla, a venture capitalist at
Kleiner, Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers. ``He wields power.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's approach to acquisitions is simple: Whatever research
and development its engineers cannot create in-house, it buys. That
pays off in a variety of ways. A start-up company on the verge of
releasing a new product, for instance, will see it explode onto the
market _ under the Cisco name. Cisco also uses acquisitions to gain
talent for its entire organization. A case in point is Judy Estrin,
a founder of Bridge Communications, who became Cisco's chief
technology officer after the company earlier this year acquired
Precept Software, where she worked.
</P>
<P>
   Volpi was not always so popular. In his early days at Cisco _ he
started four years ago, an eon in the hyper-speed world of Silicon
Valley _ Volpi had trouble completing proposed deals, said Barry
Eggers, who hired Volpi for his staff when he ran the acquisitions
effort for Cisco. His ``outward confidence,'' said Eggers, now a
venture capitalist at Weiss, Peck &AMP; Greer Venture Partners, was
mistaken at times for arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important part of his development is that he learned
power doesn't come from telling people you are powerful,'' Eggers
added. ``He went from being a guy driving the deal from his side of
the table to the guy who understood the deal from the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Cisco's recent acquisition of Selsius Systems, a
Dallas-based affiliate of Lagardere, a French military and media
holding company. When Volpi walked into Selsius' small conference
room the morning of Oct. 13 to complete the deal, the lawyers were
still bickering over minor points, such as what would happen to
shares of stock held jointly by an employee and spouse in the event
the employee died.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of frustration,'' said Daniel Scheinman, vice
president for legal and government affairs at Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   Volpi spent the morning on the phone with Scheinman, who was in
Washington for meetings with the Federal Trade Commission, and with
the company's accountants. But as the discussions with the other
side became testier, Volpi finally pulled aside Jacques Payer, an
executive representing Largardere, for a private conversation. ``I
said something like, `Jacques, we have a handshake,''' Volpi
recalled. ``Let's get over this and sit down and get this deal
done.'' Within a half-hour, Volpi compromised on some points,
signed the documents and was back home in time to attend his wife's
childbirth class.
</P>
<P>
   Volpi is refreshingly candid, a welcome surprise at a
corporation that zealously guards its public image. A spokeswoman
for Cisco, for example, initially demanded to listen in on
interviews with some of Volpi's personal friends. When that failed,
these friends were counseled by e-mail on how to answer questions.
By contrast, Volpi encouraged his friends to speak freely.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he had anything to worry about. Jane Schuchinski, who
met Volpi on their first day of orientation at Stanford Business
School in 1992, was gushing in her praise. ``He makes the best
risotto in the world!'' blurted Ms. Schuchinski, who is chief
executive of a small software start-up in New Jersey and stays
frequently with Volpi and his wife, Toni, at their Los Altos home
when she visits Silicon Valley. Volpi spent an evening recently
advising her on how to handle the next day's business meetings.
``Mike said, `The best you can do is go in and be true to yourself
and everything will be fine,''' she recalled. ``That is how he runs
his life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpi was born in Milan, Italy. His father is a bank executive,
his mother a journalist. When he was 6, his family moved to Japan,
where he attended a private Roman Catholic boys school. There he
perfected the two additional languages _ Japanese and English _
that he knows besides Italian. In 1984, he left Japan for Stanford
University to study mechanical engineering. (He got bachelor's and
master's degrees.) After a brief stint at Hewlett-Packard, he went
to business school and ended up at Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite his first-class American higher education, Volpi is not
fully acculturated. ``One funny thing is all the innuendos about
American television shows he doesn't get,'' said Gene Frantz, a
business school friend. ```The Brady Bunch'? He has no ability to
relate to it at all. Cartoons? He does not get it.'' When told of
the comment, Volpi, still an Italian citizen, laughed in response.
``That's OK; they don't get my cartoon, either.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Volpi avoids Silicon Valley's trendier byways.
``Mike just does his job and goes home and lives a reasonable
life,'' said Gregory Waldorf, an institutional money manager at
Pacific Edge Investment Management in Palo Alto, Calif. ``That's a
powerful contrast to investment bankers in Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, Volpi and his team have been on an
acquisition spree, buying eight to 10 companies each year. The
companies are typically small in size, usually valued between $50
million and $300 million. And many of their recommendations for
acquisitions come from customers.
</P>
<P>
   The March acquisition of Netspeed, a maker of products that give
users high-speed Internet access at home, is an example. Solomon
Trujillo, chief executive of US West, the regional phone company,
called Chambers earlier this year to suggest he buy Netspeed, Volpi
said. US West wanted to buy Netspeed's products, but did not want
to rely on a small supplier. ``Chambers said our customer is
willing to write a purchase order,'' Volpi recalled. ``You have to
do it.'' The acquisition was announced in March.
</P>
<P>
   Volpi also keeps open a constant dialogue with Silicon Valley
venture capitalists. ``The tough part is figuring out whom you
trust and whom you don't,'' he said. ``If you can't trust them the
first time around, you quit sharing information.'' And he practices
what he preaches. Recently, Khosla of Kleiner Perkins asked Volpi
why he had not talked to one of his companies before acquiring
Netspeed. Instead of dodging the question, Volpi explained the US
West connection. ``Even when I'm competing I can trust him to be
straight,'' Khosla said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Volpi is straightforward, he does not volunteer
competitive information. ``If you see he hasn't returned your calls
for a few days and then you read in the newspaper he bought your
competitor,'' said Rob Soni, a partner at Bessemer Venture
Partners, ``then you probably don't care for him too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Cisco's acquisitions have been home runs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Granite Systems, a company started by Andreas
Bechtolshiem, founder of Sun Microsystems, and which Cisco paid
$220 million in stock to buy, has not turned out to be a
blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   And Cisco's unusual decision to back a start-up with the express
intent of buying it has not worked out as well as expected. ``We
had an idea about the product, and we wanted it fast and in Cisco
mode,'' Volpi said. Cisco made an early investment in the company,
Ardent Communications, a maker of integrated voice, video and data
equipment to hook up company branches with headquarters. It
garnered two seats on the board and worked closely with Ardent's
engineers. Volpi acknowledges now that Cisco micromanaged the
company too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tricky balance between telling them what you want and
letting them act as a start-up,'' he said. ``We tried to keep it
too tight and the product doesn't have the spark of a typical
start-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Cisco ran into trouble with the Federal Trade
Commission, which is investigating whether talks Cisco had with
Lucent Technologies and Northern Telecom Ltd. in 1997 constituted
an illegal effort to carve up the market for Internet equipment.
Scheinman said that Cisco, which denies any wrongdoing, was fully
cooperating with the investigation and had delivered two boxes of
documents to the FTC, including e-mail exchanges among the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his attempts to stay out of the limelight, Volpi seems
to attract a following all his own. At a charity auction last year,
a pair of Tigger the Tiger slippers he liked to wear at home sold
for $600. And the mother of one of his best friends bought Cisco
stock after Volpi told her over dinner in 1994 that he was taking a
job there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what Cisco does,'' said Vivian Schuchinski, the
mother of his friend Jane. ``But I wanted to buy a piece of Mike.''

A SAMSON WITH A BLACK BELT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARAH BRYAN MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The travel and the long hours were starting to catch up with
him; Jose Cura sounded low, gravelly and untenorial on a recent
morning. ``Excuse me,'' he growled, ``as I use my double-bass
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   But a tenor he is, and good news for opera fans. An Argentine
who once held a black belt in kung fu, he boasts a baritonal
timbre, secure technique and outstanding musicianship, combined
with the vocal strength to do the big roles of the French and
Italian repertories and a darkly handsome macho look to go with his
dark, macho sound.
</P>
<P>
   Now appearing at the Washington Opera as Samson in Saint-Saens'
kitschy classic ``Samson et Dalila,'' Cura has an impressive New
York Metropolitan Opera debut lined up, as Turiddu in ``Cavalleria
Rusticana'' (alongside Placido Domingo's Canio in ``I Pagliacci'')
on opening night next year.
</P>
<P>
   With his CD of Puccini arias (conducted by Domingo) selling
steadily, Erato has released two new recordings in which he is
prominently featured: ``Samson et Dalila,'' with Olga Borodina as
the Philistine seductress and Colin Davis conducting, and
``Anhelo,'' a collection of Argentine songs, which includes two
tunes composed by Cura. He also conducts the songs and is credited
with orchestration and cover design.
</P>
<P>
   Booked through 2004, Cura might seem to American audiences to
have sprung full-blown from Domingo's international Operalia
competition, which he won in 1994. Cura disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working, studying, doing this kind of thing since I
was 12, and I'm 35 today,'' he said. ``I'm pretty solid in this
career. I'm not the kind of singer who comes from nowhere and
cracks under the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cura began his musical studies as a classical guitarist, then
moved to conducting and composition. While studying choral
conducting in his mid-20s, he sang in choruses and, he says,
learned vocal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the conservatory in his hometown, Rosario,
Argentina, encouraged him to study voice, and he soon left for
Europe to pursue a career.
</P>
<P>
   A series of small breaks, gradually leading to international
attention, brought Cura his current success. In 1995 he opened a
Verdi festival at Covent Garden, in place of Jose Carreras, and
caught the notice of recording executives.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligent and articulate, Cura seems aware of his limitations
and wary of hype. ``It is lucky that it was not one big
explosion,'' he said. ``If you do a big noise once, you are
expected to do that all the time, and if you don't do it the next
time, they say you are going down.''
</P>
<P>
   He bristled when asked about the inevitable comparisons with
Domingo, another baritonal tenor who sings the big roles and
conducts on the side. ``He has taken an interest in my career, and
that is flattering and nice,'' Cura said. ``When one of the winners
of his contest is making a big international career, it is natural
for him to be proud and helpful. When he said that he believed in
Cura, that Cura was a great artist, that was helpful to my
reputation. The danger is that some people said that Cura was
singing only because Domingo was pushing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Cura's talents should be judged on their own merits, Domingo
insists. ``Without any doubt, Jose is one of the most exciting
tenors of the new generation for his vocal and artistic qualities
and his musicality,'' Domingo said. ``He is a `must' tenor for any
major opera company.''
</P>
<P>
   But is Cura ready for heavy roles? He believes he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every tenor, when young, dreams about tackling the big roles,
the big heroes,'' he said. ``Of course that ruins careers when you
sing only for wanting to do it and not because you are ready. So
every time one tries it, they say, `Oh, another one who's going to
burn his wings.' Almost 30 years ago, when Placido did Otello, they
said he was going to ruin his career. They are so demanding, these
roles, that even if you have the voice for the roles, if you don't
have the technique, you will burn the voice. It is a combination of
both things, the voice and the intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   He is dubious, however, about moving into German repertory. ``I
put a great amount of effort in acting on stage, to be as
believable as I can, and for that you need to master the language,
the nuances of the language,'' he said. ``If you can't do that, you
will never be believable on stage. If I could ever become as fluent
in German as I am in English, then maybe I would tackle a German
role.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he should have plenty of work in the French and
Italian repertory. His new recording as Samson is ruggedly sung.
Inspiring as he leads the Israelites into battle, convincingly
abject in defeat, Cura gives a strong performance. ``Anhelo''
(``Intense Desire'') shows a different side of his vocal
personality, softer, introspective and less prone to sustained high
notes.
</P>
<P>
   Cura, who lives outside Paris with his wife and three children,
is a sports fan and was once a semiprofessional athlete. As a
former martial-arts trainer and rugby player, he appreciates the
sacrifices athletes make. ``I know how much you have to suffer to
get those results,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has given up the guitar for lack of time, he
continues to conduct. ``That was really my origin as a musician,
something I don't like to lose,'' he said. ``In the past it was not
easy to get an orchestra. Now it is much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other tenors of his generation, Cura must deal with
``fourth tenor'' pressure. He dismisses the label, yet it doesn't
bother him. ``If you analyze it, you realize it's a way for the
press to tell people what kind of level you are at,'' he said.
``It's just media shorthand.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he have particular goals in mind? ``There are no real goals
in a career,'' he replied. ``You have to analyze and study and take
what is right for you. When you have two proposals every day and
each can take you in a completely different direction, you make a
choice, and that leads to other decisions. You can make a career,
or burn out in a couple of years. It all depends on whether you're
intelligent or not.''

 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Vladimir and Estragon of Andrei Belgrader's
elegiac new production of ``Waiting for Godot'' are so aware of the
proximity of death that it seems at times as if they're tiptoeing
between cemetery plots.
</P>
<P>
   Beckett's bleak masterpiece is in fact partly a meditation on
the tragic brevity of life: ``They give birth astride of a grave,
the light gleams an instant, then it's night once more,'' goes the
haunting line spoken by the slaveowner Pozzo to the famous hobos
trapped in that notorious no man's land, waiting day after day for
the redeemer who never comes.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Shalhoub and John Turturro, playing Vladimir and Estragon
in the Classic Stage Company's solemn revival of this actors'
favorite, which opened Wednesday night, take these words as gospel.
As a result, this ``Godot'' is one mournful waiting room. Their
tramps are conscious at all times of the gravity of their
existential plight: no statement is expressed without careful
forethought, no action undertaken that does not imply sober
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, Turturro's Estragon attempts the task of
removing his tight boot, his acrobatics are as painstakingly
plotted as those of a Cirque du Soleil contortionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waiting for Godot'' unfortunately can invite a certain
sobriety. It's an elliptical tragicomedy that wrestles with really
Big Questions, like the meaning of everything; think of Nietzsche
and Einstein up there, doing two and a half hours of stand-up. The
danger for actors is becoming too enamored of the play's
big-picture concerns about existence, when it's the challenges of
everyday existence, like finding a pair of comfortable boots, that
are what keep us entertained, if you will, that keep us from
thinking too much about life's essential absurdity.
</P>
<P>
   Shalhoub and Turturro, thoughtful, sensitive stage actors who
have found success on television and in the movies, seem humbled by
Beckett's mysterious play. In Belgrader's reverential
interpretation, they display the symptoms of a severe case of
significance. It's not fatal to the production: both deliver
admirably pared-down portrayals, devoid of famous-actor's ego. But
the quasi-religious tone does tend to s-s-l-l-o-o-w-w things down
quite a bit, especially in a protracted first act that almost seems
a real-time re-enactment of the tramps' eternal vigil.
</P>
<P>
   When they pick up the pace in the second act, when at last Didi
and Gogo, as they call one another, embrace and gaze into each
other's eyes and really converse, ``Godot'' not only quickens, it
becomes sharper and more amusing. For although Belgrader is intent
on a faithful reproduction, his overly academic approach up to then
has taken a lot of the snap out of the play and makes that barren
country road, adorned by a single naked tree, seem a pretty windy
place.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Godot'' is the first offering by Classic Stage under its
new artistic director, Barry Edelstein, who directed a much-admired
``All My Sons'' for the Williamstown Theater Festival and the
Roundabout Theater Company. Clearly, Edelstein is making a
statement, setting off with a play that ranked in a recent Royal
National Theater poll as one of the most important dramas of the
20th century. And he is to be commended for beginning his tenure by
attracting such a first-rate cast, which also includes Christopher
Lloyd as Pozzo and Richard Spore as the human workhorse, Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Now, his stellar players should all take deep breaths and relax.
``Waiting for Godot'' does not have to be a portentous event. As
was demonstrated recently in a cheeky and fully alive version of
the play by the Studio Theater in Washington, ``Godot'' can seem as
biting and fresh as improvisational comedy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Joy Zinoman, the Studio's director, took liberties
with the text that got her into hot water for a spell with
skeptical representatives of Beckett's estate _ the actors' ad-libs
sparked a public debate over how much control a dead playwright's
agents can exercise over how his plays are interpreted _ but she
did not alter its meaning. What she did was in full service of the
master of the absurd, reinforcing the lasting relevance and
elasticity of his vision.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrader, of course, takes a more conservative approach here,
more reserved by far than, say, the Mike Nichols 1988 all-star
version for Lincoln Center Theater with Robin Williams and Steve
Martin. But his scrupulous efforts at deriving meaning sap the play
of a good portion of its humor and theatricality. Why, for example,
would he have Spore try to make sense of Lucky's amazing nonsense
aria? The emaciated Spore, tethered to the rope carried by Lloyd,
is a freakish fright of a Lucky, an apparition conjured in one of
those hallucinatory episodes of ``Twin Peaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, Lucky's monologue of gobbledygook, prompted by
Pozzo's command that he ``Think!,'' is delivered in a burst of
energy, gushing forth like the contents of a broken fire hydrant.
It's the only way that it's funny. Here, Spore labors over every
word of the speech, as if trying to divine some rationale for it,
and it falls completely flat. By the end, Shalhoub and Turturro
become our surrogates, gesturing madly at Lucky to get on with it.
No one in the audience would disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd, with those wild eyes and the voice of the leader of a
chain gang, can be a wonderfully menacing presence on a stage, and
his gargoyle-like Pozzo is definitely the sort of bully that
Vladimir and Estragon would be cowed by. But as with Spore, there
is no lightness of being in his performance; the underlying
music-hall smoothness of Pozzo _ he's costumed here as a ringmaster
_ eludes Lloyd, who is playing someone close to his evil character
in ``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with these maddeningly half-realized creations, Shalhoub
and Turturro are pressed to fully occupy the play's emotional
center. Given time, they begin to find their way toward one
another. (They could even pass for brothers).
</P>
<P>
   Shalhoub's placid Didi is the more refined of the two, with the
suggestion of education in his clipped delivery and his more
decisive manner: it is he, after all, who gets the message from
Godot to wait, for reasons forever unknown, on this road halfway to
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Turturro, so expert at wired outsiders, like the angry,
cast-aside contestant in the movie ``Quiz Show,'' here strips away
the bravado and plays Gogo as a blue-collar naif, with the trace of
a New York accent and an unassuming air. This simplicity is the
most rewarding aspect of this ``Godot.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Shalhoub, he's at his best when he's treating Beckett's
language as an actor's fuel, and not as if it had been inscribed on
tablets and handed down from the mountaintop.
</P>

 &HT;    Juveniles receiving abusive justice, Amnesty International says
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In Georgia and across the country, juvenile justice
systems routinely violate the rights of children in custody,
inflicting beatings and other cruel punishments, Amnesty
International said in a report issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The international human rights group said federal, state and
local governments in the United States have drastically stepped up
the severity of punishments imposed on offenders under 18 in the
last generation.
</P>
<P>
   Society should focus instead on prevention, education and
rehabilitation, the group said, along with the head of a Georgia
advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many children are incarcerated when other action could or
should have been taken,'' said Pamela Johnson of the Amnesty
International's Southern Regional Office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Betraying the Young: Children in the U.S.
Justice System,'' is part of Amnesty's yearlong, worldwide campaign
focusing on issues in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia ranks among the worst states for juvenile justice, but
no state in the country provides the proper programs well, said
Richard L. McDevitt, president of the Georgia Alliance for
Children.
</P>
<P>
   McDevitt called Georgia's juvenile justice system
``state-sponsored child abuse'' and ``an incubator'' for adult
crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``To prevent adult crime, you have to start with juveniles,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the U.S. Justice Department reported it found ``a
pattern of egregious conditions violating the federal rights of
youths'' in Georgia's detention centers. Among other problems, it
said, youths were routinely abused and lacked proper educational
facilities and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The state agreed in March to spend $65 million over the next
three years to relieve overcrowding and improve education and
programs for mental and medical care.

 &HT;    Microsoft faces multisided challenge
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT-JAVA (moved). Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With its $280 billion market capitalization at
risk, an embattled Microsoft Corp. fought Wednesday to defend its
formidable Windows franchise on several legal and political fronts.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth week of a historic antitrust trial, Microsoft
lawyers sought to turn the tables on the government prosecutors by
charging that some of the biggest names in the software industry,
led by IBM Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsystems Inc., had
recently formed a secret pact to promote the Java programming
language in a bid to break Microsoft's Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial probably has many more weeks to run, Microsoft
has seemingly decided that its best defense is a strong offense.
</P>
<P>
   That decision may have been reinforced by a ruling Tuesday in
another federal courtroom 3,000 miles away, one that obliges that
company to rewrite parts of Windows 98 code to conform to Sun's
version of Java.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
promptly branded the Java ruling a major victory for the Justice
Department's separate antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that senior executives at Microsoft will begin to see
that, in the end, the facts and the law will prevail over its
public relations campaign and muddled defenses,'' Hatch said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Hatch had blasted Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in a
contentious hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The trial became even more contentious Wednesday when Microsoft
lawyer Steve Holley concluded his cross-examination of John
Soyring, a government witness from IBM, by asking him: ``Do you
think it's appropriate for IBM and Sun, who hold themselves out to
be major competitors, to collude with one another?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Objection,'' thundered Steve Houck, as assistant attorney
general from New York, who was handling this aspect of the massive
case on behalf of the 20 states that have joined the Justice
Department in challenging Microsoft's business conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustained,'' said U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
who is trying the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-bounds comment was based on an e-mail that Microsoft
had unearthed from John Thompson of IBM, the firm's top software
gun, to Scott McNealy, the top figure at Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must engage our other partners to bundle (Netscape)
Navigator and/or Java compatible JVM's (Java virtual machines) with
their products,'' Thompson wrote on Aug. 13, two months before the
Microsoft trial began.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Holley asked IBM's Soyring whether the combined
power of the half-dozen companies cited in the IBM note to Sun ``do
not in every respect dwarf that of Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In every respect but market capitalization,'' Soyring said.
</P>
<P>
   With five witnesses already under its belt, the government is
now set to move to the heart of its antitrust case by calling as
its top expert witness Frederick Warren-Boulton, a consultant who
served as the Justice Department's chief antitrust economist during
the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will be significantly harmed if Microsoft succeeds
in crushing the cross-platform threat that independent browsers
pose to the Windows operating system monopoly,'' Warren-Boulton
wrote in an 89-page statement released as his direct testimony in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee, of course, that independent browsers
will bring these benefits or reduce the monopoly power of Microsoft
in the operating system market, even if Microsoft did not engage in
exclusionary conduct. That is a matter for the market _ not
monopolists or engineers or economists _ to decide,'' he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With its $280 billion market capitalization at
risk, an embattled Microsoft Corp. fought Wednesday to defend its
formidable Windows franchise on several legal and political fronts.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth week of a historic antitrust trial, Microsoft
lawyers sought to turn the tables on the government prosecutors by
charging that some of the biggest names in the software industry,
led by IBM Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc., Microsystems Inc., had
recently formed a secret pact to promote the Java programming
language in a bid to break Microsoft's Windows monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   While the trial probably has many more weeks to run, Microsoft
has seemingly decided that its best defense is a strong offense.
</P>
<P>
   That decision may have been reinforced by a ruling Tuesday in
another federal courtroom 3,000 miles away, one that obliges that
company to rewrite parts of Windows 98 code to conform to Sun's
version of Java.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
promptly branded the Java ruling a major victory for the Justice
Department's separate antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that senior executives at Microsoft will begin to see
that, in the end, the facts and the law will prevail over its
public relations campaign and muddled defenses,'' Hatch said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Hatch had blasted Microsoft chairman Bill Gates in a
contentious hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The trial became even more contentious Wednesday when Microsoft
lawyer Steve Holley concluded his cross-examination of John
Soyring, a government witness from IBM, by asking him: ``Do you
think it's appropriate for IBM and Sun, who hold themselves out to
be major competitors, to collude with one another?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Objection,'' thundered Steve Houck, as assistant attorney
general from New York, who was handling this aspect of the massive
case on behalf of the 20 states that have joined the Justice
Department in challenging Microsoft's business conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sustained,'' said U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson,
who is trying the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The out-of-bounds comment was based on an e-mail that Microsoft
had unearthed from John Thompson of IBM, the firm's top software
gun, to Scott McNealy, the top figure at Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must engage our other partners to bundle (Netscape)
Navigator and/or Java compatible JVM's (Java virtual machines) with
their products,'' Thompson wrote on Aug. 13, two months before the
Microsoft trial began.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Holley asked IBM's Soyring whether the combined
power of the half-dozen companies cited in the IBM note to Sun ``do
not in every respect dwarf that of Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In every respect but market capitalization,'' Soyring said.
</P>
<P>
   With five witnesses already under its belt, the government is
now set to move to the heart of its antitrust case by calling as
its top expert witness Frederick Warren-Boulton, a consultant who
served as the Justice Department's chief antitrust economist during
the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will be significantly harmed if Microsoft succeeds
in crushing the cross-platform threat that independent browsers
pose to the Windows operating system monopoly,'' Warren-Boulton
wrote in an 89-page statement released as his direct testimony in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no guarantee, of course, that independent browsers
will bring these benefits or reduce the monopoly power of Microsoft
in the operating system market, even if Microsoft did not engage in
exclusionary conduct. That is a matter for the market _ not
monopolists or engineers or economists _ to decide,'' he said.

AUSTRALIANS TAKE PART IN A SHOWER OF STRAUSS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)  (js) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is it related to the shower of Leonid meteors, this
odd confluence of dubious works by Richard Strauss? Edo de Waart
and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra presented the ``Symphonia
Domestica'' at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening, a day before
Christian Thielemann and the New York Philharmonic were to begin a
run of performances of the ``Alpine Symphony'' at Avery Fisher
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect Straussians tend to melt before the homely pieties and
calculated impieties of the ``Domestica,'' but even they have
little but scorn for the grandiosity of the ``Alpine.'' This flawed
Straussian has always regarded the ``Alpine'' with a perverse
fondness and taken the ``Domestica,'' when necessary, through
gritted teeth. (Tortured memory has gone so far as to imagine the
clanging of actual pots and pans in the percussion, and its failure
to appear always provides some relief.)
</P>
<P>
   Atypically, a listener was tempted to wish for a less
adventurous program from the Sydney Symphony: one of the Beethoven
symphonies it played over the weekend at the Tilles Center in
Brookville, N.Y., perhaps, in view of its captivating performances
of two Beethoven symphonies recorded live in June by the Australian
Broadcasting Company.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra did offer Beethoven of a more discreet kind _ the
Second Piano Concerto, with Christian Zacharias as soloist _ and
the crisp performance bore out the promise of those recordings.
Zacharias fitted in comfortably, coloring a fine, unbroken line
with an imaginative array of touches and sonorities.
</P>
<P>
   It was an excellent idea, too, to bring along an Australian
work, if a piece inspired by Les Baxter, Henry Mancini and John
Barry (and surely Bernstein's ``West Side Story,'' though the
composer doesn't say so) can be so described. Graeme Koehne's
``Elevator Music,'' his program note suggests, seeks to restore the
good name of ``music which serves to give pleasure to `ordinary'
people,'' and it makes for a pleasant enough way to spend 10
minutes. It also affords a thorough workout for the orchestra, and
here, as in the Beethoven, the Sydney players, obviously well
trained by de Waart, their chief conductor, produced an impressive
corporate sound.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the Strauss with its greater extremes and individual
demands did weaknesses show: a shrillness in the highest string
playing; thin and wavering tone from several soloists. Still, there
was nothing so bad that it might not have been concealed by a
cannier, not to say better, choice of repertory.

 &HT;    Forbes examines 'promise and threat' of the Internet
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Given the recent resurgence of Internet stocks,
Fortune (Dec. 7) displays good timing with a package of stories on
what it calls ``the promise and threat'' of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine starts by declaring the Internet ``will empower
consumers like nothing else ever has,'' and cites this as evidence:
``Already 16 percent of car buyers shop online before showing up at
a dealership, and they aren't comparing paint jobs _ they're arming
themselves with information on dealer costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' point is while the Internet is good for consumers, it
makes life harder for businesses, and the latter needs to learn to
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   Discount broker Charles Schwab is one business that has embraced
the Internet. In three years, it has gone from handling no
transactions over the Internet to handling trades on $4 billion
worth of securities a week, according to Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   All the world's a stage
</P>
<P>
   The story lines in the Nov. 23 issue of Business Week run from
Hollywood to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The cover report is about Steven P. Jobs' efforts to turn Pixar,
the animation studio, into the ``next Disney.'' In the same edition
is a report card on Asia. Business Week's conclusion: A complete
recovery is months away, and some countries are doing better than
others, but the ``region's harrowing economic free fall is nearing
bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately speaking
</P>
<P>
   Forbes (Nov. 30) is out with its list of the biggest private
companies in the United States, based on revenue. There are no
changes at the very top, with Cargill No. 1, followed by Koch
Industries and Atlanta's United Parcel Service. Forbes' list of 500
companies includes 17 based in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Worth a second look
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit a brick wall at 125 miles per hour, you have to
pick yourself up and go around it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's money manager Gavin Rankin's comment on dealing with the
thrashing the collapse of the Russian economy has given to
Lexington Troika Dialog Russia, last year's hottest mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   That story, and another offering advice on mortgage refinancing,
make the December issue of Money worth reading for more than just
the retirement planning guide.

 &HT;    Delta gives non-union workers pay raise
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Non-union Delta Air Lines workers will get an 8
percent pay boost on Jan. 1, but the raises will be partly offset
by the termination of a profit-sharing plan for those workers.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, Atlanta's largest private employer, also has
offered to restore a 2 percent pay cut for unionized pilots 16
months ahead of schedule. Pilots would continue to receive
profit-sharing payouts at 6 percent of salary.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were announced Wednesday in what Chief Executive Leo
Mullin called ``significant and positive changes to (Delta's)
compensation program.''
</P>
<P>
   They follow a $1 billion profit in the fiscal year ended June
30. Mullin and other top executives already have received hefty
bonuses for the strong financial results, which capped a rebound
from hard times earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Wage boosts have been scarce for Delta's non-union workers in
the '90s, although the profit-sharing plan was added in 1995 and
produced payouts of 6 percent of base pay in the last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said profit-sharing will be scrapped for non-union workers
at the end of this year, with a final payout covering the first
half of the current July-June 1999 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 1, profit-sharing will be supplanted by a 6
percent wage hike, with an additional 2 percent boost added for an
8 percent net wage increase.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot pay changes are structured differently because of the
union contract, but they are intended to have the same effect.
Delta's Air Line Pilots Association unit has been seeking a
midcontract pay boost for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ALPA leaders must approve the company's offer and will take it
up next month, a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mullin, in an employee memo, said the conversion of
profit-sharing to a pay boost provides more security for most
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recession is a real possibility, and such economic conditions
can alter the value of variable compensation elements such as
profit-sharing,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Extra boosts will go to flight attendants and mechanics who
``have fallen below competitive compensation,'' according to the
memo. It said the changes will leave those workers, along with
reservationists and airport agents, at the top of the industry
based on top-of-scale wage rates at major carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, high wages have helped Delta remain the
least-unionized major airline. But two unions are courting flight
attendants, and one of them, the Transport Workers Union, also is
trying to organize ramp workers and mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of employees know the reason this came about was
the organizing efforts,'' said Jeff Osborne, a TWU organizer. He
said the plan amounts to only a 2 percent boost for non-union
workers, once profit-sharing is eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne said workers are concerned about other issues, such as
retirement benefits.

`MADAMA BUTTERFLY': FROM UPSTATE, STAGED STRIKINGLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The cooperative arrangement between the Glimmerglass
Opera and the New York City Opera whereby new productions are first
tried out at the Cooperstown, N.Y., summer company and then brought
to New York makes a lot of sense. But sometimes productions that
seemed ideally suited to the 900-seat Glimmerglass house have
looked a bit lost in the 2,730-seat New York State Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite is true of the director Mark Lamos' production of
Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly,'' which was introduced at
Glimmerglass in 1997 and opened at the New York City Opera on
Tuesday night, replacing the company's 30-year-old Frank Corsaro
production.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas at Glimmerglass this scenically abstract production
seemed dominated by an imposing set of stairs that crossed the
entire stage, at the New York State Theater the stairs seemed just
one component of Michael Yeargan's set, and Lamos' directorial
concept came through affectingly.
</P>
<P>
   The house overlooking Nagasaki harbor that Pinkerton, the U.S.
naval officer, has leased for his new child bride, Butterfly, is
suggested by the aqua-greenish stairs, and a series of large
translucent panels that can be slid open and shut like traditional
Japanese paper walls. Robert Wierzel's lighting allows the set and
sky to mingle in strikingly abstract ways, though the costumes by
Constance Hoffman are appropriate to the turn-of-the century
period.
</P>
<P>
   The set allows Lamos to position the singers dramatically at
different heights and distances. That said, it is still hard not to
notice the singers being careful as they climb up and down, and
when, for example, we see Butterfly sleeping on a stair, it takes
some effort to accept the abstractions. But it is worth the effort,
for the staging rescues this opera from the fusty realism and
chintzy exotica that mar other productions. And Lamos is a
sensitive director of singers.
</P>
<P>
   As Butterfly, the performance of the Ukrainian soprano Oksana
Krovytska was deeply moving, though uneven. Her voice sometimes had
a grainy quality, and her low range was patchy. However, her sound
was distinctive, she brought a wide range of expressive colors to
her singing and her phrasing was often elegant. Most important, Ms.
Krovytska movingly inhabited the role.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton was sung on short notice by the young American tenor
Barton Green (covering for the indisposed Alfredo Portilla). This
was Green's company debut, though he is to sing Pinkerton during
the spring season. The handsome young tenor brought his attractive
lyric voice to the role. If his sound was sometimes not full-bodied
enough for this ardent verismo opera, he wisely did not push his
voice and kept his singing clear and lyrical.
</P>
<P>
   The mezzo-soprano Kathryn Honan-Carter, also in her company
debut, was a very sympathetic Suzuki. The fine baritone James
Maddalena was excellent as the U.S. consul Sharpless, so confounded
by Pinkerton's manipulative treatment of Butterfly. The tenor John
Daniecki was an appropriately slimy Goro, the marriage counselor.
</P>
<P>
   Guido Johannes Rumstadt, a young German conductor, made an
impressive company debut, leading a dramatically taut yet lyrically
generous performance. Overall, this second look at a new production
in a more appropriate space was a revelation.

 &HT;    The haunted heroine
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS AND ILLUSTRATIONS
 &HT;    By Gary M. Pomerantz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robin Fech had tried once to get back into an
airplane. But she made it only as far as the flight attendant's
jump seat near the door.
</P>
<P>
   She kept that door open _ and left through it when fear overcame
her.
</P>
<P>
   Her psychotherapist's plan was to slowly desensitize Fech to an
airplane so she could fly again. First she did nothing more than
park at the Macon airport to watch planes take off and land. Next
she walked into the terminal. The first time she moved onto the
tarmac, she cried.
</P>
<P>
   It was so unlike the person she had been, so full of sass and
moxie that she once explained her nature with the laugh line, ``I
don't get my panties in a wad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now each step toward recovery revived the terror. She couldn't
so much as use a curling iron without being reminded of the smell
of fire.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a month passed before Fech could step into an empty
Brasilia identical to the crash plane and stay awhile.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, she did a necessary thing. She sat in each of the 30
seats. Closing her eyes, she tried to become the passengers who
fell from the sky with her.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted to know what they had felt in the last nine minutes
and 20 seconds of Atlantic Southeast Airlines Flight 529.
</P>
<P>
   At home, Fech had diagramed the seat assignments. She knew
Jennifer Grunbeck was in 4B, Jean Brucato in 4C. She'd drawn
squiggly lines where the fuselage had broken in the ill-fated row
five, where Jim Kennedy and Bond Rhue sat.
</P>
<P>
   In seat 4A, she was Ed Gray, the Connecticut businessman. She
looked out the window, as Gray had done after hearing the propeller
break loose and lodge against the front edge of the wing. Yes, Gray
could see what no passenger ever wants to see.
</P>
<P>
   Now, alone in row eight, Fech saw again the young David
Schneider, bursting with confidence. He promised to open his
emergency door once the plane was on the ground, and she knew he
meant it.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the back row in 10B, she saw an older
African-American woman standing beside her seat, turning in a
circle. Lucille Burton had been confused.
</P>
<P>
   From her diagrams, Fech knew that most of the passengers in the
back three rows had perished.
</P>
<P>
   She closed her eyes and saw them all again, alive and afraid,
just as they were before the pine trees and the field.
</P>
<P>
   Only three months before the ASA crash, Fech's father died of
cancer. He had been a constant influence in her life, never more so
than during his absence throughout her formative years.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours after the crash, she was in a west Georgia
hospital talking about him to the attending physician. She was
suffering ``acute post-traumatic stress disorder,'' the physician
wrote in his report. ``On top of this, I believe this woman (h)as
some unresolved grief related to her own father's death in May.''
To break her cycle of agitation, he prescribed sedatives at fairly
high doses.
</P>
<P>
   How survivors respond to a crash depends upon who they were at
the time of the incident: their temperaments, life experiences and
coping skills.
</P>
<P>
   Experiencing emotional trauma once doesn't necessarily toughen
you for the next time. Sometimes it has the opposite effect: You
become more vulnerable, as if your reserve of strength has been
depleted.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after the crash and Duane Fech's death, and a
quarter-century after a divorce that took him away from her, Robin
Fech delicately touched an old photograph of her father. He looks
dashing as a young naval aviator in his hero suit. ``Isn't he
handsome? He was a glamour boy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   God, she missed him and wished she'd known him. She wanted the
thousand and more hugs any little girl would want from her daddy.
</P>
<P>
   But as Fech sees it, her daddy abandoned her during her
formative years after the divorce, when she was in high school. His
death was the final abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, Robin Fech believed her performance in the air
would have pleased her father. For once he would have been proud of
her. She had had a chance to reconcile with him before he died, but
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Now she thought, Damn him for dying!
</P>
<P>
   The crash did not merely change Robin Fech's life. It became her
life. She has thought about it by day, dreamed about it by night.
</P>
<P>
   For her steely performance in crisis, she has received hundreds
of admiring letters, including one that said, ``I revere you, Robin
Fech.'' Yet her emotions have played like a Rubik's cube, with that
old self-doubt refusing to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the crash is the only way she knows to get through
it.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, exhausted from her crash ruminations, have suggested
that Fech get on with her life. ``But they weren't there. They
don't understand,'' Fech says.
</P>
<P>
   Her passengers do understand. She keeps in touch with a handful
of them. Several have phoned to thank her for what she did; others
have written Christmas cards. (``You were instrumental in saving
many lives. Happy Holidays! Love, Tod and Pam Thompson.'') A few
she embraced during a brief reunion in the hayfield orchestrated by
a TV magazine show. She attended the New Orleans wedding of Angela
Brumfield.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Air Force Maj. Chuck LeMay, in his e-mails from
Nebraska, calls her ``Momma Hen.'' When a Comair plane crashed in a
Detroit snowstorm nearly two years ago _ another Brasilia, also
with 29 aboard, killing everyone _ Fech phoned several of her
passengers to see if they'd heard and wanted to talk.
</P>
<P>
   She searches still for new details about her crash. ``I think
there are a lot of secrets. People keep some things to themselves
because they think it's important,'' Fech says. ``But it's unfair.
Every passenger has something they are keeping to themselves.
Everybody who worked in the field through the emergency and after
the recovery is keeping things to themselves to avoid the hurt and
to avoid the gruesome details.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, more than two years after the crash, Fech
returned to work at ASA in the Macon office, part time. She
answered phones. But that proved too much. She got nervous and
discombobulated. Her job was simplified to filing.
</P>
<P>
   That week she made her first flight. An ASA colleague said a
seat was available on the next flight out; Fech took it, without
time to back out. She flew as a passenger from Macon to Atlanta
round trip, 35 minutes each way.
</P>
<P>
   She made the same round trip several days later. The attendants
aboard were friends, so they chatted the entire way. It was so easy
that Fech didn't consider it a real test.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't flown since.
</P>
<P>
   Fech took another medical leave of absence from ASA in April,
citing post-traumatic stress disorder. She still is unsure when or
if she'll return, though she remains by title a flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Living alone in a new Macon home, Fech is 40 years old. ``But I
feel like I'm 80,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crash, she has been tormented psychologically as well
as physically; arthritis and other pains have ravaged her body,
which ``is dadgum falling apart,'' says Clemmie Jordan, her sister
and closest friend. Fech's right wrist, broken in the crash, aches
where doctors inserted four metal pins and a plate. She broke her
collarbone, too, though that wasn't discovered until later.
</P>
<P>
   She has muscle damage in her left thigh and calf, arthritis in
her neck and hands, and pain in her lower back. Her ears ring, and
her teeth hurt from nighttime clenching.
</P>
<P>
   All products of the crash, she says.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997, a psychologist evaluating Fech concluded
it was unlikely she would ever return to being a flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother worries. ``Sometimes she is close to being the Robin
she once was,'' Claudette Underwood says. ``Then at other times she
needs to be off in her own quiet place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin is sadder. You see it in everything she does,'' says
Clemmie, who has spent a lot of time with her sister since
returning to metro Atlanta last summer with her husband and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Fech's boyfriend, Chris Price, a Delta mechanic formerly at ASA,
says their relationship was broken by the crash: ``Back then, our
age difference didn't bother us as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Price is 26, 14 years younger than Fech. But the way they had it
figured, he acted older than his age, she acted younger than hers.
</P>
<P>
   Together, before the crash, they sat on the porch until 3 a.m.,
talking about life and love. They took weekend trips to Lake
Sinclair. Price fixed ASA planes; Fech flew in them. And if they
didn't have a lot of money, they had each other.
</P>
<P>
   Price says the crash changed that. ``I want that fun, carefree,
footloose person that she was then _ and that she's not now,'' he
says. His eyes, liquid blue, turn downcast. ``I can't blame her for
it. I can't blame anyone for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Through counseling, they are trying to repair their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all intertwined,'' Fech says. ``I have a fear of
abandonment. Dad leaves in the divorce. Then I date this guy for 12
years and that doesn't work out. Then I get married and that
doesn't work out. Then I date Chris and that's working out, and we
have a plane crash, and (her job) at ASA doesn't work out. And then
Chris ...''
</P>
<P>
   Those nine minutes and 20 seconds stand tall in Fech's life.
Before those moments, when she became the stabilizing force in the
passenger cabin, she was a 37-year-old divorced flight attendant
making about $20,000 a year while working long hours, landing in
towns such as Dothan, Ala., and Panama City, Fla., sometimes
getting by on pretzels and Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   Never before those nine minutes and 20 seconds had she acted so
completely without self-doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And not since.
</P>
<P>
   Had panic swept through the passenger cabin, maybe no one would
have survived.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants don't always react so confidently. Last
summer, a commercial jet suddenly dropped and rolled, injuring
several passengers before leveling off. ``Probably the worst part
was the stewardess,'' a passenger said later. ``She just couldn't
compose herself. She was telling us everything was going to be OK,
yet she was crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Fech's performance aboard Flight 529 draws people to her,
especially flight attendants. Giving speeches, she luxuriates in
the attention.
</P>
<P>
   In those nine minutes and 20 seconds after the propeller broke,
Fech calmed her 26 passengers and prepared them for impact. She
acted firmly and in command, even lying convincingly that it would
be no trouble to land the crippled plane on one engine.
</P>
<P>
   Later she was celebrated on ``Oprah'' and posed for People
magazine. She stood before Georgia's legislators, who gave her a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Fan mail poured in. One wrote, ``You showed more courage in 30
minutes than most people do in a lifetime!'' A flight attendant
wrote to thank her ``for making us look like something more than a
glorified waitress.'' A man named Fech wrote to say he didn't know
if they were related, but he hoped they were.
</P>
<P>
   An official from the National Transportation Safety Board who
investigated the crash would say, ``I'd fly anywhere with that
lady! Her courage is well-documented by passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger Alan Barrington on Fech's performance: ``If someone
told you that you had less than 10 minutes left to live, are you
going to do your job? I know I'm not going to do mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet she has felt unworthy of such praise even as she has
accepted it, much like the soldier returning from the foxhole to
receive medals for having done nothing more than his job. Fech
wonders if more lives could have been saved.
</P>
<P>
   Before she left Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton three days
after the crash, Fech asked her mother to wheel her into Dawn
Dumm's room. She wanted to see every passenger and to check on
their recovery. Fech felt guilty that she was going home first.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, she thanked Dumm, a Baltimore teacher, for urging
her injured 64-year-old mother to crawl away from the burning
fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm treated Fech coolly. She'd just undergone surgery to repair
her nearly severed foot.
</P>
<P>
   From her hospital bed, Dumm told Fech she had peered out of an
opening in the burning fuselage and screamed for help. She saw Fech
standing on the other side of the wing with two men, one holding a
briefcase, the other wearing only underwear. Dumm said she made eye
contact with Fech.
</P>
<P>
   Dumm had one question: Why didn't you come back to help us?
</P>
<P>
   Fech didn't remember seeing her. She didn't know what to say.
</P>
<P>
   Fech's mother, Claudette Underwood, said, ``Robin, could you not
hear them screaming?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no,'' Fech replied. ``There were so many screams I
heard.'' Then, turning to Dumm, Fech said, ``I guess I didn't hear
you.''
</P>
<P>
   At her home in Maryland nearly three years later, Dumm says
black smoke billowing from the fuselage might have kept Fech from
seeing her; maybe Fech didn't hear her distressed call after all.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Dumm says, while some ASA survivors ``hold this great
honor for her, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumm's early criticism has been ``very hurtful'' to Fech,
Clemmie Jordan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robin has talked to me about it in anger, in tears, in
confusion and in terms of `Why? Why is she so angry with me? What
did I do? What didn't I do?' Dawn Dumm made Robin doubt herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fech believes her actions, particularly in the hayfield, have
been embellished. ``An emergency worker said I was directing
them,'' she says. ``I have had a lot of guilt about this. These
passengers know I didn't do all this wonderful stuff that has been
said about me.''
</P>
<P>
   This despite evidence that Fech in the hayfield _ even with her
wrist broken _ was busy: trying to put out the flames on one
passenger's shoes and another's chest, screaming at passengers to
run from the fuselage, and directing a passenger who was using a
hatchet to break the cockpit window.
</P>
<P>
   So, to Dumm's criticism, Fech replies, ``What she needs to do is
talk to me, because I need to tell her my story. She thinks she's
got one? I need to tell her my story, because where she was taking
care of herself, with the foot hanging off and maybe she's trapped,
maybe she's crawling up the hill, maybe she's worried about her
mother, I'm taking care of 26 other people who are all as traumatic
as she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've got some anger about this stuff. I'm fed up with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fech's parents met because of a plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, two months before her wedding to a Navy pilot,
Claudette Underwood's fiance was killed when his jet slammed into a
mountain. His squadron sent a close friend to present the U.S. flag
at the funeral. The friend was Duane Fech.
</P>
<P>
   A romance blossomed, and a few years later Duane and Claudette,
then a Delta flight attendant, married in Athens, Ga. Two daughters
were born, and then the marriage got shaky. Duane moved to South
Georgia and soon started a catfish business. It wasn't clear to
young Robin, only a third-grader, if they were to follow or if he
had left them. In time, they joined him.
</P>
<P>
   Their parents at odds, Robin and Clemmie clung to each other
over the next six years; they became survivors and sisters in the
truest sense. When the marriage broke up in 1973, Claudette took
the girls to Athens, where she opened a dance studio. Duane went
his own way, later remarried and became an occasional presence in
his daughters' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not remain friends,'' Claudette Underwood says. But now
she wishes they had in order to make the family breakup easier for
her daughters and ``letting them know that Daddy is still Daddy,
and sharing them more with him than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her teens, Robin danced ballet, and sometimes she
rebelled, skipping classes at school. ``Clemmie laughed her way
through everything,'' Robin recalls. ``I withdrew.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next decade, she taught dance at her mother's studio,
tried night school at the University of Georgia, then married at
29, but within a year regretted it. In 1992, she was herself
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   That fall, 34 years old and alone, Fech considered her career
options: a paralegal, a respiratory therapist, something in
telecommunications _ or perhaps a flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   ASA hired her in February 1993. Never mind that she earned only
$12,400 that first year: ``It put food in my mouth.'' Besides, she
loved her passengers. Her co-workers and frequent fliers became her
family.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1994, Duane Fech found out he had cancer. After
doctors removed part of a lung, Clemmie went to see him in
Gainesville. She talked with him about the past and also about
heaven; she closed their circle. Robin would visit him, too, but
they had no such conversation. ``What circle was there?'' she says.
``What we had was more like a spiral.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Duane Fech died, his daughters came to his
hospital room. Drawn and ashen, soon to fall into a coma, he
appeared to Robin ``like a person in a coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he looked to Robin and Clemmie. Duane Fech, who adored a
round of golf and a good stiff drink, was not a wordsmith. But he
felt pressed to say what he needed to say: ``Girls, I recognize
that y'all haven't had it that easy. ...''
</P>
<P>
   And that was all he said.
</P>
<P>
   Loving him and angry at him, Robin Fech, three months before the
crash, said nothing. She just cried.
</P>
<P>
   Squinting into the ballroom lights of a Louisville, Ky., hotel,
Robin Fech fidgets and tells her 250 listeners, ``I'm not a
speaker. I just tell a story.''
</P>
<P>
   It is September 1998 and she tells her story at an international
conference of the Aircraft Rescue &AMP; Fire Fighting Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took off at 12:22,'' she begins. Then she exhales and sips
water. ``I'm sorry. Sometimes this gets emotional.''
</P>
<P>
   She has given maybe 20 speeches about the crash, mostly to ASA
and Delta flight attendants. It is hot and sticky in the ballroom;
Claudette Underwood fans herself with a program.
</P>
<P>
   Fech says, ``There was a tremendous jolt. ... I thought we'd had
a midair collision.'' The room is so silent, you can hear a distant
spoon clink against a coffee cup. Fech tells of the nervous flier
in row six, the way she lied about the crippled plane being able to
land on one engine, and of her own fears.
</P>
<P>
   She takes her listeners through impact and the fire in the
hayfield. Her mascara is running.
</P>
<P>
   She tells of her efforts to save Jim Kennedy, the passenger who
burned to death in the field. Whispering, she says, ``Excuse me.''
Her voice catches: ``I have had terrible nightmares about his skin
turning gray-green.''
</P>
<P>
   Lightening the tone, she says she saw a neighbor on the
periphery of the fiery hayfield wearing a cowboy hat and lighting a
cigarette. ``And I'm screaming at him, 'No smoking, sir!''' She
rolls her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm thinking, 'Why don't you just pull up a lounge
chair?''' Laughter ripples across the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a bad time,'' Fech says later, again somber. ``We
lost 10 people, though not all at once. I know you all know how I
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she's still in therapy and advises these aviation fire
rescuers: ``Don't deny yourself the grief. And don't deny yourself
the therapy _ especially you men. Men can be so stubborn about
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you for letting me talk,'' Fech says. ``It does me
good.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a standing ovation and praise:
</P>
<P>
   ``Very powerful. You can feel her emotions going up and down, up
and down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She should tell that story to every flight attendant in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sad story. I give her a lot of credit!''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, ASA and Delta offered nine short flights back to
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But Robin Fech climbed into her mother's car instead. Together,
they drove seven hours home.

REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP SELECTS FIRST AFRICAN AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. J.C. Watts, a former University of Oklahoma
star quarterback, made history Wednesday by becoming the first
African American elected to the House Republican leadership, giving
the GOP its long-sought chance to claim it is a party of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, a telegenic, high-octane orator, defeated Rep. John
Boehner, R-Ohio, a low-key political insider who has served for
four years as chairman of the Republican Party Conference, the
fourth-ranking leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   The 121-to-93 vote for Watts was a startling upset in
Wednesday's secret-ballot Republican leadership elections.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the party conference, which consists of all 223
House Republicans, endorsed Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, 55, to become the 51st House speaker,
replacing Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who announced two weeks ago he
was stepping down in the wake of the GOP's disappointing election
results.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who spoke briefly to the conference, left for a
Florida vacation with his wife Marianne before most of the votes
were cast. The formal election for House speaker takes place in
January when the 106th Congress convenes, but since the Republicans
have a majority, Livingston's victory is assured.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker-elect promised afterward to cut taxes and save the
Social Security Trust Fund, which could go bankrupt in the 2030s as
the bulk of baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``We want the American people to know they're
going to get good, clean, honest government from us. ``We may have
slipped,'' he added, referring to the GOP's loss of five House
seats Nov. 3. ``But we haven't fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts said he, too, looked forward to the next Congress. ``I'm
excited about everyone working together as a team to make sure that
we cut people's taxes, that we strengthen our national defense,
that we strengthen Social Security, we continue working on a health
care system to make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The 223 Republican House members who convened in the Cannon
House Office Building to select their leaders also reelected House
Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas after a cliff-hanging three
rounds of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, majority leader since the Republicans took over the House
in 1994, defeated Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma on the third
ballot in a 127-to-95 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one got the 112-vote majority needed to win on the
first ballot, two more rounds of voting ensued, each time
eliminating the lowest scorer. A late entry, Dennis J. Hastert,
R-Ill., the chief deputy whip, was the first to fall, followed by
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, the first woman to run for majority leader, had faced
opposition among some conservatives because while she is against
the use of federal funds for abortions, she is also pro-choice. She
said later she did not think that position hurt her bid against
Armey. But she said the 11th-hour candidacy of Hastert siphoned
votes away from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have minimal disappointment,'' she said, although she added,
``I would have loved to have put my shoulder to the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said the Republicans ``decided to continue with Dick Armey
for very good reasons'' _ they wanted ``continuity and stability.''
She added she was glad she ``took the risk at cracking this glass
ceiling.'' Dunn said she does not fear any political retribution
because she challenged the majority leader. ``I really do not
expect any negatives on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent, a Bible Belt conservative and former former Seattle
Seahawks wide receiver, said he was ``not accustomed to losing,''
and would ``continue to fight for the things we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said the three rounds of voting signaled less
than a ringing endorsement for Armey. ``It shows that there are
some people in our conference that were looking for change,'' said
Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``Now it's time to repair the breach.''
</P>
<P>
   In another leadership coup, Thomas M. Davis of Virginia replaced
John Linder of Georgia as chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee, the House GOP's fund-raising
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Linder had been tapped by Gingrich to head the committee, but he
was swept from office by Republicans seeking a change. In toppling
him, Davis had a strong assist from Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
Republican whip, or chief vote counter. DeLay was re-elected
without opposition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   _ Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., predictably won reelection as
chairman of the conference's 42-member Republican Policy Committee.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., became vice chairwoman of the
Republican Conference, a slot vacated by Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rep. Deborah Pryce, R-Ohio, won her uncontested post as
secretary of the Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hastert retained his leadership post as chief deputy whip.

BUSH BROTHERS TAKE SPOTLIGHT AT GOP GOVERNORS MEETING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush basked in renewed
national media attention Wednesday and picked up a qualified
endorsement for a presidential campaign from his younger brother,
the governor-elect of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, joining his Texas brother for the first time since
both scored gubernatorial election victories Nov. 3, said he was
encouraging George W. Bush to run for the White House if he could
resolve family considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush brothers grabbed the spotlight on the opening day of
the Republican Governors Association's annual meeting, bantering
with each other and with reporters in a news conference that ended
only when security officers helped the Texas governor elbow his way
out of a crowded room.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush's comments were the strongest that any member of the
Bush family has yet made in support of a potential presidential bid
by George W. Bush, who has said he has not yet decided whether to
seek the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an uncivil age that we live in. It's pretty intense
politics these days,'' said Jeb Bush, who will become Florida's
chief executive in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (the Texas governor) has got two teen-age girls who I think
are really cool, and having their father run for president is
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jeb Bush added: ``If he gets through that, and he decides to
do it, I've encouraged him to. I think he would be an awesome
candidate. I'm going to vote for him .... If he announces his
candidacy, we won't have a family vote. Everybody will be lined up
to help him.``
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine Republican governors and governors-elect, some of
whom also are considered potential presidential contenders, were
expected to attend their annual conference, which runs through
Friday. But if any governors whose last name wasn't Bush were
seeking media attention, they were in the wrong place Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes' news conference was the major event. Several dozen
reporters, photographers and TV camera operators representing most
of the country's major news organizations were there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to introduce my little brother to the Texas press
corps. It looks like some others came along,'' George W. Bush
deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   At previous governor conferences, Bush usually has held informal
briefings with the handful of Texas reporters attending and private
interviews with selected national reporters. But, now that he is
considered the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination in 2000, the demand was too great this time, spokeswoman
Karen Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush's office had been bombarded with ``dozens'' of
requests for media interviews.
</P>
<P>
   With each Bush brother sitting _ apparently accidentally _ in
front of the other brother's state flag, the first question and
many that followed were, not surprisingly, about the presidential
race. And George W. Bush's responses were equally not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind yet,'' he said. ``Right now I'm
working on my (second gubernatorial) inauguration speech, and I've
got an agenda that I've got to get through the legislative
session.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature will convene Jan. 12. Bush will be
inaugurated for his second term Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me just say this. (For) someone who is running for
president, it would be wise for them to knock on Jeb Bush's door.
Florida's an important state,'' the Texas governor added.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush said his main consideration in deciding on a
presidential bid was whether he wanted to take his family through
the grind of Washington politics.
</P>
<P>
   Although his father, George Bush, was elected president after
years of national public service, the Texas governor added:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up every day wanting to be president of the
United States. I grew up wanting to be (baseball star) Willie
Mays.``
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, 52, said it was a ``big deal'' to see his
younger brother, 45, elected governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how proud I was to see him walk into a
Republican governors' meeting,'' he said. ``This guy's a good guy,
and I love him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush's election, the Texas governor added, will make Florida
a better state.
</P>
<P>
   But the Texas governor also couldn't resist a little fraternal
teasing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been telling him what to do for 45 years, and he hasn't
listened yet,'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who called his father a great president, said he
developed a ``rather thin-skinned reputation'' for defending ``my
dad's honor'' during the elder Bush's unsuccessful re-election race
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like to see him get attacked. I found out it's a lot
different, though, going from loyal son to candidate and, now,
governor.''

CURTAIN RISES ON IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: New grafs 3-4 with witnesses; editing to conform)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid bitter partisan rancor, the House on Thursday
opens long-awaited impeachment hearings against President Clinton
for alleged perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica
Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr was scheduled as the day's
lone witness before the House Judiciary Committee. The majority
Republicans may meet Friday or later this month to decide whether
to call additional witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., late
Wednesday announced that in addition to hearing Starr's testimony,
the committee would issue subpoenas for closed-door depositions
from White House lawyer Bruce Lindsey, Clinton lawyer Robert
Bennett, and two figures in a related matter: Clinton's alleged
kissing and groping of former White House volunteer Kathleen Willey
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   One is Daniel Gecker, a Richmond, Va. lawyer who represented
Willey and undertook an unsuccessful effort to secure tabloid and
book deals for Willey. The other is Nathan Landow, a wealthy
Maryland developer and Democratic fundraiser. Willey has alleged
that Landow urged her to keep silent about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a final list,'' said Sam Stratman, spokesman for
committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Starr gets the floor for up to two hours to address
the committee after opening statements by Hyde and Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., the top Democrat on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Starr then will be questioned by Republican chief counsel David
Schippers and his Democratic counterpart Abbe Lowell. Then each of
the committee's 37 members _ 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats _ will
question Starr for five minutes each. At the tail end, David
Kendall, Clinton's lawyer in the Lewinsky matter, will get to
question Starr for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is expected to go well outside the four corners of
Clinton's efforts to hide his 18-month relationship with Lewinsky.
He will try to show that Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky affair
was part of a wider pattern of presidential obstruction of Starr's
investigation, which began in 1994 as a look at Bill and Hillary
Clinton's roles as investors in the ill-fated Whitewater land
development scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told reporters he wouldn't stop Starr from ranging beyond
the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I?'' Hyde asked. ``Because the Democrats would like
that? The Democrats want to stick to Monica Lewinsky. We want to
look at everything. That's the big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats left no doubt they intend to shift
attention away from Clinton's behavior and focus their fire on
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starr's conduct and the actions of his staff bear directly on
credibility of the inquiry itself,'' said Jim Jordan, spokesman for
Judiciary Committee Democrats. There are serious questions about
the investigation and about how the issue ended up in Starr's
office in the first place, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said Democrats would ask Starr about allegations that he
or his aides threatened Lewinsky; leaked grand jury materials; were
in contact with lawyers representing Paula Jones in her sexual
harassment civil lawsuit against Clinton; and started investigating
the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship before obtaining court
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   Alternating scenarios with different configurations of witnesses
have marked the confused Republican planning for the hearings,
prompting Democrats to charge that the last-minute confusion about
the witness list illustrated how Republicans were in disarray in
the face of polls showing little public enthusiasm for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``thought they were going to ride this impeachment
horse all the way home, (but) the horse is now in terrible shape,''
said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a Judiciary member. ``They've got
two choices: They can shoot it and send it to the dog-food factory,
or they can paint stripes on it and tell everyone its a zebra... I
don't think they know yet what they're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, at least, Republicans said they would focus on
Starr's Sept. 9 report to Congress citing 11 grounds for
impeachment of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to hearing Ken Starr's side of the
investigation,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a Judiciary
member. ``The administration and its spokespeople have savaged Ken
Starr daily and ... he has not been allowed to speak publicly about
what he has found. So, for the first time he will be able to speak
for himself and speak candidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith dismissed Democratic plans to put Starr on trial Thursday
and charges of faulty GOP leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence Ken Starr will successfully keep the focus
on whether the president committed impeachable crimes,'' he said.
``I'm sure the Democrats would like to change the subject, but
there's only one subject at hand: Whether the president committed
these crimes or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Other GOP members of the committee expressed concern about
Starr's ability to withstand the expected Democratic barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough forum for Starr,'' said Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark. ``The Democrats are champing at the bit for this
opportunity and it's going to be hard for him to look good.''
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the White House on Wednesday conceded defeat
in its effort to expand the time its lawyers would have Thursday to
question Starr. After receiving Hyde's initial offer of 30 minutes,
White House Counsel Charles F.C. Ruff on Tuesday insisted the time
be expanded to 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde turned down the request. On Wednesday, Ruff sent Hyde a
letter saying ``we will proceed within the time allotted'' even
though in his view 30 minutes ``is not consistent with the standard
of fairness that the committee has sought to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told reporters Wednesday he would be ``liberal and
tolerant'' in extending the White House's cross-examination period,
``if they're on a line of questioning and they need more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Wednesday, the committee's chief counsel, Tom Mooney,
wrote to Ruff imploring him to respond to a list of 81
Lewinsky-related questions sent by Hyde to Clinton on Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a promise to get the answers back to the committee by
Nov. 13, the White House has failed to forward them, Mooney wrote.
``We are dismayed that you have missed your own self-imposed
deadline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past week Starr has delivered additional boxes of
evidence to the committee. One set involves Willey. The other
involves Webster Hubbell, former Justice Department official and
close Clinton pal indicted last week for lying to Congress and
federal banking regulators about work he did for the now-insolvent
Madison Guaranty Savings &AMP; Loan, owned by Clinton Whitewater
partner James McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Hubbell and Willey documents could prove to be wild
cards in the hearings, though it was unclear whether either case
would come up at all.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday will mark only the third time in U.S. history that the
House Judiciary Committee has conducted an impeachment inquiry into
the actions of a president. The previous occasions were the 1867
and 1868 proceedings against President Andrew Johnson and the 1974
hearings on President Nixon's role in the Watergate scandal.

</P>
<P>
   FEATURE Stories
</P>
<P>
   BALANCHINE-BALLETS (Undated) _ It isn't a trivia question to ask
which of George Balanchine's ballets were on the first program when
the New York City Ballet officially came into existence on Oct. 11,
1948. As virtually every City Ballet subscriber knows by heart, the
triple bill consisted of ``Concerto Barocco,'' ``Orpheus'' and
``Symphony in C.'' The same program will inaugurate the City
Ballet's mammoth 50th-anniversary year on Tuesday night at the New
York State Theater, just as it marked the 40th anniversary. By Anna
Kisselgoff. (Moved). Photo.
</P>
<P>
   FILM AND VIDEO
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL-STATION-FILM (Undated) _ Walter Salles's ``Central
Station'' is a film that manages to be both intimate and epic,
local and universal. The movie, which opened Friday, is a portrait
of present-day Brazil as seen through the tale of an older woman
and a young boy who meet in Rio de Janeiro's train station and who
strike out on a journey into the hinterlands to find the boy's
father. By Laura Winters. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH-FILMS (Undated) _ These days a mood of optimism and brash
confidence has once again taken hold of French filmmaking. A new
generation of films _ ``My Sex Life,'' ``Irma Vep,'' ``The
Dreamlife of Angels'' and ``I Stand Alone'' _ is causing an
international stir with its uninhibited depictions of contemporary
society, and taking festival prizes and even finding American
distribution. By Phillip Lopate. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (Undated) _ Vincent Canby reviews ``Little Me'';
``Chicago'' and ``The Ride Down Mount Morgan. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   KIDMAN-THEATER (London) _ It will come as no surprise to Nicole
Kidman's screen admirers to learn that she also looks sexy and
beautiful on stage, not least when scantily dressed. Yet this
unremarkable discovery threw British newspapers into a veritable
swoon this fall when she made her first stage appearance in 11
years. True, sex (italics)is(end italics) the theme of the play,
``The Blue Room,'' David Hare's loose adaptation of Arthur
Schnitzler's turn-of-the-century play ``Reigen,'' or round-dance,
now better known as ``La Ronde.'' Ten characters (Ms. Kidman and
the British actor Iain Glen each play five) engage in a daisy-chain
of sexual encounters. By Alan Riding. (moved).
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL
</P>
<P>
   LA-CAJUN-MUSIC (L'anse De'prien Noir, La.) _ The vital French
music of the region _ 22 parishes called Acadiana _ hasn't been
shunted to the museum, to be occasionally dusted off and propped on
a sterile stage. French music thrived here because of South
Louisiana's isolation, both physical and cultural. But what
happened here is not an isolated event. Often damned for its
take-no-prisoners mass culture, the United States has always found
room for local, often country, musics: the strong fiddling
tradition that grew up around Galax, Va.; the African-American
fife-and-drum bands of Northern Mississippi; the Mexican-American
conjunto born along the Texas-Mexico border. And the omnivorous
popular culture has never been shy about borrowing (stealing?) from
the locals, as Cajuns know. By Dana Jennings. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-FAME (Undated) _ Is it desperation among music marketers
or just the nature of celebrity that has turned career building
into such spasms of sudden success and sudden obscurity? Selling
and buying the star is a musical process as old as Franz Liszt, but
the ascent to belovedness has become more vertical. A certain
hysteria is in the air, with audiences needy for something to love
and promoters eager to supply it. By Bernard Holland. (Moved).

</P>
<P>
   IRIS-OPERA (Undated) _ One hundred years ago Sunday, Pietro
Mascagni's opera ``Iris'' had its premiere at the Teatro Costanzi
in Rome, the same theater in which, eight years before, his first
and most famous opera, ``Cavalleria Rusticana,'' received 60
curtain calls at its premiere. But whereas ``Cavalleria'' ushered
in the era of verismo, which sought to dramatize the lives of
ordinary people, ``Iris'' came at the height of the ``japonisme''
that swept the arts in Europe in the second half of the 19th
century. The centennial of the work, which was last heard at the
Metropolitan Opera in 1931, will be celebrated on Monday evening
with a concert performance by Teatro Grattacielo at Alice Tully
Hall in New York City. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ART
</P>
<P>
   ZEN-ART (New York) _ ``The Art of 20th-Century Zen,'' an
exhibition that opened on Thursday at the Japan Society, gives a
personal face to 14 contemporary Japanese Zen masters who are also
master calligrapher-painters. By Kay Larson. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-TV (London) _ The words book and television tug against
each other in a fairly obvious way, but I still can't help smiling
at the sassy paradox implicit in the designation Book TV. That's
what C-Span 2 calls the round-the-clock weekend programming it
introduced in September, displacing reruns of the United States
Senate, the estimable show this cable network carries live on most
weekdays. By Will Joyner. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   CANDID-CAMERA (Monterey, Calif.) _ ``Candid Camera'' _ at least
a collateral precursor of such varied fin de siecle phenomena as
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ATM surveillance cameras,
nannycams, FBI sting operations, ``The Truman Show'' and Linda
Tripp _ remains an absolutely noncontroversial, even beloved
institution. And undoubtedly this is why CBS, struggling with the
other broadcast networks to attract a larger share of a shrinking
audience, has chosen to return to its roots and revive this
51-year-old franchise. By Andy Meisler. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES
</P>
<P>
   EXPLORATION-ART-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ For the legions who drive
sport utility vehicles to work on Wall Street, wear high-tech
mountain gear to suburban barbecues and keep Jon Krakauer's Everest
adventure story, ``Into Thin Air,'' on the best-seller list,
another spectator sport is catching on: collecting exploration art.
That rubric covers the paraphernalia used by the great explorers _
their oxygen cylinders, packing crates, rations cups, Holy Bibles
and climbing shoes _ as well as photographs, paintings, maps and
charts, many of which were drawn on the spot of previously
uncharted terrain. The genre spans nearly 500 years of exploration
from the early sea voyages of the 1400s to the Everest climbs of
the 1950s. By Christa Worthington. (Moved).

ERROR SENDS METEOR VIEWERS TO WRONG PART OF THE GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showers and storms of meteors, it seems, may be a lot like snow
storms and rain showers: Awfully hard to predict. Astronomers who
forecast a &UR;  &LR; storm of Leonid meteors, according to preliminary
reports, may have been a half-a-world off in predicting where the
storm would be the heaviest.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of astronomers from the United States, Canada and other
nations traveled to remote and harsh locations in Asia, including
the Gobi desert in Mongolia, in hopes of catching the peak of an
expected dazzling storm that happens only once in 33 years _ and
sometimes not that often. But it looks like they could have spared
themselves money and time if they had stayed closer to home: The
most spectacular meteor displays may have occurred somewhere over
the Atlantic ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's most skilled astronomers had analyzed
centuries' worth of records to prepare their forecasts. Just a few
days ago, they acknowledged that they might be way off in
predicting how many meteors might be seen during the peak, but they
were pretty sure about where and when the peak would be.
</P>
<P>
   If the early reports are right, just the opposite occurred. They
were close on their predictions on the number of meteors at the
peak _ perhaps as many as 1,000 to 2,000 per hour, well within a
predicted range of 200 to 10,000. But they were way off on the time
and location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predicting meteor showers is really a crapshoot,'' said Donald
Yeomans of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, who is considered one of the world's best at
calculating such things. Like most in the field, he was confident
that Asia would be be the best viewing spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out'' on exactly what did happen, Yeomans
said in an interview Wednesday, but the preliminary reports &UR;  &LR; 
strongly suggest that the forecast was about as far off as those
weather reports that have people shoveling six inches of ``partly
cloudy'' off the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody is really complaining about it _ except, of
course, the legions of would-be skywatchers who were stuck under
solidly overcast skies during the whole show. That includes most of
New England.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who could see the sky at all, few were
disappointed. Although the peak was in the ``wrong'' place,
virtually every part of the world, at some point, was showered with
meteors at a rate of 100 to 400 per hour. While that's no more than
are seen in some other, lesser meteor showers, it is more than
forecast for this year outside the Asian sites.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ecstatic eyewitness reports flooded the Internet
and radio programs around the world. Observers on different
continents, many of them experienced skywatchers who have weathered
many a meteor shower, said the displays surpassed any meteor
activity they had seen before.
</P>
<P>
   The highest numbers of meteors were reported in the Eastern
Atlantic: in Portugal and at the Canary Islands observatory at La
Palma. A team of professional astronomers from the United Kingdom,
observing at La Palma, reported that as dawn broke on Tuesday
meteors were raining down at a rate of almost one per second, or
nearly 3,600 per hour _ although less than an hour elapsed before
the display was washed out by morning twilight.
</P>
<P>
   A group of observers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., watching from the nearby mountains, said that
even with half the sky obscured by clouds they saw somewhere
between 600 and 1,000 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Green, who has been compiling information from viewers
around the world for the International Astronomical Union's central
clearinghouse for astronomical information in Cambridge, Mass.,
said Wednesday early reports do indeed suggest that predictions of
the peak were off by 12 hours or so, and that Asia missed out on
the highest levels of showers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Considering the amount of money and effort spent to send
scientists to far-flung places that turned out to be relative duds,
he said, there may be a lesson to be remembered next year, whose
Leonid shower is expected to be comparable to this year's _ and
perhaps be the last such Leonid storm for centuries to come:
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not be quite as bold next year,'' Green said,
``about predicting what will happen and when.''

NEW USES FOR OLD DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dozen years ago, when word got out that men taking minoxidil
to control their high blood pressure were growing extra hair on
their heads _ and elsewhere _ doctors began writing prescriptions
to get the drug compounded in formulations that could be rubbed
directly on the body.
</P>
<P>
   Tablets were mashed and bulk powder ordered to be mixed with
propylene glycol and alcohol so that the solution could be applied
topically.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only had one patient who ever took minoxidil for blood
pressure, but I mixed up a lot of the topical preparation to grow
hair. We mixed it however the doctors ordered,'' says Dan
Fuchshuber, a North Texas pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   So much of the topical solution was being prepared that
pharmaceutical giant Upjohn reportedly obtained a patent for
topical minoxidil and filed a lawsuit against some pharmacies that
were known to do a lot of custom compounding. This was shortly
before the company launched Rogaine,its popular hair tonic, now
sold over-the-counter.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of off-label drug use, where male pattern
baldness is treated with high-blood-pressure medicine, labor is
induced with ulcer drugs and acne medicine is prescribed for women
worried about wrinkles. And it's all legal _ and ethical.
</P>
<P>
   Although drug companies can't advertise or sell drugs for
purposes other than those for which they have been federally
approved, once the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approves a
drug as safe and effective for one indication, doctors can legally
and ethically use the drug for any purpose in the patient's best
interest.
</P>
<P>
   Antihistamines are widely used off-label.
</P>
<P>
   Benadryl, for example, causes so much drowsiness that when it
went over-the-counter about six years ago, diphenhydramine, the
popular antihistamine's active ingredient, almost immediately took
over the market as the active ingredient in sleep aids including
Sominex, Nytol, Compoz and most pain medications with a PM suffix,
such as Excedrin PM, Fuchshuber says.
</P>
<P>
   Antihistamines have been widely used as tranquilizers since
diphenhydramine was first introduced in 1945, notes Fort Worth
allergist Bob Lanier. Diphenhydramine became very popular in French
prisons, where it was used to calm down difficult-to-control
inmates, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the older tranquilizers we still use today, all the
old tricyclics, actually developed from antihistamine drugs,''
Lanier says.
</P>
<P>
   Lanier notes that there is a long tradition of using drugs
off-label because they have to be approved within such a narrow
framework. Sometimes drugs are prescribed for beneficial side
effects that are discovered. The classic example is amantadine,
developed and used since the 1960s for the treatment of Parkinson's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we had that terrible flu epidemic in 1968,'' says Lanier,
``and the only people who didn't get extremely ill with the flu
were those taking the Parkinson's drug.''
</P>
<P>
   It took more than 20 years, but Symmetrel, whose active
ingredient is amantadine, was approved by the FDA in 1991 for the
treatment of type A influenza strains. Flumadine, a closely related
drug, has also been approved to fight the flu.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the drugs used for children today are used
off-label, never officially approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for use in children. In fact, most drugs are
approved only for use in middle-aged men because they were the only
ones included in drug trials until about 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some other popular drugs originally approved for one medical
purpose and now widely used for another include:
</P>
<P>
   Retin-A: developed to treat acne, now used against wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Depo-provera: developed to treat endometriosis, now approved for
birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Taxol: developed for breast cancer, now used more in bladder
cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Premarin: developed for use in estrogen replacement therapy
primarily to prevent hot flashes, now used to protect
post-menopausal women from osteoporosis and heart disease, and
being tested against Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Thalidomide: first developed as a sedative and used to treat
morning sickness, then taken off the market; recently approved for
the treatment of leprosy and for the severe mouth ulcers that
people with AIDS often get.

TEXAS PULLS THROUGH ON THIRD BALLOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Ron Hutcheson 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Irving kept his
job Wednesday as House Republicans prepared for life without
Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Republicans picked Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana
to replace Gingrich at the top of the leadership team dominated by
Sun Belt lawmakers. Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma was elected
chairman of the Republican conference, becoming the first
high-ranking African American in the House Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, a former star quarterback at the University of Oklahoma,
will rank fourth in the next Congress, behind Livingston, Armey and
GOP Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land, who was unopposed for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans emerged from the closed-door session determined to
get back on track after setbacks in the Nov. 3 elections. The loss
of five GOP House seats triggered Gingrich's resignation and
touched off a leadership scramble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We muffed our message a little bit in the last elections, and
the American people held us accountable,'' Livingston said. ``As
Abe Lincoln said, a slip is not a fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, who faced three challengers, struggled through three
rounds of balloting before winning a majority of the 223 Republican
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Irving Republican captured 100 votes _ 12 short of the goal
_ in the first round, compared with 58 for Rep. Steve Largent of
Oklahoma, 45 for Rep. Jennifer Dunn of Washington and 18 for Rep.
Dennis Hastert of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   With Hastert out of the race, Armey fell short again in a second
ballot that eliminated Dunn from the competition. He finally beat
Largent, 127-95, in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I pray for humility, and all of a sudden I had 222
people helping me with it,'' a relieved Armey joked. ``I was in a
horse race with three thoroughbreds and one Texas quarterhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent, a former star receiver for the Seattle Seahawks
football team, fell back on a sports analogy in explaining the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve Largent has been too slow and too small his whole life,
and this is just one more occasion,'' he said, repeating a
criticism that he disproved as a football player.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers attributed Armey's victory to the good will he
has generated as a leader of the GOP revolution that captured a
House majority in 1994. He also benefited from a desire for at
least some stability after Gingrich's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reputation for reaching out to all members of the
conference _ conservatives and moderates alike _ gave him a track
record to build on,'' Rep. Lamar Smith of San Antonio said.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, whose district includes the northeast corner of Tarrant
County, had strong backing from Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis and Rep.
Kay Granger of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dunn and Largent joined Armey in a post-election show
of unity, some critics were not as willing to forgive and forget.
Armey, whose job as legislative leader often puts him between
warring moderates and conservatives, has come under fire from both
factions for his handling of the GOP agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have a track record of not learning from past
mistakes. We'll see if he does this time,'' said Rep. Joe
Scarborough of Florida, a conservative who has been one of Armey's
harshest critics.
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing mood was more optimistic. The newly elected
leaders said they intend to rally rank-and-file lawmakers behind a
targeted agenda of tax cuts, a strong national defense, Social
Security protection and education support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't betray our philosophy to win applause, nor abandon
good policy in search of praise,'' Livingston told his colleagues.
``We must cooperate to move forward. But we will never capitulate.
In short, we will never, never, never give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most rebellious Republicans said the hotly contested
leadership races eased long-standing tensions within the party.
Others said Gingrich's departure will help them stay focused on
issues rather than personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, instead of sweeping things under the rug, we're
really listening to each other,'' Rep. Matt Salmon of Arizona said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's ascension to the top job will not become official
until the full House ratifies the decision in a party-line vote
when the 106th Congress convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said his tough re-election fight taught him some valuable
lessons for the next Congress. He said one Georgia lawmaker
complained that Armey had not spoken to him in his four years as
majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine that? That's nobody's fault but my own,''
Armey said. ``Today, I sat down next to him and I said, `Say, did I
ever welcome you to the party?' ''

DEARTH OF WORKERS PLAGUES RETAILERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON   AND JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Tammy McMaster could sense that stores were desperate
for sales clerks to work during the holidays. So she made her move.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the 19-year-old reasoned, she had worked a full year
for The Body Shop and deserved a $1-an-hour raise. When her
supervisor refused, she clomped across the mall's glazed floor in
her clunky shoes to the Talbot's Kids store and got a job there.
The Body Shop quickly hired her back _ and gave her the raise.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment at its lowest level in decades, retailers
can't remember a holiday season when it was more difficult to find
clerks to prepare for the rush of shoppers. The problem is
national, but it is particularly acute in Massachusetts, where the
jobless rate is a full percentage point below US unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the tight labor market, retailers are being
forced to boost wages, offer signing bonuses, health benefits and
paid vacations _ even to seasonal and part-time workers. But that
may not be enough during the holiday weeks. Inexperienced, albeit
energetic workers have no trouble landing a job _ or playing one
retailer off against another with the bargaining skills of a
seasoned executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good year to do it,'' McMaster explained as Sunday
shoppers at the Burlington Mall sniffed The Body Shop's ointments.
``You can go through this whole mall, and there are (help wanted)
signs everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Shopkeepers are loath to snatch employees from each other. But
this holiday season demands that they use extreme tactics to
attract _ and keep _ workers in a job market flush with better
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all desperate,'' said Skip Coppola, general manager
for the Faneuil Hall Marketplace in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers in the historic shopping area have been grumbling that
Finagle-A-Bagel's offer of a ``signing bonus'' for new hires is
siphoning workers off for tasks no more skilled than slapping a
schmear of cream cheese on a bagel.
</P>
<P>
   The $50 bonus, unheard of for food service crews, is an
acknowledgment of the high cost of turnover in retail and
food-service businesses. Sign-on bonuses are aimed at retention,
since they are paid only after the worker stays on the job for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   For Finagle-A-Bagel, the two-week-old policy at the store has
produced a stack of applications from which to choose. It brings 10
prospective workers a week through the door, compared with two
applicants at another downtown Finagle-A-Bagel, company officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   To outbid competitors, retailers this season are paying seasonal
workers well above the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour, once the
standard for temporary or part-time help.
</P>
<P>
   Macy's, which is in the midst of adding 1,000 seasonal workers
to its 3,000-person work force in Massachusetts, is paying sales
clerks 50 cents an hour more this year than last, or between $6.50
and $7.50 an hour, said Elliott Tobias, vice president of human
resources for the New England region. And Macy's competitors are
shocked by the department store's steep sign-on bonus: Last
weekend, Macy's raised the bonus by $100, to $300, in New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers are using any strategy that will work to get a
larger pool of candidates for work,'' said Connie Doty, director of
jobs and community services for the city of Boston. ``There are a
lot of jobs that go wanting at the very low end.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with a tight labor market, needless to say, is that
the quality or experience of applicants has, well ... ``I need to
phrase this as diplomatically as possible,'' said Leslie Fay, who
sells beaded jewelry from her pushcart in Faneuil Hall. She
explained that applicants are unschooled in ``the basics'' _ like
getting to work on time.
</P>
<P>
   Fay, who needs just one employee to help her through the
holidays, has had no luck. ``I'm working more right now than I
typically do for the simple reason we can't find anyone to hire,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's especially tough for small operators like Fay to find help
when national chains such as Sunglass Hut, KB Toys and August Max
Woman are advertising signing bonuses, generous benefits packages
or large employee discounts this year for seasonal workers.
</P>
<P>
   KB Toys uses a 25 percent discount on store merchandise as a
tool in tripling holiday staffing to almost 30,000 nationwide. It
also runs an &UR;  &LR; ``Elves Wanted'' campaign _ displayed on billboards,
T-shirts worn by sales staff, and blimps. The toy company uses the
campaign to lure parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles who are
customers and ``already know something about toys,'' said Gerry
Murray, a vice president at headquarters in Pittsfield.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers with trendy merchandise, such as The Gap or Banana
Republic, get more mileage out of employee discounts, said John
Macht, a retail consultant and former Jordan Marsh executive.
``There's certainly some kind of pecking order going on in terms of
where they choose to work,'' he said. ``There's more selectivity on
the part of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Erin Carter ``knew it would be easy'' to find a sales job at the
Burlington Mall. So, she quit her job scooping ice cream at
Brigham's and began the search for her first retail job.
</P>
<P>
   The mall-savvy 18-year-old, who will start college in January,
picked up applications at Macy's, Sears and Lord &AMP; Taylor. But,
``they just didn't offer what Filene's offered,'' she said, folding
a gray sweater outfit for a Filene's customer. Stray glitter under
her left eye reflected the store's flourescent lighting as she
explained Filene's had the best benefits for part-time workers,
including health coverage 60 days and a week's paid vacation after
a year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``When labor markets heat up at the bottom, companies end up
improving job quality,'' said Paul Harrington, a Northeastern
University labor professor. ``They invest in the work force with
training and equipment and then wages have to be higher so you
attract a different kind of worker.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of a tight job market is that it provides experience
to young workers who might otherwise be turned away.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh out of high school, Steve Castelli was among 325 people
hired by the newly opened Rain Forest Cafe, a retail-restaurant
establishment at the Burlington Mall with a Disney-like cacacophy
of jungle drums, roaring tigers, and a long line of kids waiting
with their parents for a table.
</P>
<P>
   The Rain Forest Cafe was a big step up for Castelli, whose prior
experience was cleaning up around a health club and a friend's
house. ``I never thought I'd be doing this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, an Aldo shoe store the size of a postage
stamp was &UR;  &LR; jammed with customers trying on platform boots. Store
manager Mary Roberts was &UR;  &LR; too busy rushing around to talk much; at
3 p.m., she had given up on taking a lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry I didn't have more time,'' she said. ``If you know
someone looking for a job, let me know.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola and rival Pepsico are pouring out holiday
promotions designed to pump up year-end sales.
</P>
<P>
   The six weeks between Thanksgiving and New Year's account for
about 15 percent of annual soft drink sales, said Gary Hemphill,

   While that surge in holiday sales isn't as big as it is for
wine, beer and spirits, it's enough of an increase to generate
increased marketing efforts and aggressive price promotions,
Hemphill said.

   At Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, activities run the gamut from a
discount card to a phone card giveaway, rounded out by cyber-deals.
Highlights include:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Coca-Cola/Give Kids the World Holiday Discount Card. The
card, available for $1.99 at Kmart stores nationwide, offers more
than $125 in discounts, including free popcorn with the purchase of
any Coca-Cola product at AMC Theatres, a second night free at
participating Holiday Inn hotels, $25 off selected American
Airlines flights and five minutes in free calling time on AT&AMP;T.
Coca-Cola will donate proceeds to Give Kids the World, an
Orlando-based group that grants dream vacations to kids with
life-threatening illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Gift of Refreshment. This five-minute AT&AMP;T calling card is
attached to several million 32- and 40-ounce cups at selected
fountain locations, including Circle K and Texaco convenience
stores.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Coca-Cola Holiday Web site, at http://www.coke.com.
Surfers get the site's password behind labels of 20-ounce or
one-liter bottles of Coca-Cola Classic. Then they can order
Coca-Cola's holiday CD for $3.98, featuring performers such as
Marcy Playground, Ever Clear and Boyz II Men singing trendy
versions of classic Christmas carols. The site also is filled with
activities, letting visitors do such things as create, send and
receive holiday e-cards, post their wish lists or place themselves
on the naughty or nice page._ Locally, ``Coke on Ice'' again takes
center stage outside the World of Coca-Cola, adjacent to
Underground Atlanta. The Southeast's largest outdoor ice skating
rink will be open Nov. 27-Jan. 3. (For details, call 404-676-5151.)

   Pepsico's holiday marketing centers on two promotions:
</P>
<P>
   _ An under-the-cap game where 300,000 consumers will win ``party
packages'' filled with $40 in free Pepsi and Frito-Lay products.
</P>
<P>
   _ And ``Santa's House Party,'' another joint campaign with
Frito-Lay that will flood the marketplace with more than 50 million
coupons for the company's soft drinks and Wow! snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Pepsico hasn't announced plans to run new holiday-themed
commercials, and New Year's marketing efforts are still under
wraps, said spokesman Brad Shaw.

THE WORKS OF EDITH WHARTON: MANY AND VARIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edith Wharton was nothing if not prolific. When she died at age
75 in 1937, she left uncompleted her 16th novel _ ``The
Buccaneers'' _ in addition to which she had published eight
short-story collections, seven novellas (not including ``Ethan
Frome,'' considered here as a novel), two volumes of poetry, three
travel books, and four full-length nonfiction works including ``A
Backward Glance,'' her 1934 autobiography.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel was ``The Valley of Decision'' (1902), now
considered an apprentice work. Wharton's reputation was established
with her second novel _ ``The House of Mirth'' (1905), still
regarded as a masterpiece. (It made the recent, much-publicized
list of the 100 best 20th-century novels in English as selected by
the Modern Library board.) It concerns Lily Bart's effort to rise
in society and raises the novel of manners to the level of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton's most-read work is the short novel ``Ethan Frome''
(1911), her least typical tale, dealing not with New York society
but with New England rustics. Its resolution is tragic, and many
consider it Wharton's highest achievement. Others rate ``The Custom
of the Country'' (1913) as her best work. Its protagonist is the
anti-heroine Undine Spragg, who uses men as steppingstones to power
and wealth but is ultimately frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The other Wharton work to make the notorious ``Best 100'' is
``The Age of Innocence,'' which treats ironically the effect of
money and class on character. It is her most skillfully constructed
work, but she is otherwise less consistent than her model, Henry
James.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton's other novels, variable in quality, include ``The Fruit
of the Tree'' (1907); ``The Reef'' (1912); ``The Marne'' (1918);
``The Glimpses of the Moon'' (1922); ``A Son at the Front'' (1923);
``The Mother's Recompense'' (1925); ``Twilight Sleep'' (1927);
``The Children'' (1928); ``Hudson River Bracketed'' (1929); ``The
Gods Arrive'' (1932). ``The Buccaneers'' was issued in its
unfinished form in 1938 and republished in 1995, having been
``completed'' by other hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madame de Treynes'' (1907) and ``Summer'' (1917) are
outstanding novellas; and ``Old New York'' is the collective title
for four novellas issued together in 1924. One component _ ``The
Old Maid'' _ is especially admired. As adapted by Zoe Akins, it
became first a Pulitzer Prize play, then a classic movie with Bette
Davis. Larry Swindell, (817) 390-7731

WORLD CORPORATE POLICIES AIRED AT CONFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Business leaders representing more than 150
corporations met Wednesday to discuss the need for socially
responsible corporate policies and practices in the United States
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsored by Business for Social Responsibility, the conference
brought together representatives from five continents to discuss
the challenges companies now face as they expand operations around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bottom-line interest in making sure that the markets
we serve are economically healthy and growing,'' said keynote
speaker Henrique de Campos Meirelles, president and chief operating
officer of BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to a packed crowd, Meirelles noted that BankBoston
reacted to poverty, unemployment, and disinvestment in Boston's
urban areas by establishing a Community Banking Group in 1990.
Since then, the group has grown from seven branches in inner city
neighborhoods to a network of 46 branches in three states.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Gail Snowden, group executive of the
Community Banking Group, the project created a real estate lending
unit and began financing urban development projects.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, Meirelles said, BankBoston has expanded its
outreach to include a relatively new plan to assist women who wish
to launch their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our involvement in community development has been effective
because it is essential to who we are,'' noted Meirelles. ``Having
a community investment policy woven into the fabric of your
business will differentiate you from your competitors.'' Founded in
1992, Business for Social Responsibility is a national business
association with more than 1,400 members and affiliates.
Collect-ively, the organization's members and affiliates employ
more than 6 million workers around the world and have annual
revenues totaling more than $1.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which ends Friday, will feature such speakers as
former Prime Minister Shimon Peres of Israel; Mads Ovlisen,
president and chief executive of Novo Nordisk A/S; Arnold Hiatt,
chairman, The Stride Rite Foundation and chairman of Business for
Social Responsibility; Eileen Fisher, president and chief executive
of Eileen Fisher Inc.; and Tazeem Nathoo, interim chief executive
of Vancouver City Savings Credit Union.

DRUG COMPANIES FIND MONEY IS KEY TO CHINA'S MEDICINE CABINETS 
</HEADLINE>
 PHARMACEUTICALS-1000(2TAKES)-NYT (htv) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BEIJING _ When Sun Lilin emerged from Beijing Children's
Hospital, her pockets bulged with bottles of syrup, her hands
juggled a tower of boxes containing powders and pills. She had
brought her 5-year-old daughter to the clinic with a cough. She
left with two Chinese cold syrups, a potent broad-spectrum
antibiotic, an inhaler and a little round device that jets powdered
medicine into the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's visit cost less than $1. But the medicines cost $60
_ half a month's salary _ almost all of it for the three Western
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medicine has gotten so expensive I really can't afford
it,'' said Ms. Sun, a red-cheeked cleaning woman in a middle
school, echoing a complaint of virtually everyone in China these
days. ``But, of course, she's my only child. And she's sick. I buy
her the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Imported Western pharmaceuticals have taken China by storm,
straining pocketbooks as they hold out promises of cure. Indeed,
the denouement of nearly every doctor's visit in China today is the
prescription of a small pharmacy worth of this year's hottest
medicines, be they non-sedating antihistamines or once-a-day high
blood pressure pills
</P>
<P>
   Such sales have been buoyed by a new and unlikely symbiosis:
Western drug companies have been aggressively courting China's
doctors and hospitals not only with new pills but also with gifts,
money and even kickbacks, practices that are banned in the United
States. Their goal: to gain access to China's 1.2 billion
potentially ailing citizens, most with a seemingly unshakable
belief in the curative power of name-brand Western pills.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Chinese doctors prescribed hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of mostly expensive Western medicine last year. But
they have another motive as well: Cash-strapped Chinese hospitals
are allowed to sell medicines their doctors prescribe at a profit,
and the profit is far greater when doctors prescribe expensive
Western drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong interest group forming of drug companies,
hospital managers and doctors,'' said Qiu Renzong, a professor of
bioethics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ``In China we
produce some equally effective medicines, but doctors don't
prescribe them anymore. The result is a heavy financial burden on
the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, drug sales have become a cash cow for Chinese hospitals
in the past two years, accounting for around 60 to 80 percent of
their revenues, officials say. Although there are hundreds of
Chinese drug companies producing traditional and Western-style
medicine, medicine made by foreign or joint-venture companies now
accounts for well over 50 percent of prescriptions in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Today, foreign drug and medical equipment companies pay for
Chinese doctors to study overseas, buy hospitals new furniture and
provide airline tickets and hotel vouchers for conferences.
</P>
<P>
   In an even more controversial practice, the companies commonly
pay hospital administrators and individual doctors ``commissions''
for stocking and prescribing their drugs, though such payments are
against corporate policies and are illegal in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a pill sells for five yuan, often more than half of that is
spent to give little red packets containing cash to the hospital
director of purchasing, to the pharmacy manager and a bit to the
doctors themselves,'' said Li Ning, the vice president of Beijing's
Chaoyang Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course hospitals have regulations banning kickbacks,'' said
Li, a young general surgeon who studied hospital administration at
the University of Minnesota. ``But this is hard to catch, and we
know the rules are not very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Western firms and China's doctors has
certainly helped introduce valuable drugs and equipment into China,
which generally permits the import of any drug approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. But in other cases the high-priced
products offer only slight advantages. ``Western medicines and
medical equipment have greatly contributed to medical costs that
are rising 35 percent a year,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies operating in China refused to discuss
their practices, but Thomas Reinert, a spokesman for Bayer
Pharmaceuticals in Germany, said that his company priced medicines
lower in China than in most of the rest of the world and that Bayer
specifically forbids payments to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company follows an industry-wide international code
of conduct which allows, for example, sponsoring medical
symposiums, but forbids payments to encourage ordering products.
Still, he said, ``there is a gray zone in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, many in and out of the industry acknowledge that
young Chinese sales representatives, far from corporate
headquarters, often flout conduct codes. Indeed, ``hong bao,'' the
little red envelopes stuffed with cash, are a
semi-institutionalized part of Chinese life, at times offered to
surgeons for operations as well as to journalists in the hopes of a
favorable story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practices that would not be OK in the West are quite common in
China,'' said one industry representative, ``And it's not just
international drug companies _ the Chinese companies are doing it
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Western companies have more money, and their incentives are
tempting to doctors who often make $120 a month and who, without
their help, would have little opportunity to read foreign medical
journals or go to conferences overseas. And, ever since China's
hospitals lost the last of their formerly huge government subsidies
last year, Western drug sales have become essential for balancing
hospital budgets.
</P>
<P>
   While there are tight price controls for Chinese-made medicines,
hospitals are allowed to set their own price for Western drugs.
Some state workers still have health plans that cover the cost of
drugs, but many more now pay for medicines themselves or get only a
small fraction of the costs paid by their employer.

BEIJING: employer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cities like Shanghai and Beijing recently started requiring
patients covered by state insurance plans to pay themselves for any
Western drugs. And this month the State Planning Commission
announced it was planning to issue new regulations to reform the
drug pricing system _ for the third time in three years _ but added
``the consequences of the hospitals' sales business can not be
dealt with overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America opposes
China's proposed price controls, said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman
for the trade organization. ``Virtually all companies are putting
into that country much more than they are taking out,'' he said.
``Most are not making money; they are investing in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, at the third Great Wall International Symposium on
Interventional Cardiology, a small army of Chinese sales
representatives of Western drug and medical equipment manufacturers
welcomed Chinese cardiologists with slides, wristwatches and tote
bags _ most promoting drugs that cost more than the average Chinese
earns in a day, and tests that cost a month's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that by 2001 our sales revenue in China will reach
100 million marks,'' said Li Yumin, who was working at a booth
promoting Bayer's new heart drugs. ``There are 120 million people
with high blood pressure in this country. Their incomes are rising,
and they have better knowledge of disease. So we take every
opportunity to have contact with Chinese doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the pill he was promoting, a once-a-day
high blood pressure pill and heart medicine called Adalat GITS, was
too expensive for most Chinese to use every day for life, which is
the recommended way to treat these chronic ailments. He said the
average Chinese patient takes the medication for only 28 days. It
costs about $1 a pill, compared to the Chinese-made version of the
same drug, which costs pennies but must be taken three times a day,
and so produces less consistent blood pressure levels.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 Chinese take Adalat GITS long term, most all them
from the shrinking group of Chinese who still have government
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   To help advertise this and its new cholesterol-lowering drug,
Bayer helped pay for the heart conference, printing programs, name
cards and financing a satellite hook-up where doctors could watch
advanced heart procedures beamed in from operating rooms. Bayer
also hosted a special seminar, featuring a prominent Chinese
cardiologist describing some of the latest foreign drug trials, the
last of which supported the widespread use of drugs like Adalat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I argue that those who can afford it should take more
effective and expensive drugs,'' said the heart specialist, Dr. Hu
Dayi.
</P>
<P>
   It was a forum that could have been sponsored by any of the
dozens of Western drug companies operating here _ including giants
like Glaxo Wellcome, Eli Lilly and Novartis. And most of the 200 or
so heart specialists in the audience said they appreciated the
update, despite its heavy editorial overlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to learn about new techniques and medicines,
although they will be difficult to use where I come from because of
financial reasons,'' said Dr. Lian Mingfeng, a heart specialist
from a small hospital in Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
   Drug representatives who work in China like to emphasize their
role as educators. But Western doctors who have attended recent
Chinese medical conferences say they are shocked to see the
representatives sometimes giving the central lectures at what are
billed as impartial scientific meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like the Wild West with a lot of flagrantly unethical
behavior and few rules,'' said one, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And Chinese bioethicists have themselves bemoaned the merging of
academic meeting and sales bazaar. Qiu said that his wife, a
stomach specialist, had attended English-language medical
conferences in Hong Kong, where many of the Chinese doctors could
not understand a word of the proceedings. Drug companies ``pay for
their travel and hotel,'' he said. ``The doctors go sight-seeing
and shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Li, the hospital vice president, said that he disliked the close
relationship between hospitals and drug companies, even though it
now keeps his hospital afloat. ``Now the state gives us policies,
but no money,'' he said. ``So for survival the hospital has to have
more patients and prescribe more drugs and scans.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban Chinese are avid hospital-goers and have a strong bias
towards treating ailments with a tonic or pill. Indeed, every
sneeze in China seems to be greeted with the concerned inquiry,
``Are you taking medicine?'' After a spate of newspaper exposes
about counterfeit pills and the poor quality control at some
Chinese pharmaceutical plants, many people have grown at least a
bit suspicious of domestic products. And _ in handbags or in
medicines _ the Chinese are extremely fond of name brands, leaving
Western pills with gangbuster sales and Chinese hard pressed to
afford them.
</P>
<P>
   At a clinic in Yuyao, a city in Zhejiang province, Dr. Fu Zhiyin
prepared to give 35-year-old Huang Yifeng antibiotic pills for her
serious pelvic infection. How many should she take?
</P>
<P>
   ``She should take 36,'' said Fu, matter-of-factly. ``But it
depends how many she can afford.''

Gephardt had a hissy fit. Stick to the sex (which turns people off)
or we walk, was his message. Hyde called that bluff; the boycott
threat was hastily withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume Starr uses his opening time to show how Clinton
exhibited a four-year ``pattern and practice'' of abusing his power
by withholding evidence and tampering with witnesses _ from hushing
up Web Hubbell to coaching forgetfulness in Betty Currie.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers and committee partisans will try to change
the subject to Starr's leaks, expenses and prosecutorial hardball,
as if he and not the president's lawbreaking were the impeachment
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton has undermined the rule of law with his
repeated trivialization of the oath, power abuse beyond ``lying
about sex'' has to be shown before a consensus could form for
removal.
</P>
<P>
   In the matter of Kathleen Willey, the committee needs to know
all the grand jury knows about possible witness intimidation. More
important than who lied about sexual harassment in the Oval Office
is whether the power of the White House, buttressed by private
snoops, was subsequently brought against an individual accuser. The
committee cannot settle a she-accused-he-denied dispute, but it is
duty bound to find out what power, if any, was used to shut her up
after the alleged event.
</P>
<P>
   The committee should grill Starr on other investigations long
overdue for a criminal information. Now is the time to expose the
Clinton manipulation of the FBI in Filegate, as well as White House
influence on Justice Department persecution of Travel Office
employees standing in the way of political patronage. And has Starr
solved the mystery of the reappearance in the first lady's upstairs
office of her long-missing Whitewater billing records?
</P>
<P>
   We have just learned that Starr has been taking the testimony of
John Huang, the Riady family's man at Commerce and the illegal DNC
fund-raising operation. That's in connection with the Riadys'
hushabye payment to the jail-bound Hubbell.
</P>
<P>
   The committee should call Huang, give him use immunity and find
out how Clinton illegally raised millions from Asian sources, which
was soon followed by good news for the Riady clan: a flip-flop of
Clinton policy toward most-favored-nation trade.
</P>
<P>
   If Judiciary is unwilling to look into this, it does not take
seriously its impeachment responsibility. That's because the word
in the Constitution that comes before ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' as a cause for impeachment is ``bribery.''
</P>
<P>
   Huang, a secret participant with Indonesia's James Riady and
Bruce Lindsey at meetings in the Oval Office, knows what policy
advice was solicited and how much hard and soft cash was solicited.
Clinton's Justice Department has avoided questioning Huang for two
years. Why can't we know what Starr has learned _ and why must
Congress depend on the independent counsel for part of the story
when Huang and Lindsey are available to the committee?
</P>
<P>
   The courts have ruled that Clinton cannot cloak the
taxpayer-paid lawyer Lindsey with executive privilege; if Clinton
repeats his unlawful stonewalling order, that would become an
impeachment count.
</P>
<P>
   Looking into illegal foreign fund-raising that borders on
bribery, of course, is not as offputting to the public as delving
into private lives. That's why Clinton partisans want a
``Monica-only'' inquiry into sex lies.
</P>
<P>
   Congress should press Starr to reveal the status of all his
court-assigned investigations. The public's need to know of any
White House abuse of power now outweighs a prosecutor's obligation
to indict lesser figures later.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should the committee rely on any independent counsel as its
only source of information. The unpublicized Select Committee on
Chinagate has yet to share its secret findings with Judiciary.
Before a vote is taken on impeachment, Congress should find and tie
up Starr's loose ends.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. J.C. Watts, a former University of Oklahoma
star quarterback, made history Wednesday by becoming the first
African American elected to the House Republican leadership, giving
the GOP its long-sought chance to show it is a party of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, a telegenic, high-octane orator, defeated Rep. John
Boehner, R-Ohio, a low-key political insider who has served for
four years as chairman of the Republican Party Conference, the
fourth-ranking leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   The 121-to-93 vote for Watts was a startling upset in
Wednesday's secret-ballot Republican leadership elections.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the party conference, which consists of all 223
House Republicans, endorsed Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob
Livingston of Louisiana, 55, to become the 51st House speaker,
replacing Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who announced two weeks ago he
was stepping down in the wake of the GOP's disappointing election
results.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, who spoke briefly to the conference, left for a
Florida vacation with his wife Marianne before most of the votes
were cast. The formal election for House speaker takes place in
January when the 106th Congress convenes, but since the Republicans
have a majority, Livingston's victory is assured.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker-elect promised afterward to cut taxes and save the
Social Security Trust Fund, which could go bankrupt in the 2030s as
the bulk of baby boomers retire.
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``We want the American people to know they're
going to get good, clean, honest government from us. ``We may have
slipped,'' he added, referring to the GOP's loss of five House
seats Nov. 3. ``But we haven't fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts said he, too, looked forward to the next Congress. ``I'm
excited about everyone working together as a team to make sure that
we cut people's taxes, that we strengthen our national defense,
that we strengthen Social Security, we continue working on a health
care system to make it better.''
</P>
<P>
   The 223 Republican House members who convened in the Cannon
House Office Building to select their leaders also reelected House
Majority Leader Richard Armey of Texas after a cliff-hanging three
rounds of votes.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, majority leader since the Republicans took over the House
in 1994, defeated Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma on the third
ballot in a 127-to-95 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Because no one got the 112-vote majority needed to win on the
first ballot, two more rounds of voting ensued, each time
eliminating the lowest scorer. A late entry, Dennis J. Hastert,
R-Ill., the chief deputy whip, was the first to fall, followed by
Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, the first woman to run for majority leader, had faced
opposition among some conservatives because while she is against
the use of federal funds for abortions, she is also pro-choice. She
said later she did not think that position hurt her bid against
Armey. But she said the 11th-hour candidacy of Hastert siphoned
votes away from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have minimal disappointment,'' she said, although she added,
``I would have loved to have put my shoulder to the wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said the Republicans ``decided to continue with Dick Armey
for very good reasons'' _ they wanted ``continuity and stability.''
She added she was glad she ``took the risk at cracking this glass
ceiling.'' Dunn said she does not fear any political retribution
because she challenged the majority leader. ``I really do not
expect any negatives on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent, a Bible Belt conservative and former former Seattle
Seahawks wide receiver, said he was ``not accustomed to losing,''
and would ``continue to fight for the things we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans said the three rounds of voting signaled less
than a ringing endorsement for Armey. ``It shows that there are
some people in our conference that were looking for change,'' said
Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ``Now it's time to repair the breach.''
</P>
<P>
   In another leadership coup, Thomas M. Davis of Virginia replaced
John Linder of Georgia as chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Campaign Committee, the House GOP's fund-raising
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Linder had been tapped by Gingrich to head the committee, but he
was swept from office by Republicans seeking a change. In toppling
him, Davis had a strong assist from Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
Republican whip, or chief vote counter. DeLay was re-elected
without opposition.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)

Republican Conference, a slot vacated by Dunn.

RROR SENDS METEOR VIEWERS TO WRONG PART OF THE GLOBE

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Showers and storms of meteors, it seems, may be a lot like snow
storms and rain showers: Awfully hard to predict. Astronomers who
forecast a &UR;  &LR; storm of Leonid meteors, according to preliminary
reports, may have been a half-a-world off in predicting where the
storm would be the heaviest.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of astronomers from the United States, Canada and other
nations traveled to remote and harsh locations in Asia, including
the Gobi desert in Mongolia, in hopes of catching the peak of an
expected dazzling storm that happens only once in 33 years _ and
sometimes not that often. But it looks like they could have spared
themselves money and time if they had stayed closer to home: The
most spectacular meteor displays may have occurred somewhere over
the Atlantic ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the world's most skilled astronomers had analyzed
centuries' worth of records to prepare their forecasts. Just a few
days ago, they acknowledged that they might be way off in
predicting how many meteors might be seen during the peak, but they
were pretty sure about where and when the peak would be.
</P>
<P>
   If the early reports are right, just the opposite occurred. They
were close on their predictions on the number of meteors at the
peak _ perhaps as many as 1,000 to 2,000 per hour, well within a
predicted range of 200 to 10,000. But they were way off on the time
and location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predicting meteor showers is really a crapshoot,'' said Donald
Yeomans of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, who is considered one of the world's best at
calculating such things. Like most in the field, he was confident
that Asia would be be the best viewing spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out'' on exactly what did happen, Yeomans
said in an interview Wednesday, but the preliminary reports &UR;  &LR; 
strongly suggest that the forecast was about as far off as those
weather reports that have people shoveling six inches of ``partly
cloudy'' off the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anybody is really complaining about it _ except, of
course, the legions of would-be skywatchers who were stuck under
solidly overcast skies during the whole show. That includes most of
New England.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who could see the sky at all, few were
disappointed. Although the peak was in the ``wrong'' place,
virtually every part of the world, at some point, was showered with
meteors at a rate of 100 to 400 per hour. While that's no more than
are seen in some other, lesser meteor showers, it is more than
forecast for this year outside the Asian sites.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ecstatic eyewitness reports flooded the Internet
and radio programs around the world. Observers on different
continents, many of them experienced skywatchers who have weathered
many a meteor shower, said the displays surpassed any meteor
activity they had seen before.
</P>
<P>
   The highest numbers of meteors were reported in the Eastern
Atlantic: in Portugal and at the Canary Islands observatory at La
Palma. A team of professional astronomers from the United Kingdom,
observing at La Palma, reported that as dawn broke on Tuesday
meteors were raining down at a rate of almost one per second, or
nearly 3,600 per hour _ although less than an hour elapsed before
the display was washed out by morning twilight.
</P>
<P>
   A group of observers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., watching from the nearby mountains, said that
even with half the sky obscured by clouds they saw somewhere
between 600 and 1,000 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Green, who has been compiling information from viewers
around the world for the International Astronomical Union's central
clearinghouse for astronomical information in Cambridge, Mass.,
said Wednesday early reports do indeed suggest that predictions of
the peak were off by 12 hours or so, and that Asia missed out on
the highest levels of showers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Considering the amount of money and effort spent to send
scientists to far-flung places that turned out to be relative duds,
he said, there may be a lesson to be remembered next year, whose
Leonid shower is expected to be comparable to this year's _ and
perhaps be the last such Leonid storm for centuries to come:
</P>
<P>
   ``People may not be quite as bold next year,'' Green said,
``about predicting what will happen and when.''

LITTLE SUBSTANTIAL COMES OUT OF APEC MEETING 
</HEADLINE>

 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Hopes that a summit of Asia-Pacific
leaders would launch concrete measures to hoist the battered region
out of financial freefall faded Wednesday, as leaders endorsed a
modest set of recovery plans, a half-baked trade deal, and a vague
commitment to study the controversial question of regulating world
capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow of Malay batik shirts sported by the 21 leaders of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations added a rare bit of color
to a day of long-winded platitudes and blurry proposals. The APEC
leaders added little to the 16-month-old debate of how to rescue
what was the world's fastest-growing region from a downward spiral
that has eviscerated currencies, bankrupted companies, and thrown
tens of millions of people into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   A political dogfight sparked by Vice President Al Gore's vocal
support for protesters demanding more democracy here and across
Asia distracted from APEC's economic agenda. But there is no
indication that leaders would have approved more radical plans even
without the diplomatic ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, APEC summiteers have walked away with
concrete schedules and individual action plans for liberalizing
trade in specific areas. That may be because when APEC held its
first summit in 1993, Asian economic growth was strong, so
cooperation was easy. But at a time of recession and political
foment, it is hard for nations to agree on how to navigate a way up
from down.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, leaders proclaimed victory, even if in muted
tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a successful meeting,'' said Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad. ``Whether it is successful later on, we
will have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior US official who spoke on condition of anonymity
acknowledged that ``meetings don't solve problems. What solves
problems is work.'' He reasoned that ``there's nothing we can do
about the basic fact that this meeting took place in the context of
a political crisis in Malaysia and a rather formidable financial
crisis that has now spread from Asia to a more global scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official asserted that the ``centerpiece of this
meeting was an agreement on consensus for strategies for strong,
credible recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading the communique, however, reveals that most of those
strategies are ones that APEC is merely endorsing, not ones that it
initiated. One is a $10 billion US-Japanese proposal to inject
capital into credit-strapped Asian banks and corporations to spur
investment and growth. Another is the tripling by the World Bank
and the doubling by the Asian Development Bank of lending to create
social safety nets, a rarity in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   US officials also cheered themselves that a nine-sector trade
liberalization deal remained intact, even though only 16 economies
signed on and one key nation _ Japan _ did not give full approval.
The deal will now be passed to the 124-nation World Trade
Organization to gain more support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ideal is alive and well and getting its passport in shape
to get to Geneva,'' another US official said, referring to the
trade organization's headquarters. ``We have 16 economies that have
booked to travel with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, taking the deal to a world forum may be the most
appropriate thing to do. As Asia's recession has affected &UR;  &LR; world
markets, the need for global, not just regional, cooperation has
become painfully apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, an ongoing debate over whether capital flows and
financial markets should be regulated or monitored will be studied
by APEC, but even Malaysia's Mahathir _ the world's most vocal
proponent of capital controls _ said Wednesday that such issues
must be addressed by a larger world community, such as the G22
group of nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with something that involves all the countries
in the world,'' said Mahathir, surprising those who thought he
would push Asia to endorse its own capital controls like those he
imposed here Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   However, the admission that there must be wider participation
beyond Asia on trade and financial systems raises the question of
APEC's relevance as a solo body. The leaders' declaration on
capital flows was also almost verbatim from a statement two weeks
ago by the G7 group of industrialized nations, calling into
question what original thinking APEC leaders did on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say APEC acts as a united catalyst, bringing to a
global forum issues endorsed by a region that accounts for 55
percent of world economic output. But others, especially APEC
business delegates, wish the group would have also taken specific
regional action on trade and business development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is most people are disappointed,'' said Robert
Lees, secretary-general of the Pacific Basin Economic Council, an
association representing 1,100 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's communique also praised China for not devaluing its
currency and endorsed International Monetary Fund austerity
measures that others have criticized as the wrong prescription for
certain Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton, who skipped the APEC summit
because of the Iraqi crisis, is expected to arrive in Japan today
for a two-day visit, where he will urge the world's second-largest
economy to do more for Asian recovery. He then goes to South Korea,
where he will examine economic reforms undertaken after a
staggering financial collapse and $60 billion IMF bailout a year
ago.

<P>
   SUGAR LAND, Texas _ Barney the purple dinosaur, Big Bird and
actor Leonardo DiCaprio were on lists that recently led Macario
Garcia Middle School in this Houston-area suburb to suspend two
13-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   School authorities do not think the lists were anything other
than pranks in which the teens were naming people they disliked _
in fact, each boy's name was on his own list _ but the youths were
suspended late last month.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of violent attacks in schools nationwide this
year, school officials do not consider such pranks funny.
</P>
<P>
   The principal at Garcia Middle School on Wednesday sent out a
letter with some details of the incident, reassuring parents that
the school _ part of the Fort Bend Independent School District _ is
safe for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The teens were suspended for three days after school district
police confiscated the lists of names. The lists, made
independently of one another and not connected, were labeled ``The
List'' and ``A Death List.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Barney and Big Bird, the lists also named eight to 10
peers _ classmates the boys admitted to police they didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   The two boys, whose names were not released, told the
investigating officer they never had any intention of killing or
harming any of those on their lists, said Fort Bend ISD spokeswoman
Mary Ann Simpson.
</P>
<P>
   Although district officials view the lists as a prank, it was a
serious enough prank to be deemed disruptive behavior punishable by
three days of suspension, Simpson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think school safety is at the forefront of all of our
minds,'' said Fort Bend ISD Area III Superintendent Betty Baitland.
``We are very careful with everything we see and hear in schools
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, five teen-age boys in Burlington, Wis., were
arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit murder after a plot
to systematically shoot and kill classmates and administrators
unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   This followed more than a year of school campus horror stories
in which teachers and students were killed and wounded in violent
outbursts by young people in schools around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While the lists at the Sugar Land-area school are being viewed
as non-threatening, concerned parents just finding out about the
incident have been calling for more information, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The boys turned over their lists to a district policeman Oct. 22
after the officer heard rumors and asked the pair for them. The two
were suspended from Oct. 27-29.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia Middle School Principal Jeryl Jean Kyle could not be
reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the letter sent home to Garcia Middle School parents
Wednesday, she has likened the lists to a past middle school fad
involving so-called ``slam books,'' in which pupils were asked to
write things _ usually most unflattering _ about classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something administrators worked very hard to stop,''
Baitland said. ``It was so hurtful.''
</P>
<P>
   In her letter to parents, Kyle said a youth who saw his name on
one of the lists contacted police Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Although no criminal intent or illegal act occurred, she said in
the letter, the pupils were ``given appropriate school disciplinary
penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Simpson said, the two boys saw school counselors
and the parents of one of the boys said he would get outside
counseling as well.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators sought legal advice on just how much they could
tell the parents of those children named on the lists. Parents were
called several days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you notify a parent of something like this, the first
thing they want to know is who wrote the list,'' Baitland said.
``There are some real privacy issues. We had to get some legal
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   The administrator said they were able to give those parents
whose children were on the lists the first names and the first
letters of the last names of the two authors.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle assured parents that their children are safe at the middle
school, and that police found ``no motive, weapons, plans or intent
to harm anyone on that list.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel things are safe and secure at Garcia,'' Baitland said.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Land is an affluent community of 44,000 people about 15
miles southwest of downtown Houston. &QL;

GOP SHUFFLES HOUSE LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The post-election mutiny against Speaker Newt
Gingrich and his leadership team came to fruition Wednesday with
Gingrich formally ousted, his top lieutenant narrowly surviving,
and the first black Republican grabbing power in the House GOP
hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling their management team for the last House session of
the century, Republicans unanimously endorsed Representative Bob
Livingston of Louisiana to replace Gingrich and stopped just short
of dumping the No. 2 in the leadership, Majority Leader Richard K.
Armey of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 223-member GOP caucus also effectively fired their
conference chairman, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, and
replaced him with Representative J.C. Watts, Jr., of Oklahoma, a
charismatic orator who became the first black lawmaker to hold a
national GOP leadership position.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Watts _ and the insurrection against Gingrich and
Armey _ underscored the deep unrest within the Republican caucus
after Democrats unexpectedly picked up five seats in the midterm
elections and sliced the GOP's slender majority to 11 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Watts overthrew Boehner, 121-93, he said the shift
in power ``helps us all take a serious look within ourselves and
see where do we go from here and how do we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts, a Christian conservative and former professional football
player who has refused to join the liberal Congressional Black
Caucus, responded lightheartedly when he was asked about the
historic nature of his election to the No. 4 spot in the House GOP
leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to Disneyland and celebrating!'' said Watts, who won
the position on his 41st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 55, a 20-year House veteran who will relinquish his
powerful chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee when the
106th Congress convenes in January, delivered the message of change
that many GOP members apparently yearned for after Gingrich's
four-year tenure as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his GOP colleagues who were elected to leadership posts
Wednesday, Livingston was nominated on a voice vote for the
speaker's job. The full House will elect him in January, barring
the unforeseen and extremely unlikely possibility that the 211
House Democrats persuade at least six Republicans to join them in
blocking Livingston's election.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich began the closed-door elections by handing a gavel to
Livingston as a symbol of the stunning transition of power. He then
left Capitol Hill for a Florida vacation with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Newt stood before you with the contract, I stand before
you with a new covenant to enact our agenda and build our bases,''
Livingston told the GOP rank-and-file moments later. He was
referring to Gingrich's Contract with America, the policy
centerpiece of the Republican revolution in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas was the only top member of
Gingrich's leadership team who dodged a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the fiercest race, Armey scarcely withstood a multipronged
attack from Representatives Steve Largent of Oklahoma, Jennifer B.
Dunn of Washington, and J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, a draft
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, 58, who was criticized with Gingrich for failing to heed
warnings from many GOP lawmakers that they were not adequately
communicating the Republican agenda before the midterm elections,
needed three ballots to survive but finally prevailed in a
head-to-head showdown with Largent, 127-95.
</P>
<P>
   After each round, the candidate with the fewest votes was
knocked out, first Hastert, then Dunn, and finally Largent.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's near-defeat was seen by many members as a powerful
warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sends a message that we're tired of business as usual,''
said Representative Matt Salmon, an Arizona conservative who
supported Largent. ``Ultimately, he won, but he was sent a message
that to be successful, you've got to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey, more relieved and contrite than joyful, indicated he
received the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate enough that I have been provided an even more
keenly honed opportunity to learn and understand the needs and
interests of this majority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston also discerned a need for change. Referring to the
election setbacks, he told his colleagues, ``We lost focus, we
forgot to say what we stand for, who we are, what we want to do. We
didn't run out of ideas, we simply neglected to run on our ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent, 43, who became a Hall of Fame football receiver despite
his modest size by NFL standards, said he ``has been too slow and
too small my whole life, and this was just one more occasion. But I
will tell you that I'm not accustomed to losing, and I don't like
to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But Largent pledged to work with Armey and the other Republican
leaders, as did Dunn, who lost her bid to become the highest
ranking woman House leader in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to sweep up the residue and bring unity
back to our team,'' Dunn said.

KERRY TESTS WATERS IN GRANITE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ As he works the breakfast crowd at Yoken's, a
pit stop on the presidential primary trail, Senator John F. Kerry
is looking for signs to help him make up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Dutifully, he shakes the hands of the 100 or so members of the
Chamber of Commerce who have come to hear him speak. Cheerfully, he
makes small talk from table to table, though the hour is still
early. With enough encouragement at enough places like this, Kerry
could move ahead with a presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday was his second trip across the border into campaign
2000 terrain, but he is no closer to making a decision. In fact, he
said, he may not register his yea or nay until February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really in the thinking stage,'' he said. ``I can't shed
any greater light on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends, advisers, and aides are egging him on, rooting for the
go sign. From week to week, his friends go back and forth, first
predicting he will run, then backing off, then changing their minds
again.
</P>
<P>
   In his own mind, there are numerous hurdles that need to be
cleared. He still owes $1 million from his super-expensive 1996
Senate race. He and his wife, Theresa Heinz, have to decide if they
want to give up their lives as they know it. And he worries that a
compressed presidential primary process might not allow enough time
for voters to get to know him.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry will visit Atlanta Thursday, raising money to help retire
his loans. Friday he will meet with veteran political hand John
Sasso in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Monday night, he will be at the Wang Theatre in Boston,
trying to raise even more money with the help of a few famous
friends _ Robin Williams, Shawn Colvin, and James Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to test the waters in Iowa, another presidential
proving ground, and travel to California in December for private
talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next months are pretty key,'' he said, aware that other
candidates are already raising money, locking up crucial support.
``You've got to get going at some point so as not to be left in the
dust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I've really been burdened by the debt issue,
and we're trying to get rid of that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife has also signaled some reluctance toward the
roller-coaster, non-stop craziness of a national campaign run. He
said they have had ``chats'' about the possibility of his jumping
into the Democratic fray, but they have not had the serious
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it's sort of ridiculous. That's her expression,''
Kerry said, referring to comments she made recently in New
Hampshire about his potential presidential bid. ``Later, she made
it clear that she was talking about the hurdles you have to get
over on a personal level to be able to decide to do this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If he does get in, Kerry says, both he and his wife would be
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   And he added that if he decides to run, he could run well. He
said he has a fund-raising base of $14 million to $16 million, and
one of the largest direct-mail lists in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Kerry said, his toe-in-the-water testing has
yielded an encouraging response.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a sort of curiosity about the possibility,'' he said.
``I don't find doors slamming shut.''

MIDEAST PEACE WILL NOT COME CHEAP .. GUESS WHO'S GOING TO PAY FOR
IT  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Clinton is promising Israel and the
Palestinian Authority to pick up much of the bill for their new
land-for-security plan. But buying peace will not be cheap, or
easy.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican leadership change means that congressional
scrutiny could be more acute than originally anticipated. Israel's
new aid request raises potential diplomatic problems, as the United
States runs the risk of subsidizing roads to Jewish settlements in
the West Bank. And greatly increasing aid to the Palestinians poses
financial and political difficulties, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clinton administration weighs the Israeli and Palestinian
requests, it is striving to insure that the entire aid package
strengthens rather than further complicates its role as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to seek up to $1
billion for pulling Israeli forces out of the West Bank, over and
above the $2.9 billion in military and economic aid already
earmarked for Israel this fiscal year. The new request comes just
as Congress has reduced assistance to Israel for the first time in
decades, cutting its yearly economic support check to $1.08
billion, from $1.2 billion, the beginning of what was announced as
a 10-year phase-out of nonmilitary aid.
</P>
<P>
   And Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, says he believes he
has a green light to solicit as much as $300 million in new U.S.
assistance _ a big jump in U.S. aid to Palestinian-controlled Gaza
and the West Bank, which has been kept at $75 million annually for
the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, congressional approval did not seem much at
issue. The house speaker, Newt Gingrich, and the minority leader,
Dick Gephardt, had signaled readiness to provide substantial new
assistance. But the Appropriations Committee chairman, Rep. Robert
Livingston, now assured of becoming Gingrich's successor, was one
of the few congressional leaders who has publicly questioned
economic aid to Israel. Congressional critics of Arafat, meanwhile,
are likely to try to continue to block direct bilateral-style aid.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has not yet disclosed the full scope
of its new appropriation request, which represents the fulfillment
of a pledge by the president to help underwrite the costs of the
interim peace accord negotiated last month in Wye, Md.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is considering the details of a package
which will address Israeli security requirements relating to Wye
and Palestinian economic needs,'' Jim Foley, a State Department
spokesman, said last Friday. ``We are planning to consult with the
Hill on this package.''
</P>
<P>
   While the expected U.S. aid package will spotlight the large and
widening gap between aid to Israel and aid to the Palestinians,
irking some of Arafat's supporters, Palestinian economic officials
hope it will institutionalize U.S. economic support of the kind
Egypt has enjoyed since its 1979 peace treaty with Israel.

BUSINESS TAXES IN BAY STATE CONTINUE TO RISE, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts has made progress in slowing the growth
of property tax rates, but businesses shoulder an increasingly
larger share of the burden, according to an industry report
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, compiled by the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation,
blamed a system that allows communities to set one lower tax rate
for residential and undeveloped properties and higher rates for
commercial and industrial properties. According to the foundation,
a nonprofit research group financed by leading businesses, th law
allowed Massachusetts communities to transfer $618 million in
property taxes to businesses from residential payers during the
1998 fiscal year. The amount constitutes nearly one third of the
$2.1 billion in property taxes paid by Massachusetts businesses for
the period, which ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher property tax burden adds to the already high costs
of doing business in the Commonwealth, placing many companies at a
further competititive disadvantage,'' said foundation president
Michael J. Widmer.
</P>
<P>
   Property taxes are calculated according to property values. In
Boston, businesses paid nearly three times the rate assessed to
residences, or $38.45 per $1,000 of property value, the foundation
said. By contrast, in those cities and towns that set the same rate
for residences and businesses, each pays an average of $14.60 per
$1,000 of assessed value.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is undergoing a real estate boom, and residential
values have risen at a faster rate than commercial and industrial
ones. Yet Massachusetts businesses, which sit on 26 percent of the
state's total assessed property value, account for 33 percent of
the entire property tax bill, the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that businesses are hurt under this system.
</P>
<P>
   James St. George, executive director of the Tax Equity Alliance
of Massachusetts, an advocacy group for individual taxpayers, said
businesses had benefited excessively from various tax breaks in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foundation's fundamental message is that you should cut
taxes for businesses and make individuals pay more,'' St. George
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty four states allow communities to tax different property
classes at different rates under a rule known as a classification
law. Among those states, Massachusetts ranks near the top in having
businesses bear a greater portion of the overall property tax
burden, according to the foundation. Still, Massachusetts property
tax rates, once nearly double the national average on a per capita
basis, are now only 10 percent above the average.

 JERUSALEM: with Israel.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the Oslo agreement in 1993, the United States announced a
five-year, $500 million economic aid package for the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip: $375 million in grants from the Agency for
International Development and $125 million in loan guarantees for
new local U.S. business ventures from the Overseas Private
Investment Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The promised AID money was mostly spent _ the bulk of it on
wells, sewage systems and other water installations _ but OPIC has
provided just $6 million in the last five years. ``We cannot
undertake any assistance without a willing private investor,'' said
Lawrence Spinelli, a spokesman for the investment corporation.
</P>
<P>
   From all international sources, the Palestinian Authority was
promised $4.2 billion in foreign assistance in the five years
following Oslo, but received just $2.5 billion, most of it from
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same five-year period, Israel collected $15.3 billion
in military and economic support from the United States,
Palestinians note.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration will gather international donors in
Washington later this month to present a new aid pledge for
Palestinian-controlled areas. The Palestinians hope the meeting
will nearly double international aid outlays, to $800 million or
$900 million yearly, said Anis al-Qaq, who supervises Palestinian
aid receipts as deputy minister of planning and international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious financing issue is the widening network of
bypass roads, circuitously linking isolated Jewish settlements in
Palestinian-governed territory and Israeli-controlled fragments of
the West Bank with each other and with Israel proper.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote to approve the Wye withdrawal pact, the Israeli
Cabinet gave the go-ahead for 12 new bypass routes serving
settlements that will now be left as enclaves within autonomous
Palestinian territory. The proposed 1999 budget, now being debated
in the Israeli Parliament, had already called for a tripling of
annual spending on bypass roads, to $28 million.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the hearts and often even the periphery of local towns
and villages, this emerging parallel road system enables Israeli
motorists to traverse the West Bank with little or no contact with
Palestinian residents. The roads also speed access to and from
Israeli military bases.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the bypass roads are leaching money away from
public works within Israel's borders and entrenching settlements
they oppose. A recent opinion poll commissioned by Washington
showed most Israelis opposing further spending to support Jewish
settlements deep inside the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The road-building program is even more politically fraught for
the Palestinian Authority. The bypasses almost invariably involve
expropriations of Palestinian property, followed quickly by home
demolitions, the forcible expulsion of local residents and angry
street protests led by Arafat's Palestinian opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli military officers persuaded the Netanyahu government
last week to hold off on one planned route through a Palestinian
refugee camp, warning that land seizures there could provoke
violence and disrupt the Wye-mandated troop redeployments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Netanyahu has said that it is ``as clear as daylight''
that putting into effect the new peace accords would accelerate
land seizures for new bypass projects.
</P>
<P>
   In what it called an ``interim'' financing step, the Israeli
government has authorized $60 million for immediate redeployment
expenditures: $24 million to the defense ministry for withdrawing
troops and relocating military bases, $24 million to the ministry
of national infrastructure for bypass roads and $12 million to the
ministry of public security for ``civil defense'' programs in the
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have to remember is that redeployment is not in the
budget,'' said Raanan Gissin, a spokesman for the ministry of
national infrastructure, which under the hard-line leadership of
Ariel Sharon greatly expanded roads and security installations for
the settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Since Israel's jurisdiction over those areas is not recognized
by the United States or any other foreign government, U.S. policy
precludes financing roads or any permanent Israeli installations in
the West Bank _ a restriction considered doubly important as
Washington tries to play the honest broker in talks between the
Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Yet enforcing this could be problematic, U.S. officials concede.

SUNNY DAY REAL ESTATE BREAKS THROUGH CLOUDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - The four-year moratorium on the media is over, and
members of the recently reunited Sunny Day Real Estate are finally
talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more of a story now,'' says guitarist Dan Hoerner,
from a tour stop in Orlando. ``Back in the day, we just wanted to
play and not really worry about doing the band as a career. Now
we've gotten back together and there's something to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the group had granted one interview, which came
during a 1994 tour in support of its debut release, ``Diary,'' on
the Sub Pop label.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed likely, though, that even with press attention, Sunny
Day would always remain low-key. Unlike Sub Pop counterparts such
as Nirvana and Mudhoney, who became media darlings during the
grunge era, Sunny Day was forging a name for itself in the
emotional-rock genre.
</P>
<P>
   But immediately following the release of the group's self-titled
second album _ commonly referred to as ``the pink album'' because
of its pink cover _ the members went their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just infighting,'' Hoerner says of the breakup. ``It
was little, bitchy, ridiculous things that you develop over tours
and over the course of not really knowing what you're doing and
getting in overwhelming situations.''
</P>
<P>
   During the three-year split, Hoerner fled to his farm in eastern
Washington and singer Jeremy Enigk released ``Return of the Frog
Queen,'' a solo album he composed, which was backed by a 21-piece
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In the strangest of moves, bassist Nate Mendel and drummer
William Goldsmith joined Dave Grohl's Foo Fighters _ a media
darling if ever there was one. But during the recording of the Foo
Fighters' second album, ``The Colour and the Shape,'' Goldsmith
learned that Grohl, Nirvana's ex-drummer, had recorded new drum
lines. An irate Goldsmith quit the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got screwed over in the recording,'' Hoerner says. ``He got
all his drum tracks recorded over after he worked his ass off to
put them down. He made the choice and walked away from it and I am
extremely grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldsmith's departure from the Foo Fighters helped pave the way
for the long-awaited Sunny Day reunion. (Enigk and Hoerner had
already been working together again).
</P>
<P>
   The missing piece, of course, was Mendel. The trio had waited
six months for him to join them in the studio, but it never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to the Foo Fighters, we're like a goldfish compared
to a whale. Nate wanted to play the music of Sunny Day, but
couldn't walk away from the money of Foo Fighters,'' Hoerner says.
</P>
<P>
   The band recruited Jeff Palmer, formerly of San Francisco's
Mommy-heads, to play bass and recorded ``How It Feels to Be
Something On.''
</P>
<P>
   The album is the last the group owed Sub Pop as part of its
contract, which raises the question of whether this is a permanent
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're totally going for it,'' Hoerner says. ``We just really
want to make music. I think we're all looking forward to getting
into the studio and making the next record.'' &QL;

LITTLE SUBSTANTIAL COMES OUT OF APEC MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Hopes that a summit of Asia-Pacific
leaders would launch concrete measures to hoist the battered region
out of financial freefall faded Wednesday, as leaders endorsed a
modest set of recovery plans, a half-baked trade deal, and a vague
commitment to study the controversial question of regulating world
capital flows.
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow of Malay batik shirts sported by the 21 leaders of
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation nations added a rare bit of color
to a day of long-winded platitudes and blurry proposals. The APEC
leaders added little to the 16-month-old debate of how to rescue
what was the world's fastest-growing region from a downward spiral
that has eviscerated currencies, bankrupted companies, and thrown
tens of millions of people into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   A political dogfight sparked by Vice President Al Gore's vocal
support for protesters demanding more democracy here and across
Asia distracted from APEC's economic agenda. But there is no
indication that leaders would have approved more radical plans even
without the diplomatic ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, APEC summiteers have walked away with
concrete schedules and individual action plans for liberalizing
trade in specific areas. That may be because when APEC held its
first summit in 1993, Asian economic growth was strong, so
cooperation was easy. But at a time of recession and political
foment, it is hard for nations to agree on how to navigate a way up
from down.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, leaders proclaimed victory, even if in muted
tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a successful meeting,'' said Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad. ``Whether it is successful later on, we
will have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior US official who spoke on condition of anonymity
acknowledged that ``meetings don't solve problems. What solves
problems is work.'' He reasoned that ``there's nothing we can do
about the basic fact that this meeting took place in the context of
a political crisis in Malaysia and a rather formidable financial
crisis that has now spread from Asia to a more global scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official asserted that the ``centerpiece of this
meeting was an agreement on consensus for strategies for strong,
credible recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading the communique, however, reveals that most of those
strategies are ones that APEC is merely endorsing, not ones that it
initiated. One is a $10 billion US-Japanese proposal to inject
capital into credit-strapped Asian banks and corporations to spur
investment and growth. Another is the tripling by the World Bank
and the doubling by the Asian Development Bank of lending to create
social safety nets, a rarity in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   US officials also cheered themselves that a nine-sector trade
liberalization deal remained intact, even though only 16 economies
signed on and one key nation _ Japan _ did not give full approval.
The deal will now be passed to the 124-nation World Trade
Organization to gain more support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ideal is alive and well and getting its passport in shape
to get to Geneva,'' another US official said, referring to the
trade organization's headquarters. ``We have 16 economies that have
booked to travel with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, taking the deal to a world forum may be the most
appropriate thing to do. As Asia's recession has affected &UR;  &LR; world
markets, the need for global, not just regional, cooperation has
become painfully apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, an ongoing debate over whether capital flows and
financial markets should be regulated or monitored will be studied
by APEC, but even Malaysia's Mahathir _ the world's most vocal
proponent of capital controls _ said Wednesday that such issues
must be addressed by a larger world community, such as the G22
group of nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with something that involves all the countries
in the world,'' said Mahathir, surprising those who thought he
would push Asia to endorse its own capital controls like those he
imposed here Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   However, the admission that there must be wider participation
beyond Asia on trade and financial systems raises the question of
APEC's relevance as a solo body. The leaders' declaration on
capital flows was also almost verbatim from a statement two weeks
ago by the G7 group of industrialized nations, calling into
question what original thinking APEC leaders did on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say APEC acts as a united catalyst, bringing to a
global forum issues endorsed by a region that accounts for 55
percent of world economic output. But others, especially APEC
business delegates, wish the group would have also taken specific
regional action on trade and business development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is most people are disappointed,'' said Robert
Lees, secretary-general of the Pacific Basin Economic Council, an
association representing 1,100 companies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's communique also praised China for not devaluing its
currency and endorsed International Monetary Fund austerity
measures that others have criticized as the wrong prescription for
certain Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, President Clinton, who skipped the APEC summit
because of the Iraqi crisis, is expected to arrive in Japan today
for a two-day visit, where he will urge the world's second-largest
economy to do more for Asian recovery. He then goes to South Korea,
where he will examine economic reforms undertaken after a
staggering financial collapse and $60 billion IMF bailout a year
ago.

 &HT;    ARMEY RE-ELECTED HOUSE MAJORITY LEADER
 &HT;    765 words
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican U.S. House of Representatives members on
Wednesday re-elected Rep. Dick Armey of Texas as House majority
leader and tapped Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the sole black
Republican in Congress, to help GOP lawmakers deliver a unified
message during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Armey fended off three challengers to retain the No. 2 position
in the House, but his duties and visibility may be vastly curtailed
under new House Speaker Bob Livingston, R-La., who was acclaimed
Wednesday as the successor to Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced his resignation Nov. 6 after being blamed for
losses in the Nov. 3 election that shaved the already-thin majority
in the House and left Republicans with 223 seats to Democrats' 211.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappiness with the election results claimed two more victims
Wednesday as Republicans picked their leaders. A 130-77 vote dumped
the GOP campaign committee chairman, Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., in
favor of Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner, R-Ohio, lost
that No. 4 seat to Watts in a 121-102 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Texans survived the leadership shake-up. Majority Whip
Tom DeLay of Sugar Land was unopposed for re-election to the No. 3
job in the House, and Armey of Irving was able to stave off his
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   With the mix of new and old leaders, ``we have a good
combination of continuity and fresh faces,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas. ``This vote has re-energized Republicans and reflects a
more accurate image of us as a party.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes may not be over, however. Gingrich had ceded much of
the day-to-day running of the House to Armey, who also became
Republican lawmakers' lead spokesman at weekly news conferences and
Sunday talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is expected to take back some of the power Armey had
enjoyed, and the Texan said Wednesday he could live with that.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich ``had an awful lot of authority that he more or less
handed over to me,'' Armey said in an interview after his
re-election. ``If Bob wants to pull some of this authority back as
speaker, I'm perfectly content to have him do that because, quite
frankly, I think I took on too much in this work. I had the
responsibility while (Gingrich) retained the authority, and it
turned out to be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the authority Armey wielded over legislation came from
Gingrich's usurpation of the powers that traditionally belonged to
House committee leaders. Livingston was one of those leaders, being
Gingrich's hand-picked head of the House Appropriations committee.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, Livingston is expected to return control to
committee leaders, which will be good news for another Texas
Republican, Rep. Bill Archer of Houston, who will return for a
final two-year term as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For rank-and-file Republicans, they're hoping the new team will
cure what they saw as a lack of both substance and style in the
current team. Unhappy GOP members complained that Gingrich, Armey
and other leaders failed to deliver a GOP election platform on tax
cuts, Social Security and education. And when the leaders did speak
out, insurgents complained, they looked and sounded terrible.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, one of Armey's challengers, former football star
and conservative Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., campaigned in part on
his telegenic good looks. Another challenger, moderate Rep.
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., gave Republicans the opportunity to promote
a woman in House leadership. Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., went on
the ballot Wednesday as a last-minute candidate who could appeal to
both conservatives and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The election of majority leader went to three ballots, with the
lowest vote-getter dropping off at each round. Hastert fell first,
then Dunn, and finally Largent as Armey won, 127-95.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Armey's re-election, House members were complaining
about his public appearances: ``He's lousy on TV,'' said Rep. E.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla. ``It's something we have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey blamed his bad TV presence on a Washington press corps
that is obsessed with personalities, not policy: ``You put Dick
Armey on a Sunday morning show and ask him to talk about IMF reform
or tax cuts (or) bankruptcy reform,'' he said, ``and you get a
pretty clear and concise message.''
</P>
<P>
   As for House business, Armey said he can work past the
sometimes-strained relations between Livingston and him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do fine,'' Armey said. ``Bob and I have a long and
colorful history. Fundamentally, Bob Livingston and Dick Armey are
legislators, and we will work well on that.''

ARMEY SURVIVES CHALLENGE TO HOUSE POST 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas survived
a strong challenge Wednesday as Republicans elected their new
leadership team, including the first black GOP member ever to hold
a top post.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the only black Republican in
Congress, won the No. 4 spot in his party hierarchy by beating John
Boehner of Ohio 121-93 for chairman of the GOP House caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other black lawmaker, former Rep. William Gray, D-Pa.,
had ever held a top leadership job in Congress. Gray was majority
whip from 1989-91 when he resigned from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Armey was re-elected to a third term as the No. 2 leader, but it
took three ballots for the Texan to gather a majority of votes. He
beat out Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma on a final ballot of
127-95.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Republicans chose Rep. Bob Livingston of
Louisiana as the new House speaker to replace Newt Gingrich of
Georgia who was pressured into resigning after the GOP lost five
seats to the Democrats in this year's mid-term election.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Sugar Land, Texas, was
re-elected without challenge to his No. 3 post, joining his fellow
Texan Armey of Irving as the only members of the old leadership
team to survive the election fallout.
</P>
<P>
   Both Watts, a former quarterback at the University of Oklahoma,
and Largent, a former pro football star, were backed by
conservative members who tried unsuccessfully last year to remove
Gingrich from the speakership.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Matt Salmon, one of the leaders of that failed coup, said
Watts prevailed in his race and Largent turned in ``a good
showing'' against Armey because ``people were ready for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey faced two challengers because he was generally blamed _
along with Gingrich _ for not accomplishing much in Congress this
year and for failing to develop a unifying message for Republicans
to take to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Dunn of Washington, another Armey challenger, drew
support from the more moderate wing of the caucus, but was
eliminated on the second ballot after tallying only 49 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Armey said he was grateful to be returning next year to his old
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that ... I have been provided an even more keenly honed
opportunity to learn and understand the needs, the interests of
this majority as we go forward,'' he said shortly after his
election.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton of Ennis, who helped rally votes for Armey,
cautioned his fellow Texan to become more in touch with the
concerns of his party colleagues, especially the conservatives, in
the next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Dick needs to listen to the rank and file very
closely,'' Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   Watts said his addition to the leadership team would send a
message of inclusion to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for the Republican Party for America to know
that we're a party of men and women, and red, yellow, brown, black
and white Americans,'' the ex-quarterback told reporters. ``I think
we want to say to everybody that you're welcome in the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The leadership elections ended two weeks of what one member
referred to as ``a back-stabbing, dirty campaign'' by some
candidates to unseat Armey, Boehner and John Linder of Georgia, who
lost his position as chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee to Tom Davis of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   As they emerged from their meeting room, Dunn was the first to
call for members to put the leadership elections behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important to sweep up the residue and bring unity
back to our team,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Livingston a short time later. He
said Republicans would quell their internal spats in an effort to
``work hard'' for the good of the country even if it means reaching
out to the Democrats and the president to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the American people to know that they're going to get
good, clean, honest, efficient government from us,'' Livingston
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're all going to have to work together. We have a
slim majority.''
</P>
<P>
   After the election reverses, Republicans hold an 11-seat edge,
with 233 members to 211 for the Democrats. Rep. Bernard Sanders of
Vermont, the lone independent in Congress, usually votes with the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks to reporters, Livingston said that Republicans
should be looking ahead with confidence to 2000 and the possibility
of winning the White House and gaining back seats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We muffed our message a little bit in the last elections,'' he
acknowledged. ``The American people held us accountable. But as Abe
Lincoln said, a slip is not a fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're going to pick ourselves up and move ourselves
forward, and advance the Republican agenda because that agenda is
what's good for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston said preserving Social Security and passing tax cuts
would be at the top of that legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Although elected to his new position by his Republican
colleagues, Livingston, 55, will still have to be confirmed as
speaker in a vote by the full House when it convenes in January.
But that will be only a formality.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., met with Livingston
to discuss not only management matters related but legislative
issues that they might be able to work together on next year.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt among Republicans about who is in charge,
they were erased Wednesday when Gingrich rose to praise Livingston
during the caucus and urged members to unite behind him. In a
gesture of support, Gingrich handed Livingston a gavel and then
left on a long vacation trip to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who was chairman of the Appropriations Committee
before ascending to the speakership, is a conservative like
Gingrich but is considered to be much more pragmatic in his
approach to getting legislation through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Where Gingrich tended to stress ideology over compromise,
Livingston is expected to emphasize deal-making, an art that won
him the respect of Democrats on the Appropriations Committee.

NEW MEXICO COURTS SPAIN AS BOTH SIDES HOPE TO PROFIT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Four hundred years after Spain conquered New
Mexico, the state this week sent its first trade mission here,
along with American Indian religious dancers, to show there are no
hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ties between New Mexico and Spain have been on the mend
since last April, when a Spanish official visited the state and met
with American Indians whose ancestors suffered during the conquest
by 500 Spaniards in 1598.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sensed opportunity in the 400th anniversary, deciding
it was time to set a new course between Spain and New Mexico, which
belonged to the Spanish crown until 1821 and which gained statehood
in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   The 140-member trade and cultural delegation, among the largest
ever sent by any U.S. state to Spain, comes just months after the
arrival of the new U.S. ambassador, Edward Romero, a Democrat and a
New Mexico businessman who traces his lineage back four centuries
to a village near Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not able to make inroads into Spain with him being
ambassador, I don't know how we ever will,'' said New Mexico Gov.
Gary Johnson, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Spain has rolled out the red carpet for the New Mexico
delegation, part of its plan to build ties with all of its former
territories, whether in Latin America, which has long received
Madrid's attention, or in certain parts of the United States, where
Spain is taking a closer look at the Hispanic traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spain, at the end of the 20th century, with a bigger presence
in the world, and more economic capacity and enthusiasm, wants to
recuperate contact with those areas,'' said Jose Luis Solano, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Spain has worked hard since last spring to gain the confidence
of New Mexico's Indians. Projects under discussion include
assisting in the restoration of Pueblo Indian villages or
exchanging teachers. The effort seems to be paying off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot teach our children to hate. We have to establish a
positive relationship for the next 400 years,'' said Earl Salazar,
governor of the San Juan Pueblo, whose dancers will perform at a
ceremony this week in Madrid and in the village of Romero's
ancestors to bless the new relationship with Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Madrid officials would like to be involved in New Mexico's $45
million Hispanic Cultural Center, which is scheduled to open in
Albuquerque in December 1999. It will showcase Hispanic fine arts,
literature and even cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't stay out of an international Hispanic Cultural
Center, could we?'' said Maria Bassols, a Spanish diplomat. But she
added, ``We don't want big cooperation projects that will fall to
nothing. We want little things that will grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero said Spain appeared to have a two-track approach with New
Mexico, wooing the Indians and also the Hispanic residents in the
state _ like him and his wife _ who have long been proud of their
direct Spanish roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're playing up to both cultures,'' Romero said.
``But it's hard to separate Spanish history in New Mexico from
Native American history. A lot of Spaniards married Native
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's population of 1.75 million is 40 percent Hispanic
and 10 percent American Indian, and many of the latter have Spanish
surnames.
</P>
<P>
   During the visit, New Mexico's Indians, including 19 Pueblo
tribes, hope to sell to Spain's largest department store chain, El
Corte Ingles, at least $600,000 of their hand-made jewelry, while
also courting other retailers.

   SPACE-STATION (Undated) Fourteen years and many billions of
dollars after President Reagan called on the country to build a
permanently manned space station, what is billed as the most
ambitious and difficult undertaking since the building of the
pyramids is about to begin. America's Cold War warrior, though,
could never have imagined when he issued his challenge in 1984 that
the first piece of the space station would be built by Russia and
launched from the republic of Kazakhstan, a country created with
the breakup of the old Soviet Union. When a Proton rocket blasts
off shortly before midnight Thursday (Seattle time), it will not
only mark a new chapter in the space age, but a grand opportunity
for The Boeing Co. to establish itself as the world's leader in the
space business. Boeing is the prime contractor for the space
station.

   HOUSE-LEADERSHIP-DUNN (Washington, D.C.) Jennifer Dunn's rapid
rise through the GOP leadership hit a wall yesterday as her fellow
House Republicans overwhelmingly rejected her candidacy for
majority leader. Republicans accepted Dunn's argument that a
``fresh face'' was needed to diversify a GOP leadership team that
had consisted exclusively of white men. But instead of adding a
woman to the top echelons of leadership, the Republicans made the
surprise move of elevating the lone black GOP congressman, J.C.
Watts of Oklahoma, to the post of conference chairman. Dunn now
resumes life as a rank-and-file member of Congress, pledging to
continue to work to reach out to women voters.

COMMENTARY: HOW DID JAYLA DIE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (bl) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Linda Norton offers us a voice of sanity in the nightmarish
case of Lacresha Murray, a 14-year-old in Texas who is serving a
25-year prison term after being found guilty of beating a
2{-year-old girl to death. The killing occurred in Austin in 1996,
when Lacresha was 11.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norton is a former Dallas County medical examiner who is now
in private practice. She is recognized as an expert in matters of
child abuse and neglect and has testified frequently for the
prosecution in child-abuse cases.
</P>
<P>
   This time, for the first time, she testified for the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been doing forensic pathology since 1974,'' she said in
an interview, ``and I have never had a case affect me like this
one. Lacresha Murray is an innocent child.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha, who has learning difficulties and is big for her age
(which played into the prosecution's efforts to portray her as an
11-year-old monster), was convicted of criminally negligent
homicide and injury to a child in the death of Jayla Belton.
Lacresha was said to have attacked Jayla with such force that she
broke four ribs and ruptured her liver.
</P>
<P>
   There was no legitimate evidence against her, just a
``confession'' that even prosecutors have acknowledged would not
have accounted for the injuries that killed Jayla. There were no
witnesses and no murder weapon, and police investigators who
scoured the premises where the killing supposedly took place could
find no forensic evidence of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   That, said Dr. Norton, is because Lacresha did not kill Jayla.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norton believes that Jayla Belton was a chronically battered
and malnourished child. She noted that dozens of bruises had been
found on her body. ``A lot of those bruises and some of the healing
abrasions were clearly quite old,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norton was openly and harshly critical of the Travis County
Medical Examiner, Dr. Roberto Bayardo, for not conducting the kind
of tests during his autopsy that she believes would have confirmed
that Jayla had long been physically abused and had not been
adequately fed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't even weigh the body,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bayardo acknowledged Wednesday that ``the baby was small, that's
for sure.'' But he said he hadn't weighed the body because ``at
that time we were in an old building. We didn't have a scale.'' So,
he said, ``We just estimated the weight, whatever it was.''
</P>
<P>
   He told me he had seen many bruises but had not conducted the
microscopic examinations that would have indicated when they had
been inflicted because there was no need for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They only tell you when the injuries are old,'' he said.
``When they are old I can see it by my naked eye.''
</P>
<P>
   His eye, he said, told him that the bruises had only recently
been inflicted. He said he did not believe Jayla had been
chronically abused.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked if he thought an 11-year-old girl could have
exerted enough force to rupture the baby's liver, he replied,
``This was not your usual 11-year-old girl.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of May 24, 1996, Jayla's mother's boyfriend,
Derrick Shaw, dropped Jayla off at the one-family home in Austin
where Lacresha lived with three siblings and their grandparents,
R.L. and Shirley Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norton believes Jayla had been seriously injured, perhaps by
a kick or some other blow to the abdomen, before she was dropped
off. The child's behavior that day, as described by members of the
Murray family, was consistent with that, she said. Jayla, usually
ravenous, refused to eat. She brought up whatever food was given to
her. She wanted only to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Norton said she believed the child's liver had already been
damaged, and that Jayla was bleeding and ``going into shock all day
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha and her grandfather rushed the child to the hospital
early in the evening. Hospital personnel tried for more than 20
minutes to revive her.
</P>
<P>
   Said Dr. Norton: ``With CPR on a child, you're talking about 100
compressions a minute.'' That's more than 2,000 powerful chest
compressions on a very thin child. Dr. Norton believes the rupture
of the already damaged liver occurred then.
</P>
<P>
   Lacresha became a suspect because Bayardo told police that Jayla
could not have survived more than a few minutes with a ruptured
liver, so the killer was probably the last person with the child.
Lacresha had carried Jayla into the hospital.

TEXANS WIN BIDDING WAR FOR ALAMO EYEWITNESS ACCOUNT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two men, described only as ``native Texans,'' bid a winning
$350,000 Wednesday _ topping a University of Texas offer by $50,000
_ during a tense, four-minute Los Angeles auction for an eyewitness
account of the Battle of the Alamo and the summary execution of
Davy Crockett afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they intend to keep the manuscript in Texas; that was
their sole motivation behind buying it,'' said Wendy Evans Hoff,
the New York agent who placed the clinching bid by telephone.
``They will probably make an announcement in the next 60 days about
their intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to comment on her clients' identities beyond saying
they are private investors with Texas roots. With commissions, the
700-page manuscript cost them $387,000, well above the auctioneer's
valuation of $200,000 to $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although amateur historians and a deceased handwriting expert
have questioned the diary's authenticity, historical authorities of
the period generally believe it is genuine. Some would prefer to
see further forensic tests, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever has bought it, I hope they are responsible stewards
and run the sort of tests that this document requires and settle
this debate once and for all,'' said Stephen L. Hardin, a Victoria
College historian who specializes in early Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The diary by an obscure Mexican officer, Lt. Col. Jose Enrique
de la Pena, caused a sensation when its 1974 English translation
described the execution of Crockett and six other Alamo survivors.
Crying foul were Crockett fans raised on Walt Disney's version of
the coonskin-capped frontiersman going down swinging his musket,
Betsy. They asserted that the diary was a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The UT System's representative at the auction, Don Carleton,
said he was satisfied the papers are genuine, citing various
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Carleton, the only one of four bidders physically present at the
Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield auction room, stopped bidding at
$300,000. ``With public funds, there was a limit beyond which you
cannot go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He welcomed the new owners' statement, relayed by Evans Hoff,
that the documents will remain in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case, I'll be happy,'' said Carleton, director
of UT's Center of American History, ``I'd be even happier if it
stays in a public institution, like UT.'' It had loaned to the
University of Texas at San Antonio library from Ruby Peace, whose
husband purchased it in Mexico City.

WHEN ALL THAT GLITTERED WAS GLAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A great scene occurs at the beginning of Todd Haynes' new movie,
``Velvet Goldmine:'' A pack of teen-age glam-rock fans, all vibrant
and sparkly in glitter makeup, high heels, flashy clothes and long
hair, run laughing through staid, gray London.
</P>
<P>
   They are clearly having the time of their lives, reveling in
their youth, their ability to shock, their sheer otherness.
</P>
<P>
   They adjust their makeup and crowd into a hall to hear the
sparkly, vibrant, campy music of Maxwell Demon (the alter ego of
Brian Slade), who comes onstage in a shower of feathers and squeals
and theatrical sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Velvet Goldmine'' gets a lot wrong _ Ewan McGregor's
Michigan-street-kid accent, for starters _ but for these few
minutes, at least, it's rock 'n' roll nirvana, and a piece of
history. Between 1972 and 1975, glam was the music of choice for
hundreds of thousands of young English rock fans _ and a few
American ones.
</P>
<P>
   The major guiding force, of course, was David Bowie, whose
theatrical live presentations and concept LPs, such as ``Diamond
Dogs,'' were loved by fans and critics.
</P>
<P>
   But right behind him (at least in England) was the art-pop of
Roxy Music, the teen heartthrob/sugar-metal of Marc Bolan's T. Rex,
the stompalong party anthems of Slade and Sweet, the more
aggressive, wise and cynical Mott the Hoople, and Gary Glitter's
campily updated take on Vegas-era Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Here was something totally different amid 20-minute
progressive-rock workouts by Yes and Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin's
blues-based hard rock, and the folk of Crosby, Stills &AMP; Nash.
</P>
<P>
   Guitar-based _ but not full of long, bombastic solos _ melodic
and given to catchy, sing-along choruses, glam could be seen as an
antidote to all of the above. Here was youth and fun and the first
blush of young lust, wild clothes and long nights of mirth-making.
Here was the party.
</P>
<P>
   As with punk (which drew from it and followed it) you didn't
have to be a virtuoso to play it. The songs were most often
concerned with being young and carefree, the romance of love and
club life (in Roxy's case), of violence and decadence and life on
the road (Mott) and related topics.
</P>
<P>
   It is in portraying the heady rush of glam that ``Goldmine''
flourishes: The era was all about the right image as much as the
actual music, although the music was frequently wonderful. Glam
could seem as much a fashion show as a musical movement, although
the music influenced even nonglam acts, like Elton John and the
Rolling Stones.
</P>
<P>
   And because it was so campy and cute _ and the music so much
more purely pop than the boogie and prog-rock filling stadiums at
the time _ glam never caught on in America.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Bowie, who became a huge star, glam in America
consisted of bands getting one or two hit singles, such as Mott's
``All the Young Dudes.'' American hard rock fans simply wanted the
more macho, harder, deadly serious fare of Aerosmith and Black
Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'70s, glam had faded. Bowie went underground to get
his life together in Berlin; little girls grew up and got tired of
Marc Bolan (who died in an auto crash in 1977); Ian Hunter left
Mott; and Roxy Music broke up. Then punk came along and captured
the interest and imagination of a new generation of teen-age rock
fans.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, glam became part of the mainstream. Mott fan
Mick Jones co-founded the Clash; Roxy's sound was a huge influence
on the New Romantic movement of the '80s and, to a lesser extent,
the Cars. Joan Jett covered Glitter, and Quiet Riot had two big
hits with Slade songs, ``(Mama Weer All Crazee Now'' and ``Cum on
Feel the Noize).''
</P>
<P>
   And glam's still around: Marilyn Manson dresses up his sound and
his image to remind us of David Bowie circa 1972. English bands,
such as the London Suede and Pulp, draw on Roxy Music as a major
influence. Glitter's ``Rock and Roll Part 2'' (the one where
everybody goes ``Hey!'' over and over) is heard at basketball and
hockey games everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in England, there is talk of a ``glam revival.'' But as
glam was never a major movement here, the chances are far slimmer
that Americans will embrace it. But that's OK. Glam was about a
moment (pre-AIDS, pre-anti-drugs) when we liked our rock stars to
be flamboyant. On its own, it couldn't and wouldn't work in these
more conservative times, but its influence will never really
disappear. Dave Ferman, (817) 390-7839 dfer\Nstar-telegram.com]

EDITH WHARTON: A LIFE NOT SO INNOCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edith Wharton was born into the society she would write about.
Her wealthy parents moved in the highest New York circles, and they
afforded their daughter a private education in the United States
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   She was born Edith Newbold Jones in 1862. At 23, she married the
considerably older Theodore Wharton, a fellow blueblood, who proved
to be neurotic and alcoholic. After only a few years, and with the
marriage possibly having never been consummated, Edith left him.
But divorce was out of the question, and she remained forever
``Mrs. Wharton.''
</P>
<P>
   She began writing short stories, and her first submissions to
women's magazines were anonymous. But after Henry James encouraged
her, she began signing her stories and made her hardcover debut at
37, just before the century's turn, with the story collection
titled ``The Greater Inclination.''
</P>
<P>
   Five books later and securely established, Edith Wharton moved
permanently to France in 1907, returning only occasionally to
America for brief visits. What the American literary community
learned about Wharton during her years of living abroad was mainly
what she chose to reveal. Confident that her celebrity would
endure, she left letters and other papers ``for my biographer,''
and was certain that she had accomplished an immaculate deception.
</P>
<P>
   Several earlier Wharton biographers never caught on, but R.W.B.
Lewis did a more thorough investigation, found other papers and
decoded information about a long love affair initiated soon after
Edith took residence abroad. The man in question was a man of
letters _ Morton Fullerton, himself unhappily wedded _ and their
secret liaison endured until Fullerton died in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' biographical study of Wharton won the Pulitzer Prize and
National Book Critics Circle Award for 1976. In its aftermath,
scholars have correlated Edith Wharton's life with her more
renowned works, particularly ``Ethan Frome'' (paraphrasing her own
unhappy marriage) and ``The Age of Innocence'' (the affair with
Fullerton).
</P>
<P>
   Edith Wharton died in 1937. She is buried at Versailles.

GRIM, SHOCKING, DIDACTIC, A NEW NEW WAVE ROLLS IN  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 22)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
Phillip Lopate's collection of film criticism, ``Totally, Tenderly,
Tragically,'' has just been published by Anchor Books. 
 By PHILLIP LOPATE  
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   These days a mood of optimism and brash confidence has once
again taken hold of French filmmaking. A new generation of films _
``My Sex Life,'' ``Irma Vep,'' ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' and ``I
Stand Alone'' _ is causing an international stir with its
uninhibited depictions of contemporary society, and taking festival
prizes and even finding American distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Some are calling it the new New Wave, the Next Wave or the
Re-New Wave; others, more skeptically, a hype-created ripple.
</P>
<P>
   The original Nouvelle Vague, or New Wave, of the 1960s looks, in
retrospect, like a miracle, with Jean-Luc Godard, Francois
Truffaut, Eric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, Alain Resnais, Louis Malle,
Jacques Rivette, Agnes Varda and Jacques Demy all re-inventing
cinema as free expression. Even if such a national renaissance
cannot expect to be repeated in a half-century, there is no
question that French filmmaking is undergoing a resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   The old New Wave was a band of brothers: Parisian
film-critics-turned-directors who started out as friends and
collaborators (whatever fallings-out later occurred). But the
current crop of auteurs tends to be more fragmented and tribal.
</P>
<P>
   To oversimplify: one tribe (Arnaud Desplechin, Olivier Assayas,
Mathieu Amaric) consists of Parisian, largely Jewish, intellectuals
making realistic, urbane, analytical films about the lives of
graduate students, wannabe writers and professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Another tribe (Erick Zonca, Gaspar Noe, Mathieu Kassovitz, Bruno
Dumont) focuses more somberly and often angrily on the working
class _ dropout youths from the provinces or the housing project
neighborhoods or suburbs, who either get into trouble or get
trapped on the assembly line.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most gifted of the lot is Arnaud Desplechin. His
first feature, ``La Sentinelle'' (released here last month), was a
fascinatingly layered drama about a medical student finding a
severed head; his attempt at identifying it leads to a hornet's
nest of issues about loyalty and politics at the end of the cold
war.
</P>
<P>
   Besides writing extraordinarily eloquent dialogues, Deplechin is
a stickler for physical gestures and will film multiple takes until
he gets exactly the right shrug or cigarette angle he is looking
for. His second feature _ and so far the masterpiece of the new New
Wave _ is ``My Sex Life (or How I Got Into an Argument),'' a
three-hour, richly novelistic comedy about several brainy,
competitive, neurotic philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   The charmingly hangdog Mathieu Amalric plays Paul, a perpetual
student who can't seem to finish his doctorate and keeps
vacillating among three women. Amalric, whom the New York Times
film critic Janet Maslin described as ``his generation's
Jean-Pierre Leaud,'' projects a shy, likable warmth,
self-deprecating intelligence and decency even when he is playing
lecherous Peter Pan characters who resist growing up. (Amalric's
own feature, ``Eat Your Soup,'' was praised by Godard as the best
film he'd seen in years.)
</P>
<P>
   Fellow filmmakers were drawn to him. ``I think it's because I
wasn't an actor at the start that I got used so much; I know I have
very little range,'' Amalric said in New York recently, with a
puckish smile. ``I mostly work for filmmakers who speak in the
first person, and who can imagine me as their alter ego.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did this ``first person'' style come from? One of the less
desirable effects of the original New Wave's aura was its tendency
to eclipse the very talented generation of filmmakers that
immediately followed. Maurice Pialat, Andre Techine, Chantal
Akerman, Bertrand Tavernier, Jean Eustache, Philippe Garrel, Benoit
Jacquot and Jacques Doillon, all labored in the shadow of the New
Wave's glamour, creating a daring, often brilliant body of work
without ever achieving name art-house status.
</P>
<P>
   But the personal, intransigently marginal filmmaking of
(especially) Eustache, Garrel, Ms. Akerman and Doillon had a
greater influence on the younger filmmakers than did their New Wave
elders.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Eustache's ``Mother and the Whore'' (1973), a
three-hour film about an overeducated, underachieving guy torn
between two women, has haunted much of the French cinema that
followed, setting a reproachful standard for honesty and intensity.
Its archetypal French film plot, of extracting oneself from an old
love and immersing oneself in a new, had an obvious influence on
Deplechin's ``My Sex Life'' and Garrel's ``Birth of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the other camp, Gaspar Noe has said: ``I love
Eustache. He came from the lower class, and he had some anger,
something existentialist, almost Dostoyevskian, that is totally
missing in the other French directors.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Wave opened the door to a fresher, more casual
filmmaking approach: real locations, improvisations, jump-cuts,
hand-held camera, self-reflexive distancing jokes. Today's younger
filmmakers take this vocabulary as a matter of course; their shocks
come from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gaspar Noe's ``I Stand Alone'' is an act of aggression against
audiences: its protagonist, an unemployed butcher, kicks his
pregnant wife in the stomach and either slits his daughter's throat
(or fantasizes doing so) while spewing racist, homophobic,
incestuous thoughts on the soundtrack. All in the service of what
the filmmaker calls ``a cinema of catharsis.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this brutality is undercut by jarring sound effects,
supergraphic titles and a sly, over-rhetorical expressionism. Noe
says that the deadpan comedy in Leonard Kastle's 1970 cult classic,
``The Honeymoon Killers,'' served as his model.
</P>
<P>
   A slight, polite, head-shaven young man, Noe was delighted that
a man fainted at this year's Toronto Film Festival screening, and
chagrined that the New York Film Festival audience seemed to take
his shock treatment in stride. Callowly provocative as his
worldview sometimes seems, he has a filmmaker's instinctive touch:
a genius for arresting compositions and poetically grim locations.
</P>
<P>
   Noe professes little use for the films of his contemporaries
Assayas and Desplechin, much less Rohmer, with their (to his mind)
privileged, boringly bourgeois characters. He much prefers the
stark, harsh portrait of a racist delinquent in Bruno Dumont's
``Life of Jesus,'' which won le Prix Jean Vigo for best first
feature in 1997, or Mathieu Kassovitz's lacerating if sophomoric
``Hate,'' about disaffected multicultural youth, or this year's
surprise debut hit Erick Zonca's ``Dreamlife of Angels,'' which
follows the dead-end lives of two young working-class women.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Lumpen types are more naked, you can see their scars more
easily. I don't think I could ever shoot a movie about high
society,'' says Noe.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver Assayas, at 43 the veteran of the Parisian group, rolls
his eyes at Noe's comments; he's heard it all before. ``I respect
his and his friends' filmmaking, but what I don't like is their
saying that the reality they're depicting is the only reality. I
don't like the sanctimonious aspect of their discourse. To my mind,
modern alienation, the pain of everyday life, the lack of meaning,
is as strong and disturbing for the petit bourgeoisie as for the
working class.''
</P>
<P>
   Assayas has evoked that pain most powerfully in his 1994 film
``Cold Water,'' about middle-class youth in the 70s who lash out at
inner emptiness with drugs, stealing and self-destructive behavior.
The remarkable 20-minute party scene in which they trash a suburban
home is one of the apotheoses of recent French cinema, and a
triumph of Assayas' patient, observantly mobile camera.
</P>
<P>
   He followed it up with the comic, wildly satiric ``Irma Vep''
(1996), starring the Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung, about a film
production that also gravitates toward chaos.
</P>
<P>
   But in his most recent film, the soon-to-be-released ``Late
August, Early September,'' Assayas opts for a more thoughtful,
mature focus, as he charts a circle of friends turning 40 and
facing career disappointments, aging and death. There is nothing
``privileged'' or ``safe'' about the raw feelings and economic
struggles of this group on the precipitous verge of middle age,
still trying to construct authentic selves.
</P>
<P>
   An important filmmaker who bridges the Parisian and the
proletarian group is Claire Denis. She is a good friend of Assayas,
and her movies (like ``No Fear, No Die'' and ``I Can't Sleep'')
treat the problems of African guest-workers or Algerian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In these subtle, empathetic films, Ms. Denis uncovers the
growing pains of a new, multicultural French society, without the
blunt didacticism of other, politically progressive filmmakers who
are trying to speak out against the National Front's brand of
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Issues of class, cinematic style and genre can't help
intersecting. The bruised, proletariat characters in last year's
``Life of Jesus'' _ as inarticulate as cows in the field _ are
served well by a bleakly minimalist Bressonian style. Paradoxically
the audience for such movies is almost entirely the educated middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the film theorist Stanley Cavell once
observed that one of the reasons the characters in witty talking
comedies were nearly all middle-class was that the middle class had
the leisure to converse. Another key dividing line in French cinema
today is the degree to which the pervasiveness of American
filmmaking is resisted or embraced.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, even as the French film industry began to
speak out against the market domination of Hollywood, many French
film school graduates became enamored of the jazzy rhythms and
darkly smirking attitudes of Quentin Tarrantino, David Lynch and
other American independent filmmakers. As one of these graduates,
Gaspar Noe, said, ``I feel more in common with Todd Haynes' `Velvet
Goldmine' or Todd Solondz's `Happiness' than I do with most French
filmmakers.'' His new motion picture, ``Enter the Void,'' will be
shot in English.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Mathieu Kassovitz has also moved, temporarily, to
Hollywood and is trying to mount an English-language production.
The Parisian tribe of Deplechin and Assayas would seem to be
clinging to a more self-consciously French style, with their
slower, talkier, more character-driven and nuanced chamber dramas.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the two esthetics is hilariously sent up in
Assayas' ``Irma Vep,'' when a young French journalist interviews
Maggie, the beautiful Hong Kong actress who is about to star in an
art-film remake of the 1915-16 classic ``Les Vampires.''
</P>
<P>
   The journalist says he can't stand these precious French art
films; the only motion pictures that are truly alive are the Hong
Kong and Hollywood action flicks. His harangue is actually a
paraphrase of opinions expressed by Mathieu Kassovitz in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But when I asked Assayas whom he was satirizing he said:
``Myself! He's like a monstrous version of myself as a young man. I
began in film criticism, I wrote the issue on Hong Kong movies for
Cahiers du Cinema and then I found, to my horror, that people were
using Hong Kong action films to trash the values of the other
moviemakers whom I loved _ like Bergman and Rohmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most of the original New Wave directors are still
alive and working, though their avuncular expressions no longer
shake the world as they did when they were Young Turks. Rohmer's
most recent, ``Tale of Autumn,'' is the wise, delicately witty work
of a septuagenarian; Resnais' latest, ``Same Old Song,'' is
sublimely mellow, melancholy, lyrical; Godard continues to stretch
the boundaries between fiction and essay-film with his video
series, ``Histoire(s) du Cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   The patriarchs are busy commenting, kibitzing, appreciating (and
sometimes, no doubt, wishing ill to) the younger filmmakers who
have inherited their mantle, and who basically ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   Both the new Parisian and the provincial-working-class camps
have surprisingly much in common: a sexual frankness; an emotional
grittiness; an openness to Cassavetes-inspired, informal camera
work, a resistance to the frothy lure of ``Gallic charm,'' which
many Americans still expect from French movies.
</P>
<P>
   France has continuously been one of the great national cinemas _
which means that at no time in the last hundred years have
impressive movies not been made there. But American audiences don't
always get the chance to see French quality films because of the
vagaries of distribution.
</P>
<P>
   During the 80s, there was a near-blackout; now, thanks partly to
the promotional hype surrounding this new New Wave, that situation
may be rectified. If so, it is hype in a worthy cause.

   SYCAMORE, Ill. _ It was not quite 8 a.m. as Jan Binder stood on
the sidewalk in a cold Midwestern drizzle. Her fellow workers
hustled past her toward the office, some of them shaking their
heads in dismay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're thinking,'' Ms. Binder said, ``she doesn't have the
sense to come in from the rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shivers, the tall woman with auburn hair stood in
the drizzle, her fingers clutching the last precious inch of a
burning cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   To be a smoker in America today is to be an outcast. It means
being viewed as weak, offensive and, perhaps most of all,
dimwitted. These are people, after all, who do not seem to have the
sense to come in from a toxic thunderstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who have never smoked cannot fathom why anyone would
put a cigarette in her mouth and draw the noxious fumes. It should
be simple to stop. But almost anyone who has smoked heavily knows
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   There are few riddles in life more enigmatic than the spell that
smoking can cast, even to smokers like Jan Binder, a smart
38-year-old who has walked the horror chamber of nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   It was two years ago, in a hospital room, that a doctor looked
into the eyes of her husband, James, and told him, ``Mr. Binder,
you have lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening her husband walked in the door at home, switched on
a lamp, turned to her and sized up his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't regret anything,'' he told her, ``except a few million
cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, he was dead. He was 37. His daughter Mary
was 7. Kate was 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they told Jim he was going to die,'' Ms. Binder said,
``and I saw the look on his face, I knew I would never smoke
again.''
</P>
<P>
   She was certain sheer will power could do it. But it was like
willing herself to stop drawing breath.
</P>
<P>
   She has tried going cold turkey. She has tried the nicotine
patch. She has tried the drug Zyban.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has worked for more a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``People look at me and think, `How can you still smoke?''' Ms.
Binder said. ``And God knows, I don't want to smoke. But I am like
a slave to it. It rules your life.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a woman who scarcely lacks fortitude. Besides her
full-time job for a state education consortium that oversees
programs for disabled students, she fills her late husband's
partnership in his pizza business, doing the books and overseeing
the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   She digs deep into her pockets to pay for her daughters to
attend private school, to take piano lessons, to play soccer and
softball. She rises before daybreak to clean the house and wash
school uniforms. She carries 50-pound bags of water softener down
the stairs to her basement.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to those feather-light sticks of tobacco, she
feels helpless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think they should just lock me up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her girls, Mary and Kate, have come to view cigarettes the way
some children think of monsters under the bed. They have thrown
their mother's cigarette packs into the trash. In some cases, they
have taken each cigarette out of the pack and broken every single
one into pieces.
</P>
<P>
   They have begged, pleaded and cajoled her to stop. And they have
thrown tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   Kate erupted in the kitchen one afternoon after seeing her
mother light a cigarette, shouting that she hated her, over and
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Binder listened for a long time, motionless and ashamed. She
knew that the girls worshiped the memory of their father. In one of
those moments of weakness that every parent experiences, and
regrets immediately, she looked for mercy. Why, she asked the
girls, did they so scorn her for smoking, when they had given a
pass to their father when he smoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' Kate screamed, her eyes blazing with anger, ``I
didn't know he was going to get tumors and die.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the rare smoker who does not wish to quit. A recent survey
found that two-thirds of smokers have tried seriously to stop, most
of them at least three times. Medical experts say nicotine has a
powerful effect on the chemistry of the brain, improving mood and
in some cases masking depression. One treatment for that is an
anti-depressant like bupropion hydrochloride, which has been
marketed as Zyban as an aid to quitting smoking.
</P>
<P>
   What is not as commonly understood, is the way that smoking
makes people feel guilty and ashamed, looking at themselves as
failures for not being able to kick a habit.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As a child growing up in the Wisconsin suburb of Monona, just
outside Madison, Ms. Binder rode with her family in the car almost
every weekend to see her grandparents in the farm town of
Dodgeville. The car was always full of smoke, a cloud that billowed
from the cigarettes of her father, a high school history teacher
and football coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated the smoke,'' Ms. Binder recalled. ``It made me sick.''
</P>
<P>
   As a 12-year-old, walking home from Winnequah Junior High
School, she watched a girlfriend pull out a pack of cigarettes and
light one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me one of those,'' young Jan Louise Rundle told her
friend.
</P>
<P>
   She took a puff and coughed, puffed again and coughed harder.
Determinedly, she kept smoking until she could draw the smoke into
her lungs without gagging. Moments later, feeling dizzy and
lightheaded, she walked home to her family's three-bedroom ranch on
Arrowhead Drive.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, she reached into her father's pockets and took one
of his cigarettes. She smoked it on the way to school, cupping it
in her hands to hide it.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, she was a talented artist, the queen of the
``Snowball'' dance, a star athlete. She was named to the all-state
team of top basketball players in Wisconsin. Through it all, she
smoked.
</P>
<P>
   She did not sit in the parked cars outside the school building
and puff, like many of the other students who smoked. That was far
too dangerous, especially for a girl whose father was a teacher at
the school. She picked her spots more carefully.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she used lunch money to buy cigarettes, plunking her
change in vending machines or buying packs at the corner store. If
the clerk raised any question about an adolescent's buying
cigarettes, she simply explained that they were for her father. But
usually, there were no questions.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, it was hardly scandalous for young people to
smoke. Many of their parents, after all, had started smoking
themselves as teen-agers. And the signals from popular culture made
cigarettes seem acceptable, even downright wholesome.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody over age 35 can remember flickering images of Johnny
Carson on the living room television, smoking away as he chatted
and laughed with guests. Even Andy Griffith, as nice a sheriff and
as fine a Pa as television ever created, would occasionally relax
with a cigarette in his Mayberry home. President John F. Kennedy
was known to sometimes smoke a cigarette. Baseball star Richie
Allen would smoke in the dugout before strutting to the batter's
box, where he often slammed home runs. And the great Green Bay
Packers coach, Vince Lombardi, smoked on the sidelines and racked
up football championships.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers' lounges were usually hazy with smoke. Some high
schools even had smoking lounges for students. No table was
properly set without an ashtray. People smoked just about
everywhere they went, even at wakes, puffing away as they paid
their last respects.
</P>
<P>
   After Jim Binder was diagnosed with cancer, he tried valiantly
to live a pristine life. Facing death, he bore a crushing guilt, a
husband and father who would be leaving his family behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted so desperately to undo what he had done,'' Ms.
Binder said
</P>
<P>
   To extend his days, he ate organic foods and drank herbal tea.
He meditated. He prayed.
</P>
<P>
   And he tried his very damndest to give up cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   But there were moments, early in the morning before the children
would rise, that he would sit out on the back porch, gazing into
the distance, drawing hard on a cigarette, shrouded in a smoky
cloud that, for the moment at least, served as a kind of scutcheon.
</P>
<P>
   It is now his wife who carries the guilt, a mother who cries in
the shower about her fatherless children, and about their terrible,
completely logical fears when they see her light up. She has gotten
rid of the ashtrays in her house.
</P>
<P>
   She has vowed so many times to her children that she will quit,
often setting a date. And when that time comes, she tries. The
minutes crawl like years, and she feels as if she is coming out of
her skin, a jangle of nerves and emotion. And suddenly her hand is
reaching for a pack, almost reflexively. Or she is standing at the
counter of a convenience store, with the $3 that will feed an
insatiable craving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to quit _ I have to,'' she vowed one recent day, as
a cigarette burned on a plate, a makeshift ashtray, in the kitchen
of house that falls quiet, too quiet, in the nighttime. ``I just
don't know how.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This holiday season, go for the glitz and the glow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the perfect time of the year to go a little over the
top,'' says Jerry Bolduan, a contributing editor to Martha Stewart
Living magazine. ``If last year you decorated with just flowers or
fruit, mix flowers, fruits and foliage this season. And use twice
as many flowers.'' But he warns, ``this is not inexpensive to do.''
</P>
<P>
   For more glitz, he suggests silver or gold accents. John Loring,
design director for Tiffany &AMP; Co., agrees that ``the holidays cry
out for glitter.'' He says: ``Don't forget silver tinsel and plenty
of lights on the tree. Three strings won't do.''
</P>
<P>
   To add a special glow and warmth to any holiday setting, Atlanta
interior designer Melissa Galt uses candles. ``I love to group
candles in odd numbers for greater impact,'' she says. ``For
example, place one candle on one end of the mantel, three on the
other end, perhaps five on a coffee table.''

 &HT;    Martin at last gelling with her `ER' co-stars
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a village to save an ``ER,'' something the NBC drama
finally gets through its pointy head tonight (10 ESTon NBC) to
produce its most gripping episode of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's classic ``ER.'' The show has spent most of this season
idling in a frustrating neutral _ focusing too much on perky new
intern Lucy Knight (perky Kellie Martin) and pushing plots along as
though someone forgot to take the safety off the County General
gurneys.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight ``ER'' gets back to its whiz-bang roots: dying kid,
lots of operating room heroics by lots of different docs, tension
between characters that becomes its own subplot and an ending that
leaves things profoundly unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   And while Martin again gets too much face time _ there will come
a point tonight when you'll wish you could reach right through the
TV screen and put a sock in her mouth _ her character finally
becomes part of the ensemble. She's not just there to bug Dr. John
Carter (Noah Wyle), though she does plenty of that. She's finally
there to make his character grow up into something else.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other plot lines this season that have strolled casually
through the back door, things hop tonight from the start. A little
girl is wheeled into the ER with a bleeding spleen, an injury she
got with her father in a car accident. She needs a blood
transfusion, and the only one who can be located quickly with her
rare blood type is her father. But he splits the hospital without
anyone knowing it: He'd kidnapped the girl from his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   While the battery of regulars work like mad to keep the girl
alive, Carter and Lucy head out into the cool Chicago night to find
the father. Their amateur sleuthing is often as much a competition
between them as it is a search for the girl's dad. Carter is as
controlling as Lucy is headstrong, and it's when they finally meet
in the middle that they both become something new and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for TV's best drama, which until tonight hasn't
seemed new or interesting all year.

There's a good reason: While much of TV's best returning shows
aren't clicking this season, ``Friends'' is.
</P>
<P>
   Or, rather, has been.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's Thanksgiving episode (8 o'clock ESTon NBC) is
serviceable _ and sometimes even outright funny _ but not nearly as
inventive as we might like.
</P>
<P>
   The gang relives a string of Thanksgiving memories, all full of
sight gags that for the most part would be better left to the
memory of Lucille Ball.
</P>
<P>
   Among the ones you won't want to miss: Chandler (Matthew Perry)
in the '80s with his hair coifed into a Flock of Seagulls do,
Monica's (Courteney Cox) return to her fat years and Rachel
(Jennifer Aniston) with her old nose.
</P>
<P>
   The Ross-Emily plot does finally get a rest. And we hope it's
over and done with.

MIT MEDIA LAB TO DEVELOP PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Media Lab, where academics develop everything from
personalized news broadcasts to wearable computers, is among the
most famous research centers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now MIT is set to open a kiddie version of the Media Lab, thanks
to a $27 million grant from the chairman of Japanese video game
maker Sega Enterprises Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   The cash grant, one of the largest ever received by the
university, comes from Isao Okawa, chairman of Sega and of its
parent, CSK Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than games, however, the center's researchers will
develop new technologies aimed at enhancing the social activities
of children and teenagers, such as storytelling, dance, music, and
visual arts.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the Media Lab's efforts among children have focused
primarily on the development of ``intelligent toys'', such as Lego
blocks containing computer chips that control mechanical operations
like turning wheels and triggering camera shutters. In 1990, the
MIT Media Lab received a $3 million grant from Sega's rival,
Nintendo, to study how video games can be a learning tool for
children. However, Nintendo reportedly is no longer a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Now the school wants to help children experience computers in
more social environments. The latest venture is based on Okawa's
views that digital technologies offer a chance to make fundamental
changes in education _ or, as the school puts it in a press
release, to ``rethink the nature of childhood itself.'' Okawa has
funded children's conferences on similar themes.
</P>
<P>
   A more formal research agenda will be drawn up by Mitchel
Resnick, a computer scientist at the Media Lab who also leads
efforts to create intelligent toys.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Resnick said &UR;  &LR;  the center's main &UR;  &LR; goal &UR;  &LR; is to
``find out how new technologies might enter the lives of children
in more meaningful ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The new institute, to be known as the Okawa Center, will be
affiliated with the Media Lab. It will be housed in a new building
to be built next to the Media Lab, near Kendall Square, that is
expected to open in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Another building will be torn down to make room for the new one,
said an MIT spokeswoman. The new facility will be designed by a
Tokyo architectural firm.

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In their debut appearance as heirs to the latest
American political dynasty, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his
younger brother, Gov.-elect Jeb Bush of Florida, Wednesday stepped
forward as models for what they described as a new ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans lament and point fingers over their party's
discouraging performance in the midterm elections, the Bush
brothers, sitting side-by-side at a joint news conference at the
opening of the Republican Governors Association's annual
convention, were still savoring their electoral triumphs. And they
were not bashful in proclaiming themselves as exemplars for their
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conservative philosophy doesn't have to be confined to
certain people,'' said the Texas governor, who won impressive
support from members of minority groups, particularly from Hispanic
voters. ``A conservative philosophy can extend its message across
demographic lines. A conservative philosophy is one that can
attract Hispanics if properly positioned. And the Republican Party
needs to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   As his older brother looked on approvingly, Jeb Bush said,
``It's the style of governance, George's case and, the style of
campaigning in my case, that might be a good lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The sons of former President George Bush emerged as such a
marquee attraction here that they scheduled their own briefing and
were mobbed by reporters and Republican operatives who seemed to
barely notice other party luminaries, including Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the Senate Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the frenzy was around the Texas governor who, fresh from
an overwhelming re-election victory, has emerged as the most-talked
about prospect for the party's presidential nomination in 2000.
There was also curiosity about Jeb Bush, who won the governorship
after a narrow loss four years ago. Texas is the nation's second
largest state and Florida is the fourth largest, and between the
two 35 million people will again have a Bush first family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the tall one and I'm the short one,'' Gov. Bush, who is
52, said of the lanky 45-year-old politician he described as ``my
little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   With a wide smile, the Texas governor insisted, ``I haven't made
up my mind yet,'' about whether to run for president. If he does,
he said, ``I'm going to have to start sending signals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were signals aplenty Wednesday. Bush said he thought
the next president should be a governor. And he made it clear that
one way or another, he and his brother would have influential roles
in the presidential competition. Not since 1967 _ when Nelson
Rockefeller was governor of New York and his brother, Winthrop, was
governor of Arkansas _ have two brothers occupied governor's
mansions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone to be running for president, it would be wise for them
to knock on Jeb Bush's door,'' George Bush said. ``Florida's an
important state.'' After a pause, he added, ``Just like it would be
wise for someone to knock on the Texas governor's door.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said the point of the event was to introduce
his brother to the press. ``I can't tell you how proud I was to see
him walk in the Republican governors' meeting,'' George Bush said,
adding, ``This guy's a good guy and I love him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Bush began taking questions from reporters before his
brother even had a chance to speak. In fact, Jeb Bush stayed quiet
for much of the nearly half-hour session and often looked on with
amusement as his brother, teased, hinted and parried with his
questioners about his aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   When the Florida governor-elect was called upon to speak, he was
often asked about the man sitting next to him. And when the session
ended, Jeb Bush walked out while his brother _ enjoying the
limelight _ lingered with reporters for another 15 minutes until
his aides finally pulled him out.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said his brother would be ``an awesome candidate,''
should he decide to run. Although he expressed concern about the
toll a candidacy could take on his brother's family, he said, ``If
he announces his candidacy, we won't have a family vote. Everybody
will be lined up to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor-elect said his brother has had such success that he
``was the first Texas governor, I think, in a long while, that got
re-elected.'' His brother, with a smile, corrected him, saying he
was the ``first ever'' governor of Texas to win two consecutive
four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   While the brothers _ the two eldest of the four Bush sons _
seemed to get on fine, there were signs of the old Bush family
competitiveness as they ribbed each other.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter if George was the savvy brother and Jeb was
the smart one, George replied, ``I'd describe me as the smart
one.'' And as they discussed how aggressive Republicans should be
in pressing their agenda, Jeb turned to his brother, jabbed him on
the shoulder, and asked, ``Can I disagree on a minor point?''
</P>
<P>
   His brother shot back, ``Make sure it's a minor point.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone think the event Wednesday marked the unveiling of a
future Bush-Bush ticket, Jeb Bush nixed the idea with a ready
one-liner. ``A nepotism rule precludes that from happening,'' he
said.

REPUBLICANS ENDORSE LIVINGSTON, EJECT OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two weeks of bloodletting over their
leadership, House Republicans sent a mixed message Wednesday about
the image they want to project in the upcoming 106th Congress _
they kept some leaders and threw out others, producing a team with
a strong conservative cast that includes the party's first black
leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a foregone conclusion, the party unanimously endorsed Rep.
Robert Livingston of Louisiana as its nominee for speaker. He will
replace Newt Gingrich, who was forced from office after the party
lost seats in the Nov. 3 midterm elections. Livingston is to be
elected speaker by the whole House on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans kept Dick Armey as majority leader and Tom DeLay as
majority whip. Both men, who are from Texas, are strong
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   But they ejected John Boehner of Ohio as Conference Chairman,
replacing him with J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the first black
Republican in a leadership role. And they repudiated John Linder of
Georgia as chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, replacing him with Thomas Davis III of Virginia. Both
Boehner and Linder bore some blame for the party's midterm stumble,
in which it lost five House seats.
</P>
<P>
   The party put two women in its low-level leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   The voting Wednesday by secret ballot took place behind the
closed doors of the ornate caucus room in the Canon Office
Building. Emerging midway through the day, Livingston stood with
some of his new team, including Armey, with whom he and DeLay have
had frosty relations.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a tone of low-key conciliation, Livingston pronounced
his party ``united,'' adding: ``We're all going to have to work
together,'' a daunting task that will entail ``reaching out to
Democrats,'' given the party's narrow six-vote majority and the
strength of its ideological wings on the left and on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the American people to know that they are going to get
good, clean, honest, efficient government from us,'' Livingston
added. ``We muffed our message a little bit in the last
elections,'' he conceded. ``We may have slipped, but we haven't
fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's priorities, he and others made clear, would be to
save Social Security and enact tax cuts before the elections in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sitting on the sidelines gloated that the Republicans
had failed to make a clean sweep of their leadership and put a
fresh face on their party. ``On the issues, there is no difference
between Newt Gingrich and the new Republican leaders,'' said Roy
Romer, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The most intense action of the day came during the protracted
four-way race for majority leader, the second in command. Armey won
a majority of votes only after a third ballot, and seemed somewhat
the bloodier for it. A relieved Armey described the ordeal as a
``merry chase.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But his closest challenger, Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a
fierce conservative and charter member of the revolutionary class
of 1994, brooded after the battle: ``Steve Largent has been too
slow and too small his whole life, and this is just one more
occasion,'' he said, a reference to criticism early in his football
career, which started out rocky but culminated with his induction
into the Hall of Fame. ``But I will tell you that I'm not
accustomed to losing, and I don't like to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Also spurned for majority leader was Rep. Jennifer Dunn of
Washington, the first woman to run for a leadership position, who
declared that even her attempt to run for office was a milestone.
</P>
<P>
   And a fledgling effort to draft Dennis Hastert of Illinois fell
flat. In the first round of balloting, Armey won 100 votes,
Largent, 58; Ms. Dunn, 45, and Hastert, 18. With no one winning a
clear majority of 112, the person coming in last, Hastert, was
dropped and a second ballot was held. On the second, Armey won 99,
Largent, 73, and Ms. Dunn 49. On the third, Armey won 127 and
Largent, 95.
</P>
<P>
   After retaining Armey, the party ousted two other incumbents
from its hierarchy. In what some described as a burst of
indignation, Republicans rejected Boehner as conference chairman.
The chairman is responsible for presenting the party's message to
the public and communicating leadership decisions and party policy.
</P>
<P>
   Watts blamed the leaders directly for the party's losses in the
midterm elections. ``I'm a public relations major,'' he told
reporters. ``And one of the things I found out in public relations
is, it's very hard to P.R. a bad product. And we had a very bad
product as Republicans coming down the stretch. And whether it was
true or not, the perception was the presidential problems and
Monica Lewinsky became our agenda.''

 OILERS' McNAIR PRESENTS DOUBLE THREAT TO JETS  
 (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bryan Cox, who has launched himself into the
upper echelon of New York Jets defenders with his recent play,
wiped that off-the-field smile off his face Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The linebacker was thinking of Steve McNair, the scrambling
Tennessee Oilers quarterback the Jets face on Sunday. Both American
Conference clubs are 6-4, and this could be a game that helps
determine a wild-card berth for either team.
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate problem is McNair, who earned the nickname Air
in college for his outstanding passing at Alcorn State and is now
also running at a gaudy 8.2 yards a carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get angry,'' said the excitable Cox, ``when I run all that
way and then just as I'm about to tackle him, the quarterback
slides. I'm teed off that I wasted all that energy.''
</P>
<P>
   For defensive tackle Jason Ferguson, the husky McNair's running
ability ``is like having Eddie George back there running the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Oilers also have George back there. George, in his
third year, has amassed 953 rushing yards. He is on the hottest
tear of any running back in the National Football League. Over the
last six games, he is averaging 121.8 yards a game. The tandem has
coalesced in the last three games, all victories, including two
over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The team has generated 94 points in
the span.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot 2-inch, 225-pound McNair is completing passes at a
61.5 percent rate and has tossed 11 touchdowns to only 7
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a lot of people realized this about McNair,''
said Oilers coach Jeff Fisher. ``But as a junior, he was a pocket
passer. As a senior, he used four wide receivers in an open game.
We wouldn't have drafted him if he wasn't a good pocket passer.''
</P>
<P>
   This is McNair's fourth season with the Oilers, and second as a
starter. It surprises people to learn that for at least one year he
played in a pro-type offense in college, where he tossed 530 career
passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lot different,'' he said Wednesday. ``In college I
was throwing a lot. Here, there's a balanced attack.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a major part of that balance with his running, which
includes the Oilers' longest score of the season, a 71-yard
scramble. He has run 37 times and has scored three touchdowns, as
many on the ground as George.
</P>
<P>
   But McNair knows he must also be practical when he picks up
running yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Did he ever forget to slide?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when you try to make more yards on third
down,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps the Nashville fans are getting accustomed, indeed
looking forward to, this improving team. In five home games this
year, Vanderbilt's 41,000-seat stadium has been sold out only
twice. The Oilers were 8-8 last season, when they played in Memphis
but practiced in Nashville. In 1996, the team played in Houston.
Next year, they will be moving into a new, as-yet unnamed stadium
that will hold 67,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will be our fourth stadium in four years,'' said Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are settling down,'' said the coach, who can finally
play home games at home. Last year, the Oilers flew to all 16
games, including the eight they played at ``home'' in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, George said ``it'll take a few years for people to get
used to having an NFL team in Tennessee.'' And he's not happy with
the artificial turf at Vanderbilt, which he described as ``hard on
your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, meanwhile, the team won't even be the Oilers any
longer. They will be the Titans, which just happens to be the Jets'
original name. But the Tennessee Titans got their name, said their
owner, Bud Adams, because Nashville is known as the Athens of the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Adams noted that one nickname the team didn't want involved
snakes or reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``That eliminated Copperheads and Vipers,'' said Adams. ``My
apologies to the herpetologists.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets' loss to the Colts is still galling. The Jets
produced so many positive offensive and special-teams plays, yet
lost by a point. ``In all the years I've played,'' said quarterback
VINNY TESTAVERDE, ``this is the toughest game I've had trouble
putting behind me. But in order to win the next game, we've got to
put it behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   _ At least one Oilers starter, safety BLAINE BISHOP, is out,
having suffered a knee injury. Another, wide receiver YANCEY
THIGPEN, is listed at 50-50 to return from a knee injury, which has
kept him out of the last three games.
</P>
<P>
   _ AARON GLENN is the American Conference's special-teams player
of the week for his league-record 104-yard touchdown return of a
Colts field-goal attempt. &QL;

BRAZIL'S ECONOMY SHRINKS IN THIRD QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Fanning widespread fears that Brazil is
plunging into a full-fledged recession, the government announced
Wednesday that the economy contracted by 1.5 percent in the third
quarter and said that key indicators pointed toward an even more
pronounced slump over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in the gross domestic product, sharper than
expected, was the worst in three years for Brazil. The Brazilian
economy, the eighth largest in the world, grew 1.4 percent in the
second quarter of 1998 over the preceding three months, and most
analysts had predicted further advances before the collapse of the
Russian economy in August set off a stampede of investors from many
emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   In its analysis of the figures made public Wednesday, the
Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics attributed much of
the drop to the ``effects of the Russian crisis on the Brazilian
economy.'' But the institute, an official monitoring agency, also
warned that harder times lie ahead, predicting that the full impact
of the last three months' turbulence ``will probably be observed
only in the indicators for the final quarter of 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in September, the Brazilian government _ hoping to stave
off a devaluation of its currency and end an outflow of
foreign-exchange reserves from more than $70 billion in August to
about $40 billion a few weeks later _ ordered an effective doubling
of its minimum lending rate, to nearly 50 percent. With consumers
now having to pay interest rates as high as 150 percent, demand for
household appliances and other goods is drying up.
</P>
<P>
   The $41.5 billion economic rescue package that Brazil signed
last Friday with the International Monetary Fund seems to have
reassured investors interested in the country's long-term
prospects. On Wednesday, the benchmark stock index gained 2.6
percent; in the three market days since the aid package was signed,
stocks have risen 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the terms of the IMF deal have added to the concerns of
ordinary Brazilians. The IMF is requiring the government to carry
out a combination of spending cuts and tax increases totaling $84
billion over the next three years, which will squeeze the
pocketbooks of Brazil's estimated 165 million people.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, the figures announced Wednesday caused little
surprise. Companies have been laying off employees and families
have been tightening their belts for three months in anticipation
of the austerity package announced last week. Stores are already
predicting a disastrous Christmas season, after a decline in retail
sales of just over 5 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are already living in a recession, and I don't
think the IMF loan is going to be a solution,'' said Jose Roberto
Ramiz, a university physical education professor here. ``It's only
a palliative that has to be paid some day, and unfortunately the
bill for irresponsibility and incorrect policies is going to be
paid with a lot of sacrifice by all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics indicate that while agriculture and
commerce are also suffering, industry, especially manufacturing and
construction, has been the sector hardest hit in the crisis.
Automobile manufacturers saw their sales and output drop by nearly
20 percent in the second quarter from the first and by almost 40
percent compared with the corresponding quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recent figures I have seen show industry declining about 6
percent on a September-to-September basis, and that is very
worrying,'' said Carlos Geraldo Langoni, who was president of the
central bank when Brazil negotiated its last IMF package in 1983.
``That has a lot of social implications, but the government is
going to have to resist pressures to abandon austerity and plunge
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Debate here centers not on whether there will be a recession,
but on its strength and duration. Initially, in its negotiations
with the IMF, the Brazilian government acknowledged that a
contraction was inevitable, predicting a decline of 1 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   After the IMF agreement was signed last Friday, though, the
government appears to have changed its tune and now argues that any
slump will be brief and relatively gentle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of external support with internal reforms will
permit Brazil to resume growth during 1999,'' Finance Minister
Pedro Malan said in the newspaper O Globo over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But Malan's opinion is a minority one, discounted by most
outside the government as excessively optimistic. Private analysts
have been predicting that the economy could contract as much as 3
percent in 1999 and shrink again in 2000 unless interest rates
decline substantially and the government proves to be really
serious about tackling the huge budget and current-account
deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that we have a difficult year ahead of us,
following a year that already has not been all that good,'' said
Carlos Kawall, chief economist for Citibank in Sao Paulo, Brazil's
financial capital. ``But it won't be a totally lost year if we can
get tax reform and reverse the negative tendencies we've seen in
public accounts.''

NOW STARRING FOR THE GOP: THE BUSH BROTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ In their debut appearance as heirs to the latest
American political dynasty, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and his
younger brother, Gov.-elect Jeb Bush of Florida, stepped forward
Wednesday as models for what they described as a new
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans lament and point fingers over their party's
discouraging performance in the midterm elections, the Bush
brothers, sitting side-by-side at a joint news conference at the
opening of the Republican Governors Association's annual
convention, were still savoring their electoral triumphs. And they
were not bashful in proclaiming themselves as exemplars for their
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conservative philosophy doesn't have to be confined to
certain people,'' said the Texas governor, who won impressive
support from members of minority groups, particularly from Hispanic
voters. ``A conservative philosophy can extend its message across
demographic lines. A conservative philosophy is one that can
attract Hispanics if properly positioned. And the Republican Party
needs to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   As his older brother looked on approvingly, Jeb Bush said,
``It's the style of governance, George's case and, the style of
campaigning in my case, that might be a good lesson.''
</P>
<P>
   The sons of former President Bush emerged as such a marquee
attraction here that they scheduled their own briefing and were
mobbed by reporters and Republican operatives who seemed to barely
notice other party luminaries, including Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
the Senate Republican leader.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the frenzy was around the Texas governor who, fresh from
an overwhelming re-election victory, has emerged as the
most-talked-about prospect for the party's presidential nomination
in 2000. There was also curiosity about Jeb Bush, who won the
governorship after a narrow loss four years ago. Texas is the
nation's second-largest state and Florida is the fourth largest,
and between the two 35 million people will again have a Bush first
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the tall one and I'm the short one,'' George W. Bush, who
is 52, said of the lanky 45-year-old politician he described as
``my little brother.''
</P>
<P>
   With a wide smile, the Texas governor insisted, ``I haven't made
up my mind yet,'' about whether to run for president. If he does,
he said, ``I'm going to have to start sending signals.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there were signals aplenty Wednesday. Bush said he thought
the next president should be a governor. And he made it clear that
one way or another, he and his brother would have influential roles
in the presidential competition. Not since 1967 _ when Nelson
Rockefeller was governor of New York and his brother Winthrop was
governor of Arkansas _ have two brothers occupied governor's
mansions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone to be running for president, it would be wise for them
to knock on Jeb Bush's door,'' George W. Bush said. ``Florida's an
important state.'' After a pause, he added, ``Just like it would be
wise for someone to knock on the Texas governor's door.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor said the point of the event was to introduce
his brother to the press. ``I can't tell you how proud I was to see
him walk in the Republican governors' meeting,'' George Bush said,
adding, ``This guy's a good guy and I love him a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But George Bush began taking questions from reporters before his
brother even had a chance to speak. In fact, Jeb Bush stayed quiet
for much of the nearly half-hour session and often looked on with
amusement as his brother teased, hinted and parried with his
questioners about his aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   When the Florida governor-elect was called upon to speak, he was
often asked about the man sitting next to him. And when the session
ended, Jeb Bush walked out while his brother _ enjoying the
limelight _ lingered with reporters for another 15 minutes until
his aides finally pulled him out.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush said his brother would be ``an awesome candidate''
should he decide to run. Although he expressed concern about the
toll a candidacy could take on his brother's family, he said, ``If
he announces his candidacy, we won't have a family vote. Everybody
will be lined up to help him.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Florida governor said his brother has had such success
that he ``was the first Texas governor, I think, in a long while,
that got re-elected.'' His brother, with a smile, corrected him,
saying he was the ``first ever'' governor of Texas to win two
consecutive four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   While the brothers _ the two eldest of the four Bush sons _
seemed to get on fine, there were signs of the old Bush family
competitiveness as they ribbed each other. Asked by a reporter if
George was the savvy brother and Jeb was the smart one, George
replied, ``I'd describe me as the smart one.''
</P>
<P>
   And as they discussed how aggressive Republicans should be in
pressing their agenda, Jeb turned to his brother, jabbed him on the
shoulder, and asked, ``Can I disagree on a minor point?'' His
brother shot back, ``Make sure it's a minor point.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest anyone think the event Wednesday marked the unveiling of a
future Bush-Bush ticket, Jeb Bush nixed the idea with a ready
one-liner. ``A nepotism rule precludes that from happening,'' he
said.

<P>
   BEIJING _ When Sun Lilin emerged from Beijing Children's
Hospital, her pockets bulged with bottles of syrup, her hands
juggled a tower of boxes containing powders and pills. She had
brought her 5-year-old daughter to the clinic with a cough. She
left with two Chinese cold syrups, a potent broad-spectrum
antibiotic, an inhaler and a little round device that jets powdered
medicine into the lungs.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's visit cost less than $1. But the medicines cost $60
_ half a month's salary _ almost all of it for the three Western
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The medicine has gotten so expensive I really can't afford
it,'' said Ms. Sun, a red-cheeked cleaning woman in a middle
school, echoing a complaint of virtually everyone in China these
days. ``But, of course, she's my only child. And she's sick. I buy
her the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Imported Western pharmaceuticals have taken China by storm,
straining pocketbooks as they hold out promises of cure. Indeed,
the denouement of nearly every doctor's visit in China today is the
prescription of a small pharmacy worth of this year's hottest
medicines, be they non-sedating antihistamines or once-a-day high
blood pressure pills
</P>
<P>
   Such sales have been buoyed by a new and unlikely symbiosis:
Western drug companies have been aggressively courting China's
doctors and hospitals not only with new pills but also with gifts,
money and even kickbacks, practices that are banned in the United
States. Their goal: to gain access to China's 1.2 billion
potentially ailing citizens, most with a seemingly unshakable
belief in the curative power of name-brand Western pills.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Chinese doctors prescribed hundreds of millions of
dollars worth of mostly expensive Western medicine last year. But
they have another motive as well: Cash-strapped Chinese hospitals
are allowed to sell medicines their doctors prescribe at a profit,
and the profit is far greater when doctors prescribe expensive
Western drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong interest group forming of drug companies,
hospital managers and doctors,'' said Qiu Renzong, a professor of
bioethics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. ``In China we
produce some equally effective medicines, but doctors don't
prescribe them anymore. The result is a heavy financial burden on
the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, drug sales have become a cash cow for Chinese hospitals
in the past two years, accounting for around 60 to 80 percent of
their revenues, officials say. Although there are hundreds of
Chinese drug companies producing traditional and Western-style
medicine, medicine made by foreign or joint-venture companies now
accounts for well over 50 percent of prescriptions in Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   Today, foreign drug and medical equipment companies pay for
Chinese doctors to study overseas, buy hospitals new furniture and
provide airline tickets and hotel vouchers for conferences.
</P>
<P>
   In an even more controversial practice, the companies commonly
pay hospital administrators and individual doctors ``commissions''
for stocking and prescribing their drugs, though such payments are
against corporate policies and are illegal in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a pill sells for five yuan, often more than half of that is
spent to give little red packets containing cash to the hospital
director of purchasing, to the pharmacy manager and a bit to the
doctors themselves,'' said Li Ning, the vice president of Beijing's
Chaoyang Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course hospitals have regulations banning kickbacks,'' said
Li, a young general surgeon who studied hospital administration at
the University of Minnesota. ``But this is hard to catch, and we
know the rules are not very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Western firms and China's doctors has
certainly helped introduce valuable drugs and equipment into China,
which generally permits the import of any drug approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration. But in other cases the high-priced
products offer only slight advantages. ``Western medicines and
medical equipment have greatly contributed to medical costs that
are rising 35 percent a year,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the companies operating in China refused to discuss
their practices, but Thomas Reinert, a spokesman for Bayer
Pharmaceuticals in Germany, said that his company priced medicines
lower in China than in most of the rest of the world and that Bayer
specifically forbids payments to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company follows an industry-wide international code
of conduct which allows, for example, sponsoring medical
symposiums, but forbids payments to encourage ordering products.
Still, he said, ``there is a gray zone in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, many in and out of the industry acknowledge that
young Chinese sales representatives, far from corporate
headquarters, often flout conduct codes. Indeed, ``hong bao,'' the
little red envelopes stuffed with cash, are a
semi-institutionalized part of Chinese life, at times offered to
surgeons for operations as well as to journalists in the hopes of a
favorable story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practices that would not be OK in the West are quite common in
China,'' said one industry representative, ``And it's not just
international drug companies _ the Chinese companies are doing it
too.''
</P>
<P>
   But Western companies have more money, and their incentives are
tempting to doctors who often make $120 a month and who, without
their help, would have little opportunity to read foreign medical
journals or go to conferences overseas. And, ever since China's
hospitals lost the last of their formerly huge government subsidies
last year, Western drug sales have become essential for balancing
hospital budgets.
</P>
<P>
   While there are tight price controls for Chinese-made medicines,
hospitals are allowed to set their own price for Western drugs.
Some state workers still have health plans that cover the cost of
drugs, but many more now pay for medicines themselves or get only a
small fraction of the costs paid by their employer.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Cities like Shanghai and Beijing recently started requiring
patients covered by state insurance plans to pay themselves for any
Western drugs. And this month the State Planning Commission
announced it was planning to issue new regulations to reform the
drug pricing system _ for the third time in three years _ but added
``the consequences of the hospitals' sales business can not be
dealt with overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America opposes
China's proposed price controls, said Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman
for the trade organization. ``Virtually all companies are putting
into that country much more than they are taking out,'' he said.
``Most are not making money; they are investing in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, at the third Great Wall International Symposium on
Interventional Cardiology, a small army of Chinese sales
representatives of Western drug and medical equipment manufacturers
welcomed Chinese cardiologists with slides, wristwatches and tote
bags _ most promoting drugs that cost more than the average Chinese
earns in a day, and tests that cost a month's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that by 2001 our sales revenue in China will reach
100 million marks,'' said Li Yumin, who was working at a booth
promoting Bayer's new heart drugs. ``There are 120 million people
with high blood pressure in this country. Their incomes are rising,
and they have better knowledge of disease. So we take every
opportunity to have contact with Chinese doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that the pill he was promoting, a once-a-day
high blood pressure pill and heart medicine called Adalat GITS, was
too expensive for most Chinese to use every day for life, which is
the recommended way to treat these chronic ailments. He said the
average Chinese patient takes the medication for only 28 days. It
costs about $1 a pill, compared to the Chinese-made version of the
same drug, which costs pennies but must be taken three times a day,
and so produces less consistent blood pressure levels.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 Chinese take Adalat GITS long term, most all them
from the shrinking group of Chinese who still have government
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   To help advertise this and its new cholesterol-lowering drug,
Bayer helped pay for the heart conference, printing programs, name
cards and financing a satellite hook-up where doctors could watch
advanced heart procedures beamed in from operating rooms. Bayer
also hosted a special seminar, featuring a prominent Chinese
cardiologist describing some of the latest foreign drug trials, the
last of which supported the widespread use of drugs like Adalat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I argue that those who can afford it should take more
effective and expensive drugs,'' said the heart specialist, Dr. Hu
Dayi.
</P>
<P>
   It was a forum that could have been sponsored by any of the
dozens of Western drug companies operating here _ including giants
like Glaxo Wellcome, Eli Lilly and Novartis. And most of the 200 or
so heart specialists in the audience said they appreciated the
update, despite its heavy editorial overlay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to learn about new techniques and medicines,
although they will be difficult to use where I come from because of
financial reasons,'' said Dr. Lian Mingfeng, a heart specialist
from a small hospital in Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
   Drug representatives who work in China like to emphasize their
role as educators. But Western doctors who have attended recent
Chinese medical conferences say they are shocked to see the
representatives sometimes giving the central lectures at what are
billed as impartial scientific meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like the Wild West with a lot of flagrantly unethical
behavior and few rules,'' said one, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   And Chinese bioethicists have themselves bemoaned the merging of
academic meeting and sales bazaar. Qiu said that his wife, a
stomach specialist, had attended English-language medical
conferences in Hong Kong, where many of the Chinese doctors could
not understand a word of the proceedings. Drug companies ``pay for
their travel and hotel,'' he said. ``The doctors go sight-seeing
and shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Li, the hospital vice president, said that he disliked the close
relationship between hospitals and drug companies, even though it
now keeps his hospital afloat. ``Now the state gives us policies,
but no money,'' he said. ``So for survival the hospital has to have
more patients and prescribe more drugs and scans.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban Chinese are avid hospital-goers and have a strong bias
towards treating ailments with a tonic or pill. Indeed, every
sneeze in China seems to be greeted with the concerned inquiry,
``Are you taking medicine?'' After a spate of newspaper exposes
about counterfeit pills and the poor quality control at some
Chinese pharmaceutical plants, many people have grown at least a
bit suspicious of domestic products. And _ in handbags or in
medicines _ the Chinese are extremely fond of name brands, leaving
Western pills with gangbuster sales and Chinese hard pressed to
afford them.
</P>
<P>
   At a clinic in Yuyao, a city in Zhejiang province, Dr. Fu Zhiyin
prepared to give 35-year-old Huang Yifeng antibiotic pills for her
serious pelvic infection. How many should she take?
</P>
<P>
   ``She should take 36,'' said Fu, matter-of-factly. ``But it
depends how many she can afford.''

GONZALEZ GARNERS SECOND MVP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe now Juan Gonzalez will get some respect. For the second
time in three years, he has been voted the American League's Most
Valuable Player, and it wasn't even close.
</P>
<P>
   The man who had the most RBIs in the AL in 49 years and led the
Texas Rangers to their second AL West title in three seasons easily
won over a star-studded field in the voting announced Wednesday by
the Baseball Writers Association of America. The Texas outfielder
received 21 first-place votes and seven seconds for 357 points.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra was a distant second with
232 points, including five firsts, seven seconds, and seven thirds.
The 1997 AL Rookie of the Yeear will receive a $75,000 bonus
because of his high finish.
</P>
<P>
   In third place was Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter with 180
points, including two firsts, six seconds, and three thirds.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Red Sox players received votes. Free agent first
baseman Mo Vaughn finished in a fourth-place tie with Seattle's Ken
Griffey with 135 points. Closer Tom Gordon got 27 points, Cy Young
Award runner-up Pedro Martinez 1.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez batted .318 this year with 45 home runs and a league
high of 50 doubles. His 157 RBIs were the most in the AL since Ted
Williams and Vern Stephens each had 159 for Boston in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of support for Gonzalez was somewhat surprising. In
1996, he barely nosed out Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez,
290-287. Rodriguez would have won had he received the vote of a
Seattle writer.
</P>
<P>
   This time Gonzalez had no such competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I felt more comfortable this year because of my
numbers and my team,'' he said via teleconference from his home in
Puerto Rico. ``We won the division title, and that was a plus for
me. To finish first in a field like this is a great honor for me. I
give a lot of credit to Nomar and the rest of the guys behind me in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for me has always been to stay healthy,'' added
Gonzalez, who played in a career-high 154 games. ``When I'm
healthy, I'm able to put up the best numbers that I can. I have a
trainer who goes with me everywhere, and that really helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I had going for me was the great chemistry
inside the lines and inside the clubhouse. We're like a family.
Everybody works so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was on fire early in the season. He had 101 RBIs by the
All-Star break, and at the end of July, he had 116 RBIs in 105
games, posing a threat to the major league record of 190
established by the Cubs' Hack Wilson in 1930. But in the final two
months, opponents pitched around him, and even though his average
went up, his power totals leveled off. Gonzalez was also bothered
by hamstring pulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed that I didn't get the record,'' he
said. ``I knew when I drove in 101 RBIs in the first half, I had a
great chance for the record. In the second half, I had Rusty Greer
hitting in front of me, and they'd rather pitch to him. It made a
difference. He wound up having more opportunities than me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez already has the respect of home run king Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great, great hitter,'' McGwire said in a recent
interview. ``But the sad thing is, if somebody said, `Who was the
MVP in the American League in 1996?' I'd bet nobody really knows.
It's Juan Gonzalez. Year in and year out, he puts up the numbers.
It just seems he doesn't get the notoriety that he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he still thinks he can break the RBI record, the
29-year-old Gonzalez said, ``It's not impossible. I just need to
stay healthy and keep working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said the thought of being the first Latin American
player to win the MVP Award twice is pleasing. But he has another
goal _ for Dominican slugger Sammy Sosa of the Cubs, author of 66
homers and a major league-leading 158 RBIs, to win the National
League MVP Award today. Sosa is considered the front-runner, ahead
of the Cardinals' McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd vote for Sammy,'' Gonzalez said. ``It would be a special
moment if two players from Latin America could win the MVP Award
the same year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sammy had great numbers and a great year. No one should forget
that both he and Mark McGwire broke Roger Maris's (home run)
record. Mark did hit 70. My feelings go towards Sammy because of
Chicago winning the wild-card race.''

FCC PROPOSING NEW RULES TO ENCOURAGE MINORITY HIRING  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the wake of a court decision invalidating its
affirmative action requirements for broadcasters, the Federal
Communications Commission will propose new rules to encourage
television and radio stations to hire minorities and women. But it
will no longer require an evaluation of how stations are achieving
that goal.
</P>
<P>
   According to drafts of the proposed rules, the commission will
no longer make a comparison between the percentage of minorities
and women in a station's work force and the proportion of those
groups in its broadcast area when the agency is ruling on the
station's renewal of its broadcast license.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are de-linking it from the renewal process,'' said FCC
Chairman William Kennard.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old rules, which were put in place in 1987 during the
Reagan administration, broadcasters with at least 10 employees were
encouraged to have a work force where the proportion of minorities
and women was half their percentage in the local broadcast area.
For example, if a station had 100 employees and minorities
constituted 20 percent of the population in the local area, the
station was encouraged to have 10 minority workers.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials had argued that such numerical goals were
merely one part of a set of guidelines to evaluate a station's good
faith efforts to recruit minorities and women. They insisted,
however, that a person's sex or race could not be factors in actual
hiring decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Although these figures were looked at when a television or radio
station sought to renew its license, commission officials contended
that no renewal application had ever been denied because of a
failure to comply with the guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in April that the
mere possibility that a station could lose its license for failure
to comply with the commission's guidelines would induce station
managers to secretly give minorities and women a preference when it
came to hiring.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say it was the first time that a federal court had
struck down affirmative action efforts that involved the
recruitment of minorities and women, and not their actual hiring.
The Clinton administration has yet to decide whether to appeal
Silberman's ruling to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The new proposals, which will be voted on by the FCC's five
commissioners on Thursday, will still require stations to undertake
certain efforts to enhance the number of women and minorities that
they employ in order to be granted license renewals.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts include looking at a station's actual recruitment
efforts and examining whether a station has been sued for
employment discrimination and whether it maintains training and
internship programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can still require that broadcasters demonstrate that they
are reaching out in their communities to pull together a diverse
applicant pool,'' Kennard said. ``But they will no longer compare
the profile of their station with that of the communities they
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, women made up 41 percent of all broadcast employees,
according to the commission, up from 23.3 percent in 1971.
Minorities totaled 20.2 percent of all employees, a jump from 9.1
percent in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights advocates say the commission's new rules are part
of a broad retreat on affirmative action in the face of hostile
court rulings on the issue.

ESTHER ROLLE, 78, PIONEERING AFRICAN-AMERICAN ACTRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Esther Rolle, a pioneering African-American
actress who gained national recognition in the 1970s for her role
as Florida Evans on two television shows, first ``Maude'' and then
``Good Times,'' died at a hospital here on Tuesday. She was 78 and
lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Calhoun, her longtime publicist, said the cause of death
had not been determined, but he added that Ms. Rolle had been
suffering from diabetes and had been under dialysis. He said she
had celebrated her 78th birthday a little more than a week ago, and
that one of the last things she had done was to write a check to
support a local black theater, something she had done most of her
career.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rolle met with many of her old friends and cast members of
the two television shows last week in a gathering here for a People
magazine article.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Lear, one of the executive producers of both of her
shows, said the once-stocky actress appeared thin but vibrant, and
that she had a role in a forthcoming movie, ``Down in the Delta,''
directed by poet Maya Angelou and scheduled for release this month.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rolle became famous for playing the role of a strong-willed
maid on television, and in that role she also performed memorably
in the play ``A Raisin in the Sun,'' in the television movie
``Summer of My German Soldier,'' for which she won an Emmy Award in
1979, and in the movie ``Driving Miss Daisy.'' She also appeared in
the film ``Rosewood.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke firmly and often about about her desire to fight black
stereotypes on television and even left the cast of ``Good Times''
for a while, saying at the time that she resented the image
presented by the buffoonish character of her son in the show. In
the show she played the matriarch of a struggling black family in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rolle was well known for her strong personality, both on and
off screen, and her ear for the nuances of race relations. Lear,
who was the executive producer of ``All in the Family,'' from which
``Maude'' and ``Good Times'' were spun off, said one of his most
vivid memories of Ms. Rolle was a musical number she performed with
Beatrice Arthur, the actress who played Maude.
</P>
<P>
   Lear said that every year there was a musical number on the
show, and one season Ms. Rolle and Ms. Arthur performed ``Me and My
Shadow.'' Ms. Arthur kept trying to stand in back and play the
shadow in the scene, but Ms. Rolle kept slipping behind her, a
striking metaphor for the subtleties of race relations that Lear
described as ``an indelible memory of an indelible woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Fla., a retirement
community that was once a bucolic farming town with the character
of the Deep South. She was the 10th of 18 children, and her father
was a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   She had a theatrical bent and after high school followed her
sister, Rosanna Carter, also an actress, to New York. She was one
of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York and
in the late 1950s performed with Shologa Oloba, an African-American
dance troupe. In 1958 she and her sister appeared with the company
in a revival of Asadata Dafora's ``Zunguru.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 she became the first woman to receive the NAACP
Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the
image of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rolle's marriage ended in divorce, and she had no children,
her publicist said. She is survived by two sisters and a brother.

SOUTH AFRICA'S PLANNED SMOKING CURBS HAVE CRITICS FUMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ A bill to ban smoking in public,
outlaw all tobacco advertising and regulate nicotine levels in
cigarettes is about to become law here.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, the Tobacco Products Control Amendment Act, passed
Parliament last week, and President Nelson Mandela is expected to
sign it.
</P>
<P>
   South Africans are heavy smokers; between 28 and 34 percent
light up. Many sports events, from the Dunhill Derby to the Gunston
500 surf contest to Camel cross-Africa races, are sponsored by
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, put forward by Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma, is
opposed by a coalition of tobacco interests, media and advertising
executives and free-speech advocates. The African National Congress
pushed it through, while most opposition parties voted against it _
not because they endorse smoking, but because they say it
unconstitutionally limits free speech, intrudes on privacy, burdens
police and grants the health minister dangerously large powers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the minister can ban all forms of tobacco
advertising, sponsorship deals, tie-in products and even anything
that might be mistaken for a tobacco ad.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking is banned in workplaces and enclosed public spaces.
Restaurants and bars must have separate, independently ventilated
smoking rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking illegally can bring a $36 fine; selling to minors a
$1,800 one; advertising a $36,000 one and possibly jail.
</P>
<P>
   The minister can order cigarette manufacturers to lower tar and
nicotine levels, theoretically down to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Zuma, a pediatrician, says the law is needed to prevent smoking
by children and to bring down high lung cancer rates. International
tobacco companies, frustrated at home, ``are on the offensive in
developing countries,'' she said at an anti-smoking conference this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is opposed by tobacco companies, one of which,
Rembrandt Holdings, is one of the country's five biggest
conglomerates. The industry says that tobacco creates 100,000 jobs
and nearly $1 billion in tax revenue. Magazines and newspapers say
they will lose $50 million in advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Other opponents say the bill creates absurdities. They say
smokers who employ maids or babysitters might not be able to smoke
in their own homes, since they would be workplaces. The police,
already failing to stem high rates of rape and murder, would chase
smokers. The popular Camel and Marlboro lines of clothing would be
banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just saying `Gold' or using the color might be banned because
it implies Benson &AMP; Hedges,'' said Laura Polecutt, executive
director of the Freedom of Expression Institute. The institute, a
long-established defender of free speech, opposes the section of
the bill banning advertising, arguing that commercial speech is
constitutionally protected.
</P>
<P>
   The Freedom of Commercial Speech Trust, recently created with
the backing of the tobacco and media industries, plans to take the
bill to the Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Rabinowitz, a member of Parliament specializing in
health issues for the Inkatha Freedom Party, objected to the powers
the law gives the minister.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions to the ban ``are totally at her whim,'' Dr.
Rabinowitz said. ``If she likes the person, or if it's someone in
the ANC unions with an interest in Camel jackets saying jobs will
be lost, she can let them go on. If it's some dirty buzzard who
took her to court, she can shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no checks anywhere along the line. To be truthful,
our health-related bills should all say: `The minister may do as
she likes.'''

 &HT;    Armey re-elected House majority leader
 &HT;    By Christi Harlan
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican U.S. House of Representatives members on
Wednesday re-elected Rep. Dick Armey of Texas as House majority
leader and tapped Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the sole black
Republican in Congress, to help GOP lawmakers deliver a unified
message during the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Armey fended off three challengers to retain the No. 2 position
in the House, but his duties and visibility may be vastly curtailed
under new House Speaker Bob Livingston, R-La., who was acclaimed
Wednesday as the successor to Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich announced his resignation Nov. 6 after being blamed for
losses in the Nov. 3 election that shaved the already-thin majority
in the House and left Republicans with 223 seats to Democrats' 211.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappiness with the election results claimed two more victims
Wednesday as Republicans picked their leaders. A 130-77 vote dumped
the GOP campaign committee chairman, Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., in
favor of Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.
</P>
<P>
   And Republican Conference Chairman John Boehner, R-Ohio, lost
that No. 4 seat to Watts in a 121-102 vote.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Texans survived the leadership shake-up. Majority Whip
Tom DeLay of Sugar Land was unopposed for re-election to the No. 3
job in the House, and Armey of Irving was able to stave off his
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   With the mix of new and old leaders, ``we have a good
combination of continuity and fresh faces,'' said Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas. ``This vote has re-energized Republicans and reflects a
more accurate image of us as a party.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes may not be over, however. Gingrich had ceded much of
the day-to-day running of the House to Armey, who also became
Republican lawmakers' lead spokesman at weekly news conferences and
Sunday talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston is expected to take back some of the power Armey had
enjoyed, and the Texan said Wednesday he could live with that.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich ``had an awful lot of authority that he more or less
handed over to me,'' Armey said in an interview after his
re-election. ``If Bob wants to pull some of this authority back as
speaker, I'm perfectly content to have him do that because, quite
frankly, I think I took on too much in this work. I had the
responsibility while (Gingrich) retained the authority, and it
turned out to be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the authority Armey wielded over legislation came from
Gingrich's usurpation of the powers that traditionally belonged to
House committee leaders. Livingston was one of those leaders, being
Gingrich's hand-picked head of the House Appropriations committee.
</P>
<P>
   As speaker, Livingston is expected to return control to
committee leaders, which will be good news for another Texas
Republican, Rep. Bill Archer of Houston, who will return for a
final two-year term as chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   For rank-and-file Republicans, they're hoping the new team will
cure what they saw as a lack of both substance and style in the
current team. Unhappy GOP members complained that Gingrich, Armey
and other leaders failed to deliver a GOP election platform on tax
cuts, Social Security and education. And when the leaders did speak
out, insurgents complained, they looked and sounded terrible.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, one of Armey's challengers, former football star
and conservative Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., campaigned in part on
his telegenic good looks. Another challenger, moderate Rep.
Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., gave Republicans the opportunity to promote
a woman in House leadership. Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., went on
the ballot Wednesday as a last-minute candidate who could appeal to
both conservatives and moderates.
</P>
<P>
   The election of majority leader went to three ballots, with the
lowest vote-getter dropping off at each round. Hastert fell first,
then Dunn, and finally Largent as Armey won, 127-95.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Armey's re-election, House members were complaining
about his public appearances: ``He's lousy on TV,'' said Rep. E.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla. ``It's something we have to live with.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey blamed his bad TV presence on a Washington press corps
that is obsessed with personalities, not policy: ``You put Dick
Armey on a Sunday morning show and ask him to talk about IMF reform
or tax cuts (or) bankruptcy reform,'' he said, ``and you get a
pretty clear and concise message.''
</P>
<P>
   As for House business, Armey said he can work past the
sometimes-strained relations between Livingston and him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll do fine,'' Armey said. ``Bob and I have a long and
colorful history. Fundamentally, Bob Livingston and Dick Armey are
legislators, and we will work well on that.''

 &HT;    Fiery deaths put commune in spotlight
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMELLE, Ala. _ They call this place the Holyland, but Tuesday
evening one building on this religious commune became a hellish
deathtrap for four small children.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left of a dormitory that housed 78 people is a
smoldering tangle of burned mattresses and charred iron bed frames,
and four red flags marking where the two boys and two girls, aged 3
to 5, died.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year-old girl knocked over a lamp, causing the fire at the
commune in this remote farming community near the Mississippi
border, said Sumter County Sheriff Johnny Hatter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids didn't know what to do, and by the time the adults
saw what was going on, the place was in flames,'' Hatter said. Two
mangled, ash-covered buckets, evidence of an effort to stop the
fire, lay in the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Holyland, an Apostolic, self-reliant community, was started 20
years ago by Luke Edwards, a 72-year-old preacher who has been
accused of running a cult and building a business empire by making
poor blacks work for him for little pay. Edwards, who lives in a
modest trailer at the front of the 54-acre property where some 150
people live and work, was not available for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Most Holyland residents shied away from the media, but Denise
Chapman, 41, who has lived here 18 years, defended the community as
a haven for poor and troubled African- Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started, 99 percent of our church in Meridian (Miss.)
was on welfare,'' she said. ``We pooled our resources and now no
one is on welfare. I came from Michigan an ex-drug addict. They
changed my life. I'd probably be dead now.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the members are not from the area, and many are troubled
youths from cities as far away as Chicago, sent here by their
parents to straighten them out.
</P>
<P>
   The community raises its own food and livestock, schools the
children and provides medical care. It is part of a
multimillion-dollar operation called Reach that owns four
restaurants, three motels, three stores, a slaughterhouse, an
airplane, and three limousines. A 1997 Associated Press story said
the empire was started by church members who used food stamps to
buy food wholesale and used it to open the first store.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has been hit with repeated lawsuits, child labor fines
and claims by his daughter and some former members of sexual
improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   Hatter said he is not familiar with any troubles with the place,
except for the occasional teen trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had reports of kids knocking on neighbors' doors trying
to get away,'' he said. ``And kids have stolen cars, trying to get
back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Clement Scott, a pilot from Tuskegee who teaches some of the
kids how to fly, laughed at suggestions that Holyland was a cult.
He was at the site Wednesday to see if he could help his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what they are doing here,'' he said. ``It's not a cult,
it's just people working for the whole group. They're doing good
things here. I've never had anybody try to recruit me. And look,
they don't even have a gate. People can come and go.

 &HT;    Gingrich leaves capital as successor nominated
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich left town quietly Wednesday after
urging Republicans to rally around his presumptive successor as
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and his wife, Marianne, boarded a plane for an
undisclosed location in Florida late Wednesday morning shortly
before his Republican colleagues in the House made Rep. Robert
Livingston of Louisiana their nominee for speaker. The full House
will elect the speaker when it convenes on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief address to GOP House members, Gingrich said he told
them, ``It's been a great emotional experience for Marianne and me
to have had these years working together with our team.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said Livingston will ``make a great successor.'' Other
Republicans said the speaker made a plea for party unity, saying it
is the only way Livingston will succeed with the party's narrow,
six-seat majority.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston launched a challenge to Gingrich Nov. 6, three days
after Republicans suffered a loss of five seats in the House in the
midterm election. Before the day was out, Gingrich announced he
would not seek another term as speaker and also would leave the
House.
</P>
<P>
   He has not revealed the terms of his departure, but his aides
have said Gingrich does not intend to take his seat in the 106th
Congress. Once he has vacated his seat, the governor will issue a
call for a special election.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich did not elaborate Thursday on what he plans to do after
he leaves Congress, except to tell CNN it will be a ``public life
on the outside,'' where he said he will be making speeches and
``talking about where we need to go as a country.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker is not expected to return to Washington until Dec. 8
for the lighting of the Christmas tree on the Capitol grounds.

 &HT;    GOP takes larger step southward
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One reason for the restlessness among congressional
Republicans, it was widely said last week, is a desire for a
leadership less dominated by Southern white males. So much for
that.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled a bit, but Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas held
on to his post in Wednesday's House caucus elections, joining
Speaker-elect Bob Livingston of Louisiana and whip Tom DeLay of
Texas to leave the party's top three positions in SWM hands. The
election of Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma and Rep. Tillie Fowler of
Florida to party posts did add some racial and gender diversity to
the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   But if anything, the former University of Oklahoma wishbone
quarterback's defeat of Ohio Rep. John Boehner in the race for
conference chair bumps up the Southern male part of the quotient a
few more degrees, while the success of Fowler, daughter of the late
Georgia state Sen. Culver Kidd, in the race for vice chair gives
the leadership an even more Southern stamp.
</P>
<P>
   This should not be too surprising. The SWM critique somewhat
misses the point of how so many Republicans got to Congress in the
first place. Also, it gets a bit mushy when Newt Gingrich, an SWM
born in Harrisburg, Pa., is replaced as speaker by Livingston, an
SWM born in Colorado Springs, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Armey, an SWM born in Cando, N.D., struggled a bit but managed
to avoid being smitten by the sword that Gingrich fell on. Not so
for Georgia's John Linder, born in Deer River, Minn., who took the
fall for the party's disappointing showing this month and lost his
job to Virginia's Tom Davis, an SWM born in Minot, N.D.
</P>
<P>
   As this birthplace tour is intended to illustrate, the old
regional generalities are being replaced by more modern means of
political location.
</P>
<P>
   Airports, for instance: Livingston and Armey both represent
districts that have grown around large metro airports, as did
Gingrich before he moved to the newly created 6th District. This is
not coincidence, but a natural process of leaders rising out of
places where their party's voters have accumulated.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston's district outside New Orleans and Armey's outside
Dallas combine a solid base of Republican suburbia with a stretch
of conservative rural counties, which could also describe those in
Georgia represented by Linder, Bob Barr and Mac Collins. Or, for
that matter, the district outside Seattle represented by Rep.
Jennifer Dunn, who fell short in her bid for majority leader
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There's no more representative example of the new post-regional
geography than Florida, and that state's GOP chairman, Tom Slade,
has announced he's challenging Jim Nicholson of Colorado for the
party's national chairmanship _ the next test of how restive the
party is after the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia GOP Chairman Rusty Paul said Wednesday he thinks the
Republican National Committee is about evenly split among those who
want to dump or keep Nicholson and those who haven't made up their
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you this: The Republican base is furious,'' Paul
said after a blistering state executive committee meeting over the
weekend. That base _ which includes quite a few SWMs _ isn't going
to wait long for the new leadership team to turn things around.

 &HT;    Linder's loss of rank linked to poor GOP performance at polls
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Linder became the second Georgian to fall
from the GOP leadership ranks when House Republicans on Wednesday
gave Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia Linder's job.
</P>
<P>
   Davis won a two-year term as chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, which Linder ran for the past two years.
Davis easily defeated Linder, 130-77.
</P>
<P>
   Critics and supporters of Linder alike agreed that the Georgian
carried ``too much baggage,'' in Rep. Nathan Deal's (R-Ga.) words,
following the GOP's unexpected loss of five seats in the
congressional midterm election. The NRCC recruits candidates and
raises money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to accept some of the blame, whether it was justified
or not,'' said Deal, who voted for Linder.
</P>
<P>
   Davis got help from Rep. Tom DeLay (R-Texas), the House Majority
Whip, who put his vote-counting operation to work for the
Virginian.
</P>
<P>
   Linder campaigned hard for another two years as chairman,
boasting of his success in raising money. One critic, Rep. Joel
Hefley of Colorado, said Linder had ruffled some feathers in his
quest for campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linder raised a lot of money, but he didn't do it with any
grace and he threatened us no matter how much we gave. If we gave
$50,000, he wanted $100,000. If we gave $100,000, he wanted
$200,000,'' Hefley said.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, 56, easily won a fourth term in Congress on Election
Day. But in the wake of the GOP's disappointing performance, he
immediately came under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich told Linder he would have to run for his
post, rather than be appointed by the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker's own decision to step down temporarily took the
focus off Linder, but did not satisfy the thirst for change in the
ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly was a desire for change and I was a perfect
target for that,'' Linder said following the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In Davis, the Republicans chose a more moderate politician who
represents a suburban Washington district. Davis, 49, also is a
prolific fund raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a broad-based party. We have a great message. We need to
look at more messengers. We're looking at keeping our party base
broad and open to all who share our philosophy,'' Davis said after
his victory. He was first elected in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, who probably will retain his seat on the powerful Rules
Committee, said he knew faced his long odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by fighting the fight and being able to talk to 180
people, I think I cleared the air about what the committee did and
did not do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a trying two weeks, Linder even managed a joke.
With more time on his hands the next two years, he said, ``Maybe
I'll get a dog.''

 &HT;    Watts chosen for fourth-ranking slot in House
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans gave their only African-American
member the fourth-ranking slot in the House hierarchy Wednesday as
they chose some new faces and some familiar ones as leaders in the
next Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts (R-Okla.), a former All-America quarterback,
became the first black man to hold a Republican leadership position
in the House when he defeated Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) for
Republican Conference chairman, whose job is to promote the party's
agenda and keep members informed about legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner had sought a third two-year term as chairman, but he
absorbed some of the blame for the Republicans' ineffectiveness
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, who won 121-93, said his election sends a message of
Republican inclusiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good for the Republican Party for America to know
that the Republican Party _ that we're a party of men and women,
and red, yellow, brown, black and white Americans,'' said Watts,
who turned 41 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With Newt Gingrich stepping down at the end of the current term,
Republicans unanimously chose Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana as
their candidate for speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, pledged
to work with Democrats, but also sought to reassure his
conservative colleagues. ``We will do so to advance Republican
principles'' of less government, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, 55, still must be elected by the full House, but
that is considered a formality. He identified his top priorities as
preserving Social Security and cutting taxes, an agenda quite
similar to Gingrich's.
</P>
<P>
   While Watts was claiming a victory for diversity, another
aspiring leader who campaigned on that theme fell short in her bid
to become majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) finished third in the balloting.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas won a third term over
Rep. Steve Largent, another football-playing Oklahoman. On the
third ballot, after Dunn had been eliminated, Armey defeated
Largent, 127-95.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Texan Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, also earned
another two years from Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.), chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, did not fare as well, losing
his post to Rep. Tom Davis (R-Va.).
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's challenge to Armey opened up her position as
vice-chairman of the conference. Republicans chose Rep. Tillie
Fowler, a six-year member of the House, as Dunn's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, a Georgia native, is the daughter of the late Democratic
state Sen. Culver Kidd of Milledgeville.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining members of the leadership team stayed the same.
Rep. Chris Cox (R-Calif.) will remain chairman of the Republican
policy conference and Rep. Deborah Pryce (R-Ohio) will stay on as
Cox's deputy.

FOUR CHILDREN DIE IN COMMUNE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMELLE, Ala. _ Four small children died in a fire that destroyed
a dormitory at a religious commune whose founder has been praised
as a self-help visionary and scorned as a cult leader.
</P>
<P>
   The fire Tuesday night at a 54-acre compound called ``Holyland''
was apparently caused by a 10-year-old girl who knocked over a
lamp, said Sumter County Sheriff Johnny Lee Hatter. The lamp
ignited bedsheets, and the fire reduced the wooden building to
little more than ashes and the charred remains of metal-frame beds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went up fast from there,'' Hatter said in an interview.
``All that was left was the rubble, and we've been digging through
that all day.''
</P>
<P>
   As investigators sifted through the building's remnants
Wednesday, four red flags marked the spots where the searchers
found the children, two boys and two girls ages 3 to 5.
</P>
<P>
   Their identities were not immediately released and it was not
known if they were among the children of Holyland's 72-year-old
founder, Luke Edwards, who by some accounts has fathered more than
a dozen children with members of his flock. Edwards has acknowleged
fathering 18 children _ nine each by his first and second wives _
but denied fathering children out of wedlock. He could not be
reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in mourning, but we will rebuild,'' said Martin
Crawford, an Edwards assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Hatter said an initial investigation of the fire showed there
was no foul play involved. However, a spokesman for the fire
marshal's office said it was too early to determine whether any
laws were broken. Hatter said the building had smoke detectors, but
no sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   The building was one of seven wooden structures, three mobile
homes and several sheds that dot the property along with rusty
earth-moving equipment. At least one other fire has occurred at the
western Alabama commune near the Mississippi line. A nursery and
preschool building were destroyed in 1993. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports indicated the fire was being treated as
suspicious, but Hatter said that was not the case. He also said the
controversies surrounding Edwards would not color authorities'
treatment of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't had no problems at all with him,'' the sheriff said.
``To me it's just a business he's running.''
</P>
<P>
   Few others who know Edwards are so sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   For the past decade, Edwards's unique approach to self-help _ an
unorthodox blend of business savvy, low-cost labor and
old-fashioned begging _ has earned him publicity and a decidedly
mixed reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Some praised him as a religious entrepreneur who moved his
congregation of poor blacks from welfare to work. But others
derided him as a self-interested charlatan who built a cult-like
organization from the sweat of his followers, who they say are
forced to travel the country panhandling.
</P>
<P>
   Holyland has been a magnet for reporters in recent years, drawn
by a business empire worth an estimated $6.5 million as well as by
$1.3 million in court judgments, child-labor fines and claims of
sexual improprieties by former residents.
</P>
<P>
   A Detroit auto worker turned Pentecostal preacher, Edwards took
over a church in Meridian, Miss. more than 25 years ago. He never
went beyond the fourth grade, but his followers call him ``the
bishop.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that nearly his entire congregation received food
stamps, Edwards devised a plan in the early 1970s to use government
aid as a financial stepping stone. He opened food pantry in the
church and received authorization to take food stamps. Goods were
purchased at wholesale and sold to church members at retail prices.
</P>
<P>
   The profits formed the building blocks of his later
acquisitions. In a few years, the organization started buying land
across the border in Alabama under its not-for-profit corporate
arm, REACH Inc., which stands for Research, Education and Community
Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Now REACH owns three motels, four restaurants, a small
slaughterhouse, three stores, a cattle feedlot, a hog farm, an
airplane, 2,800 acres of land, several limousines and two garages,
according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Holyland's businesses are not its only money maker. There is
also the group's system, known as ``The Route.'' Vanloads of adults
and children are sent on the road for weeks at a time to ask for
money outside stores nationwide.

 &HT;    Biden warns lawmakers to heed public's views about Clinton
 &HT;    By Nichole Monroe
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers who want to remove President Clinton from
office must ``bend over backwards'' to show the American people the
impeachment proceedings are fair, Sen. Joseph Biden said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior member and former chair of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Biden, D-Del., said though lawmakers are elected to
exercise their own judgment and not shift with the political winds,
they still should take seriously the views of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're trying to decide whether an offense is a breach of
the public trust, it is important to know what the public thinks,''
he said at a National Press Club luncheon. ``If the American people
don't think they have made a mistake in electing Bill Clinton, we
in Congress had better be very careful before we upset their
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Biden said the best way to ensure the inquiry is conducted
properly is for lawmakers to proceed in a manner that is fair and
consistent with the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Democrats and Republicans to disregard their party
affiliation, and he warned them not to base their decision on
whether they agree with Clinton's political or personal views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should they fail to do this, the risk they face is the chance
that they will inflict more damage on our system of government and
induce more cynicism and disgust with politics than anything
President Clinton has done thus far,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's comments come amid continued bickering in Congress
as independent counsel Kenneth Starr prepares to present
allegations against the president at impeachment proceedings
Thursday. While Democrats are complaining about plans to call
additional witnesses, Republicans are warning them not to launch an
attack against Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers who want to vote against impeachment should not think
it is an approval of the president's actions, Biden said. Other
alternatives to impeachment exist, including criminal charges once
the president has left office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to impeach, even failure to proceed with criminal
action, does not mean the president has not paid for his immoral
behavior,'' Biden said. ``He has already been sentenced to a
hundred years of shame in the history books, which is not an
insignificant penalty.''

 &HT;    Feds to review slavery course
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Federal officials want to determine whether a
community college noncredit course violated civil rights laws by
teaching that most black people during the Civil War were happy
under slavery.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina advisory committee to the U.S. Commission on
Civil Rights voted Wednesday to request that the federal commission
schedule a public forum to examine the course and its sponsor, Lt.
F.C. Frazier Camp 668 of the Sons of the Confederate Veterans in
High Point, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should have to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt
that they are not a hate group,'' said Richie Everette, the branch
president of the NAACP in Randolph County.
</P>
<P>
   He said he recently attended one of the classes, and that he was
treated cordially by the dozen white students. Still, he said the
group sponsoring the course should ``open its doors'' by inviting
blacks to participate in its military re-enactments.
</P>
<P>
   The final class in the weekly 2 1/2-hour course, ``North
Carolina's Role in the War for Southern Independence,'' is
scheduled for today at the Archdale campus of Randolph Community
College. But the controversy that erupted this week amid criticism
from civil rights leaders and skepticism from historians promises
to intensify under federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Voting to request that the federal agency hold a forum in the
next few weeks, state advisory committee Chairman Wyatt Kirk said,
``We are going to try to put to rest distortions and percep-
tions.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the federal Civil Rights
Commission, asked Wyatt to gather information about the course
during the North Carolina panel's quarterly meeting Wednesday in
Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia A. Daniel, the college's vice president for education
programs, told committee members that she was not qualified to
debate the historical accuracy of whether black people enjoyed
slavery. She defended the college's decision to offer the course,
saying administrators approved it under the same guidelines they
authorized other nonacademic credit continuing education courses,
such as ones titled ``Creating Racial Unity'' and ``Angels Right on
Schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to enter the theological debate (whether there)
are angels among us?'' said Daniel. ``I haven't met many this
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Taught for the first time this semester, the Civil War course is
part of the college's series of courses about North Carolina's
place in history, Daniel said. A course slated to start in January
will examine the role of civil rights in the state. Tuition for the
Southern history course is $40 per student, which covered
instructors' salaries and materials, Daniel said. Instructors are
not employed by the college. A few in the audience complained that
the civil rights panel should focus on what they consider more
critical issues for blacks, such as police brutality, crime and
housing.

MICROSOFT SAYS IT WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT JAVA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST, MICROSOFT-DEFENDERS) 
(mk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. has decided ``absolutely'' to continue to
support the Java programming language in the wake of a ruling on
Tuesday in which a U.S. judge ordered the company to change its
Java software, a Microsoft executive said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary ruling, the judge found that Microsoft had
violated its licensing contract with Sun Microsystems Inc.,
inventor of the Java language, by altering it so that it was
tailored for Microsoft's Windows and incompatible with Sun's Java
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ronald Whyte of U.S. District Court in San Jose, Calif.,
told Microsoft it could no longer ship the incompatible software
and gave the company 90 days to comply with his order.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling on Tuesday afternoon, Paul Maritz, a Microsoft
group vice president, said the company was weighing its options and
that ``the option of not supporting Java is open to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tod Nielsen, Microsoft's general manager in charge of
dealing with software developers, said the company was ``absolutely
going to support Java, and we will support it as long as there is a
desire for it,'' among programmers. Maritz's comment on Tuesday,
Nielsen said, was intended as one of a number of ``hypothetical
options'' available to Microsoft in the aftermath of the judge's
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does curb some of Microsoft's practices. For example,
the company may not contractually require software developers to
use Microsoft's version of Java exclusively, nor may Microsoft add
commands to Java that result in programs that run only on
Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But the main element of the judge's order, according to
Microsoft, is the requirement that the company include additional
commands that make it compatible with Sun's Java standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though there are some restrictions on what we can do,'' said
Tom Burt, an associate general counsel for Microsoft, ``Microsoft
still has the right to create its own version of Java.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than curbing its Java offerings, Nielsen said Microsoft
would comply with the judge's order by giving ``software developers
another choice'' among the Java options that the company includes
in products like its Windows 98 operating system and its Internet
Explorer World Wide Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   Still, industry analysts expressed skepticism about Microsoft's
court-ordered conversion to the virtues of offering more choice for
the thousands of software developers who write programs in Java
that are used for everything from animating Web sites to tracking
stock prices. Microsoft, the analysts said, had tried to divide
Java into different camps _ one aligned with Microsoft, one with
Sun _ to undermine the Java threat to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of Java is that it makes it easier to write programs
that can run easily on different operating systems, thus weakening
the advantage Microsoft enjoys now because most developers write
programs tailored for its industry-standard Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies, including IBM Corp. and Novell, have licensed
Sun's Java technology, and those companies are permitted to
fine-tune Java as long as the additions do not make it incompatible
with the core Java software.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the difference is that Microsoft tried to create
incompatibilities,'' said Jeffrey Tarter, editor of Softletter, an
industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling could cause some uncertainty among software
developers working with Microsoft's version of Java, Tarter said.
Perhaps within a year or so, Tarter said, Microsoft will likely
regain its influence over the growing community of Java programmers
by re-engineering Java so that it can do whatever it wants with it.
</P>
<P>
   In this process of ``cloning'' software, engineers who have not
had access to Sun's Java programming code are given specifications
about what tasks the cloned Java should perform and then told to
write code that performs those tasks. The resulting product, Tarter
said, would be intended to run existing Java programs but also to
run far better than Sun's version on computers using Microsoft's
Windows operating system.

   ``Microsoft got its start doing a knock-off of the old Basic
operating system, so that kind of reverse engineering is totally in
character,'' Tarter said.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen of Microsoft said there were no current plans for
cloning Java, and he described that option as a ``long-term
technical issue.''
</P>
<P>
   By requiring Microsoft to offer Java that is compatible with
Sun's standards, the California court order is likely to make it
more difficult for Microsoft to use its dominance of personal
computing software to bend Java in its direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really forces Microsoft to compete on the merits of the
product, and these days it rarely does that,'' said Richard
Shaffer, a principal of Technologic Partners, a technology
consulting firm in New York. ``Typically, Microsoft's enormous
market power gives it a huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Nielsen of Microsoft said, ``We feel pretty
confident about our ability to write software.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Morris, Sun's general counsel, said the court order was
intended to make the playing field level for all companies in the
Java market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft is happy with that, I'm delighted,'' Morris said.

RANGERS SHOULD BITE CASH BULLET ON GONZALEZ NOW, NOT LATER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The one thing the Rangers do not want to know _ never want to
find out _ is how much two-time American League MVP Juan Gonzalez
is worth on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   Advice to general manager Doug Melvin: Do not go there. Not if
you want to keep your job.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the smartest thing the Rangers can do in the next
few months is spend a little money _ oh, maybe $75 million, give or
take Fort Knox _ to tie up the best player in franchise history for
the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   It's the classic, pay me now, or pay me later.
</P>
<P>
   Get it on paper ASAP and consider the $75 million another
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably sit down and put our club together here for
next year,'' Melvin said yesterday, ``then take a look at it. We've
talked about it within the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa, who should be announced
today as the National League MVP. Forget publicity hogs Ken Griffey
Jr., Mike Piazza and Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The best hitter in baseball works the night shift at The
Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez stamped himself as the premier hitter of the '90s by
winning his second Most Valuable Player award in three years
yesterday, to go along with two home-run championships captured
earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think Juan gets a little bit overlooked,'' Melvin
said. ``There's been a lot of talk about Griffey, a lot of talk
about some of the other players. I think the way Juan performed
this season and what he set out to do should put to rest some of
the criticism that was thrown in his direction earlier in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was the most valuable player. I didn't think it
was a surprise at all that he won.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come as a surprise to the Baseball Writers of America,
either. The 28 baseball writers with MVP votes made Gonzalez a
runaway winner. Three-fourths of the voters _ 21 writers _ gave
Gonzalez their first-place votes and the not-so-magnificent-seven
who didn't (shame on them) made him their second choice.
</P>
<P>
   He is the first Latin American player in baseball history to win
the MVP award twice, which may speak to the same bias to which
Melvin is alluding. But that's another column for another time.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, just put yourself in Melvin's seat and try to
figure out what you're going to have to offer to get Gonzalez's
signature on a long-term contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the facts:
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who just turned 29, is under contract this season, and
the Rangers have another option for the year 2000, both at around
$7 million a year. Sure, by today's standards, that's a steal for
the Rangers, but you, as Melvin, don't have to feel a bit guilty.
In 1994 and '95, when Gonzalez was injured parts of both seasons
and limited to 46 homers in two years, he was overpaid. That's the
way these long-term deals work.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, the Rangers have to have Gonzalez signed to an
extension or he can become a free agent. Piazza's contract with the
Mets _ seven years, $91 million (an average of $13 million a year)
_ is the current slugger's financial ceiling. Vaughn, according to
media reports, has a six-year, $72 million offer on the table from
the Angels. But the contract that knocked the socks off every GM in
baseball was the one singles-hitting Jose Offerman just signed with
Boston for four years, $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's worth that,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates asked,
``what's Mo Vaughn worth? What's Juan worth?''
</P>
<P>
   And those are 1998 dollars. What will Gonzalez be worth two
years from now, in baseball's rapidly escalating economy?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow!'' Melvin exclaimed. ``That's hard for me to say. I can't
win in that situation, if I say what he's worth and put a figure on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Logic says Gonzalez, if he were on the open market today, would
zoom past Piazza and stretch the ceiling to $14, maybe $15 million
a year. He could easily be the first $100 million baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were smart enough in January 1994 to sign Gonzalez
to a five-year contract with two option years that has prevented
that from happening. Now the smart thing to do is sign him to a
five-year extension at $15 million a year and never look back. It's
the kind of decisive, money-saving deal Tom Hicks has made dozens
of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to play with Texas,'' Gonzalez said yesterday from San
Juan, Puerto Rico. ``It's a great place to play baseball. They have
great fans. I'd feel much better to play my whole career in one
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that a five-year extension will take Gonzalez to the end of
his career, by any means. Seven years from now, Gonzalez will have
just turned 36 and, if he has remained healthy, be somewhere close
to 500 career home runs.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, is another story for another time.
</P>
<P>
   Today's story is Gonzalez, which means it's time for the Rangers
to take care of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Before they find out things they really don't want to know.
</P>

GONZALEZ WINS SECOND AL MVP AWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez has been named the
American League's most valuable player for the second time in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who won a tight race for the award in 1996, was the
overwhelming winner this time, receiving 21 of 28 first-place votes
from the baseball writers. Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra was a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the most excited person in the whole world right now,''
Gonzalez said yesterday from Puerto Rico, where he celebrated with
a small group of family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who will receive a $250,000 bonus in addition to the
trophy, is the 23rd player in major league history to win two MVP
awards. He is the first Latin American player to win the award
twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa can make it a clean sweep for the
region by winning the National League award, which will be
announced today.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen of the other 22 are in the Hall of Fame. Cal Ripken,
Barry Bonds and Frank Thomas are still active; Robin Yount and Dale
Murphy aren't yet eligible for enshrinement.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Maris, whose single-season home run record was broken this
season by Mark McGwire, is the only two-time MVP who is eligible
for the Hall of Fame but not in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says Juan is one of the elite players,'' said Rangers
manager Johnny Oates. ``To be elected two out of three years, that
says he's among the best of the elite. That's quite an
accomplishment. What he does, he does very well, and that's drive
in runs.''
</P>
<P>
   His number of runs batted in proved to be the difference.
Gonzalez led the American League with 157 RBI, the most by one
player since Boston's Ted Williams and Vern Stephens drove in 159
in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   He had 100 RBI at the All-Star break, creating speculation he
would challenge the all-time single-season record of 190 set by
Cubs outfielder Hack Wilson in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez also hit a career-high .318 with 45 home runs, 110 runs
scored and a league-leading 50 doubles. His batting exploits helped
the Rangers win their second West Division championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll remember most us winning the division title,'' said
Gonzalez, who has played eight full seasons with the Rangers.
``When you win the division, that's a great moment for the whole
team and the whole organization. Then, 157 RBI was amazing. There's
been a lot of years where nobody drove in more than 150 RBI.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said he was also proud of staying injury-free. This was
the first time in four years that he did not spend time on the
disabled list, allowing him to set a career high with 606 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked in spring training about playing every day,'' Oates
said. ``That's what I'm most excited about, his dedication and hard
work being rewarded like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The voting was done by 28 baseball writers, two in each American
League city. Ten players were named on each ballot. Gonzalez
received 21 first-place and seven second-place votes for a total of
352 points.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra received 232 points, followed by Yankees shortstop
Derek Jeter (180). Red Sox first baseman Mo Vaughn and Mariners
outfielder Ken Griffey Jr. tied for fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez edged Seattle Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez by
three points to win the award in 1996. That year he hit .314 with
47 home runs and 144 RBI to join Jeff Burroughs as the only Rangers
to win the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time I felt more comfortable than in 1996,'' Gonzalez
said. ``The first time was too tight. Now I feel great. I'm in
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland Indians outfielder Manny Ramirez, New York Yankees
outfielder Bernie Williams, Chicago White Sox outfielder Albert
Belle, Rodriguez and Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez rounded out the
top 10.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth time in club history that the Rangers have
had two players in the top 10. The others were Burroughs and
pitcher Ferguson Jenkins in 1974; Gonzalez and Rafael Palmeiro in
1993; and Gonzalez and Rodriguez in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez receives a $50,000 bonus for being in the top 10.
Reliever John Wetteland got an eighth-place vote and starter Rick
Helling got a 10th place vote, marking the first time in club
history that four Rangers received most valuable player
consideration.

   Confronting Traumatic Brain Injury
</P>
<P>
   William Winslade
</P>
<P>
   Yale University Press, $27.50
</P>
<P>
   ``On September 7, 1943, when I was not quite two, I fell from a
second-story porch and landed headfirst on the concrete pavement.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are the opening words of William Winslade's book, which
illuminates an underappreciated public health problem: traumatic
brain injury.
</P>
<P>
   After his accident, Winslade was in intensive care in a Chicago
hospital for five weeks. No one could predict whether he would live
or die _ or whether he would suffer lifelong mental, emotional and
physical disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He survived, and thrived. Today, he is the James Wade Rockwell
Professor of Philosophy in Medicine at the Institute for the
Medical Humanities at the University of Texas Medical Branch in
Galveston, and he teaches preventive medicine and community health,
psychiatry, and behavioral sciences.
</P>
<P>
   But so many others don't do well.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 75,000 to 100,000 people die of brain
trauma each year. An additional 70,000 to 90,000 are left
permanently impaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``On any given day, we have 25,000 to 40,000 people in a
persistent vegetative state. We can't help them. It's a fate worse
than death,'' Winslade says. ``We rescue people from the brink of
death with the jaws of life, so the fatalities are down, but the
devastation is up.''
</P>
<P>
   Winslade works with the Transitional Learning Community in
Galveston, where more than 600 head-trauma patients have undergone
physical, speech, recreational and occupational therapy, and have
relearned the practical skills necessary for independent living
over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are killing 40,000 a year in car accidents, and most of
them die of brain injuries. Gunshot wounds, falls and sports
injuries account for most of the others,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet traumatic brain injury seldom comes to mind when we list
major public health problems,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   His book calls for policy changes to lower the incidence of
traumatic brain injury. He wants to raise the minimum driving age
and make driver's-license tests more challenging. He is lobbying
the Texas Legislature for a graduated licensing system, which would
limit the privileges of our youngest drivers, such as requiring
that they drive with an adult in the car for the first six months,
drive only during daylight hours, drive only if no other teens are
in the car, or observe a midnight driving curfew.
</P>
<P>
   He points out that 7 percent of licensed drivers are 16 or 17
years old, yet they account for 14 percent of traffic fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many people do you know who have failed their driver's
tests?'' he asks. ``Very few, because the standards are so low. We
should make driver's tests harder. Driving a car is not a
constitutional right. We need to rethink what's important to us.
Too often, we start our kids driving as young as possible because
it's more convenient for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Winslade says cars worry him more than guns; a car is 2 tons of
steel going 90 mph with other people in the way. He believes that
it was stupid to raise speed limits, and he wants more speed checks
and more law-enforcement officers patrolling the highways.
</P>
<P>
   He also would require bike and motorcycle helmets, air bags and
seat belts. He wants to tax automobile licenses and driver's
licenses, guns, and alcohol to help cover the costs of treatment
and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   And, he's calling for a ban on professional boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Winslade's goals are to make brain-injury prevention part of the
education of every student before the student is old enough to get
behind the wheel of a car, and to get traumatic head injury
recognized as a public health problem.
</P>
<P>
   This book should go a long way toward those goals.

   Winslade says cars worry him more than guns; a car is 2 tons of
steel going 90 mph with other people in the way. He believes that
it was stupid to raise speed limits, and he wants more speed checks
and more law-enforcement officers patrolling the highways.
</P>
<P>
   He also would require bike and motorcycle helmets, air bags and
seat belts. He wants to tax automobile licenses and driver's
licenses, guns, and alcohol to help cover the costs of treatment
and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   And, he's calling for a ban on professional boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Winslade's goals are to make brain-injury prevention part of the
education of every student before the student is old enough to get
behind the wheel of a car, and to get traumatic head injury
recognized as a public health problem.
</P>
<P>
   This book should go a long way toward those goals.

DUNN LOSES BID FOR TOP LEADERSHIP ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Jennifer Dunn's rapid rise within the GOP came
to an abrupt halt Wednesday as her fellow House Republicans
overwhelmingly rejected her candidacy for majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accepted Dunn's argument that a ``fresh face'' was
needed to diversify a GOP leadership team that previously had
consisted exclusively of white men. But instead of adding a woman
to the top echelons, the Republicans made the surprise move of
elevating the lone black GOP congressman, J.C. Watts Jr. of
Oklahoma, to the post of conference chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn, a 57-year-old Bellevue Republican who gave up a junior
leadership post to run for majority leader, now returns to life as
a rank-and-file House member.
</P>
<P>
   She accepted her defeat with grace. She congratulated the
victor, incumbent Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and pledged
to continue to work on broadening the party's appeal to women. Dunn
also said she was pleased even to have been taken seriously as a
candidate for a position that no woman has ever held, and said she
hopes her effort will make it easier for other women to rise in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic day for the Republican Party,'' Dunn told
reporters minutes after her loss. ``We have broken yet another
glass ceiling _ the first time ever a woman has run for a top
leadership position. It's a great groundbreaker for women.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the Republicans chose Appropriations Committee
Chairman Bob Livingston, R-La., as their nominee for House Speaker.
If elected by the House in January _ pretty much a foregone
conclusion because Republicans hold a majority _ Livingston will
replace Newt Gingrich. Gingrich decided not to seek another term as
speaker after his party suffered the unexpected loss of five seats
in the House in this month's election.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also re-elected Tom DeLay of Texas as majority
whip. But they ousted John Boehner of Ohio as conference chairman,
replacing him with Watts.
</P>
<P>
   Armey won re-election after three rounds of voting by the 223
Republicans elected to the next Congress. In the first round, Armey
won 100 votes to 58 for former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent, 45
for Dunn, and 18 for Rep. Denny Hastert, R-Ill. Hastert then
dropped off, and in a second round of voting Armey won 99 votes to
73 for Largent and 49 for Dunn. Dunn then dropped off, and Armey
ultimately defeated Largent of Oklahoma, 127 to 95. (Not all
Republicans voted in each round.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Hastert's entry hurt us, because when all the talk about him
came about, that kind of froze members from making commitments
because they didn't know what the field would be,'' said Rep.
Richard ``Doc'' Hastings, R-Wash., who was Dunn's top vote-counter.
``But Jennifer is still a senior member of the Ways and Means
Committee, and, let's face it, she is still a very good spokesman
for our party, and she will be sought after by various media who
ask her opinions on things. I don't think that will be diminished
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's supporters offered a variety of other theories to explain
her defeat. Top among them was that she was running against an
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick (Armey) had used his position to ingratiate himself with
an awful lot of people around the country, and it's hard to
dislodge that,'' said Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash. ``It was a
question of whether Dick should be punished for the election losses
or not, and although people wanted to flirt with that
(possibility), in the end they didn't want to enforce it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that perhaps Dunn, who had held the
sixth-ranking leadership post, might have aimed too high in running
for the No. 2 job, and might have waited too long to declare her
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jennifer did a great job, and I supported her vigorously, but
we're a small state and Armey had a running start,'' said Rep. Jack
Metcalf, R-Wash. ``If she had run for a lesser office, she probably
would have made it. This was no repudiation of her _ this was just
a reinforcement of support for Dick.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Dunn supporters quietly blamed her loss on her compromise
position on abortion _ she supports abortion rights but is not a
vocal champion of the cause and opposes federal financing of
abortions. That position has managed to alienate supporters and
opponents of abortion rights, because both sides believe Dunn isn't
entirely with them.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's campaign, although failing to win votes of a majority of
House Republicans, dramatically increased her national prominence.
She was profiled on NBC News and in the Washington Post and New
York Times; she was interviewed on a variety of television shows
and by numerous newspapers; and she was mentioned as a possible
vice-presidential nominee in 2000 by U.S. News and World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn's political future is uncertain. The next major political
races in Washington state are in 2000 for U.S. Senate and governor.
But Republican Slade Gorton has told friends he plans to seek
re-election to the Senate and Democrat Gary Locke appears likely to
be difficult to beat for the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn said she will focus on trying to cut taxes and save Social
Security as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, and
will ``work as a member of our broad Republican team to reach out _
particularly to women _ through a national campaign, communicating
our positive vision to every American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what's next,'' she said. ``I don't know what
will happen. I have no thought that they will create a new position
(for Dunn). But it's such an inside game. You don't have to be part
of leadership to do what you're here to do _ I'm here to make a
difference and I expect to do that one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dunn said she doesn't regret her choices this year, which
included forgoing a race for U.S. Senate against incumbent Democrat
Patty Murray to focus on a career in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have minimal disappointment, because I would love to have
put my shoulder to the wheel. I'm a very good manager and I love to
do that kind of work,'' she said. ``But I don't have any regrets.''

MARKET PLACE: BEHIND THE COCA-COLA SHAREHOLDERS' SELLOFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While much of America spent its summer vacation lying on the
beach or relaxing on a mountaintop, some key shareholders of
Coca-Cola Enterprises spent theirs in a flurry of trading on the
stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Early filings for the third quarter show that at least one big
mutual fund company, a money manager and a trust company with
significant positions in Coca-Cola Enterprises sold nearly all
their shares during that period. Another mutual fund is said to
have sold 10 million shares, possibly in a private deal. And the
buyer of at least 14 million of the shares on the block was the
company itself.
</P>
<P>
   Two factors helped prompt the selling. In late July, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, which is Coca-Cola Co.'s main bottler in the United
States and parts of Europe, announced a $5 billion capital spending
plan that alarmed some investors, particularly when the company
said it would not start showing increased positive cash flow until
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of investors just didn't want to wait,'' said Jennifer
Solomon, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Then the stock market, rattled by global economic crises in
Russia and other regions, fell into an August swoon that carried
the stock price of Coca-Cola Enterprises south along with those of
many other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest sellers included Prudential Mutual Fund Investment
Management, which sold slightly more than 6.2 million shares, worth
$158.9 million, at the end of August. The company had held those
shares since June, said Tim Biggs, a spokesman for Prudential, but
declined to say why Prudential had decided to sell. Prudential
still has about 242,000 Coca-Cola Enterprises shares in its
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Another big seller was the Bessemer Trust Co., which sold 2.9
million shares, worth $73.3 million, according to its most recent
filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company,
which has been a long-term shareholder, still has about 46,000
shares.
</P>
<P>
   And the word on Wall Street is that Putnam Investment
Management, the second-biggest shareholder in Coca-Cola
Enterprises, quietly sold about 10 million of its 15.8 million
shares during the third quarter as well, possibly in a private
deal. A spokesman for Putnam, part of Marsh &AMP; McLennan, refused to
comment. Meanwhile, filings show that Warburg Pincus Asset
Management sold 901,167 shares during the quarter for $22.7
million; the firm kept 9,600 shares.
</P>
<P>
   Where did all those shares go? As it turns out, 14 million were
bought by the company itself, for $404 million _ issuing more debt
to pay for them at a time when it is already heavy with debt from
acquisitions of smaller bottlers. The company frequently uses its
own stock in acquisitions, which can mean tax-free deals for the
owners of companies it takes over.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, Coca-Cola Enterprises went on its shopping spree
without fanfare, though companies often publicize buybacks, since
the purchases can give the stock a lift. The first mention came in
late October, at the end of its third-quarter earnings release.
</P>
<P>
   The company's most recent stock-repurchasing plan, aimed at
reclaiming 30 million shares altogether, was authorized in April
1996, a company spokeswoman said. But until Jan. 1 of this year, no
shares had been repurchased, because the company was reluctant to
take on more debt.
</P>
<P>
   While 1 million shares were bought in the first quarter _ and
preceded by a detailed news release _ that move was dwarfed by the
activity that came in the third quarter, when other owners were
busy selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's not the way to use shareholder capital,'' said
Albert Meyer, an accountant and consultant in Indianapolis who has
previously criticized Coca-Cola Enterprises. ``And it's capital
they don't have, because they had to borrow to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like merger activity, corporate share repurchases are at an
all-time high. Last year, companies spent $182 billion to buy back
their own stock, said Laurie Hodrick, a professor of economics and
finance at the Columbia University business school. They do so to
invest in the stock when it appears to be undervalued, or for tax
advantages, or as a deterrent to possible takeovers, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're repurchasing to communicate confidence, you'd want
to announce it,'' she said. ``But if the purchasing is done on the
open market, firms need not disclose it and whether they do so or
not depends on the purpose of the activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Carton, vice president for investor relations and
planning at Coca-Cola Enterprises, says that share repurchases have
long been part of the company's strategy, and the third quarter was
merely an example of that strategy in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took advantage of the soft share price and bought a lot of
shares,'' she said, adding that the purchases took place in August
and September, at prices ``from the mid-30s to low 30s all the way
down to the mid-20s.'' Some shares purchased were part of a 17.7
million block that had been issued in the spring as a means of
financing the company's takeover of a large Texas bottler, Coke
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Some purchases were made on the open market, and others were
``privately negotiated transactions that we're not able to
disclose,'' she said, adding that ``short-term paper'' was used to
finance the deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody calls us and says we'd like to do this privately,
we're interested,'' she said, calling a private sale ``a more
direct transaction'' that permits the company to negotiate the
price.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The company's decision to take on more debt to do that, though,
may not sit well with every investor. ``If interest rates were to
spike, I think CCE would be in serious trouble, just to make their
interest payments,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least one analyst is worried that price-cutting
in the next few months may further erode earnings. ``I didn't sense
that this significantly improving pricing environment is around the
corner,'' said Caroline Levy, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., who
took the stock off her recommended list Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coca-Cola Enterprises' share price has bounced back.
Working in the company's favor was its inclusion in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index on Oct. 7. That alone pushed up the stock
price somewhat, since index funds had to add shares of Coca-Cola
Enterprises to their holdings. And, as the market in general has
risen back to early-summer levels, the company's share price has
gone up as well. Coca-Cola Enterprises stock closed at $38.0625 a
share Wednesday, down 93.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even during the third quarter, there was at least one
new big buyer: Merrill Lynch Asset Management, which bought 2.9
million shares for $73.5 million. Morgan Stanley Asset Management
added 2.8 million shares to its holdings during the quarter as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter's single heaviest session of trading came July 22,
the day Coca-Cola Enterprises released its second-quarter earnings
and let investors know the details of the capital-spending plan.
Trading volume, typically less than 1 million shares daily, soared
to 7,996,100 shares; the price dropped from $38.4375 to $35.3125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who invested in the company have become concerned
about the divergence between EBITDA and earnings,'' said Marc
Cohen, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, referring to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. ``While EBITDA is
growing, the big financial commitments they are making to expand
the business are causing real earnings measures, and most
importantly, free cash flow, to weaken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fabulous use of funds as long as there's money to
borrow,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.

IRAQI DISSIDENTS MAY BE A SHAKY BRIDGE TO SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (htv) 
 By James Risen and Barbara Crossette   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iraqi dissident groups are weak, divided and in
many cases thoroughly penetrated by Iraqi agents, making it
uncertain how they could ever topple Saddam Hussein, Clinton
administration officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the groups also have misgivings about U.S. support.
Leaders of some of the smaller groups say the United States might
do little but revive discredited projects that have lost the
support of people inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton caught the dissident groups and even some U.S.
officials off guard last weekend, when he said the best way to
avoid another crisis with Iraq would be a change in Baghdad's
government. After calling off a planned air strike, he said the
administration would do more to support ``forces of change in
Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also embraced a new law that many in the Pentagon and
his administration had criticized as a waste of money. It calls for
Washington to provide $97 million worth of military equipment and
other resources to the dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledge that the president's
address suddenly revived a policy that many critics believed had
been on the back burner. Indeed, the president's announcement came
weeks after the top U.S. military commander in the Gulf, Gen.
Anthony Zinni, dismissed the new law, saying, ``I don't think these
things have been thought out.'' Now, the White House and State
Department are moving quickly to try to fill in the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the president's address, Martin Indyk, assistant
secretary of state, met with Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi
National Congress, which has been out of favor with the
administration since its operations in northern Iraq were decimated
by the Iraqi army two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Chalabi lobbied Congress to pass the $97 million funding plan,
and now hopes to push the administration to designate his group as
a prime beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's support ``represents a policy reversal,''
said Chalabi. ``They have opened their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration also is accelerating efforts to help unite
feuding Kurdish and other groups into a cohesive opposition. These
include an influential Iranian-backed Shiite Muslim group. That
group, the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution of Iraq, met
privately with Clinton administration officials in Washington three
months ago, according to other dissident leaders. It is the largest
among Iraqi Shiite groups in southern Iraq and may now be willing
to take part in a U.S.-sponsored military action against Saddam, if
Tehran approves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than a dozen opposition groups in London were
asked to meet with a British government official the day after
Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain supported the efforts to
undermine Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
   But altogether, the sheer number of dissident groups and the
fact that they have competing interests, have hampered Washington
and London in their search for a way to topple Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials acknowledged Wednesday that
they are not yet ready to decide which groups would receive
American support, and if any would receive arms. Under the terms of
the law, called the Iraq Liberation Act, the president has until
the end of January to announce which groups will receive U.S.
support, but it does not require him to actually turn over arms to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are intensifying our engagement with the opposition groups
by strengthening our economic and political support for them,''
said the State Department spokesman, James Rubin. ``With respect to
arming them, we haven't ruled that out, but we think it is
premature to do that, until we work on the political side, and
until then we are not unduly risking people's lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior State Department official was equally cautious.
``We have to be realistic about how we go forward,'' he said.
``Working with the opposition to help them unify to create an
alternative is a critical first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress say they aren't convinced that the White
House is serious. ``They have taken a step towards support for the
Iraq Liberation Act, but I don't see that they have really made a
commitment to overthrow Saddam,'' said a senior Republican Senate
aide. ``And that's the purpose of the act.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Iraqi dissident groups, which are divided across ethnic and
sectarian lines, worry about U.S. and British intentions, saying
that any plan that provides support for the Iraqi National Congress
will have little support inside the country. ``From the beginning,
I realized that this is not for changing the regime in Iraq,'' said
Sami Faraj, who writes a weekly column for a London-based weekly
newspaper, Free Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Saad Jabr, the publisher of Free Iraq and the son of a former
prime minister of Iraq when it had a British-installed monarchy,
recommended an indictment of Saddam for crimes against humanity and
total diplomatic isolation for his regime, among other measures. He
also recommended spending ``big money'' on an effective satellite
system for broadcasting to Iraq. A number of exiles mentioned that
the Radio Free Iraq broadcasts that the United States has now begun
are too little, too late.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think America is serious, unfortunately, about
removing Saddam Hussein,'' Jabr said in an interview. And if the
Clinton administration wants to count on any serious support within
the country, the Iraqi middle class living mostly in Baghdad or
other towns in the country's Arabic, Sunni Muslim heartland, need a
psychological boost, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Abbas Mehdi, a university professor who is
chairman of the Union of Independent Iraqis, a group linking about
30 small groups, said the United States has embraced sanctions that
cut into the living standards of the Iraqi middle class, the very
group whose cooperation Washington would need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are destroying the people and the country,'' he
said. ``They have weakened the people who now have to depend on
Saddam Hussein more than ever. It pains me to see how people talk
about the U.S. in the Middle East, not only in Iraq. People are
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new interest, many U.S. officials have grown wary of
investing too much _ in time or resources _ into groups that often
seem more intent on fighting each other than unseating Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Persian Gulf War, Saddam has exploited the
differences among the groups and managed to subvert them, rather
than the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. options have been so limited that the Central Intelligence
Agency has been secretly funding one group that agency officials
know has been betrayed by Iraqi agents, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi National Accord, a group made up of former military
officers and other defectors from the Baghdad regime, is still
receiving CIA backing more than two years after Iraq revealed that
it knew all about the group's covert efforts to subvert Saddam's
rule. In June of 1996, Iraq rounded up and executed about 100 army
officers and others suspected of involvement with the group, making
it clear that the government had agents inside the group.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, U.S. officials say they strongly suspect that the
group of defectors, with offices in Amman, Jordan, and London, is
still riddled with double agents spreading disinformation.

SOUTH AFRICA SHOPS ABROAD FOR $5 BILLION WORTH OF ARMS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Seeking to upgrade its aging
military hardware, South Africa announced Wednesday that it would
spend about $5 billion to buy warships, submarines, helicopters and
jets from Britain, Germany, Sweden and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deals, South Africa will insist that some of the
equipment be built here, and officials assert that 65,000 jobs will
be created in a country where the official unemployment rate is 33
percent. Trade Minister Alec Erwin said the $5 billion price tag
would generate $17 billion in ``industrial benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the deal argue that the nation does not need
expensive new weapons when half the country still lacks indoor
plumbing. They also argue that South Africa faces no military
threat that submarines or jets can defeat. There were reports that
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel opposed the deals as too expensive,
but Deputy President Thabo Mbeki took pains to deny them.
</P>
<P>
   The government is touchy about the criticism, and Defense
Minister Joe Modise said Tuesday that anyone who opposed the arms
deals was ``opposed to progress'' and ``not friends of South
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the Cabinet authorized him to negotiate the purchases
with companies it named as leading bidders. Delivery is expected to
begin in 2002 and take seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Military expenditures have fallen drastically from their 1989
peak, when the apartheid government was battling the African
National Congress. In that year, they were almost 5 percent of
gross domestic product. Until Wednesday's deals, they have been
about $2.3 billion, or 1.5 percent, well below the World Bank
recommendation of a 2 percent limit for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The country is seeking three submarines and four light frigates
called corvettes. Thyssen AG and Preussag of Germany were the
leading bidders.
</P>
<P>
   It wants 28 Gripen fighters and 24 Hawk 100 trainers. British
Aerospace builds the Hawk and makes the Gripen jointly with Saab AB
of Sweden. This would be the first sale outside Sweden for the
JAS-39 Gripen, which has suffered from crashes during airshows and
on television.
</P>
<P>
   Agusta of Italy, a unit of Finmeccanica, is favored to supply 40
light utility helicopters, while Westland Ltd. of Britain is
favored to supply four helicopters for the frigates.
</P>
<P>
   An army request for 108 new tanks was turned down for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Much of South Africa's hardware is badly outdated. The Cheetah,
its principal fighter jet, is based on the French Mirage and uses
30-year-old technology. Its three Daphne-class submarines are
frequently laid up for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Its strike craft, acquired about 25 years ago from Israel, were
built for the placid Mediterranean Sea. Their hulls are weakening
from the pounding they take off the Cape of Good Hope, and
particularly when venturing down to South African islands near
Antarctica. The navy complains that it does not have enough ships
to prevent foreign trawlers from illegally overfishing thousands of
miles of South African, Mozambican, Namibian and Angolan coastline.
</P>
<P>
   In less complex weapons, South Africa is a net exporter. Its G-5
and G-6 artillery pieces are rated among the best in the world and
heavily marketed in the Middle East. It sells assault rifles,
mortars and armored cars to other African nations. Its Rooivalk
helicopter gunship is said to be the only helicopter in the world
that can do a barrel roll, but it has found few customers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was conspicuously absent from Wednesday's list
of suppliers. It did not even appear among the also-rans.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They are mothers and grandmothers from Africa,
Europe, Asia and the United States, now scattered throughout New
York, and every month they meet in a First Avenue conference room
across from the United Nations. They call themselves the U.N.
Family Rights Committee, but one woman says ``the dumped wives
club'' is more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   They are estranged or divorced spouses of U.N. employees, women
who followed their husbands to postings around the world and are
chasing after them once again. The agenda at their meetings rarely
changes. Some cannot collect unpaid support orders from U.S. and
foreign courts because the United Nations blocks them from doing
so. Most are not entitled to a share of their former husbands'
pensions, again because of U.N. policy.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, a native of the Middle East, lives in a Manhattan
rooming house. Her husband, a U.N. diplomat, left her after 40
years of marriage. She won a support order, but knows she may never
collect.
</P>
<P>
   Another woman, Audrey Camp Nekunam, a 71-year-old American, has
unsuccessfully tried to collect court-ordered support since her
husband, a native of Iran, left their Westchester County home 26
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out of the marriage an older woman who is no longer
attractive, either for marriage or for jobs, with a resume with
nothing I could put on it but housework,'' Ms. Nekunam said. ``As
an American, I can sue. I have rights to his pension and his wages.
I gave these American rights up when I married a UNer. I became his
ward.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorce is rarely simple, nor is it always fair, but these women
have discovered it can be uniquely devastating for a spouse of a
U.N. staff member. Had Ms. Nekunam's former husband not worked at
the United Nations, a court could have garnisheed his wages. But
the organization is exempt from legal process and refuses to
execute family court orders, so that while most of its divorced
employees do pay their family obligations, those who do not enjoy a
measure of protection.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Boernstein, a lawyer formerly with the U.N. legal
department who now advises the spouses' group, said the United
Nations' immunity privileges were important and ``were drawn up for
a good purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were never meant,'' she said, ``to protect diplomats
from their own families.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials fear that waiving immunity, even in family court
cases, could establish a precedent weakening the organization's
independence. But they say they have reduced the number of unpaid
support cases to a handful by threatening problem employees with
unspecified ``disciplinary actions.''
</P>
<P>
   The precise number of affected spouses is uncertain, and a
subject of heated debate. The family rights committee and its
advisers estimate that more than 100, nearly all of them women,
live in metropolitan New York, and hundreds more are around the
world. The attendance at the monthly meetings is 20 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   They say the United Nations' estimate of a handful does not
account for women like Ms. Nekunam, whose case is considered closed
because her husband is retired. Independent international
organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund
and the Inter-American Development Bank have also drawn complaints,
and other spouses' groups have been organized in Vienna, Geneva and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration considers the problem significant
enough to apply pressure. In July, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright took the unusual step of sending a diplomatic note urging
international organizations to comply voluntarily with family court
orders. But a State Department official conceded that the United
States' credibility on the issue was compromised by its own failure
to pay its dues to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, even some U.N. officials now concede, the
organization essentially ignored divorced spouses. One of the few
benefits the United Nations did provide these women struck them as
somewhat callous: a one-way airplane ticket home. The spouses lost
medical insurance and, in some cases, educational grants for their
children. Foreign spouses were also vulnerable to immigration laws,
facing possible deportation within 60 days of divorce, even if they
had lived in New York for years and had borne children.
</P>
<P>
   This month, a committee of the U.N. General Assembly has begun
considering changes that for the first time could provide a small
pension to some divorced spouses. For 20 years, the voting board,
currently 28 men and five women, that controls the $20 billion U.N.
pension fund had rejected all such proposals, even though pensions
have become a commonly divided divorce asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole rules and regulations of the pension fund,'' Ms.
Boernstein said, ``reflect a view of the world that went out after
World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   But the current proposal contains a catch. A spouse receives a
share of the pension only if her former husband, the employee,
agrees. Many of these women cannot even find their former husbands,
and few believe they would consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's like asking the American public if they want to pay
income taxes,'' said Suzanne Colt, a lawyer who represents several
U.N. spouses.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Audrey Camp Nekunam lives on the Bronx River Parkway in a
rent-stabilized apartment decorated with artifacts like a Persian
rug, Danish teak furniture, and a persimmon chest and a wooden
hatbox from Korea that reflect her life as a U.N. spouse. She lived
in a three-bedroom house in the Westchester community of Hartsdale
until 1972, when she returned home from an art class and discovered
her husband and half of their furniture gone.
</P>
<P>
   About a year later, she received a document from Iran notifying
her that her husband, Ali Nekunam, had been granted a divorce in
Tehran in her absence. The Iranian court had not awarded any
support for her.
</P>
<P>
   The $200-a-week support order she received from a Westchester
family court in 1973 was useless. Within months, her husband
transferred to another U.N. agency in Austria. He never paid
spousal support, nor did U.N. officials garnishee his pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had greater hopes for the U.N.,'' Ms. Nekunam said. ``We
joined the U.N. when it was young, and everybody had high hopes.
That's the last organization that should be against women. For
heaven's sake, what is the U.N. all about?''
</P>
<P>
   With no income or job experience, she rented out the house in
Westchester and worked as a textile artist in the garment district,
never earning more than $20,000 a year. Her husband occasionally
sent money to their three children while they were in school.
Without a pension, she survives today on a $320 monthly Social
Security check and the rent from her house, which she would not
disclose.
</P>
<P>
   Her former husband's lawyer in New York, Joseph Marro, called
Ms. Nekunam vindictive and said his client was an elderly retiree
living modestly off his pension in Vienna. U.N. records show that
Nekunam received a lump sum of $199,362 from his pension upon
retiring in 1982. He receives a monthly pension payment of about
$4,700, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Because Nekunam has lived abroad for 25 years, Marro contended
that New York courts did not have jurisdiction. Wednesday, Ms.
Nekunam learned that a Yonkers Family Court judge had vacated a
$70,000 judgment in her favor on the ground that the court did not
have jurisdiction. Marro also said both U.N. policy and New York
law protected his client's pension from any judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really a question of what is right or wrong,'' he
said. ``It's a question of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is above the law, in the eyes of Philip
Kamaras, a lawyer who took on the case of Marie Sall. Her husband,
Alione Sall of Senegal, is a staff member of the U.N. Development
Program, stationed in West Africa. In 1995, the couple divorced,
and court documents show that Sall fell behind on his monthly
support payments. U.N. records say Sall is paid about $102,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, a judge ordered a default judgment of $128,000
against him, but Kamaras could not garnishee his wages, and Ms.
Sall's financial situation worsened. Then, Kamaras said, Sall took
the two children to France under the pretense of a vacation but
instead enrolled them in school. If Ms. Sall were to leave the
United States, her visa would not allow her to return and she would
be unable to pursue her husband in court. But if she stayed, she
would not see her children.
</P>
<P>
   Kamaras says he has not seen Ms. Sall in months. He does not
know if she has left the country or if she is still in New York. (
Sall's former lawyer, Thomas Rome, declined to comment. Sall did
not respond to an attempt to get in touch with him via e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   Even though they are not U.S. citizens, foreign spouses like Ms.
Sall are allowed to file for divorce and support in New York. Many
of them do so because family court laws seem to offer them a better
chance of receiving a more advantageous settlement than the laws in
their own countries.
</P>
<P>
   One Middle Eastern woman said she followed her husband to
postings throughout that region, entertaining diplomats and royalty
at official functions she helped organize. Now, she lives alone in
a Salvation Army rooming house in Manhattan, abandoned without
support after 45 years of marriage. She said her husband is living
in Asia with another woman. She has won a support order against
him, but she has yet to receive any money. Still, she refused to
identify herself, not wanting to upset him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to antagonize him,'' she said. ``He is not
stupid. He did not make a proper divorce. At least now I have a
right to half his pension should he die before me.''
</P>
<P>
   For many women from foreign countries, the greatest fear is
deportation. Many want to stay in the country where they have lived
for decades, where they have established lives and raised children.
But while some manage to remain _ through sponsorship by U.S.-born
children or help from a sympathetic U.N. official _ others have no
such protection.
</P>
<P>
   So, some women remain married for little reason beyond fear of
divorce and its consequences.
</P>
<P>
   A 53-year-old woman from Western Europe says she lives ``in
limbo,'' as her husband of 30 years lives with another woman. She
has resided in the United States for 20 years, but because her visa
and work permit hinge on her marriage to a U.N. employee, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service would deport her within 60
days upon divorce.
</P>
<P>
   So she is careful not to disrupt the status quo, insisting on
anonymity for fear of upsetting her husband. She is reluctant to
return to Europe, because her children live in the United States.
Yet she does not qualify for Social Security. She has a job
teaching in a Roman Catholic high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the way it is now,'' she said, ``I feel I'm going
to have to work until I die in order to survive.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The elasticity of diplomatic immunity is not a new issue in New
York City, as anyone who remembers last year's uproar over unpaid
parking tickets can attest. Only the highest ranking U.N. officials
enjoy diplomatic immunity from civil lawsuits and criminal
prosecution. But because U.N. lawyers consider pay and pension as
immune assets belonging to the organization, all employees have de
facto immunity from salary garnishment. And pensions remain immune
after the employee leaves the United Nations, either for retirement
or another job.
</P>
<P>
   In October, another international agency, the World Bank,
amended its policies to allow many spouses to garnishee wages for
unpaid support. Between 1993 and 1997, the bank says, counselors
working with the agency reported handling about 100 cases involving
divorced couples in which financial support was an issue.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the United Nations has become more responsive to
complaints, particularly as spouses have become better organized
and outside scrutiny has increased. In recent years, Rep. Rick
Lazio, R-N.Y., has sponsored legislation in Congress on the
spouses' behalf. Today, the United Nations will not execute a court
order, but it will recognize one and pressure and cajole a
delinquent employee to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked very closely with the women involved,'' said
Rafiah Salim, an assistant secretary general for human resources
management. ``We have taken every possible step to, shall we say,
persuade people to pay up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Salim said a working group of about 10 officials was
completing a policy for handling these cases without canceling
immunity. She noted there are 185 member states in the United
Nations, each with different customs, attitudes and laws about
women and marriage. Often, she said, a spouse and an employee may
receive conflicting divorce decrees from different countries. The
laws of each must be weighed equally, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an American institution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Ms. Colt and Ms. Boernstein commend Ms. Salim's
office for acting in good faith, but neither is satisfied. They
want an ombudsman to act as a representative for spouses within the
organization. In a meeting last week with U.N. officials, they
again lobbied for the organization to garnishee wages. They say
persuasion is an ineffective tool for collecting unpaid debts,
particularly since the ultimate threat, dismissal, only deprives
the family of income.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that Ms. Nekunam has been paying closest attention to
lately is the pension. What Ms. Nekunam and other spouses want _ an
automatic pension share upon divorce, determined by the duration of
the marriage _ is a long way from what is proposed, a share granted
only with the permission of the employee. She has spent more than a
quarter of her life chasing her former husband. She said she simply
wants what is fair and what she is owed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave up a lot being married to him,'' she said. ``What is a
woman worth? Hire me as a chauffeur to take the kids to school.
Hire me as a nanny, as a cook, as a secretary to do the books. Hire
me to do all these things a woman does, and a man couldn't afford
me.''

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Edward Porter, R-Ill., is no friend of
Bill Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   But the 10-term moderate is one of a small though growing number
of Republicans who say they would vote against impeaching the
president, barring any new information in the inquiry against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get it over quickly, censure the president and let the new
Congress start with a clean slate,'' said Porter, one of five
Republicans who said in interviews that they would oppose
impeachment. ``This is an albatross around the neck of Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the high-stakes testimony from Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, before the House Judiciary Committee, many
House Republicans are expressing doubts and anguish over the
panel's inquiry, which the public overwhelmingly wants to end.
</P>
<P>
   With their party holding only an 11-vote margin that will
dwindle to six votes in the next Congress, it would take only a few
other Republicans among those who say they are wavering to kill any
chance of impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one Democrats voted for the Republican inquiry in
October, but the vast majority now say that, based on current
facts, they would not vote to impeach Clinton, whom Starr has
accused of obstructing justice by concealing his affair with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Porter, four other Republicans said they would
oppose impeaching the president: Peter King and Jack Quinn of New
York, Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Mark Souder of Indiana.
Shays told reporters Wednesday that there are ``conceivably 20
Republicans'' who would oppose impeaching Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana, who will succeed Newt
Gingrich as speaker, has reportedly made clear to Rep. Henry J.
Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that he wants the
investigation wrapped up before he takes over in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we can be certain of is that Bob wants to get on
with his agenda,'' said Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin, R-La., who is one
of Livingston's closest confidantes in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Even conservative Republicans who have signaled that they would
support impeachment, like Ron Packard of California and Mark
Sanford of South Carolina, concede that the House is unlikely to
impeach the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's appetite for stepping out on the impeachment plank
has substantially diminished,'' said Sanford.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment critics cite the Senate's almost-certain rejection
of any impeachment resolution, public opinion polls and the
mid-term elections as evidence that the inquiry is doomed on the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``To keep picking at this wound, knowing that nothing is going
to happen, I think is wrong,'' said Rep. Amo Houghton Jr., R-N.Y.,
who declined to say how he would vote.
</P>
<P>
   Souder, a two-term conservative, said, ``It's important to send
a signal to Chairman Hyde and the Republican leadership, they don't
have the votes. The public doesn't want impeachment, but our base
can't stomach his behavior. So it puts Republicans in a very
difficult position.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays added, ``If Republicans could rewrite history, we
certainly would have handled this differently. But it's out of the
box and now we don't know how to get it back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike these vocal opponents of impeachment, many Republicans
say they have been too busy, first with the mid-term elections and
then with Wednesday's leadership races, to pay attention to the
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the powerful chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said he has been wrestling with momentous
issues like taxes, Medicare and Social Security. What about
impeachment? ``You're out of my league,'' Archer said Wednesday.
``I haven't thought it through.''
</P>

<P>
   House Republicans say each new development in the investigation
seems to sink its chances to bring down Clinton. They point, for
example, to the 22 hours of conversations between Monica Lewinsky
and her erstwhile friend, Linda Tripp, that were released on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tripp tapes will be the final blow against Starr's case,''
said Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., who is undecided on impeachment.
``Americans will probably be repulsed by the tapes and anyone
aligned with Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, many Republicans say they wish the whole issue
would just go away. ``This is very difficult,'' said Rep. Dana
Rohrabacher, a conservative Californian and frequent critic of the
president. ``Most of us would rather not have to vote on this. But
we can't carve out an exception for the president for lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican disenchantment with impeachment reveals a gulf
between House Republicans in general and those on the Judiciary
Committee, who are for the most part more conservative than their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Hyde's insistence the committee will deal only with
impeachment, the dimming prospects for that outcome are fueling
efforts by other Republicans to devise alternatives, like censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more doors are opening to alternative solutions, and
the White House is listening,'' said Tauzin. ``Remember, the
Judiciary Committee was told to consider impeachment or any other
recommendation. They could recommend censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, like Shays, say censuring the president would
set a bad precedent. ``To censure or rebuke would open the door to
a censure of the week or censure of the month,'' Shays told
reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But other Republicans say the alternative route may be the only
one with enough support to pass the House. ``Given the fact there
aren't enough votes for impeachment, if censure is the only
available option, then that will be the option,'' said Sanford.
``It's the only one that has a chance of surviving.''

ECONOMIC SCENE: CONTROLLING CHEAP STEEL IMPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Asian, Latin American and Russian imports are pouring into the
United States, trapping the Clinton administration in an
embarrassing trade hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton promised to stop the ``flooding of
our markets'' with low-priced steel and other imports that he said
threatened U.S. workers. This week, he sent Vice President Al Gore
to Malaysia to preach open borders to a gathering of Asian-Pacific
countries, many of which are clawing their way out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently it is acceptable for Russia and other countries to
export their way to recovery as long as those exports do not land
in the United States. Clinton is right to seek protection from a
deluge of temporarily cheap steel imports. But there are good and
bad ways to go about this task. So far the administration has not
chosen wisely.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. steel manufacturers have accused Japan, Russia and Brazil
of ``dumping'' steel in the United States, or selling it for less
than it costs them to make it at home. But anti-dumping rules too
often amount to protectionism, shutting out legitimate exports and
provoking trading partners to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   The better course would be for the administration to exploit a
different provision of international trade rules, known as the
safeguard clause, which permits countries to impose quotas or
tariffs in order to block a sudden rush of cheap imports. That
would give the United States a principled and constructive way to
insulate workers from the temporary ravages of trade.
</P>
<P>
   The steel industry's complaints center on imports of hot-rolled
steel, which account for more than half of all steel products.
These imports are soaring in part because Japanese and Brazilian
mills are selling steel to the United States because buyers are
evaporating in neighboring countries mired in recession. Russian
steel is flooding America in part because the ruble has collapsed,
cutting the dollar price of Russian goods. The price of steel in
the United States has fallen by up to a third, and imports have
risen about 80 percent since last year. Layoffs have already
started.
</P>
<P>
   The steel industry's answer is to accuse Japan, Russia and
Brazil, which account for all of the explosive rise this year, of
dumping. The one-third price drop ``is out of bounds,'' said Keith
Busse, president of of Steel Dynamics Inc. of Indiana, one of the
12 companies that brought the dumping charges. ``Right is right and
wrong is wrong,'' he said, and ``import prices are crazy and will
take out not just inefficient producers.''
</P>
<P>
   But to many economists, invoking international anti-dumping
rules lies somewhere between a joke and protectionist fraud. The
Commerce Department, which determines whether dumping has occurred,
not only gets to decide what another country's costs are but also
gets to tack on a nifty profit.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Russia, the Commerce Department can determine
that its markets are too primitive to yield reliable cost estimates
and substitute figures based on higher production costs in, say,
Turkey. The process is designed to insure that the domestic
industry wins.
</P>
<P>
   An independent agency then decides whether the dumped imports
have caused the aggrieved industry ``material harm,'' a low
threshold. If the steel industry gets its way, the United States
will then impose prohibitive tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Americans' overuse of dumping charges is now taking a large
toll. The rest of the world is catching on to the charade. The
dumper now often claims to be the dumpee _ last year the United
States was a defendant in about as many cases as it was the
plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Start from first principles. Low-cost imports are a gift to U.S.
consumers if they can be expected to last. If foreigners want to
give us $2 worth of steel for $1 year in and year out, the country
would be foolish to turn down the largess. But if the
something-for-nothing is only temporary _ as is almost certain in
the current case _ then the gift can turn sour. The temporary
influx would trifle with the livelihoods of ordinary steelworkers,
throwing them out of work one year only to lure them back in
another. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is why international trade rules include a safeguard
clause. It allows nations to impose quotas or tariffs in an effort
to hold off a sudden rush of cheap imports. But the safeguard
clause is better tailored than anti-dumping rules to prevent abuse.
The safeguard clause can only be invoked temporarily and must be
phased out. An independent agency must determine that imports
impose ``serious harm'' to the domestic industry rather than merely
``material harm'' under the anti-dumping rules. And if
countermeasures are left in place for an extended period, then the
United States, in the steel case, would be required to compensate
Russia, Japan and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   That is the right principle. Americans protect their
steelworkers from needless ravage but do so in a way that minimizes
harm to suffering workers in Russia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is right to pursue relief for the domestic
steel industry. But how it pursues that relief also matters. If the
domestic industry successfully exploits anti-dumping rules in this
case, the semiconductor, apparel and scores of other industries
will follow suit. Then watch retaliatory measures take hold by
America's trading partners around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   The steel mills that brought dumping charges cannot be blamed
for resorting to a legal device stacked in their favor. But
Congress and the president are obligated to take a wider view.
Under the law, each can initiate use of the safeguard clause on
behalf of steelmakers. There is, despite the continuing dumping
case, still time.

   The company's decision to take on more debt to do that, though,
may not sit well with every investor. ``If interest rates were to
spike, I think CCE would be in serious trouble, just to make their
interest payments,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, at least one analyst is worried that price-cutting
in the next few months may further erode earnings. ``I didn't sense
that this significantly improving pricing environment is around the
corner,'' said Caroline Levy, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., who
took the stock off her recommended list Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Coca-Cola Enterprises' share price has bounced back.
Working in the company's favor was its inclusion in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index on Oct. 7. That alone pushed up the stock
price somewhat, since index funds had to add shares of Coca-Cola
Enterprises to their holdings. And, as the market in general has
risen back to early-summer levels, the company's share price has
gone up as well. Coca-Cola Enterprises stock closed at $38.0625 a
share Wednesday, down 93.75 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, even during the third quarter, there was at least one
new big buyer: Merrill Lynch Asset Management, which bought 2.9
million shares for $73.5 million. Morgan Stanley Asset Management
added 2.8 million shares to its holdings during the quarter as
well.
</P>
<P>
   The quarter's single heaviest session of trading came July 22,
the day Coca-Cola Enterprises released its second-quarter earnings
and let investors know the details of the capital-spending plan.
Trading volume, typically less than 1 million shares daily, soared
to 7,996,100 shares; the price dropped from $38.4375 to $35.3125.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people who invested in the company have become concerned
about the divergence between EBITDA and earnings,'' said Marc
Cohen, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs, referring to earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. ``While EBITDA is
growing, the big financial commitments they are making to expand
the business are causing real earnings measures, and most
importantly, free cash flow, to weaken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fabulous use of funds as long as there's money to
borrow,'' said Emanuel Goldman, an analyst for Merrill Lynch.

STUDY LINKS BONUSES TO DOCTOR DISCONTENT WITH HMOs  
(nk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Many California doctors say the bonuses and other
financial incentives that managed care organizations give them for
speeding up office visits and restricting care compromise the
quality of care, according to a survey of doctors reported
Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But, the survey added, when health maintenance organizations
include incentives based on patient satisfaction and quality, or
the theory that better care is often cheaper care, doctors believe
the quality does indeed improve, along with their satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal accounts of physician discontent with managed care are
commonplace, but The New England Journal's editor, Dr. Jerome P.
Kassirer, said this analysis, by a doctor-led group of researchers
at the University of California at San Francisco, breaks ground in
examining the link of financial incentives to such unhappiness.
</P>
<P>
   The article, ``Primary Care Physicians' Experience of Financial
Incentives in Managed Care Systems,'' is based on a survey
conducted two years ago of 766 primary care, office-based,
independent doctors who have HMO contracts and of salaried doctors
for California's big HMO, Kaiser Permanente.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the doctors _ pediatricians, internists,
family practitioners and obstetrical-gynecologists _ was 49, and an
average of 56 percent of their patients were members of HMOs. The
doctors' average annual salary is $130,000, which includes bonuses
and other incentives that typically accounted for 7 percent of
their pay, or $10,500.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, made up of 55 state
and local affiliates, saw the study less as a rebuke than as fodder
to support changes in the health care system that it has begun to
endorse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care is a work in progress,'' said Patrick Hayes, the
association's president and chief executive. ``There's no question
about our needing to reinvent managed care as it has been
implemented in the last 10 or 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The study does not try to establish whether the incentives have
led to an actual decline in the quality of care, but it warns that
they may.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In analyzing the survey, Dr. Kevin Brumbach, Dr. Andrew B.
Bindman and their team found that 38 percent of the doctors, or
291, were subject to financial incentives to control costs. These
included limiting referrals of patients to specialists, limiting
the use of hospitals and prescriptions and raising their
productivity by seeing more patients.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 291 doctors, the study said 28 percent ``reported that
they felt pressure to limit what they told patients about treatment
options.''
</P>
<P>
   A much higher proportion, 57 percent, felt pressured to restrict
their referrals, and a nearly a third of these doctors said the
pressure was severe enough to compromise the quality of care. And
75 percent of the doctors, or 575, said they felt pressured to see
more patients. A third of these doctors, too, said care was
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast two other incentives, quality and patient
satisfaction, pleased the doctors, particularly at Kaiser. Ten
percent of the office-based doctors and 31 percent of those at
Kaiser said the quality of care was an incentive. Patient
satisfaction was a criterion for 11 percent of the independent
doctors and for 45 percent of those at Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   The study added that the Kaiser doctors felt more pressure than
the independent doctors to see more patients, and faster. But it
also said that ``they were the least likely to report feeling
pressure to limit referrals or to restrict what they told patients
about treatment options.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Medical Association saw Wednesday's report of the
study as ammunition to force changes in laws governing HMO
contracts with provisions that the association says undermine good
care. On Tuesday, the California Department of Corporations
rejected an association petition urging the changes; within a week,
the association plans to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This state has gone from the leading edge in managed care to
the bleeding edge,'' said Dr. Jack Lewin, the association's chief
executive. ``Doctors are at this point burnt out.''
</P>
<P>
   Concluding a two-page editorial on discontent among doctors that
was based on the study, Kassirer of The New England Journal writes:
``There has been an undercurrent of unhappiness among physicians
for many years, but the complaints seem more widespread and
strident now. One thing we know: disgruntled, cranky doctors are
not likely to provide outstanding medical care.''

HARTFORD BOB? I DON'T THINK SO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The announcement came breathlessly Wednesday afternoon.
It sounded like the flip side version of ``The Midnight Ride of
Paul Revere.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of ``The British are coming!'' we were warned that ``The
Patriots are leaving! The Patriots are leaving!''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   Does anyone really think that &UR;  &LR; Bob Kraft _ a man with an ego
bigger than the Citgo sign in Kenmore Square _ wants to be owner of
the Hartford Patriots? Think he wants to be our football Harry
Frazee? Think he wants to stroll the dead streets of America's File
Cabinet, gladhanding the poor souls who could not support a major
league hockey team, the Forever .500 Whalers?
</P>
<P>
   I don't care what he signs or doesn't sign. Kraft knows that
Hartford, Conn. is a yahoo sports town. He knows moving to Hartford
means he'll immediately lose half of his Greater Boston fan base.
Patriot fans will drive to Providence, R.I., but thousands will
drop out before they make the 100-mile trek to the picturesque
intersection of Interstates 84 and 91.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Bob. Hartford? You can't do better than Hartford?
Hartford is populated by Jet fans and Giant fans. This is where you
want to build a fan base for the Patriots? Why not try New Haven or
Kennebunkport? Both are in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know him know that ``Live Shot'' Kraft can't stand the
anonymity of Hartford. He can't be Jerry Jones Jr. in Hartford.
Hartford has no mass media for him to cultivate. Hartford has no
Sunday night sports TV war, no big-time media consultants with
their own radio shows.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was willing to make his team worse because of his hatred
for Bill Parcells, but will he actually move it because of his
hatred for House Speaker Thomas Finneran?
</P>
<P>
   Don't the Hartford yahoos know they are being used? Again.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft no doubt will try to make Finneran the bad guy as he puts
the loaded gun to the head of state taxpayers. Finneran certainly
makes it sound like a personal matter when he tells the Salem
(Mass.) News, ``I'm going to give tax breaks to some fat-ass
millionaire and screw our kids?'' (The speaker said he was talking
about Oakland's Al Davis and Baltimore's Art Modell.)
</P>
<P>
   Is it personal?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard that repeated,'' said Finneran from his office
Wednesday night. ``I don't know if that's Mr. Kraft's
characterization. We've agreed to disagree. If it was personal, I
don't think you'd see a $52 million proposal sweetened to a $57
million proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   You may think Finneran is wrong. Many do. You may think he has a
personal agenda. Many do. But the speaker is prepared to take the
heat for Kraft's potential departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already been identified as the bad guy consistently for
the past two or three years,'' Finneran said, ``but when you ask
people what they admire in public leaders, they say they admire
those who articulate principles in the face of pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   How does he feel about being marked as the man who would drive
the Patriots out of Massachusetts?
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some who say that,'' said Finneran, ``but I
think many will say, `Thank God for people of conscience and people
of principle who won't flinch under pressure.' This is nothing but
economic bullying.''
</P>
<P>
   Finneran said he is disappointed by reports the team is leaving.
``I had been cautioned by people for many months and years not to
fool myself that there would be any reciprocity of loyalty between
fans and owners. These owners gouge our fans, overpay their
employees, then the solution is to turn to the taxpayer and say,
`Save us from ourselves.' It just doesn't pass a rational economic
analysis. To do what the owners request is to create precedent that
is very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker can be sanctimonious (the ``guardian at the gate''
comes to mind), and his words won't fly well on the sports pages.
But football fans tend to forget that there is a segment of the
population that favors Symphony Hall and the Museum of Fine Arts
over Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Will the Legislature revisit the issue when Kraft again folds
his paper house of Hartford?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said the speaker. ``We have never closed the
door up here. It's not my style, and I don't think it's appropriate
to say we'll never revisit this. The burden is on all of us to be
prepared to listen to other ideas. But the essential principle for
us is not to create precedent we can't live up to. When you ask
taxpayers to come into a partnership, you have to treat them as a
partner and not someone to be plundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope was that there'd be some type of reciprocity and that
the loyalty and commitment to the fans would be a factor. It
clearly has not been a factor. This has reduced itself to a Jerry
Maguire-type status.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Maguire didn't have the same hammer as Bob Kraft. Jerry
had only one wide receiver to shop. Kraft can say, ``Show me the
money!'' and threaten to move his team.
</P>
<P>
   But he won't. Just as Finneran won't be bullied or threatened,
Kraft won't be reduced to owning the Hartford Patriots. Hartford
doesn't cut it for King Kraft. He wants the citizens of
Massachusetts to kiss his ring. He wants to be Big Man on Campus in
(itals)Boston(unitals). Not Hartford.

TRAVEL AGENTS UP IN THE AIR OVER LATEST CAP ON COMMISSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A year after the nation's airlines angered travel
agents by cutting the commissions on domestic tickets, agents are
taking off -- this time as the carriers cap agents' cut for
overseas flights.
</P>
<P>
   In a cost-cutting move last week, Chicago-based United Airlines
changed the commission structure from an 8 percent base rate per
international ticket to an 8 percent rate capped at $100 for each
round-trip fare and $50 for one-way tickets.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, both American and Delta airlines followed suit --
and agents fear others will follow.
</P>
<P>
   It was bad enough when more than a dozen airlines last year
reduced commissions on domestic flights from 10 percent to 8
percent per ticket, said Lynn Solky, owner of Designer Travel in
suburban Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact is much greater now because the only way travel
agents stay in businesses is by doing international travel,'' Solky
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Commissions can be as high as, say, the $320 that Solky expected
to earn from a complicated, $4,000 international flight she
arranged Wednesday for a client.
</P>
<P>
   Had it been United, the maximum she could have earned was $100.
Losses like that would likely have to be passed on to customers in
the form of extra fees and charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fair for the consumer to pay so the airlines can save
$100 million. That's greed,'' Solky said.
</P>
<P>
   United spokesman Tony Molinaro said the move was intended to
prepare the airline for a possibly turbulent financial year ahead.
The Asian economic crisis, plus more competition from stronger
overseas airlines, are eating into the company's profits.
</P>
<P>
   United expects to save $100 million a year by imposing the cap.
The airline paid about $1.5 billion in commissions last year,
Molinaro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to control our costs to prepare for what could be a
challenging year next year, and commissions costs are our
third-largest expense,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Molinaro said he expects the savings to be pumped into service
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines officials on Wednesday would not comment on
the changes. Delta Airlines officials could not be reached for
comment late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Loucks, a spokesman for the American Society of Travel
Agents in Alexandria, Va., said consumers who balk at paying any
additional travel agency fees and turn directly to the carriers are
likely to miss out on any deals that other airlines may be
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how you slice it, the consumer will be paying more
for their airline tickets,'' Loucks said.
</P>
<P>
   The association is considering an antitrust suit against the
airlines, he said.

A FORT WORTH PAST IS IN SAX MAN'S `FUTURE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the 1940s in Fort Worth, and little Billy ``Tom'' Robinson
is sitting in a car, waiting for his dad, Ellis. Dad's a plumber;
he's in somebody's house, finishing a job or collecting money.
Whatever. Billy is studying people: the movement of their bodies,
the way they walk and the sway of their shoulders all suggest music
to him.
</P>
<P>
   Billy hears music everywhere (especially when mockingbirds
chirp; he's fascinated by how they never repeat themselves) and at
the Jamboree Dine and Dance, the little joint Mom and Dad run
downtown, where musicians come and go. During the day, Billy
sometimes goes inside to try his hand at boogie-woogie piano.
</P>
<P>
   Time passes, and Billy takes up the tenor saxophone, learns from
guys like Thomas ``Red'' Connors and Dewey Redman and Dallasites
James Clay and Buster Smith, keeps on listening to the mockingbirds
and watching people, keeps hearing melodies, starts to go out to
quiet places and play duets with the mockingbirds. He also notices
the colors of leaves in the fall; the different colors set against
one another, the different hues of yellow and green, suggest chord
changes, different intensities of sound.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to 1964, and Robinson has moved to San Francisco to try to
make it in jazz. There's a cave near a landmark called Seal Rock,
and that's where you can find him, far away from the smoky clubs
and the nascent hippie movement, practicing in the cave and
outside, on a cliff, experimenting with sounds and chord changes
all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Between then and now Robinson, 59, has played with legends
(Archie Shepp and Charles Mingus). He has also recorded several
solo CDs, the latest being this year's excellent ``A Short Turn to
the Future,'' which includes five of his own tunes and a version of
Duke Ellington's ``In a Sentimental Mood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Future'' is a rare treat for Fort Worth jazz fans, a gem of a
CD from a man who stands tall in the city's jazz history _ and
certainly deserves to be mentioned among such Cowtown sax titans as
Ornette Coleman, the late, great Julius Hemphill, Redman, and King
Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson isn't as well-known as those men _ not through any lack
of talent, but rather because he largely opted out of being in New
York, the epicenter of the jazz world. Robinson moved to Montreal,
Canada, in the early '70s, after marrying a Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   He liked it. Montreal and now Ottawa, where he has lived for
years with his second wife, are nice, safe places, and he took to
them. He taught jazz improvisation at two universities and has also
studied psychology, lectured, recorded, and played festivals and
universities; New York is a place to go now and then, not a place
to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about where you live,'' he says. ``It's about what
you have going on and keeping your family safe.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Robinson has merged his playing and his studies in
psychiatry at the University of Ottawa to develop a music-therapy
system he calls Audio-Neural Musichiatry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about how you can take records and manipulate the mind
with them, by duplicating mental processes and emotions with
voicings and tone textures and the dynamics of tones,'' he says.
``They can also affect the sense of equilibrium. You have a thought
memory and an emotional memory. When you play rhythms and melodies,
people relate to them in a balance sense. Music can stimulate your
sense of balance and cause you to remember emotional experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   A book Robinson wrote on the subject will, he says, be out next
spring. ``Future,'' however, is here now, and although you'll
probably have to order it to get it, it's well worth the search.
They say it's always a good idea to stop and smell the roses. Billy
Robinson has been doing it all his life, and listening to the
mockingbirds, too, refusing to hurry or worry about how famous he
might have been.
</P>
<P>
   And if he gets his way, he'll be bringing his music back to
Texas soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intentions are to come back to America and play more, by
all means,'' he says. ``I'm an American. I want to establish a
musical relationship with America. I want to establish a
relationship with my home state and my hometown.'' Dave Ferman,

TEAMS AWAIT DECISIONS BY FOUR SUPERSTARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eventually, one of the dominoes will fall first. It could be
Albert Belle. Or Bernie Williams. Or Mo Vaughn. Or Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   There is no 24-second clock forcing anyone to make a move until
they're good and ready. In the meantime, millions of dollars are
stacked like cordwood, waiting to be awarded like dowries at the
end of that peculiar mating ritual between free agent superstars
and the baseball teams coveting their services.
</P>
<P>
   These are courtships carried on in relative secrecy, especially
those in which the occupants of Yawkey Way are involved. So far,
the Red Sox have parted ways with Vaughn, made an offer to
Palmeiro, and put the full-court press on Belle. But as of last
night, they remained on hold on all fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman, the one free agent they have signed, was due in
town today for formal introductions with his new club.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Wednesday afternoon, the Red Sox had not made an
offer to Belle, but neither had their only rivals for the slugger's
services, the Yankees, who spent the day wooing free agent
outfielder Brian Jordan. And Jordan, a candidate to replace free
agent Bernie Williams as the Yankees' center fielder, emerged from
his meetings in Yankee Stadium, only to add to the confusion,
saying he'd been told repeatedly by Yankees officials that their
first priority was to re-sign Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, meanwhile, was supposedly planning to pay a visit to
Boston sometime this week, but neither his agent, Scott Boras, nor
club officials would confirm Wednesday whether a meeting has been
scheduled. Boras, who has not returned repeated phone calls to his
office, has been asked by general manager Dan Duquette not to talk
about his negotiations with the Sox. Team spokesman Kevin Shea gave
it his best ``I don't know'' response.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, Palmeiro Wednesday night was being wined and dined
by team owner Peter Angelos and GM Frank Wren as the Orioles
attempt to retain their 34-year-old first baseman, who offered to
have a similar meeting with the Sox but was told that wasn't
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   A Red Sox offer to Belle could come as soon as Thursday. CEO
John Harrington, the man who pulled the plug on Vaughn, must decide
whether he wants to pay Belle, who is earning $11 million a year
now (including his $5 million buyout on a five-year deal), an
average salary at least equal to the $13 million a year the Mets
are paying catcher Mike Piazza. Belle has three years remaining on
his deal with the White Sox and probably will want at least another
three years tacked onto that by the Red Sox, who were willing to go
no more than five years (plus an option) with Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, meanwhile, went another day without accepting the
Angels' six-year, $72 million offer. His agents have been talking
with that other team in southern California, the Dodgers, who need
to move some more salary before they can take on Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn and Palmeiro's destinies do not appear to depend on what
course Belle and Williams choose, but there's no doubt that what
Belle does, presuming he is the first to make a move, will define
the field better for Williams. The loser in the Belle sweepstakes
is almost certain to turn its attention to Williams.

LIVENT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY; OVITZ SUES DRABINKSY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Minn., Wash., Mass., Canada)  (mk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Livent Inc., the Broadway theater company, filed for bankruptcy
protection Wednesday, just six months after the company was taken
over by Michael Ovitz, once widely considered the most powerful
person in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ovitz, former president of Walt Disney Co.,
and his new management team filed a lawsuit against the company's
founders, the flamboyant impresario, Garth Drabinsky, and his
partner, Myron Gottlieb. The lawsuit accuses the two men of having
fraudulently misled Ovitz, who invested $20 million in Livent, by
hiding the fact that the company was losing millions of dollars on
its expensive productions of shows like ``Ragtime,'' ``Showboat''
and ``Phantom of the Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also contends that Drabinsky and Gottlieb had
fraudulently given themselves more than $7.5 million in
``kickbacks'' by funneling some of Livent's money to another
corporation in Toronto that Gottlieb owned.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and the company's new managers maintain that Drabinsky and
Gottlieb had ordered Livent's accountants to manipulate the
financial books so that more than $60 million of extravagant
spending on advertising, salaries for the shows' huge casts and
elaborate sets were hidden and never cut into the profits the
company reported in its financial statements. The lawsuit further
contends that to try to keep the matter covered up, Drabinsky and
Gottlieb went to Livent's senior financial executive and tried to
gain his cooperation in keeping the fraud hidden by offering him
greatly increased compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The company's severe financial straits are already taking a toll
on the many theater productions that the company now has in major
cities in the United States and Canada. On Tuesday night, the cast
of one of the company's productions of ``Ragtime,'' which has been
touring in the United States and is now playing in Minneapolis, was
told that the rest of the tour, including the many weeks of shows
scheduled for Seattle and Boston, had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the allegations, Drabinsky and Gottlieb, who were
suspended from their jobs in August and formally dismissed
Wednesday by the company's board of directors, said in a written
statement that Ovitz and Roy Furman, Livent's new chief executive
and a former Wall Street investment banker, were trying to blame
them for their own business decisions and miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb said they would vigorously defend
themselves against the company's allegations. In addition,
Drabinsky filed his own lawsuit against Ovitz, Furman and other
Livent executives charging that they had acted together ``in a
conspiracy to injure him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time that Drabinsky, 48, a man long known for
his artistic vision, abundant confidence and high-spending ways,
has built a sprawling entertainment company, only to be dismissed
because of accounting issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Drabinsky, a former entertainment lawyer, founded
Cineplex Odeon in Toronto and went on to build it into an
1,800-screen chain sprawling across the United States and Canada.
But in 1989, MCA, one of the company's big investors, dismissed him
in 1989 amid questions of aggressive accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb said in their statement Wednesday: ``This
is a sad day for live theater and a sad day for Livent
shareholders. New management is facing the consequences of their
actions of recent months. Rather than growing the company, they
have wasted resources on accountants and lawyers in a protracted
campaign to inflict injury to our reputations.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement continued: ``Instead of nurturing the creative
potential of the company, they have diminished it. Instead of
focusing on growing the company and building shareholder value,
they have relentlessly focused on descrediting us.''
</P>
<P>
   They added that Ovitz and Livent had filed the lawsuit against
them on the same day that the company filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act ``to
deflect attention from their own ill conceived decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The filing Wednesday in Manhattan will give the company many
months to reorganize its finances while it continues to produce
shows. With the protection from creditors that comes with filing
for a business reorganization under Chapter 11, Livent will not
have to make its scheduled payments of interest and principal on
almost $200 million of debt until it can renegotiate the terms with
its creditors. Now, the debt, which was mostly used to pay for the
construction of new theaters in New York, Chicago, Vancouver,
British columbia, and Toronto, is eating up most of the company's
cash, leaving the company unable to keep up with its daily
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The company is desperately trying to arrange some new short-term
financing so that it can meet its payroll and other day-to-day
costs.
</P>
<P>
   After months of delay, the company released corrected financial
statements Wednesday for 1996, 1997 and the first two quarters of
1998. They show that the company's entire equity has been eaten up
by its bills. That means that the company's debts are now greater
than the value of its theaters and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   The corrected statements were the first financial details that
Livent has publicly released since Aug. 10, when it announced that
it had discovered serious accounting irregularities and was
suspending Drabinsky and Gottlieb while it investigated the scope
of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lack of financial information, securities
regulators in both the United States and Canada suspended trading
in Livent's stock. It is not clear whether the regulators will now
let the stock trade again with the release of the corrected
financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the civil suits and countersuits, Livent is under
investigation by securities regulators in both the United States
and Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have begun a
criminal investigation into the company's activities.

WCC MAKES THE SWITCH TO WOOD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 &HT;     c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The West Coast Conference has decided to switch from using
aluminum bats to an NCAA-approved wooden composite bat for the 1999
season in a move that will affect the Pacific-10, Western Athletic
and Big West conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``What our presidents have decided,'' WCC commissioner Michael
Gilleran said on Wednesday, ``is that we're going to use a wood or
a wood composite bat. We're going to notify our nonleague
opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   In August, the NCAA Baseball Rules Committee voted to alter bat
specifications for the '99 season. That paved the way for
conferences to switch to bats made of wood or, like the WCC is
doing, wood composite.
</P>
<P>
   Safety was the main concern, although the abundance of scoring
in the College World Series _ capped by USC's 21-14 win over
Arizona State in the championship game _ also was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Gilleran said it was a ``prudent'' decision.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the New Jersey Athletic Conference, which announced
the switch to wood on Tuesday, WCC teams will no longer play teams
that use aluminum. That means Pepperdine and Loyola Marymount could
have games removed from their upcoming schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Loyola Marymount coach Frank Cruz said his players have been
using wooden Louisville Slugger bats during the fall-league season
and in practice. He said LMU has yet to order any of the wooden
composite bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially it's going to hit us,'' Cruz said. ``It's going to
make a dent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Muldoon, director of publicity for the Pac-10, said the
conference hasn't made a decision to drop aluminum. But it is a
move that seems to be imminent. Stanford baseball coach Mark
Marquess has spent the last week calling Pac-10 coaches about the
possibility of dropping aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   A UCLA baseball coach who didn't want to be identified said he
couldn't comment on the issue, even when he was asked if the Bruins
are using wooden bats in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Farrell, commissioner of the Big West, said that
conference hasn't made an official decision on switching to wood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're examining that possibility,'' he said. ``(The WCC
decision) obviously has a schedule impact for all the schools in
our conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hurd, a WAC associate commissioner who oversees baseball,
said the WAC is adopting a wait-and-see attitude toward dropping
aluminum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not addressed (switching to wood) from a league
standpoint,'' Hurd said. ``I don't know the time involved will
allow that happen (for the '99 season). We have discussed it, but
we never did adopt a conference policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The WCC's decision to drop aluminum is another blow for Van
Nuys-based Easton Sports, the nation's leading aluminum bat
manufacturer. Easton filed a $267 million restraint-of-trade
lawsuit against the NCAA on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Easton, the chairman for Easton Sports, has said that the
NCAA's safety concerns regarding aluminum bats are overblown.

CATHOLIC CHURCH IN CHILE ASKS FOR INQUIRY INTO PINOCHET-ERA
ABUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ As a panel of the House of Lords in London
decides the legal fate of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the Chilean Roman
Catholic Church is pushing to reopen an investigation into the
deaths and disappearances of activists during his regime.
</P>
<P>
   The move by Archbishop Francisco Javier Errazuriz of Santiago
has quickly attracted the support of a wide range of prominent
politicians. And while leaders have differing opinions about how
far a new investigation should go, the momentum building behind the
archbishop's proposal reflects how Pinochet's arrest in London last
month has made human rights an important issue in the 1999
presidential race now getting under way.
</P>
<P>
   Errazuriz has called for the reconvening of a 1991 Truth and
Reconciliation panel, also known as the Rettig Commission, which
identified more than 2,000 victims and detailed the circumstances
surrounding their cases.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report blamed the military and security forces
for the vast majority of the deaths, most of which occurred between
1973 and 1978, but stopped short of identifying the officers and
agents involved.
</P>
<P>
   Errazuriz has not said what he thinks the new commission's
mandate should be, and the fate of his idea may depend on whether
the Law Lords uphold a lower British court ruling and allow
Pinochet to return to Chile. A reversal could open the way for the
former dictator's extradition to Spain for him to stand trial on
charges of genocide and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Most political observers say it is virtually unthinkable that an
amnesty introduced by Pinochet while he was still in power could be
reversed, or that the former dictator will be stripped of the legal
immunity in Chile derived from his lifetime senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   But the possible identification of military officers involved in
killings, including senior officers still on active duty, would be
a dramatic departure from agreements made by civilians and Pinochet
aides during talks leading to democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with the archbishop on Tuesday, Andres Zaldivar,
the president of the senate and the leading presidential candidate
of the governing Christian Democratic Party, said a new commission
could shed light on the guilty and comfort families of the
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know where the bodies are, and we need justice,''
Zaldivar said. ``The Rettig Commission was a step forward, but we
have to go much deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   More surprising was the support given to the commission proposal
by Sebastian Pinera, a former senator who is the presidential
candidate of the conservative National Renovation Party, which
includes many members who served in the Pinochet regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is the disappeared,'' Pinera said in an interview
Wednesday. ``We have to do our best to find the bodies and return
them to their families.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it would be unwise for a future commission to
identify guilty officers, adding: ``That would only set a new fire.
It's like in a marriage in which a wife and husband have been
unfaithful but want to get back together again. How useful is it
for them to know every single fact?''
</P>
<P>
   Leftist politicians generally welcomed the archbishop's
proposal.

AS HEARING OPENS, VOTE EXPECTED TO WIDEN SCOPE OF INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER AND MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With high drama and potentially grave consequences,
a bitterly divided House Judiciary Committee will open hearings
Thursday on possible impeachable offenses stemming from President
Clinton's sexual affair with a former White House intern and other
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr is scheduled as the only
witness, presenting his case against the president. According to an
advance copy of his testimony, Starr will allege Clinton ``misused
his authority and power as president'' to stymie Starr's
far-ranging grand jury investigation and the recently settled
sexual-harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Corbin Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's partisan clashing grew increasingly hostile
Wednesday night as they wrangled over a Republican decision, in the
final hours before Starr was scheduled to appear, to expand the
scope and duration of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Committee &UR;  &LR; Chairman Henry J. Hyde issued a list of future
witnesses, including White House deputy counsel Bruce R. Lindsey,
one of Clinton's closest confidants, and Robert Bennett, Clinton's
lawyer in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The move was assailed by committee Democrats as a ``fishing
expedition'' with the makings of ``a gotcha game.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr, a lightning rod for critics who have accused him of
trying to bring down Clinton over a private, consensual affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky, intends to testify that the case against the
president ``is not a private matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence further suggests that the president ... misused
his authority and power as president and contravened his duty to
faithfully execute the laws,'' Starr plans to say, according to his
prepared testimony. ``That too is not a private matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Starr hearing will be a pivotal passage in the proceedings,
as Clinton's foes and supporters jockey before a Congress that is
wary of the volatile case and a public that polls show is weary of
the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice before in the nation's history has a president been
the target of a congressional impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   However, the panel's GOP majority is expected to prevail
Thursday when the committee votes on whether to issue subpoenas for
Lindsey, Bennett, and two individuals who are familiar with former
White House volunteer Kathleen Willey: Democratic fund-raiser
Nathan Landow and Willey's lawyer, Daniel Gecker. Willey has
accused Clinton of groping her near the Oval Office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The new witnesses were expected to be questioned first in
private depositions, according to the Associated Press. Republicans
would then decide whether to summon them, or additional witnesses,
at public hearings, committee officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gecker and Landow are expected to be called early next
week, followed by Lindsey and Bennett during the first week of
December, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prepared testimony includes detailed arguments to
support his claim that there is ``substantial and credible''
evidence that Clinton committed 11 impeachable offenses stemming
from the Lewinsky matter, including perjury, witness tampering, and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short,'' Starr plans to say, ``the evidence suggests that
the president repeatedly used the machinery of government and the
powers of his office to conceal his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky from the American people, from the judicial process in the
Jones case, and from the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   With Hyde's approval, Starr plans to range beyond the Lewinsky
and Willey episodes to discuss the Whitewater real estate deals,
the improper use of FBI files by White House political operatives,
the firing of White House travel office personnel, and allegations
that Clinton's friend, Webster L. Hubbell, may have accepted ``hush
money'' to shield the president from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans said they are expanding the inquiry to
support Starr's contention that Clinton has engaged in a pattern of
deception beyond the alleged coverup of his illicit affair with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said it appeared the
Republicans were off on an unfair, unconstitutional ``partisan
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have rediscovered all of their old bad habits and since
they don't like where it's going, they're going to try to find
something else,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde acknowledged the widening gulf between the two sides. ``The
Democrats want to stick to Monica Lewinsky,'' he said. ``We want to
look at everything. That's the big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In lurching toward looking at ``everything,'' Hyde risks
inciting the wrath of a growing number of House Republicans who
favor swiftly ending the proceedings and sanctioning Clinton short
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde, who has said he hopes to resolve the impeachment issue
by the end of the year, blamed the White House in part for
prolonging the inquiry. He said Clinton's lawyers could have
expedited the process by admitting in a sworn affidavit to the
allegations in Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said lawyers have yet to complete
answers to 81 questions from Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some cooperation from them is very desirable,'' Hyde said.
``It would be helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Democrats, who are poised to counterattack Hyde and
Starr in the nationally televised hearing, expressed outrage at the
Republican move to broaden the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat who sits
on the Judiciary Committee, said the move was ``nothing less than a
desperate attempt to resuscitate a failing effort to impeach the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   Meehan called it a ``a recipe for a protracted inquiry, which is
exactly what the American people don't want.''
</P>
<P>
   For Starr, whose favorable rating in the most recent public
opinion poll was only 18 percent, Thursday's hearing poses the
biggest test of his career as he tries to make his case in a
two-hour speech before the committee. Starr then faces questioning
from the 37 committee members, including some Democrats who hope to
turn the hearing into an examination of Starr's tactics.
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles F. C. Ruff said the president's
legal team would abide by a Republican-controlled schedule that
gives him 30 minutes to question Starr, although Ruff said in a
letter to the committee that the restriction ``is not consistent
with the standard of fairness that the committee has sought to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself was thousands of miles away on a trip to Asia.
Privately, White House officials expressed confidence that Clinton
would emerge relatively unscathed, noting that Starr is on the
defensive and that Republicans are so divided that they are ousting
House Newt Speaker Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Starr sent a report to Congress that said Clinton
may have committed impeachable offenses in the Lewinsky case, in
which the president denied under oath that he had a sexual
relationship with the former intern. When Lewinsky later testified
that she had oral sex with Clinton, the president said his denial
had been ``legally accurate'' but acknowledged that his
relationship with Lewinsky was ``wrong.''

STARR TO CITE PATTERN OF OBSTRUCTION; WIDENING INQUIRY SEEN
</HEADLINE>
   (htv) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, will insist
in the House impeachment hearings on Thursday that President
Clinton not only obstructed justice by covering up his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, but repeatedly threw up ``roadblocks and hurdles''
that slowed the prosecutor's other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr's prepared testimony for the House Judiciary
Committee's first hearing was made public Wednesday night, Rep.
Henry Hyde, the chairman, announced that Republicans would supboena
four new witnesses in the investigation of Clinton amid signs that
the committee majority is now seeking to broaden the inquiry far
beyond the Lewinsky matter to show a larger pattern of obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also sought a Justice Department report on campaign finance
investigations concerning Clinton, and the department indicated it
was likely to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared statement, Starr ran through a litany of the
investigations he has conducted since he was first charged with
examining the president's failed Whitewater real estate venture,
and said ``The pattern of obstruction of justice, false statements,
and misuse of executive authority in the Lewinsky investigation did
not occur in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained, ``We have been forced to go to court time and
again to seek information from the executive branch and to fight a
multitude of privilege claims asserted by the administration _
every single one of which we have won.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Starr announced in his prepared testimony
that his investigations have exonerated the Clinton administration
from any wrongdoing in the firings of seven employees in the White
House travel office and into whether White House officials used
confidential FBI files.
</P>
<P>
   As for Whitewater, Starr said he had drafted an impeachment
referral in late 1997 that outlined allegations that Clinton had
testified falsely at the trial of Jim McDougal and Jim Guy Tucker.
But Starr said he never sent the referral because he said the
evidence did not meet the standards required.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Starr's testmony dealt with the Lewinsky matter, on
which he refered 11 potential articles of impeachment to the House
in September. Starr summed up his view of the president's hostility
to his investigation in these terms:
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next several months, it became apparent that the
strategy to win had many prongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the president denied the truth publicly and
emphatically. Second, he publicly promised to cooperate with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, the president deflected and diverted the investigation
by telling aides false stories that were then relayed to the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourth, he refused invitations to testify to the grand jury
for over six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifth, his administration delayed the investigation through
multiple privilege claims, each of which has been rejected by the
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth, surrogates of the president attacked the credibility
and legitimacy of the grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventh, surrogates of the president attempted to convince the
Congress and the American people that the matter was unimportant.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Republicans wanted to take depositions from Bruce
Lindsey, the Clinton confidant who is deputy White House counsel
and from Robert Bennett, Clinton's private attorney in the sexual
harassment case brought by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He said the committee would also question Daniel Gecker, the
lawyer for Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer who has said
the president made a sexual advance to her, and Nathan Landow, a
Democratic developer and fund-raiser close to the White House who
counseled Ms. Willey on whether she should testify in the Jones
case.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's 1996 campaign finance practices, Hyde wrote to
Attorney General Janet Reno, seeking unrestricted access to a
memorandum from Charles LaBella, the former top prosecutor for
campaign finance abuses, in which he recommended that an
independent counsel be named to investigate the president and Vice
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, obtained by The New York Times, Hyde said that
because he wanted to wrap up his impeachment inquiry expeditiously,
``I do not believe that the committee can or should wait for you to
finish your preliminary inquiry of possible crimes of the president
or your campaign finance investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde once again said that he intended to finish his
investigation by the end of the year. But Democrats and the White
House accused the Republicans of ranging far beyond Starr's charges
of 11 possible impeachable offenses in the Lewinsky case and of
trying to start a battle over attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to pick a partisan food fight they've been
reduced to picking up Ken Starr's leftovers,'' said Jim Kennedy. a
White House spokesman. ``They are even trying to out-Starr Starr by
breaching the attorney-client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is an impeachment in search of a crime, and
in another 48 hours we will be reopening the Vincent Foster case,''
said James Jordan, the spokesman for Democrats. And Rep. Martin
Meehan, a committee Democrat, said the fast-moving events meant
``this is going to be a long involved process.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Justice Department officials said that the department is
likely to cooperate with Hyde's request for the memo written by
LaBella. It must first, however, obtain judicial approval to
disclose grand jury informaiton in the report. The Justice
Department could go to court to seek permission as early as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The activity and partisan positioning came on Wednesday, a day
before Starr will take center stage before Congress, set free for
the first time in his four year investigation of the president to
give a wide-ranging public presentation of his case against the
president. In his prepared testimony, obtained Wednesday night,
Starr argued that his case against Clinton has nothing to do with
sexual liaisons and he protested that his office had taken no
pleasure in investigating the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The propriety of a relationship is not the concern of our
office,'' Starr says in his written statement. ``No citizen who
finds himself accused in a sexual harassment case, or in any other
kind of case, can lie under oath or otherwise obstruct justice, and
thereby prevent the plaintiff from discovering evidence and proving
her case.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conclusion of his prepared statement, Starr subtitled the
final section ``Reflections.'' In it, he defended the work of his
office over nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lewinsky investigation, Starr said neither he nor his
staff ``relished'' the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff and I agree with the sentiments expressed by Chairman
Hyde in the Nov. 9 hearing when he said, `I'd like to forget all of
this,''' Starr said, adding: ``I mean, who needs it?''
</P>
<P>
   He also detailed his legal background, dating back to his
position as a law clerk in 1973 and attempted to joke about his
lack of political acumen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person is, of course, deeply affected by his or her
experiences,'' Starr said. ``For my part, my experience is in the
law and the courts. I am not a man of polls, public relations, or
politics, which I suppose is obvious at this point. I am not
experienced in political campaigns.''

WARREN DOWNPLAYS SEAHAWKS REUNION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys running back Chris Warren's former
teammates check on him occasionally with long-distance phone calls.
Cortez Kennedy wants to know how he likes Dallas. Darryl Williams
and Michael Sinclair call up to chat about life.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, Warren said, rarely turn to how or why his eight-year
career with the Seattle Seahawks came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, with the Cowboys playing host to the Seattle
Seahawks on Sunday, Warren must relive his final days in Seattle.
It's OK. He understands that people want to know if he harbors any
bitterness toward his old team, if he has circled Nov. 22 in red on
his calendar, if he is looking for revenge against the club that
did not re-sign its all-time leading rusher.
</P>
<P>
   His answers?
</P>
<P>
   No, no and no.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, they wanted a change,'' Warren said yesterday. ``I was
out. Ricky \RWatters\S was in. It's something you have to respect
and be professional about. If I was bitter, that would take away
from my game and it'd be falling right into their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson would not discuss the details
that led to the change. But Erickson said he has watched Warren
this year and is ``happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris Warren did a lot of things for this franchise and for me
personally,'' Erickson said. ``I know him well, and I think he will
come out and play a good game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said he doesn't expect Warren to play
more than usual. Warren will spell starter Emmitt Smith, and he'll
return kickoffs. He might return punts in place of Deion Sanders,
who has a sprained big toe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, ``a 100-yard game would be incredible,'' Warren said. ``But
I'm not putting my eggs in that basket.''
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Two players with sprained big toes, Sanders and center Clay
Shiver, did not practice yesterday. Sanders is expected to start
Sunday, coach Chan Gailey said, but Shiver might be sidelined for
the second consecutive game. Right guard Everett McIver returned to
practice yesterday for the first time since spraining his right
knee Oct. 4. Gailey said he will wait until at least Friday to
announce who will start, McIver or rookie Flozell Adams. Cornerback
Kevin Smith practiced and showed no ill effects from a separated
left shoulder.

A GENE IS LINKED TO DEAFNESS IN ASHKENAZI JEWS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have identified a gene that is a major cause of
inherited deafness among Ashkenazi Jews, a group that includes 90
percent of the 6 million Jewish people in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery does not mean that deafness is any more common in
Jews than in other people. In the general population, including
Jews, roughly 1 in 1,000 children is born deaf, half from
hereditary deafness. The new research simply identified a
particular genetic mutation, that is more common among deaf Jewish
people than among deaf people from other backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is one of a series of recent advances that make it
possible to offer genetic tests to help people determine why they
are deaf, and to confirm a diagnosis of deafness in infants too
young for hearing tests.
</P>
<P>
   But the research is controversial, because it means that fetuses
can also be tested, raising the possibility that some parents might
choose abortion rather than give birth to a child who cannot hear.
In addition, some Jewish people fear that genetic studies involving
Jews will stigmatize them by creating the false impression that
they are more prone than others to hereditary disease.
</P>
<P>
   In the report being published Thursday in the New England
Journal of Medicine, scientists studied deaf and hearing members of
three large Ashkenazi Jewish families, two from the United States
and one from Belgium. Ashkenazi Jews are descended from ancestors
in Eastern and Central Europe. The deafness in the families was
``nonsyndromic,'' meaning that it was not associated with any other
abnormal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by scientists from the National
Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, Louisiana
State University, Michigan State University, the University of
Antwerp, Belgium and New York University.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers went to great lengths to preserve the patients'
anonymity, concealing the cities they were from and even altering
some features of the family trees published in the medical journal.
Some family members worried that if it became known that their
children might carry genes for deafness, it would be hard to
arrange marriages for them, which is the custom among some Orthodox
Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers looked for mutations in a gene called connexin
26, which was identified in 1997 and linked to 50 percent or more
of cases of inherited deafness in Italy and Spain. The gene, which
directs the production of a protein that makes up part of the inner
ear, is recessive, meaning that carriers, who inherit just one
defective copy from a parent, have normal hearing. But those with
two flawed copies, one from each parent, have moderate to profound
hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   The connexin 26 gene was also affected in the Jewish patients,
but many had a different mutation from those in the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the scientists looked for the new mutation in blood
samples from 551 Ashkenazi Jews from New York, and also in other
whites, blacks and Asians in the United States, and a group of
patients from France. They found it in 4 percent of the Ashkenazi,
but in none of the other groups.
</P>
<P>
   They also looked for the first connexin mutation, which turned
up in 3.2 percent of Spaniards and Italians, 0.58 percent of whites
and 0.73 percent of Ashkenazi Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bronya Keats, a geneticist at Louisiana State University who
participated in the study, said a test for the gene would probably
become available next year.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bloch, executive director of the National Association of
the Deaf in Silver Spring, Md., wrote: ``We applaud the great
strides made through genetic identification research, however, we
do not condone the use of such information for eugenics and related
purposes.'' Ms. Bloch, who is deaf, sent her comment by e-mail.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Berlin said that he and his colleagues hoped to continue their
studies of inherited deafness in Ashkenazi Jews. But some are
troubled by such research. Rabbi Moshe David Tendler, a professor
of medical ethics at Yeshiva University in New York, said, ``It's
giving the impression that the Ashkenazi community is the
repository of all bad genes.'' Tendler said he considered genetic
testing for individuals acceptable, but screening of populations to
find the incidence of a gene amoral, and potentially a source of
employment and insurance discrimination against Jews.
</P>
<P>
   An Orthodox Jewish organization in Brooklyn, Dor Yeshorim, has
received requests for genetic testing from families in which
deafness occurs, said the organization's director, Rabbi Josef
Ekstein. The goal of the group is to provide testing to young
people before they even begin dating, to help them avoid marriages
that might produce children with severe genetic diseases. Ekstein
said he was not sure yet whether Dor Yeshorim would offer testing
for deafness genes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kathleen Arnos, a medical geneticist at Gallaudet
University, a college for the deaf in Washington, said that the
university has offered free testing for the first connexin mutation
since last spring, and she expected that Gallaudet would also test
for the second one among Ashkenazi Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Arnos said that many deaf people find genetic tests
threatening, and think prenatal diagnosis will be used to eliminate
future generations of deaf children.
</P>
<P>
   ``But a lot are excited to get personal information about why
they're deaf,'' Dr. Arnos said. Many are also interested in finding
out the odds of their children being deaf. Some have even expressed
an interest in finding spouses with the gene to make sure their
children will be deaf. Still others want children who can hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest group is in the middle and doesn't care either
way,'' Dr. Arnos said.

BOEING EXPORTS TRIM U.S. TRADE DEFICIT

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton left for Japan Wednesday
declaring that ``our workers and our farmers pay the price'' for
declining U.S. exports to Asia, the Commerce Department reported
trade figures suggesting that the price is not rising as quickly as
many feared.
</P>
<P>
   Shipments abroad of Boeing Co. aircraft nearly doubled,
narrowing the September trade deficit to $14 billion, down nearly
$2 billion from a record monthly deficit in August. But the plane
sales appeared to be a one-time statistical oddity, and the overall
figures showed that the huge falloff in exports to the Pacific Rim
_ combined with growing imports of steel, toys and electronics _
were beginning to take a larger toll on jobs and corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   The figures underscored the political imperatives behind the
dual messages that Clinton is expected to deliver in Japan and
South Korea: that the United States wants to help the Asian
economies, but not at the cost of absorbing more and more of their
products.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slight improvement in the recent month's figures,
for the first nine months of 1998 the U.S. trade deficit has been
running about 50 percent higher than it was a year ago, when the
Asian crisis was in its early months. That widening deficit poses
what Secretary of Commerce William Daley recently called ``a
political problem of enormous magnitude.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Clinton said: ``Nothing is more important to
restoring stability and growth in Asia than efforts to restore
Japan's economy. But it has been stalled for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time he cited South Korea's giant
conglomerates, the chaebol, saying that their resistance to
economic liberalization had to end.
</P>
<P>
   In both Tokyo and Seoul, Clinton's aides say, he will raise the
subject of soaring shipments of foreign steel to the U.S. market,
an issue that has mobilized unions and steelmakers alike. The
companies point to a first wave of layoffs in the steel industry as
an indicator of what will happen to other U.S. industries as the
full effects of the Asian crisis begin to be felt broadly in
American manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the import explosion here has yet to really
occur,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global economist of Primark
Decision Economics in Boston. ``The aircraft-export days are
numbered for us. And when the Asian economies begin to do better
with their production, the flood of cheaper imports will be
noticeable, even on lean-and-mean American companies.''

   To be sure, cheaper imports also offer advantages for U.S.
consumers and companies. They lower the cost of production,
particularly for automakers and construction companies that can buy
parts or steel more cheaply. Many are now searching the world for
such deals, gradually relying on more foreign suppliers. That often
contributes to restraints in prices, allowing the kind of
interest-rate cuts that the Federal Reserve announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The figures released Wednesday show how much of the current
trade problem is rooted in Asia. The deficit with China for
September, $5.9 billion, is larger than that with Japan for the
month, $5.1 billion. Together, the two countries have surpluses in
the trade of goods with the United States amounting to nearly $89
billion since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   American car exports to Japan _ the subject of the Clinton
administration's big confrontation with Tokyo three years ago _
amounted to $79 million in September, and $709 million since the
beginning of the year. These paltry results provide vivid evidence
of how the economic downturn has wiped out any advantages from the
1995 agreement with the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   After Asian nations, the biggest trade deficits were with Canada
and Mexico, the two other members of the North American Free Trade
Agreement, totaling a little more than $6 billion for September,
and $24.4 billion since the beginning of the year. The United
States continues to run a small surplus with Brazil, which received
a $41.5 billion IMF bailout last week. Trade with Brazil, however,
is expected to turn into deficit as the Brazilians slip deeper into
recession.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said that exports in September increased
to $77.1 billion, from $75.4 billion in August, but the entire
difference was attributed to the aircraft sales.
</P>
<P>
   Imports edged down to $91.2 billion from $91.3 billion in
August.

CHINA TO DEPORT FOREIGN REPORTER, SECOND IN A MONTH  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China Wednesday expelled a reporter for the German
news magazine Der Spiegel, one day after eight officials burst into
his office and accused him of possessing secret documents. The
reporter, Juergen Kremb, said he was told he must leave China
within 48 hours and could not return for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Last month another foreign reporter, from the Japanese newspaper
Yomiuri Shimbun, was also charged with possessing state secrets and
was deported.
</P>
<P>
   Both reporters denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   In China almost any political or economic information that has
not been published in the state media or announced by a senior
official can be defined as a state secret, giving the authorities a
ready tool for attacking people seen as opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Both recent cases involved reporters who have angered security
agencies with their reporting on human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kremb, 41, has reported in China for seven years. He is the
author of a recent biography of Wei Jingsheng, the prominent
democracy advocate who was sent from prison into exile in the
United States last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Kremb was detained for two days when he visited Wei's
family in Anhui Province. In a spottily enforced rule, journalists
are supposed to obtain the permission of provincial authorities
before conducting interviews anywhere in China.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer Kremb began working in Singapore, but he was in
Beijing this week in the latest of several reporting trips before
his official accreditation and visa to work here as a journalist
expire at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Kremb said the agents who raided his office pushed him roughly
against a wall and read loudly from a document accusing him of
violating the law. They searched the office for three hours, then
confronted him with what they said were secret papers he held, and
demanded that he sign a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Kremb said he had refused to sign, and suggested that the
officers might have planted evidence. ``I was shown documents but
refused to touch or even read them,'' he told the Reuters news
agency. ``I haven't been in my office for a long time and I don't
even know if they were mine.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, the Chinese foreign ministry said,
``Mr. Kremb illegally possessed secret Chinese documents in
violation of the law.'' The security agents lawfully searched
Kremb's office, the statement said, ``found a large amount of
evidence and ordered him to leave China.''
</P>
<P>
   The German foreign ministry said it had complained about the
treatment of Kremb to the Chinese ambassador in Bonn.

PRESSURE IS OFF BONILLA, THE SECOND TIME AROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In one breath, he insists he has learned from his mistakes and
has not only matured, but also changed. In the next breath, Bobby
Bonilla says, ``I'm the same guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Complex as ever, Bobby Bo is officially back home, even if Shea
Stadium in Flushing, Queens, is one borough from his native Bronx
and half an hour from his home in Greenwich, Conn. The question now
is, are the New York Mets truly ready for Bonilla's return?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets hope they are, and they welcomed him back Wednesday
with a news conference at Shea. But Bonilla's return wasn't the
only news of the day as the Mets kept busy on the free-agent front.
</P>
<P>
   _ They re-signed valuable left-handed reliever Dennis Cook for
three years at $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ They quickly revised their initial offer to free-agent
outfielder B.J. Surhoff from three years at $12.75 million to three
years with an option for a fourth in a deal that could be worth as
much as $17.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ They seemed to be backing off their pursuit of free-agent
outfielder Brian Jordan, who visited with the Yankees Wednesday.
Jordan is supposed to meet with the Mets Thursday but seems to be
leaning toward signing with the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that the bigger news of the day was the
re-signing of Cook, who was probably the most consistent member of
the bullpen last season. Or the Mets' intensified pursuit of
Surhoff, which is why they are probably shying away from Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But the cameras and the questions belonged to the 35-year-old
Bonilla, who was reacquired by the Mets last week to play right
field and give Mike Piazza some protection in the middle of the
lineup. As usual, Bonilla did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he said he did not think he was a controversial
person. ``But,'' he quickly added, ``controversy just seems to
follow me and I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason might be that Bonilla cannot keep himself from
talking, something he basically admitted Wednesday. Indeed, even as
he arrived at Shea, he was being hounded by another annoying
controversy, this one involving his negative remarks about Tommy
Lasorda, which The Los Angeles Times reported on Monday. Bonilla
said he was going to phone Lasorda (who happens to be Mets Manager
Bobby Valentine's mentor) and apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Who says you can't go home again?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bonilla, for one, said he would not have changed a thing during
his stormy initial tenure with the Mets from 1992-95, when he was
expected to be the centerpiece of the team for years but never
exceeded 34 homers or 87 runs batted in for a season. He learned
not only about himself, he said, but about his hometown as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to laugh at myself,'' he said, referring to one
tabloid cartoon that portrayed him in diapers. ``No matter what
anybody writes.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe there was one thing he would have changed, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said something at that first press conference that I
shouldn't have said,'' Bonilla said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   He was obviously referring to the quip he made about how no one
would be able to wipe the smile off his face, the one that came
with Bonilla _ who had just become the highest-paid player in the
game _ from Pittsburgh to New York.
</P>
<P>
   That Bonilla is not nearly the highest-paid player on his team
now is one reason the Mets think his second stay will be much
easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the situation is different will be a plus,''
said General Manager Steve Phillips, who presided over the news
conference on his second full day back after an eight-day leave of
absence. ``Before, he was the highest-paid player.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with that, Phillips said, came expectations. And added to
that, Phillips said, was the way Bonilla behaved. Or, as some might
say, misbehaved.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hope is he blends in more this time,'' Phillips said.
``There aren't the same expectations. And now we have other quote
makers on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Bonilla will play in the outfield for the
Mets, even though Valentine said there was a remote possibility he
could also be used at third base. When asked about his defensive
ability, Bonilla said, ``I hope when it comes up, I can catch it
when it's on its way down.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought a high-five from Valentine because it was a
reference to a comment Valentine had made during the initial news
conference to announce the trade. At that time, Valentine was
talking about the risk and reward of obtaining Bonilla _ the reward
having to do with Bonilla's offensive prowess, the risk coming with
his oft-maligned glove.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Wednesday about where he would prefer to play,
Bonilla said, ``In the lineup somewhere, as long as it ain't as the
designated hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Mets play in the National League, that
brought laughs, and recognition that Bonilla was referring to a
controversy during his days in Baltimore, when he and Oriole
Manager Davey Johnson disagreed on where Bonilla should play.
</P>
<P>
   Once Johnson became the manager in Los Angeles this off-season,
Bonilla _ who played hurt in 1998 _ pretty much knew his days there
were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my chances were limited in L.A.,'' said Bonilla, who
hit just .237 with seven homers and 30 runs batted in for the
Dodgers in 72 games after he was traded from Florida in the deal
that sent Piazza away from Los Angeles on May 15. ``But I didn't
know it would be that quick.''
</P>
<P>
   That it was back to the Mets came as something of a surprise to
Bonilla, who was dealt by the Dodgers for the Mets' underachieving
reliever Mel Rojas. Bonilla's initial reaction when he learned of
the trade while on a trip to Mexico?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little reserved,'' Bonilla said. ``I was excited, but
then I pulled back. I have a 10-year-old and a 5-year-old. And
you've got to be careful. It affects them more than you. And I know
how it is here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because Bonilla has been through all this before.

FOR MANY DIGITAL HARD HATS, IT'S MICROSOFT, RIGHT OR WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Nev., Va.)  (bl) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Just as President Richard M. Nixon found support
among construction workers during the Vietnam War, it is here in
the PC-filled aisles of the Microsoft Partners Pavilion at the
heart of the sprawling Comdex computer trade show that Microsoft
Corp.'s besieged chairman, Bill Gates, finds his staunchest
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nixon's defenders, whose rallying cry was ``My country,
right or wrong,'' many of these digital hard hats today say that
Gates was the victim of a conspiracy. His enemies, they say,
competitors who have lost in the marketplace, turned to the
government to save them when their products failed.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in federal court in San Jose, Calif., Gates' Internet
strategy of ``embrace and extend'' _ in other words, to add
Microsoft-specific features to industry-standard software _
suffered a stinging defeat.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte issued a temporary restraining
order that gave Microsoft 90 days to make its Java software
compatible with the version created by its archrival, Sun
Microsystems, which owns the programming language, or remove it
from its Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, that ruling followed weeks of damaging testimony in
the trial of the government's antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft,
which has seen a parade of government witnesses accuse the software
giant of systematically using its control of the Windows operating
system to defeat its competition.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in other parts of the nation's largest computer
trade show there were people who cheered Tuesday's decision and
shared dark whispers accusing Microsoft of using strong-arm
business tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here in the Microsoft Pavillion, one of the most crowded
sections of the trade show, under banners trumpeting new advances
in ease-of-use and productivity, neither court case dimmed the
support of hundreds of Gates loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   In row after row of personal computers featuring Windows
software products of every description, from industrial automation
to architectural support, 252 companies see themselves as living
proof that the Windows business model is making money for more than
just Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   These are companies that have started small, just as Gates did
more than two decades ago, and have prospered writing programs that
run on his Windows operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   There is little love here for the idea of government regulation
or intervention. There is a pervasive hope that with perhaps just a
little bit of luck and a strong dose of entrepreneurial sweat and
labor, it is still possible to match the success of Gates, the
nation's wealthiest person.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just Big Brother trying to beat this guy up,'' said
Jack Ross, president of Cedar Systems, a five-person start-up in
Bellevue, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Ross views Gates as a consistent innovator who has suffered some
bad public relations defeats in recent weeks at the hands of the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how the government can come in and help settle the
score after these guys have lost in the marketplace,'' he said,
referring to Silicon Valley companies like Sun, Netscape
Communications Corp. and Oracle Corp., which are Microsoft's most
bitter enemies.
</P>
<P>
   That view is apparently shared by a majority of Americans. A
CNN-USA Today poll by the Gallup organization that was reported
Tuesday found that 56 percent of 1,039 adults interviewed last
weekend had a favorable opinion of Gates, compared with 55 percent
in March before the antitrust trial began.
</P>
<P>
   Of those polled, 44 percent said they sided with Microsoft in
the trial, while only 28 percent backed the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some at Comdex portray Gates' problem as simple politics.
Microsoft, they say, has failed to educate the government on how
the software industry differs from other, more traditional U.S.
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is an extremely competitive company, like many
others,'' said Paula Gil, an alliance manager at Best Software, a
company in Reston, Va., which develops business software. Since
going public last year, Best has seen the value of its stock almost
double.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gil, who expresses great admiration for Gates, recalled that
when she heard him speak years ago, an audience member asked whom
he feared most as a competitor. Without hesitation, she said, Gates
answered that it was somebody working in a garage on a new idea
that he had never heard about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see guys walking up and down these aisles who look like they
are barely 15 years old, and they are presidents of their own
companies,'' Ms. Gil said. ``That's the spirit of competition that
characterizes this industry, and that's the perspective the
government is missing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not just the cottage programmers here who believed that
what is good for Microsoft is good for the country. Among the
software industry's most successful figures, there are some who
argue that while Microsoft's tactics have occasionally crossed the
line, it is still important to defend the powerful company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has done some bad things,'' said Gordon Eubanks,
chairman of Symantec Corp., a Cupertino, Calif., developer of
utility software.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, Eubanks said, Gates is the victim of a
broader trend in American culture: attacking and tearing down those
who are too successful.
</P>
<P>
   That view of Gates and Microsoft, as examplars of success that
are being tampered with, is echoed repeatedly among those who
believe that the operating-systems marketing wars of the 1980s are
over and that resurrecting them will hurt business and slow
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a privilege to work with Microsoft,'' said Ed Murray, a
senior consultant at Wind 2 Software Inc. He values the broad
computer industry compatibility that Microsoft's Windows operating
systems has created. `They're an innovator, and they're leading
technology forward, and it will hurt the economy and hurt our
business'' if the Justice Department wins.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft loyalists share the view that the system is not
broken, so the government should not try to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, Microsoft's size is a big advantage,'' said Robert
Mosolgo, president of Owensville Systems, a six-person start-up in
Charlottesville, Va., which makes network monitoring software.
``They're a good supporter, and it would be impossible for us to
even consider partnering against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such passionate partisanship was lost on Kevin Farley, who was
working a booth for Business Objects of San Jose, a maker of
software development tools. ``I follow the industry as a private
consultant, but here I'm just selling products,'' he said
``Besides, as a Mac user I could care less.''

MAN IN THE NEWS: DICK ARMEY, AN IDEOLOGUE WITH SWAGGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a man from North
Dakota with Texas in his swagger, cannot help indulging in a hokey
fishing tale or two when he is in a cheery mood. But seldom do they
blossom into allegory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about the poor bass,'' Armey told reporters back in
September. ``Put yourself in his place. You go into Denny's and you
sit down and somebody puts your hamburger in front of you and you
pick it up and take a bite. All of a sudden somebody grabs you by
the mouth, drags you around the store, drags you outside, pulls the
hook out of your mouth and throws you back into Denny's. That is
what the poor fish goes through.''
</P>
<P>
   For Armey, the past three weeks have been no different. Many of
his Republican colleagues aligned against him, eager to yank him
out of the leadership position he has held since 1995. But
Wednesday, after weeks of intense lobbying for a second chance at
the post of majority leader, Armey was re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   It was far from a runaway victory; members voted three times in
Wednesday's in-House election before the ballots finally sifted out
the three other challengers and fell conclusively in Armey's favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each of us provided for the other a merry chase,'' said Armey,
who represents suburban Dallas, after the secret votes were
counted. Summing up the rigors of the challenge he faced, he added,
``I have an even more keenly honed opportunity to live and learn.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 4, the day after the congressional midterm elections, it
looked as if Armey would not survive the wrath of his Republican
colleagues, who blamed their House leaders for ending up with a net
loss of five seats. Few of them could forget the sight of the
majority leader, on national television, sweeping aside dire
predictions of Republican losses with braggadocio just hours before
the polls closed.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich resigned his post almost
immediately, and two other leaders were ousted Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Armey rallied, spending days on the phone and calling into
action allies to help sway disillusioned members his way. The power
of incumbency and his years of experience helped bolster his
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Born on July 7, 1940, in Cando, N.D., Richard Keith Armey worked
as a grain elevator operator and a telephone lineman before he
traded in blue collar work for a degree from Jamestown College and
a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Oklahoma. He and his
wife, Susan, have five children from previous marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Armey is an ideologue who dislikes the current tax rate and the
International Monetary Fund as much as he does the Washington
cocktail circuit. (He reluctantly bought a tuxedo this year, which
he pairs with armadillo-skin cowboy boots.) An architect of the
Contract With America, he has fought against abortion and gun
control, and championed school vouchers, which permit tax dollars
to travel to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   When asked amid the Lewinsky scandal what would happen if he
ever found himself in President Clinton's position, Armey thought
of his wife and replied, ``I would be looking up from a pool of
blood and hearing, `How do I reload this thing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Although he emerged victorious Wednesday, it has been a rocky
year and a half for Armey. In July 1997, Armey attended a meeting
of Republican rebels who sought to oust Gingrich. He told Gingrich
about the plot, then disavowed any role in it. That left members on
both sides distrustful.
</P>
<P>
   Then, early in the year, he faced a brief challenge to his
position from Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y. In the end, it was Paxon who
backed down and later retired.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, his allies reminded colleagues that Armey had
campaigned hard for them, and is capable of learning from his
mistakes. Although the vote was close, 127-95 in the third ballot,
the argument worked.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin of Louisiana, who supported Armey,
said the narrow vote carried a warning. Armey, he said, needs to
bid farewell to the new style of firebrand Republican governance
and develop a less abrasive leadership style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to receive it as a stern message that members want
him to work with Livingston,'' Tauzin added, referring to the new
speaker of the House, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La. ``This took a
lot of assurances that Armey would be very much a team player.''

MICROSOFT SAYS IBM TRIED TO ENLIST RIVALS IN COLLUSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-SUN, MICROSOFT-DEFENDERS) 
(mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a series of attacks in federal court Wednesday,
Microsoft Corp. accused IBM Corp. of engaging in many of the same
practices that led the federal government and 20 states to file
antitrust charges against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   While cross-examining John Soyring, director of network
computing software for IBM, a Microsoft lawyer produced an e-mail
message in which John Thompson, IBM's software chief, last year
proposed to the leaders of Sun Microsystems Inc. and Netscape
Communications Corp. a strategy for a joint campaign against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson urged the others to help him enlist Oracle and Novell
in the effort ``to put Microsoft on the defensive.'' The e-mail was
written in response to a plan by Microsoft to establish its own
version of the Java programming language.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a federal judge in California gave Microsoft 90 days
to make its version of Java compatible with the standards set by
Sun, which invented and licenses the language.
</P>
<P>
   But in court Wednesday, Microsoft's lawyer, Steven Holley, used
Thompson's memo to contend that IBM had been attempting collusion
with several other companies to disadvantage Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must clearly explain to our customers that Internet
Explorer is Microsoft's primary weapon to kill 100 percent pure
Java,'' Thompson wrote. Internet Explorer is Microsoft's World Wide
Web browser, and it uses Microsoft's version of Java _ not the
``100 percent pure'' version authorized by Sun.
</P>
<P>
   Holley asked Soyring, ``Do you think it is appropriate for five
of the leading computer companies in the world to meet and
collude'' against Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   Soyring said he had not been involved in the discussions and
knew nothing about them. But the disclosure was potentially useful
to Microsoft because the government, in its antitrust suit, accuses
Microsoft of illegally colluding with several other companies,
including America Online and Apple Computer, to disadvantage
Netscape, Microsoft's chief competitor in the market for Internet
software.
</P>
<P>
   The government made public Wednesday the written testimony of
Frederick Warren-Boulton, the next witness in the case, who will
take the stand on Thursday. Warren-Boulton, an economist and former
Justice Department official, makes a long and detailed academic and
political argument that Microsoft is a monopolist, as antitrust law
defines the term, and is therefore engaging in several activities
that appear to violate antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price to consumers from Microsoft's maintenance of its PC
operating system monopoly and its creation of a new monopoly in
Internet browsers through its exclusionary practices is
substantial,'' he wrote. ``The price paid for personal-computer
systems likely will be higher than it otherwise would have been,''
and ``Microsoft's conduct will slow or halt the natural tendency of
the marketplace to provide alternative technologies.'' As a result,
he said, ``Microsoft's operating system monopoly would be further
entrenched.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren-Boulton has held a number of prominent academic and
political positions. But perhaps most interesting for someone
arguing for antitrust enforcement against Microsoft is that he was
chief economist for the antitrust division of the Justice
Department during the Reagan administration, when the government
chose to pursue few antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday, Microsoft contended that
``Warren-Boulton's testimony is clearly that of an ivory tower
consultant with little or no direct experience in the day-to-day
business and competitiveness of the U.S. software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times during the trial, Microsoft has used the tactic of
accusing its accusers of similar practices. The company argues that
the computer industry plays by different rules than the rest of
corporate America and that federal prosecutors do not understand
those rules.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Justice Department lawyers say the argument means nothing to
them; if other companies are violating the law, they should be
prosecuted, too.
</P>
<P>
   In court Wednesday, Holley tried to make the case that IBM was
``integrating'' the company's own Web browser, WebExplorer, with
IBM's personal-computer operating system, O/S2 Warp.
</P>
<P>
   A key charge in the suit is that Microsoft illegally integrated
Internet Explorer in the Windows operating system in an attempt to
disadvantage Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his argument against IBM, Holley introduced into
evidence the packaging for commercial copies of OS/2. Advertising
copy on the box states, ``IBM's WebExplorer is built in,'' and
``Internet access has been integrated into OS/2 Warp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why does it say that?'' Holley asked.
</P>
<P>
   Soyring replied that the phrases were simply marketing language,
not an accurate technological description. Unlike Internet
Explorer, he added, WebExplorer can be loaded into an OS/2
computer, and taken out again, without impairing the functioning of
the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Holley's questions, and similar questions he asked an
Apple Computer executive early this month, may prove useful in
showing that many other companies believe that including a Web
browser along with an operating system is a useful and even
essential marketing step.

LATE SURGES SPUR WIDE GAINS AS DOW CLIMBS BY 54.83  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c. 19988 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Late-session surges drove stocks to broad gains
Wednesday as investors more thoroughly digested the Federal
Reserve's decision the day before to cut interest rates for a third
time in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a heightened degree of confidence that the Fed is
doing the right thing,'' said Frederick Taylor, chief investment
officer at United States Trust Co., predicting that the economy
would ``barely'' grow next year while profits modestly fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrials finished with a gain of 54.83 points,
to 9,041.11, a level just 3.2 percent below its mid-July record.
The blue-chip gauge was down 19.3 percent from that record at the
end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Even better was Wednesday's performance of the Nasdaq market,
which climbed 18.92 points, just more than 1 percent, as various
Internet and other technology raced ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape jumped 10 to 39\ and America Online jumped 8], to 83}
on talk of an alliance between the two companies. Ebay soared 18~,
to 147{, Amazon.com 15{, to 164 and Yahoo 13], to 190[.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings of these current darlings may be skimpy or nonexistent
but according to one school of thought, their corporate fortunes
would probably suffer far less than other businesses from recession
or deflation.
</P>
<P>
   Bank stocks, by contrast, were mostly lower Wednesday. Cutting
the prime rate in response to the Fed rate reduction may have been
a factor, but a bigger reason seemed to be disclosure of steeper
costs associated with the Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Morgan eased 1, to 105~, Bankers Trust 1[, to 67 7/16.
American Express, on the other hand, jumped 2}, to 102[ to account
for about one-fifth of the Dow's rise.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market was mixed, with short-term rates edging higher
and longer-term rates a bit lower as traders and investors
continued to bet on another round of interest-rate reductions at
the next meeting of the Fed's policymaking committee on Dec. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I expect the Fed to ease again,'' said Robert
Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. The central
bank might hold off then if stocks are then at or near new highs,
especially if holiday shopping is strong, he added, but ``more
easing is needed to prevent a liquidity squeeze from grabbing
capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Stovall also cited the Wall Street maxim, supported by history,
that any time the Fed cuts rates two or more times in sequence,
both the stock and bond markets will advance over the following 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   Another optimist Wednesday was Clare Zempel, chief investment
strategist at Robert Baird in Milwaukee, who said: ``The broad
stock market has considerable room to rise.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the relationship of yields on three-month Treasury
bills to the earnings yield _ the inverse of the more common
price-earnings calculation _ for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, a ratio
now at its lowest level since early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk-reward relationship is decisively on the side of
reward,'' Zempel said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Dow stocks with sizable gains Wednesday were 3M, 2 7/16,
to 82 1/16; Merck, 2\, to 149|; General Electric 1}, to 91}; and
Wal-Mart, 1}, to 73].
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainty of the general earnings outlook,
``people are looking for the steady growers,'' said John Silvia,
economist at Scudder Kemper Investments.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup, which reported higher earnings, climbed 15/16, to
56 7/16. Daimler-Chrysler, in its second day of trading on the New
York Stock Exchange, rose 1[, to 85.
</P>
<P>
   The strength in drug stocks went well beyond Merck.
Warner-Lambert rose 3\, to 77 15/16 while gains for Bristol-Myers,
Lilly and Schering-Plough reached 2 points or more.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems closed down 1/16, to 66|, after trading as high
as 69 13/16. The stock had added 3~ Tuesday as it won a licensing
suit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 51 issues hit new yearly highs
and 32 sank to new lows but declining issues slightly outnumbered
advancing ones, 1,545 to 1,514. Volume was a moderate 652.5 million
shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 added 5.16 points, or 45/100ths of 1
percent, while the small-cap Russell 2000 gained 69/100ths of 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, two of the most closely watched markets these days
posted gains. Brazil's main index climbed 2.60 percent while
Japan's Nikkei 225 gained 1.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks rose 2.30 percent in Mexico, 64/100ths of 1 percent in
Hong Kong and 30/100ths of 1 percent in France but fell 52/100ths
of 1 percent in Britain and 37/100ths of 1 percent in Germany.

 A Low-Tech Use for Free CDs  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Over the past couple of years, I've accumulated a lot of
free CDs that either arrived in the mail or came with PC magazines
_ you know, demo software, AOL connection software, stuff like
that. Rather than throw them out, I've taken to using them as cup
covers to keep my coffee hot. Now, though, I'm starting to think
that there may be chemicals in the CDs that could hurt me. Is there
anything hazardous about them?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  CDs, both the music and software kind, start out as
piece of plastic coated with a thin, reflective layer of aluminum.
After a disc is replicated from a master disc, it's given a coat of
protective lacquer that's hardened using ultraviolet light. So, no,
there's no hazardous material involved, and you can continue to use
your novel cup covers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the tip on what to do with unwanted CDs. By the way,
have you ever thought of using them as coasters? That way you could
have one below the cup and one on top.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you know if Syquest is ever coming back? They have a Sparq
One unit of mine that was to be replaced. I can't get a phone
number to call and their Web site is down. I certainly hope they
come back. I need that unit. Can you help me contact them?
</P>
<P>
   A: For readers who don't know, Syquest is a maker of removable
disk drives that has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. It's also in
the process of selling itself to an unnamed buyer. That means it
could make a comeback under new management. In the meantime, it's
offering limited technical support, which you can reach at (510)
226-5400. It seems to me like getting a defective drive replaced
would fall into the category of limited support. Especially if the
drive was under warranty. And they must certainly have products to
spare, since they couldn't sell enough of them to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Every once in a while my computer will freeze up and tell me
that it's suffered a ``general protection fault.'' What is this, in
language I can understand, and is there anything I can do to
prevent it from happening?
</P>
<P>
   A: Windows uses general protection faults (GPFs) as a protective
measure to prevent programs from overlapping each other within the
main system memory (aka RAM). When an application you're running
tries to allocate space in memory that's unavailable, the result is
a GPF, halting the offending application in its tracks. Sometimes,
the application can be closed and then restarted, but sometimes
your entire system must be restarted.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody gets GPFs occasionally, so I wouldn't worry. If you
find that a particular application causes them, you might want to
remove and reinstall it. Also, you can reduce the risk of GPFs in
general by not having lots of applications open simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I use the Microsoft Office Shortcut Bar quite a bit to switch
between programs. The trouble is, I have to load it manually every
time I start Windows. Is there a way to have this toolbar
automatically loaded onto the desktop every time I boot up?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Indeed there is. After loading the shortcut bar, click on
the left-most icon, then choose Exit from the menu that appears.
This will close the shortcut bar, but before that happens, you'll
see a dialog box giving you the option to have the shortcut start
automatically every time you start Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 78-year-old father is losing control of his hands and it's
difficult for him to type. Is speech-recognition software advanced
enough for this feature to really help him? He doesn't want to mess
around with spelling, punctuation, etc. Also, like most of us, he
is impatient and wants to be able to dictate normally, not one ...
word ... at ... a ... time. Could you recommend any solutions and
also let me know what, if any, upgrades I'd need for my computer to
make the software work?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Until 1997, commercially available speech recognition
software used what was called ``discreet'' technology _ which
required users to pause between words. Now, however, several
affordable programs are available that use ``continuous speech''
recognition, letting you talk to the computer just as you would to
a person.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders in the field are Naturally Speaking from
Dragon Systems, ViaVoice from IBM and VoiceXpress from Lernout &AMP;
Hauspie. These programs come in different versions aimed at
different kinds of users, from individuals at home to professionals
in corporations. A program that meets the needs of dad should cost
you less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to offering hands-free dictation, the newest
programs let you use voice commands to fix spelling and punctuation
errors, and generally do anything to the text that would normally
require a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  Strike a blow for individualism and use an e-mail program that
doesn't have Microsoft or Netscape in the name. Try Eudora Light,
which you can get at &LR;  www.eudora.com,  &LR; or Pegasus, a really
powerful program available at  &LR; www.pmail.usa.com. &LR;  Both are free.

DEAL TO BRING PATRIOTS TO HARTFORD SAID `REAL CLOSE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The state of Connecticut is trying to lure the New
England Patriots to downtown Hartford with a $280 million publicly
financed stadium package, a proposal so sweet some said team owner
Robert Kraft would be unable to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is real close,'' said one person involved in the
talks between the team and Connecticut officials. ``But no one has
given anyone a time ultimatum. ... They need to know very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the proposal, Kraft's team would play
rent-free in a new 65,000-seat open-air stadium to be built by 2001
and paid for entirely by bondholders, taxpayers and football fans.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials, who have been meeting for weeks on
finalizing an offer to the Patriots, said Wednesday the deal could
be announced as early as Thursday. The agreement would not allow
for any ``wiggle room'' for the Patriots to back out of it,
according to a source with knowledge of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Governor John Rowland, who has spearheaded the attempts to lure
the Patriots away from Foxborough, abruptly cancelled plans
Wednesday to attend the National Republican Governors Conference in
New Orleans so he could meet with business and legislative leaders
and brief them on the proposal. Rowland needs to quickly complete
the deal so he can call the Legislature back for a vote authorizing
stadium construction bonds before the session ends Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said talks were continuing, but there was no
agreement as of Wednesday night. Patriots spokesman Stacey James,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Boston, the finger pointing has already begun over
the prospect of having the team leave Foxborough. But part of the
nastiness that has characterized the negotiations between Kraft and
local politicians was also evident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sending him a sympathy card,'' Mayor Thomas M. Menino said
of Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, the man who has almost
single-handedly blocked a publicly-financed stadium deal for the
last two years, was quoted in the Salem Evening News as saying,
``I'm going to give tax (breaks) to some fat-ass millionaire and
screw our kids?'' Finneran admitted he used those words at a
Peabody dinner event Tuesday night, but said they were spoken in a
conversation about other NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless a certain resolve also settled on the State House,
with Governor Paul Cellucci, attending the governor's conference in
New Orleans, wanly urging voters in a press release to complain to
their representatives for not getting a deal done here and blaming
the House in advance should the team leave.
</P>
<P>
   Said Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who struck a $72
million land and infrastructure deal with Kraft last February that
Finneran blocked: ``This day did not have to come.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Martin Meehan (D-Lowell), who has been dealing
with NFL franchise relocation issues on the House Judiciary
Committee, said the league has no way of stopping Kraft from moving
the team and likely would not try because of the national
perception of the stadium ``fiasco'' here.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that this has become personal,'' Meehan said,
``I don't think that's healthy in economic development projects.
... I believe they are going to leave and reach an agreement in
Hartford. It doesn't make any sense for them not to move to
Hartford at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, there is a string of other time-sensitive
development issues associated with the huge $1 billion convention
center, housing and retail project known as Adriaen's Landing along
the Connecticut River, which is putting pressure on securing the
centerpiece of the deal: a new stadium for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock ticking, Rowland Wednesday canceled his trip and
privately apprised about 30 legislative and business leaders of the
proposal in a surprise two-hour meeting at the Governor's Mansion
in West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut House Speaker Tom Ritter and Majority leader David
Pudlin, both Democrats, attended the meeting, showing bi-partisan
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been anyone that has come out so far to say we
shouldn't pursue the opportunity,'' said Larry Perosino, a
spokesman for the House Democrats. Given that support, any bond
issue would likely be approved, especially in light of the state's
budget surplus, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, led by Phoenix Home Life Mutual
Insurance Co. chief Richard Fiondella, is also behind the prospect
of revitalizing downtown and there is expected to be a bidding war
among the city's largest insurance companies for securing naming
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland told reporters after Wednesday's meeting that Kraft
would not be allowed to negotiate with other states if he signs a
tentative agreement on the Hartford deal.
</P>
<P>
   Public funding, which would top $370 million including
infrastructure, would be paid for over time by the team's payroll,
sales and usage taxes, in addition to the 10 percent ticket tax,
those familiar with the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the flurry of activity between the team and
Connecticut officials in recent weeks is that utility officials met
with Hartford Mayor Michael Peters Nov. 2 to figure out a way to
replace the steam plant on the site where the stadium would be
built at the crossroads of Interstates 84 and 91.
</P>
<P>
   And there finally appears to be a critical mass of will power,
effort and money in Hartford which could lure the team away from
Foxborough once and for all. Right now, Connecticut is the only
state Kraft is talking to, after he dismissed as inadequate a
proposal by the Massachusetts House last summer offering $57
million in infrastructure and walked away from talks with Rhode
Island last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Finneran defended his offer as more than enough and
blamed Kraft for being greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very consistent with the trend in professional sports.
It's all about money,'' Finneran said. ``They don't care who they
bully and pillage. And unfortunately it's the taxpayers and other
jurisdictions that continue to fall over.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his comments about a ``fat-ass millionaire,'' Finneran
said he was referencing Al Davis, the general manager of the
Oakland Raiders, and Art Modell, who moved the Cleveland Browns to
Baltimore.

WITHOUT GINGRICH, GOP LACKS MASTER FUND-RAISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Newt Gingrich stepping down from Congress, the Republican
Party is losing its top fund-raiser, a man who, by party accounts,
raised more than $60 million for office-seekers this year and
masterminded a strategy that helped Republicans take over Congress
in 1994 and retain control ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Ronald Reagan was president has the Republican Party
had a fund-raiser with as much star power and willingness to dazzle
donors as Gingrich. Without him, the party is left with no one in
its leadership ready to step into this role and with no obvious
candidates in the wings as the party prepares for the 2000
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that because of Newt's fund raising, his
decision to step down has to be greeted with a level of ambivalence
by the party,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist based in
Atlanta. ``You are losing someone who has probably raised, over the
last four years, conservatively, a quarter of a billion dollars for
the party and those things are hard to replace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has not decided what he will do next; and whether it is
teaching, espousing his philosophy or resuming a position at GOPAC,
his former political organization, he might well continue to do
some fund raising. It is clear, however, that he will no longer
serve as the party's top money man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a while before anyone can fill Newt's fund-raising
shoes,'' said Mark Braden, a Washington lawyer who represents
Republican candidates. ``Fund raising is a combination of sitting
in the right chair in Congress and being in the right places in the
campaigns. Newt was extraordinarily good at giving the `red meat'
speech to the faithful. I don't see anyone who can walk in and fill
that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to calculate exactly how much Gingrich has raised.
The party estimates that he raised $60 million for the National
Republican Congressional Committee in the midterm elections;
Gingrich's office says that for House candidates and other
Republican office-seekers, the total comes to $76 million.
</P>
<P>
   His own campaign war chest _ this year it came to $7 million _
is always one of the fattest in Congress. And in the 1996
presidential election year, Gingrich is credited by the party with
raising close to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., who is to become
the next speaker, is a more modest fund-raiser: His campaign war
chest totals just under $1 million and he gave away around $2
million to Republican candidates over the last four years. By his
staff's count, he made ``dozens'' of campaign fund-raising
appearances for candidates this year, raising around around $1
million for them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the party's best-known politician, Gingrich had a reputation
as someone who was not uncomfortable asking for money and who could
deftly separate donors from their dollars. He embraced fund raising
with a passion, understood its strategic importance and, despite
his consistently high negative ratings, was a celebrity outside the
Beltway who whipped up enthusiastic crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either directly or indirectly, Newt raised around two-thirds
of the $90 million that we raised this year,'' said Ted Maness
executive director of the National Republican Congressional
committee. ``He will be missed. This committee will try to expand
the base of people we use for fund raising. But it will take a
while to replace him. People who attended his speeches were
spellbound. He had that effect on our donors.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich raised money through fund-raisers that benefited other
Republican candidates as well as from the use of his name, voice
and likeness on telemarketing calls and direct mail solicitations.
In the last election, he traveled to 189 congressional districts in
48 states, 15 states in the last week alone.
</P>
<P>
   He also dipped into his own campaign funds, as well as into his
leadership political action committee, the Monday Morning Pac, to
give to other Republican candidates _ $896,437 in 1998. In
addition, he put $500,000 of his campaign money into a last-minute
television issue-ad blitz, which later came under fire, on behalf
of Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond fund raising, Gingrich was perhaps even more important to
House Republicans as a financial strategist who developed a game
plan in the early 1990s that is credited with putting the party on
solid financial footing and getting money to House Republican
challengers prior to the 1994 elections, a critical factor in the
Republican victory.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1992, when the party's congressional fund-raising
committee was nearly $5 million in debt and Republicans were out of
power, Gingrich promoted a ``share-the-wealth'' plan in which
Republican incumbents in safe districts were pressed to send
campaign funds to support fledging Republican candidates. He helped
create the ``Incumbent Protection Fund'' which, despite its name,
shifted millions _ $10.6 million by 1996, for example _ from
Republican incumbents to challengers. In the last year, he upped
the ante, pressing House committee chairmen to bring in $100,000 to
the party's televised campaign efforts and $50,000 for incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1998 midterm elections, the congressional committee
raised $81 million by September 30; for the entire two-years of the
1996 mid-term cycle, the committee raised $93 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich also used the power of the speaker's office _ which
gave him ``make it or break it power'' over nearly every piece of
legislation _ to draw money from Washington's corporate lobbyists
and their political action committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt was an entrepreneur who found creative and untried new
ways to maximize the financial resources of the party,'' said Reed,
the Republican strategist. ``He worked the K Street lobbyists and
he turned the unused checkbook balances of safe incumbents into
assets for the broader party. These are innovations that will be
part of politics of the future, but they were not done until
Newt.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Gingrich would be stepping down as Speaker in the
year 2002, under term limits, the National Republican Congressional
Committee had already begun use other Republicans as fund-raisers,
Maness said.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Gingrich say they do not expect him to retire
completely from the money circuit. Richard Galen, executive
director of GOPAC, said: ``His star is tarnished as speaker. But
not as Newt Gingrich.''

DEAL TO BRING PATRIOTS TO HARTFORD SAID `REAL CLOSE' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The state of Connecticut is trying to lure the New
England Patriots to downtown Hartford with a $280 million publicly
financed stadium package, a proposal so sweet some said team owner
Robert Kraft would be unable to refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is real close,'' said one person involved in the
talks between the team and Connecticut officials. ``But no one has
given anyone a time ultimatum. ... They need to know very
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the proposal, Kraft's team would play
rent-free in a new 65,000-seat open-air stadium to be built by 2001
and paid for entirely by bondholders, taxpayers and football fans.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials, who have been meeting for weeks on
finalizing an offer to the Patriots, said Wednesday the deal could
be announced as early as Thursday. The agreement would not allow
for any ``wiggle room'' for the Patriots to back out of it,
according to a source with knowledge of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Governor John Rowland, who has spearheaded the attempts to lure
the Patriots away from Foxborough, abruptly cancelled plans
Wednesday to attend the National Republican Governors Conference in
New Orleans so he could meet with business and legislative leaders
and brief them on the proposal. Rowland needs to quickly complete
the deal so he can call the Legislature back for a vote authorizing
stadium construction bonds before the session ends Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said talks were continuing, but there was no
agreement as of Wednesday night. Patriots spokesman Stacey James,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Boston, the finger pointing has already begun over
the prospect of having the team leave Foxborough. But part of the
nastiness that has characterized the negotiations between Kraft and
local politicians was also evident Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sending him a sympathy card,'' Mayor Thomas M. Menino said
of Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   And House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, the man who has almost
single-handedly blocked a publicly-financed stadium deal for the
last two years, was quoted in the Salem Evening News as saying,
``I'm going to give tax (breaks) to some fat-ass millionaire and
screw our kids?'' Finneran admitted he used those words at a
Peabody dinner event Tuesday night, but said they were spoken in a
conversation about other NFL owners.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless a certain resolve also settled on the State House,
with Governor Paul Cellucci, attending the governor's conference in
New Orleans, wanly urging voters in a press release to complain to
their representatives for not getting a deal done here and blaming
the House in advance should the team leave.
</P>
<P>
   Said Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham, who struck a $72
million land and infrastructure deal with Kraft last February that
Finneran blocked: ``This day did not have to come.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Martin Meehan (D-Lowell), who has been dealing
with NFL franchise relocation issues on the House Judiciary
Committee, said the league has no way of stopping Kraft from moving
the team and likely would not try because of the national
perception of the stadium ``fiasco'' here.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that this has become personal,'' Meehan said,
``I don't think that's healthy in economic development projects.
... I believe they are going to leave and reach an agreement in
Hartford. It doesn't make any sense for them not to move to
Hartford at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, there is a string of other time-sensitive
development issues associated with the huge $1 billion convention
center, housing and retail project known as Adriaen's Landing along
the Connecticut River, which is putting pressure on securing the
centerpiece of the deal: a new stadium for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock ticking, Rowland Wednesday canceled his trip and
privately apprised about 30 legislative and business leaders of the
proposal in a surprise two-hour meeting at the Governor's Mansion
in West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut House Speaker Tom Ritter and Majority leader David
Pudlin, both Democrats, attended the meeting, showing bi-partisan
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been anyone that has come out so far to say we
shouldn't pursue the opportunity,'' said Larry Perosino, a
spokesman for the House Democrats. Given that support, any bond
issue would likely be approved, especially in light of the state's
budget surplus, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, led by Phoenix Home Life Mutual
Insurance Co. chief Richard Fiondella, is also behind the prospect
of revitalizing downtown and there is expected to be a bidding war
among the city's largest insurance companies for securing naming
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland told reporters after Wednesday's meeting that Kraft
would not be allowed to negotiate with other states if he signs a
tentative agreement on the Hartford deal.
</P>
<P>
   Public funding, which would top $370 million including
infrastructure, would be paid for over time by the team's payroll,
sales and usage taxes, in addition to the 10 percent ticket tax,
those familiar with the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the flurry of activity between the team and
Connecticut officials in recent weeks is that utility officials met
with Hartford Mayor Michael Peters Nov. 2 to figure out a way to
replace the steam plant on the site where the stadium would be
built at the crossroads of Interstates 84 and 91.
</P>
<P>
   And there finally appears to be a critical mass of will power,
effort and money in Hartford which could lure the team away from
Foxborough once and for all. Right now, Connecticut is the only
state Kraft is talking to, after he dismissed as inadequate a
proposal by the Massachusetts House last summer offering $57
million in infrastructure and walked away from talks with Rhode
Island last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Finneran defended his offer as more than enough and
blamed Kraft for being greedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very consistent with the trend in professional sports.
It's all about money,'' Finneran said. ``They don't care who they
bully and pillage. And unfortunately it's the taxpayers and other
jurisdictions that continue to fall over.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his comments about a ``fat-ass millionaire,'' Finneran
said he was referencing Al Davis, the general manager of the
Oakland Raiders, and Art Modell, who moved the Cleveland Browns to
Baltimore.

MUSEUM PROPOSES A NEW BRANCH ON MANHATTAN'S RIVERFRONT 
</HEADLINE>

 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL and CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is quietly
developing plans for a large new branch to be designed by the Los
Angeles architect Frank Gehry and built at the Hudson River on Pier
40 off Houston Street, said people who were consulted on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed museum, part of a growing empire of Guggenheim
outposts, including those in Spain and Germany, would be built on
state land in the middle of a new shorefront state park, a
10-minute walk to Chelsea or SoHo, Manhattan's two major art
centers.
</P>
<P>
   It would be the first major museum building to rise in the city
since the Whitney in 1966 and perhaps the biggest change in the
West Side skyline since the $500 million glass-sheathed New York
Convention Center opened in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Like all projects affecting the ecology of the Hudson River, the
museum would face extensive federal, state and local review.
Approval from the Army Corps of Engineers would be required if the
building were to extend beyond the pier and into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry also designed the striking and highly acclaimed $100
million museum that the Guggenheim opened a year ago in Bilbao,
Spain. The museum, with its rakish silhouette, sweeping curves and
titanium skin, attracts more than 1.4 million visitors and millions
of dollars in the last year to the old Basque riverfront city.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new museum in Manhattan could cost four times as
much, with some prospective donors already offering support, people
at the museum said. It would allow the Guggenheim to exhibit more
of its permanent holdings of modern art as well as new collections
and to expand its programming greatly, beefing up areas like
photography, architecture and video.
</P>
<P>
   Gehry and Thomas Krens, the Guggenheim's director, declined to
discuss the project Wednesday. Other officials at the museum said
it was simply an idea in the early stages of development. Gehry,
however, has already produced architectural drawings for the
building.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has also assembled figures on the project's economic
benefits, claiming that in the first two years of operation, the
new museum would generate $1 billion in tax revenues, extra tourism
and employment for the city and state.
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials said they had not yet been consulted,
although Krens was said to have held a preliminary discussion about
it with Gov. George E. Pataki in East Hampton, N.Y., last summer.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for the governor, did not respond to
calls about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Pier 40 is, at nearly 15 acres, the largest pier jutting into
the Hudson on Manhattan's West Side, sitting amid the new five-mile
Hudson River Park established by the state legislature and signed
into law by Pataki on Sept. 8. Work on the 500-acre park, which
runs from Battery Park City to 59th Street, has just begun and is
scheduled to last until 2003 at a cost of up to $390 million. Pier
40, on state-owned land, is now occupied by a three-story 2,200-car
garage, in the shape of an oblong donut, which also has soccer
fields on the roof and some areas for community use inside.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear how the museum would fit into the lengthy
sliver park and the anticipated commercial development planned for
as many as 19 renovated piers within the park area.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders questioned about the museum's plan said it was
the first they had heard of it and that they would not want the
museum to supplant or dominate an important segment of the park.
</P>
<P>
   The park, now controlled by a 13-member state-city trust, grew
out of the long-disputed highway plan Westway, the
multibillion-dollar sunken roadway that was to have run along the
Hudson, but which was defeated in a concerted campaign by local
opponents who cited environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   People who have spoken with Krens said that the project has
already been promised substantial private support from at least one
trustee of the Guggenheim, Peter B. Lewis. Lewis, the new chairman
of the Guggenheim Foundation and chairman and chief executive of
the Progressive Corp., a Cleveland-based insurance company, made an
unrelated cash pledge of $50 million to the Guggenheim in April.
Reached by phone, Lewis said he would not discuss the new project.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has long been close to Gehry, who worked for more than
five years with Lewis on a $30 million house in Cleveland before
the project was shelved several years ago. It was Gehry who
introduced Krens to Lewis, who became a trustee of the Guggenheim
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   If the new museum is built, people at the museum said, the
Guggenheim would probably close its six-year-old branch on the
corner of Broadway and Prince Street in SoHo. The outpost in SoHo
has been a financial drain on the institution, reportedly incurring
losses close to $40 million up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Under Krens, who has led the museum for 11 years, the Guggenheim
has embarked on a series of bold expansions. Besides Bilbao, which
has been hailed by critics as one of the most important works of
architecture in the 20th-century and has already generated $219
million of revenue as well as $35 million in new tax revenue for
the long-neglected industrial city on the Nervion River, it also
opened a 7,000-square-foot exhibition space in Berlin on the ground
floor of the Deutsche Bank on the Unter den Linden, near the
Brandenburg Gate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides these projects Krens has had ambitions for a Guggenheim
presence in cities like Paris and Salzburg. But neither of the
sites he had in mind for these cities has worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Krens announced that the Guggenheim was planning
to open three new museum sites in Venice. (The museum already
operates the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in the Plazzo Venier dei
Leoni on Venice's Grand Canal.) But progress on these projects is
moving slowly, Guggenheim officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Floating an unusual $54 million bond issue, Krens also directed
a sweeping $58 million renovation and expansion of the museum's
landmark Frank Lloyd Wright structure on Fifth Avenue at 89th
Street. And he opened the Guggenheim branch in SoHo in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the new branch in Manhattan have been so closely held
that they did not come up on Monday night at a small private dinner
of Guggenheim trustees and patrons to mark the election of Lewis as
foundation chairman, one participant said.
</P>
<P>
   Krens was said to have broached the plan last summer with Pataki
at the East Hampton home of Ronald O. Perelman, chairman of Revlon
and the former president of the Guggenheim. Perelman would not
discuss it, said a spokesman, Jim Conroy.
</P>
<P>
   The state's economic development arm, the Empire State
Development Corp., has not been advised of any plans, said a
spokesman for its chairman, Charles A. Gargano.

 Ho, Ho, Ho, Holiday Greetings Go High Tech  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Holiday greetings have come a long way since 1843, when Londoner
Sir Henry Cole got fed up with writing annual letters to friends
and relatives and commissioned an illustrator to design what would
be the first Christmas card.
</P>
<P>
   Today, anyone with a PC and an Internet connection can send a
colorful, card, complete with animation and sound, anywhere in the
world in a matter of minutes by using e-mail. And inexpensive
software lets you create professional-looking cards from scratch,
complete with personal photos, and print them out in elegant color.
</P>
<P>
   For those who conduct most of their business and much of their
personal correspondence via e-mail, electronic cards are becoming
acceptable alternatives to the traditional paper kind.
</P>
<P>
   They're certainly more convenient, since they require no
envelopes, stamps or trips to the post office. And in many cases,
they're absolutely free.
</P>
<P>
   Selections of e-cards you can personalize and send at no charge
can be found at a number of Web sites, including
 &LR; www.egreetings.com, &LR;   &LR; www.bluemountain.com, &LR;   &LR; www.e-cards.com &LR; 
and &LR;  www.giftrap.com. &LR;  Greeting card leader Hallmark
 &LR; (www.hallmark.com), &LR;  also offers some free e-cards, as does
 &LR; www.greeting-cards.com. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In general, free e-cards aren't as lavish as expensive cards
that you can buy in a store. Hallmark, however, is an exception,
boasting some beautiful free cards on its site.
</P>
<P>
   If you want really high quality e-cards _ many of which have
animation and sound _ you'll have to pay from $1 to $3 or more per
card. Hallmark has a great lineup of quality cards, as does its
chief rival in the greeting card business, American Greetings
( &LR; www.americangreetings.com, &LR;  or keyword ``greetings'' on America
Online).
</P>
<P>
   When you send an electronic greeting, in most cases the card
itself stays on the site where it was created. An Internet link is
e-mailed to the recipient, who can use the link to view the card.
Cards also can usually be downloaded and printed.
</P>
<P>
   E-cards do have some drawbacks, the biggest of which is that not
everyone has e-mail. And among those who do, there are still many
traditionalists who like to send cards through the mail and hang
cards they receive over the fireplace so everyone can see how many
friends they have.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't fancy the idea of e-cards, consider software that
can take the trouble out of holiday greetings.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hallmark and American Greetings are in this part of the
business as well, with the Hallmark Connections Greetings 99 from
Microsoft ($29.95) and American Greetings CreataCard Gold from
Mindscape ($49).
</P>
<P>
   Other leading programs include Print Shop Signature Greetings
from Broderbund ($19.95) and Print Artist Cards Plus from Sierra
($29.95).
</P>
<P>
   All of the programs give you a wide selection of predesigned
cards that you can personalize, as well as letting you create cards
from scratch. You can add photos or graphics to your cards, and
print them on a decent color inkjet printer at a quality that
rivals store-bought cards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most of the programs let you e-mail cards directly
from your computer using your own Internet account. That gives you
the advantage of using an e-card Web site, without the cost for
sending a really good card.
</P>
<P>
   The Print Shop and American Greetings programs are the easiest
to use, and the most well-thought-out of the ones listed here.
Their interfaces are simple and direct, and they guide you
logically through the process of selecting, customizing or creating
a card.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft program is, as you might expect, rather
Windows-like. That means there are lots of dialog boxes and option
menus, which add up to too much complexity for what should be an
uncomplicated task.
</P>
<P>
   Least user-friendly of the bunch is Sierra's Print Artist
program. It utilizes a tool bar with 28 little icons and works like
a desktop publishing program, giving you options for stretching,
aligning and coloring photos and graphical images.
</P>
<P>
   That's way too much for all but the most ambitious computer
fanatic. For the rest of us, it's just a turn-off.

BISHOPS TAKE BOLDER STAND IN BATTLE AGAINST ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:: Mass., Md.)   (af)  
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's Roman Catholic bishops declared
Wednesday that they have a pastoral duty to speak out to persuade
public officials who support abortion rights, and Catholic
officials in particular, to undergo ``a change of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' statement, which describes abortion, euthanasia and
physician-assisted suicide as fundamental threats to the health of
civil society, is addressed to all Catholics, urging them to
register their opposition to those issues by speaking out and
voting.
</P>
<P>
   It mentions priests, religious teachers and parents, but the
statement devotes far more of its attention to what it says are the
moral responsibilities of political leaders, especially Catholic
leaders, to work against abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, the statement represents an unusually bold stance
for the bishops to take with politicians of their own faith in a
nation where Catholic politicians like President Kennedy once felt
impelled to declare that they would not take their political
positions directly from church authorities.
</P>
<P>
   It also suggests at least the possibility of a greater political
role for the bishops as the nation heads into the 2000 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s the question of what a Catholic politician was
obligated to do on this issue was the focus of a public debate
between Cardinal John O'Connor, archbishop of New York, and former
Gov. Mario Cuomo, who said he personally opposed abortion but was
obligated by law to uphold the right to it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the statement _ adopted by a vote of 217-30 at the
semi-annual meeting of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops
_ is a nuanced document, which underwent a number of revisions
during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It declares, for example, that opposition to abortion and
euthanasia ``does not excuse indifference'' to issues of poverty
and violence, but it also says that ``being `right' '' on other
social issues never excuses ``a wrong choice'' on abortion and
euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tough language, the statement seeks no
ecclesiastical sanctions against officials who do not follow church
teachings on abortion or the other issues, a point emphasized
repeatedly by leading prelates in interviews after the vote. But it
does urge the bishops to speak out to politicians, particularly on
the issue of abortion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``As chief teachers in the church,'' the bishops state, ``we
must therefore explain, persuade, correct and admonish those in
leadership positions who contradict the Gospel of life through
their actions and policies.'' The statement, titled, ``Living the
Gospel of Life: A Challenge to American Catholics,'' also says that
``no appeal to policy, procedure, majority will or pluralism ever
excuses a public official from defending life to the greatest
extent possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal William Keeler, archbishop of Baltimore, said the
document was intended to promote a ``theology of persuasion'' and
was also intended to generate a reflection by all Catholics on the
church's teaching against abortion and euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Although individual prelates, like O'Connor, and groups of
bishops have spoken out in support of anti-abortion legislation and
occasionally criticized politicians who support abortion rights,
never has the bishops' conference declared its members to have an
obligation as teachers of the faith to speak directly to Catholic
politicians on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also contains a stern pastoral warning by the
bishops to Catholic elected officials about the spiritual dangers
of continuing on a course at odds with church teachings against
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We urge those Catholic officials,'' the statement says, ``who
choose to depart from Church teaching on the inviolability of human
life in their public life to consider the consequences for their
own spiritual well-being, as well as the scandal they risk by
leading others into serious sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston and chairman of the
bishops' Pro-Life Committee, which wrote the 26-page statement,
said, ``I think what is new is this is the first time the bishops
as a body have addressed the issue in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal said the statement, which was in the works for two
years, was released after the 1998 congressional elections so it
would not be seen as linked to that election.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the document originated in the bishops' frustration at
the failure of a national effort to ban a late-term abortion
procedure called by its opponents partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But some bishops voiced reservations about how the document
would be be applied by members of the conference and perceived by a
wider public. One prelate said the statement might trigger an
``anti-Catholic'' backlash if people thought the bishops were
attempting to dictate public policy to legislators.
</P>
<P>
   That the bishops will take differing tacks in how they act on
the document was indicated in what some of them said after the
vote. In a news conference, for example, Law said that three
Massachusetts politicians, all Catholics _ democratic Sens. Edward
M. Kennedy and John Kerry, and Republican Gov. Argeo Paul Cellucci
_ were wrong in their support for a legal right to abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's press secretary, Eileen Hoffer, said in response that
the governor ``respectfully disagrees with the cardinal on the
matter of a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued: ``The governor respects the teachings of the
church but feels that the matter of choice is a private matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry did not respond immediately to being singled out by Law.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Kennedy said that he had ``great respect for
Cardinal Law and the Catholic conference but he continues to
support a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has spoken out in the past, suggesting that leaders of
the Catholic Church were wrong to expect public officials of any
faith to advocate a ban on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1984, Kennedy, in an address entitled ``Faith and
Freedom,'' defended the positions of Cuomo and Geraldine Ferraro,
the democratic candidate for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo and Ms. Ferraro both are Catholics and both were involved
in a debate at the time with O'Connor over the moral obligations of
Catholic candidates and officeholders. O'Connor contended then, as
the bishops did Wednesday, that Catholics as public officials have
an obligation to act on the moral teachings of the church.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops' statement also condemns the use of violence or the
threat of violence as a means of promoting ``the cause of life,''
which some bishops said they appreciated in light of the fatal
shooting last month of a Buffalo, N.Y., doctor who provided
abortions.

 Wheeling and Dealing at Comdex   By Dan Fost 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Las Vegas &QL; 
 &QL; 
It's 8 a.m. at the Luxor Hotel and Casino, a glass and steel
pyramid whose excesses might embarrass even a pharaoh. A few slot
machines ring out, but not too many people have started gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pyramid Cafe just off the gaming floor, Martin Sacks sits
at the head of a table of a dozen staffers from International
Microcomputer Software Inc., or IMSI, a $63 million Novato company
that makes a variety of software packages mainly for business users
and designers.
</P>
<P>
   As IMSI's chief executive, Sacks wants a rundown on how Comdex
is treating his company, which paid half a million dollars _ for
booth rental and equipment and staff per diems _ to be there:
What's the reaction to IMSI's products? Who have the executives had
meetings with? Who will they meet with today?
</P>
<P>
   While others gripe about the Comdex noise and clutter, Sacks
relishes the show's throbbing energy. ``Comdex is awesome,'' he
says at the breakfast table, ``because it's the one opportunity to
see where you are. You're talking to customers. You're seeing the
competition. You live in the cocoon of your office, and this is a
good slap-across-the-face reality check.''
</P>
<P>
   A day with Sacks, from sunup to well past sundown, reveals the
pulse that makes Comdex a trade show too big to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Even as companies scale back their presence at the show, they
still send representatives. With an entire industry gathering in
one place, Comdex spawns deals that are consummated for weeks and
months to come.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; rh1  &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; 8:45 &LR;   &UR; a.m. &LR;  Sacks has wolfed down half a grapefruit and a bowl of
corn flakes, and he hops in a cab to get to Las Vegas Convention
Center for the start of his second day at the show.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks, 38, a tan and athletic South African, is on a mission at
this particular Comdex. IMSI faltered in the past two quarters
after seven years of nonstop growth. Last week, the company laid
off 20 people _ the second such layoff this year _ as it moves to
delivering its software over the Internet and invests more than $1
million in new equipment to manage that business.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks isn't gambling in the casinos, but he's betting that the
Web holds the key to future growth, and he plans to scour the show
looking for partnerships that fit with IMSI's new strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Internet use has reached critical mass, Sacks says. ``It's time
for us to make the leap.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 9:35 a.m &LR; . Sacks jumps out of his cab two blocks from the Las
Vegas Convention Center, where traffic is at a standstill. He walks
briskly toward the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin, slow down!'' calls public relations manager Patricia
Roche, struggling to keep up with her long-legged boss.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks can't stop. ``This is Comdex, guys,'' he calls
good-naturedly over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   He spends a moment inside studying a map of the show floor, and
he's off. It's still a quiet time on the floor, as only exhibitors
are allowed in. He heads straight for the Microsoft Partner
Pavilion, checking out other software companies' displays.
</P>
<P>
   Still moving, he pauses at Symantec's booth. ``I check the
karma, see what they're pushing, what they're not pushing,'' he
says. Symantec just bought an IMSI competitor, so he sizes up how
well the new offerings are displayed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10:05 a.m. &LR;  He crosses the hall and leads an Oklahoma-style
land rush into another wing of the show. He pops in on different
booths, looking for friends, striking up partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting stuff is with the smaller companies,'' he
says. ``If IBM or Toshiba do something, you hear about it. With the
smaller companies, you have to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 minutes, he's ready to go. He takes out his mobile
phone and calls a van he's hired for the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, I missed a meeting, and I figure it cost us
$60,000,'' he says. ``We didn't do the deal. Since then, we have a
driver at our disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 10:35 a.m. &LR;  The van pulls up at the Sands Hotel, which has two
floors of Comdex booths. IMSI's booth is on the second floor,
staffed by upbeat workers in matching white shirts promoting the
firm.
</P>
<P>
   The IMSI booth is pushing two products: a Web site,
 &LR; www.arttoday.com, &LR;  that the company acquired just last month, and
a software product, MasterClips Image Server, featuring more than 1
million pieces of clip art.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks heads straight into a meeting with representatives of a
foreign government's military operation, who have bought an IMSI
application for computer-assisted design.
</P>
<P>
   He then chats up the Australians at the booth next door, asking,
``Is there any way we can work together?'' They listen to his
pitch, and in a common trade show ritual, they exchange business
cards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 11:35 a.m. &LR;  Back at his own booth, Sacks schmoozes with Jeff
Bianco, president of GraphicCorp, a Los Angeles company that
provides many of the clip art images. Reflecting the challenge of
IMSI's new Internet business model, the two men kick around ideas
of new ways to pay for and distribute the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1:05 p.m. &LR;  In one of the booth's makeshift conference rooms,
Sacks huddles with Gordon Doran, a Scottish executive with the
Walnut Creek office of LightWork Design, which is selling 3-D
images to IMSI for resale. They discuss the final stages of a
product announcement due for release by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Every conversation is carried at a higher-than-normal volume,
because of the constant crowd noise that fills the room.
</P>
<P>
   As he leaves, Doran voices a common Comdex sentiment: ``This is
the show from hell. This is unbelievable, this place.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 1:30 p.m. &LR;  IMSI sent out for sandwiches, and Sacks is about to
eat his _ and give a reporter a PowerPoint presentation _ when
longtime IMSI Vice President Marty Shapiro pokes his head in.
``Someone from Corbis is here,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Bill Gates' company,'' Sacks says. ``I'd better talk to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacks gets to eat eventually. One reason he doesn't pass up any
opportunity to meet or talk, he says, is cost: For a five-day show,
at 10 hours a day, the money IMSI spent on its Comdex presence
works out to $10,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 3 p.m. &LR;  Sacks heads into a meeting with men in suits, somewhat
of an anomaly at the trade show. The meeting is confidential and
lasts a long time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 5:30 p.m. &LR;  Sacks prowls the show floor and ultimately hooks up
with a friend, the president of another small software company, and
they talk in a quiet spot near a food court.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 6:30 p.m. &LR;  Finally leaving the hall, the IMSI workers happily
walk past a taxi line where people will wait an estimated 90
minutes. Instead, the IMSI van arrives, and a dozen people squeeze
in for the ride back to the Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   Sacks stays in the van, though, and heads to the Mirage casino,
where he's having a dinner that's part business and part social.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 11:30 p.m. &LR;  Sacks is tired, but he's changed into jeans and is
ready for one final adventure: the Leonid meteor shower.
</P>
<P>
   The ballyhooed storm is peaking Tuesday night. Sounds good to
Sacks, who has fond memories of watching Halley's comet from the
cockpit of a 747.
</P>
<P>
   He takes a ride to a spot about 30 miles west of the city, far
enough so the bright lights don't interfere with the stargazing.
</P>
<P>
   The desert is cold at night, and he leans on the warm hood of
the car. The sky is filled with stars, but his small party sees
only a handful of meteors.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; 2 a.m. &LR;  Sacks checks back in to his room at the Luxor. He's
tired, but already thinking about the next day. In less than six
hours, he'll convene another breakfast staff meeting.

 Netscape May Land AOL Deal   By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1998 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
America Online and Netscape Communications reportedly are in talks
to integrate Netscape's Web browser into AOL's online service
instead of or in addition to Microsoft's browser.
</P>
<P>
   The potential deal, reported in yesterday's Wall Street Journal,
could severely undercut Microsoft's leverage in the Internet
market. Quoting anonymous sources, the newspaper speculated that as
part of the deal, AOL might buy an equity stake in Netscape and
pick up a board seat with the Mountain View company.
</P>
<P>
   AOL currently gives its 14 million subscribers access to the Web
through Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser under an exclusive
contract that expires January 1.
</P>
<P>
   But AOL, based in Dulles, Va., may see Microsoft as a growing
competitor. Microsoft is attempting to turn its faltering MSN from
an Internet service provider into an all-in-one ``portal'' site
that would rival AOL for content, Web access and electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Another reason AOL may want to distance itself from Microsoft
is the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which claims Microsoft improperly leveraged its
dominance in operating systems to make strides in the Internet
market, has pitted the software giant against AOL and Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   AOL Senior Vice President David Colburn has testified that AOL
chose Microsoft's Internet Explorer as its Web browser because
Microsoft promised to promote AOL on its Windows operating system.
Microsoft claims it won the deal solely on technical merit.
</P>
<P>
   Still another theory: AOL may be courting Netscape to squeeze
better contract terms out of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   An AOL-Netscape deal ``would be a big win for Netscape,'' said
analyst Jim Balderston of Zona Research in Redwood City. ``If they
land the AOL deal, it could change the perception that Netscape is
dead in the water and re-establish it as a vibrant player in the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Netscape officials had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good relationship with AOL and feel confident the
software we offer them provides distinct and unique advantages to
AOL customers,'' said a Microsoft spokeswoman who didn't want her
name used. ``Besides that, we have no comment on rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of an AOL-Netscape deal come hard on the heels of a rare
legal drubbing for Microsoft. A federal judge in San Jose on
Tuesday ruled that Microsoft must alter Windows 98 and other
products to comply with Sun Microsystem's version of the Java
programming language.
</P>
<P>
   AOL shares, which split yesterday, climbed $8.38 to $83.75.
Netscape stock jumped $10 to $39.25.

U.S. FAILED TO ALERT FRANCE ON IRAQ ATTACK  
(JT) 
 &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ France was not told by the United States or by
Britain precisely when the two countries planned to attack Iraq
last weekend and could not have tipped off Baghdad, senior French
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the French had known, a French official insisted
angrily, Paris would certainly not have passed the information on
to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions were raised last weekend that the Iraqis somehow
learned of the imminence of the attack, whereupon they sent a
letter pledging to allow arms inspectors to begin work once again.
The attack was then called off.
</P>
<P>
   A senior British official said that Paris did not know the exact
timing of the attack. Very few British officials knew, this
official said, and he thought that representatives at the United
Nations would be unlikely to have been among those told.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and British officials said they had no indication that
Baghdad had been tipped off to the imminent air strikes, explaining
that they had not noticed any unusual activity by the Baghdad
authorities on Friday. ``There were things we expected them to
protect that were left exposed,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials said that there was evidence that
the Iraqis were themselves surprised at how close they came to
getting bombed. The officials said there was ``no evidence'' of any
leak to the Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official would not comment on whether Paris knew
about the exact timing of the raid, saying only that Washington was
in close touch with French authorities throughout the crisis. But
the official emphasized that there was no evidence whatever that
the Iraqis were tipped off by anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials in particular had tried to impress on Baghdad
that the threat of force was real and imminent, but anyone watching
television would have known that the Americans were ready to
strike, said Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine,
vehemently rejected a suggestion on Sunday by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., that a French tip-off might explain Saddam's fortuitously
timed letter allowing the United Nations to resume weapons
inspections. McCain himself said later that he had no special
knowledge before making his comments on a Sunday television show.
</P>
<P>
   Vedrine called the accusation ``both shameful and completely
idiotic.'' In fact, he said, ``all the Iraqi leaders had to do was
read the international press and watch CNN to know they were
threatened with an imminent strike, and that certainly played a key
role in the volte-face we all sought.''
</P>
<P>
   Francois Delattre, the French Embassy spokesman here, said he
had little to add to Vedrine's statement except to say that
``French officials are outraged'' by the insinuation at a time when
French and U.S. positions on Iraq are as close as they have ever
been.

 &HT;    GOP Election Day loses cost Boehner high-ranking House post
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Festering anger among House Republicans over
Election Day losses apparently cost U.S. Rep. John Boehner his job
in party leadership at the same time two higher-ranking members
were returned to power.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the first day of the GOP's three-day
organizational conference, Boehner of West Chester was replaced as
conference chairman by a hot, young political star, Rep. J.C. Watts
of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Watts, who becomes fourth in command in the House as Conference
Chairman, is the GOP's first black House leader. He defeated
Boehner 121 to 93 in a secret-ballot vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner issued a statement Wednesday evening, but declined to
talk with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This race began as a contest between allies, and ended as a
contest between allies,'' the statement said. ``J.C. Watts is a
tremendous spokesman for the vision, values and ideas we share as
Republicans, and his presence in the leadership will be a
tremendous boost for our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference chairman runs party meetings and also manages a
$1.1 million budget that is used for a wide variety of
communication operations that includes preparing internal party
documents such as talking points as well as mass-appeal messages
for the public. The job comes with a staff of two dozen, a suite of
offices, and a much-prized office in the Capitol Building.
</P>
<P>
   Boehner held the job since Republicans took control of Congress
in 1994, but the alliances he developed during years of
cross-country fund-raising for Republican congressmen failed to
protect him from the anti-leadership fervor that drove House
Speaker Newt Gingrich to resign within days of the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   In a vote held before the Boehner-Watts race, Republicans
elected U.S. Rep. Bob Livingston of Louisiana to succeed Gingrich
as Speaker. But in a twist, Republicans re-elected a pair of Texans
in the second and third place leadership slots.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Richard Armey defeated two challengers, and
Majority Whip Tom DeLay was unopposed. Armey faced the most
impassioned critics of any of the GOP leaders and needed three
ballots to draw the 113 votes required to claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   Armey's survival, however, diminished Boehner's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's head had to roll,'' said U.S. Rep. Mark Foley of
Florida, who had campaigned for Boehner.
</P>
<P>
   One of Boehner's close friends in the party, U.S. Rep. David L.
Hobson of Springfield, said he spoke with Boehner Tuesday night and
Boehner knew he'd be more vulnerable to defeat if Armey won. But
Boehner still encouraged him to vote for Armey, Hobson said.
</P>
<P>
   For Boehner, the opposition primarily was intangible. Most
members said there was no specific objection to the job Boehner has
done, unlike Armey whom one congressman called ``a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was a deep-seated desire among disappointed
Republicans to punish the leadership team that let Democrats gain
five seats in the House in a year when Democrats were damaged by a
presidential scandal. Coupled with that was the allure of electing
an energetic new face to the leadership team.
</P>
<P>
   ``John had the misfortune of facing a very talented guy,'' said
U.S. Rep. Jerry Lewis of California, a Watts supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Even before he decided to run for Conference Chairman, Watts,
41, had been pegged as a future leader in the party. A former
University of Oklahoma football star whose up-by-his-bootstraps
success story embodies the Republican ideal, Watts was a featured
speaker at the 1996 Republican National Convention, and the
following year gave the Republican response to President Clinton's
State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking Boehner's job, he promised to bring in outside
consultants to help hone the Republican message, and pledged to
arrange meetings with subcommittee chairmen to better integrate
policy development with the communications arm of the party.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to save Boehner's job had a decidedly Buckeye flavor,
with U.S. Rep. John Kasich of Westerville calling members of the
Budget Committee that he runs, U.S. Rep. Rob Portman of Cincinnati
also making calls, and Hobson delivering the closing nomination
speech for Boehner just before the vote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big loss for the conference and a big loss for
Ohio,'' Hobson said. ``This doesn't reflect on the job he did, it's
just that people wanted a change and John's race was the last race
where they felt they could make a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing a member of the senior leadership team cost the state
some prestige, and carries some practical changes as well. The Ohio
delegation loses an assured ear among the top decision makers in
the House, and loses a powerful vote in the party's Steering
Committee, which determines committee chairmen assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hobson's own future in the House is a matter for some
speculation. Hobson's close friendship wi

 &HT;    House Speaker-elect Livingston looks back on his home district
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Communities in U.S. House Speaker-elect Bob
Livingston's district tend to boast about two things: how close
they are to New Orleans and how far they are from New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fitting dichotomy for a conservative district that feeds
off a town that doesn't do much conservatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although only a short drive from the famous attractions of New
Orleans, Slidell has a character and appeal all of its own,'' the
city says in its promotional material. ``Thanks to Lake
Pontchartrain, which separates these two cities, Slidell has
escaped the problems which trouble many large metropolises without
being isolated from the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It's code, says political scientist Wayne Parent of Louisiana
State University, for a district that's easy to pigeonhole: largely
suburban, middle to upper-middle class, white and Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is made up of people who fled New Orleans,'' Parent said.
``They were fleeing what they perceived as crime and all the things
that go along with the big city. Early on I'm sure there were some
racial white-flight things going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who sent Livingston to Washington tend to be folks
who view government as something that is inflicted. People like
Buddy Comeaux, whose furniture and appliance store is down the
block from the high-rise that houses Livingston's district office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government intrusion is the most important thing,'' Comeaux
said. ``It's terrible. I'm expecting somebody from the government
to come in and say that I haven't granted credit equally to my
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Comeaux, fresh from a government probe of an ex-employee's
sexual harassment claim, said he sees government nonsense every day
when he drives down Veterans Highway, a suburban strip a tad past
its prime.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is drive down any street in America today,
and you will see way too many disability parking spaces,'' he
groused. ``You see all kind of foolishness like that.''
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down, baseball card store owner Frank Lucito, a
registered Democrat who votes Republican, also wants government to
spend less and stay off his back. And Lucito, proving that one
man's pork is another man's sirloin, is hopeful that Livingston can
bring home the bacon. ``If it's like the things I've seen on
television, we may get something here, a contract here or there for
the state or whatever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, Comeaux says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that we have to grovel to get our own money back,
but I guess we do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers show that Livingston's district is the state's
wealthiest and most educated. ``And it's probably the whitest
district in Louisiana,'' said David Duke, the former KKK official
elected in September as chairman of the GOP in St. Tammany Parish,
which is in Livingston's district.
</P>
<P>
   St. Tammany is the only Louisiana parish in which registered
Republicans outnumber registered Democrats. At party headquarters
in Covington, Duke continues to espouse the
right-of-right-of-right-of-center politics that has made him a
political lightning rod.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana and national GOP, Duke believes, ``have joined
with the enemies of our heritage who are transforming our great
nation into a Third World reservation of the New World Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who scores well on conservative group's vote
ratings, is part of the problem, according to Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a strong conservative, and we wish him well. But for us
he leaves some things to be desired,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Duke again has a title that entitles him to be
quoted irks local Republicans like Ron Besson, chairman of the West
Jefferson Parish Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think David Duke represents the people of St.
Tammany,'' he said. ``To the average voter there, I think David
Duke is an embarrassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but Duke claims enough popularity around here to have had
a direct role in allowing Livingston to be in position to ascend to
the nation's most powerful job elected on a less-than-statewide
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Livingston thought about joining the legion of
legislators-turned-lobbyists. Duke, who has run well in this part
of Louisiana in his gubernatorial and U.S. Senate elections,
planned to seek Livingston's seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been the odds-on favorite,'' Duke said. He added
that then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, fearing a Duke victory, encouraged
Livingston to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Even the opposition found an upside to Livingston's ascension.
Louisiana Democratic Chairman Ben Jeffers said that if the House
speaker has to be a Republican, he might as well be a Louisianan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The City of New Orleans and the State of Louisiana should
benefit from having the speaker of the House of Representatives
here as a resident,'' Jeffers said.

 &HT;    Governors Bush greet the press
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The governors Bush, brothers-in-lawmaking whose
realm includes one-eighth of all Americans, went directly to center
stage Wednesday as the nation's 31 GOP governors gathered here.
</P>
<P>
   For George W., it marked the first toe in the national political
water since a landslide re-election solidified his position as the
top contender for the GOP presidential nomination in 2000 _ though
he insists he remains undecided about his ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help it,'' Bush said of his front-runner status at a
joint news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Governors Association meeting also gave Jeb Bush,
Florida's governor-elect, a national press audience to announce his
endorsement of his big brother _ if George W. decides a
presidential race is where he wants to take his wife and teen-age
twin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets through that and decides to do it, I've encouraged
him to,'' Jeb said. ``I think he would be an awesome candidate. I'm
going to vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor steadfastly stuck with his
I-haven't-made-up-my-mind line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next question,'' Jeb chimed in, trying unsuccessfully at one
point to bail his brother out of a line of questions about a White
House race.
</P>
<P>
   Are you confident you can do the job, a Washington reporter
asked George W.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me well enough to know the answer to that is yes,''
he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor continued to insist that his decision will be
based on what's best for his family and how a presidential race _
and a national office _ would affect his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   In a roundabout way, he recently got a small taste. It came
during a public event Saturday in the Texas House chamber as his
father, former President George Bush, was subjected to screaming
protesters blaming him for suffering in Iraq. The governor, Texas
first lady Laura Bush and their daughter, Jenna, were with the
former president when he spoke at the Texas Book Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that doesn't bother me,'' the Texas governor said when
asked if moments like that give him pause about a presidential
race. ``I think it really disturbed a lot of people in the
audience. I think my daughter was a little shaken by it all, but it
doesn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he later told daughter Jenna, a 10th-grader, that
``those kinds of things happen when you've got somebody you love in
the public life.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how his daughter would react if protesters blamed him for
thousands of deaths, Bush said, ``I don't think she'd like it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like I didn't like it in 1992 when my dad was running for
president. As some of you may remember, back in those days I
developed a rather thin-skinned reputation. I don't think it was
deserved, but, nevertheless, I developed it because sometimes I
defended my dad's honor in the political process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's Bush-Bush press conference was moved to a larger
room to accommodate the large press throng, certifying that the
brothers are big news in The Big Easy. It's a result of a
combination of things: who their dad is; what George W. might
become; and the fact that, as a Reform Party member, the
governor-elect formerly known as ``The Body,'' Minnesota's Jesse
Ventura, is not here.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to New Orleans, Bush of Texas knew what he and
Jeb would face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is going to try to elbow their way in to
have a picture with me and my brother,'' he said last week. ``Kind
of the debut of the two elected governors with the same last name
from the same family. I think people are going to want to see Jeb
and I interact with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   They interacted Wednesday as politicians and brothers. ``I've
been telling him what to do since _ how old are you?'' George W.
said to Jeb.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot younger than you,'' replied Jeb, seven years younger.
</P>
<P>
   As George W. droned on with his theory that it's difficult for
Congress to set a national agenda, Jeb wedged in with: ``Can I
disagree on one thing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just make sure it is a minor point,'' cautioned big brother.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeb got the last word when George W. said, ``I didn't grow
up wanting to be president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did,'' said Jeb.

IF DEION IS COWBOYS' MVP, FORGET A LONG PLAYOFF RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All hail to Deion. Notice please, the feet-kissing frenzy that
has engulfed a segment of local star-on-the-helmet-gazers. And from
that same group also comes word that the coronation committee has
met and voted. Deion is hereby proclaimed ``King of Football.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Best-Dressed in North Texas?
</P>
<P>
   The Deion Fan Club squealed with its loudest glee after that
wild one the other day in Tempe, Ariz., a game that in their
gooey-eyed estimation proved a point.
</P>
<P>
   See there, they told us, The Blessed One is player of the year
in the NFL, Defensive player of the year in the NFL, and most
certainly, the one player the Cowboys could not do without.
</P>
<P>
   Something about what Jake, the Arizona Snake, did with Deion in
the game, and then what Jake accomplished when Deion was on the
sidelines, sitting it out with a toe ache.
</P>
<P>
   But in telling that Tempe story, why not tell it all? And the
truth shall be along shortly. But first ...
</P>
<P>
   Through 10 games this season, Sanders is the Cowboys' MVP. Don't
take my word for it. Just ask him. He'll tell you.
</P>
<P>
   From here, however, project the Cowboys through the final six
regular-season games, which would be the end of December. At that
time, if Deion is still being touted as the Cowboys' most valuable,
then it's a team that will be making a quick January exit. There
will be no playoff payoff.
</P>
<P>
   When January arrives, the real MVP had better come from an
assortment of Emmitt, Larry Allen, Troy, Michael, even Ernie Mills
or Billy Davis, which is not an outrageous theory any longer. Or
put Chan Gailey in there as MVP.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are going to be about offensive production. This is
a Cowboys' season that has been about offensive production all
along, except Troy Aikman's absence for five games caused a long
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Deion is going to be a big factor in the playoffs, but success
won't hinge on a cornerback-punt returner. It's going to come down
to how many holes the line opens for Emmitt Smith, and what he does
with those holes. Or how many weapons besides Michael Irvin does
Aikman have in the passing game, which at the moment is several.
</P>
<P>
   Winning in the weak NFL of today is about offense. Winning in
Tempe last Sunday was about five red-zone touchdowns in five trips.
</P>
<P>
   Denver is not the league's best team because of its defense _
does Denver even have a defense? In a shaky NFC, Minnesota is tops
among a jello group, but name one Vikings defensive starter. See
there. If those two teams meet in the Super Bowl, the final score
will be 60-50, and I'm guessing Denver will have the six-oh.
</P>
<P>
   The second-best thing about the game in Tempe was the Cowboys
showed their first sign of offensive dominance under Gailey. The
best thing was the W, although the finish came with a heart attack
attached.
</P>
<P>
   And, oh yeah, about that Deion factor, or nonfactor, last
Sunday:
</P>
<P>
   When Jake Plummer put on a Joe Montana show, bringing back the
Cardinals from deficits of 28-0 and 35-14, the We-Love-Deion club
says The Snake prospered because Sanders was on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   No, he wasn't. Not the whole time. Deion was back at his corner
when Plummer whipped the Cardinals on a 70-yard scoring drive,
cutting the Dallas lead to 35-28. Deion was also out there when
Plummer rallied the Cardinals from their own 22 to the Dallas 5,
and did so in exactly 43 seconds. You do remember what happened
from there.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sanders was limping, but as usual, Plummer didn't throw in
his direction anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Smith was bounced around in the Plummer passing spree, but
Kevin was also playing injured. Since the Cowboys were desperate at
cornerback, Smith gamely stayed in despite a separated shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   When Sanders was out, Charlie Williams tried to hang in as his
replacement. Williams was toasted more than once, but he's not even
a corner.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Plummer had the same second-half success against
Sanders-Smith as he did against Smith-Williams. Jake threw for 314
yards in the second half, and 124 of it came in the final four
minutes when you-know-who had returned.
</P>
<P>
   For one game anyway, it was Jake Plummer who looked like the
``King of Football.'' Deion is what he is _ the MVP thus far of the
Cowboys. For the future good of the team, that needs an offensive
change, starting Sunday vs. Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, let the slobbering continue.

OSU'S COOPER STEELS HIMSELF FOR MICHIGAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now a short break from the buildup to the USC-UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   There are actually some other rivalry games this week, and some
major eye-twitching by coaches worried about the devastating effect
a loss will have on, among other things, recruiting, booster
support and job security. And not necessarily in that order.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ohio State coach John Cooper. (Please.) He's 1-8-1 against
Michigan, having lost in 1990, 1993, 1995 and 1997 when a victory
would have earned a Rose Bowl berth, and in 1996 when a victory
would have brought a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Cooper's secretly pleased that the Buckeyes'
national-title hopes were dashed by Michigan State, because it
deprived Michigan of ruining his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get away from it,'' Cooper told reporters this week.
``You guys don't let me forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an old Cooper stand-by, to blame the media. But even he
admitted that his record against Michigan dogs him ``about 365 days
a year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, (the fans) have been pretty nice, I guess,'' Copper
added. ``There are negative comments... that people make, but
that's not going to change. Some people would not be pleased if we
won every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in the panhandle, the Florida-Florida State game has BCS
implications, with both teams ranked in the top five. The schools
fight each other in the talent-rich Sunshine state for recruits, so
this game means just about everything to both programs.
</P>
<P>
   Local legends Bobby Bowden and Steve Spurrier were both crying
the blues this week, but for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden's still trying to get over the loss of starting
quarterback Chris Weinke, and lamenting his team's 17-point
``victory'' over Wake Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst I felt after a game since N.C. State,'' Bowden
said, referring to FSU's lone loss this season on Sept.12. ``It's
because we looked so futile on offense... with the biggest game of
the year coming up. We really have got to go back to square one
offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   And then you have the surly Spurrier, who couldn't resist
alluding to the Seminoles' penchant for knocking quarterbacks out
of games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have mentioned in the past that (knocking out the
opponent's QB) is their goal,'' Spurrier said. ``I'm not going to
put words in their mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   You just did, coach.
</P>
<P>
   If Ohio State and Florida lose Saturday, get ready for plenty of
alibis.
</P>
<P>
   Clemson search begins: Last week, the New Orleans Times-Picayune
reported that Clemson athletic director Bobby Robinson spoke with
Cincinnati athletic director Bob Goin to get information about
Tulane coach Tommy Bowden. Goin was in the Florida State athletic
department when Bowden was on his father Bobby's staff at FSU.
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches being mentioned in connection with the Clemson job
are former head coach Danny Ford and Mississippi coach Tommy
Tuberville.
</P>
<P>
   We want a refund: A few weeks ago, Kansas State installed goal
posts made by Merchants Environmental Industries of Chicago. The
goal posts were guaranteed to be indestructible.
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. While it took Wildcats fans more than 30 minutes to
finally snap off the crossbar and uprights after Saturday's
Nebraska game, the goal posts in one end zone failed to live up to
the Chicago company's claim.
</P>
<P>
   The company has sent a replacement to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Gator Bowl bound: Georgia Tech can secure a Gator Bowl berth
with a victory over Wake Forest as the ACC's second team. Who will
they play? The Jacksonville, Fla.-based bowl is hoping for another
Notre Dame loss, which would mean the Irish would be out of the BCS
picture and in the Gator Bowl's to play Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Aloha Buffs? The Aloha Bowl is hoping it can pair Colorado
against USC in its Dec.25 contest but doesn't like the idea of
waiting until the Buffaloes play Nebraska on Neb.27 or the Dec.5
Big 12 title game to offer an invitation, which gives fans less
time for travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Family man: Colorado was not a bowl team last season for the
first time since 1988. After Saturday's 37-8 win over Iowa State,
coach Rick Neuheisel said, ``I spent Christmas Day at home last
season and it stunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking to the back of the room, he saw his wife, Susan, and
their three boys. Neuheisel quickly audibled: ``Sorry, honey. I
didn't mean it quite like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Subliminal message: As Texas went its through its walk-through
Friday at Texas Tech, the Jones Stadium scoreboard kept flashing
the 1997 score _ Texas Tech 27, Texas 10 _ and a picture of Red
Raiders running back Ricky Williams. Tech won 42-35.
</P>
<P>
   Fast fact: Missouri has lost three games this season _ all to
opponents that, at the time, were in the Top 10 (Texas A&AMP;M, Ohio
State, Nebraska). Not that it was any surprise, because Missouri
has a 34-game losing streak to Top 10 teams dating to 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Fast fact, the sequel: Miami has blocked 30 punts in 42 games
under coach Butch Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Finally: Texas running back Ricky Williams needs 62 yards in the
Longhorns' season finale against Texas A&AMP;M on Nov.27 to pass Tony
Dorsett as Division I-A's all-time leading rusher. &QL;

MEDIA SERVICES MERGER CALLED OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y.)  (rl) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A merger that would have created a giant media
services agency, ranking among the world's three largest, has
unexpectedly been called off.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago and MacManus Group in New York said
Wednesday that they had ended almost a year of negotiations to
combine their media operations. The talks began by exploring a
merger outside the United States, then expanded into a proposed
worldwide venture that would have encompassed planning and buying
for television, radio, print, the Internet and other media.
</P>
<P>
   Such a merger of the operations _ Starcom Media Services, owned
by Burnett, and Televest, part of MacManus _ would have brought
under one roof media accounts with billings estimated at $12
billion for marketers like Allstate, Amoco, Diageo PLC., the
M&AMP;M/Mars unit of Mars Inc., the Paramount Pictures unit of Viacom
Inc., J.C. Penney, Philip Morris and Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   The merger discussions were indicative of a boom that is
altering Madison Avenue as more agencies spin off their media
services functions into stand-alone units like Televest; Starcom;
the Media Edge, part of Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc.; and Mediacom
Worldwide, owned by Grey Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Such spinoffs are intended to compete against huge media-only
agencies like Carat International, a unit of Aegis Group PLC, and
Zenith Media Services, owned by Cordiant Communications Group PLC
and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   But the abrupt halt to the talks is a reminder that even as
merger mania sweeps the agency industry, not every deal envisioned
will be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We announced our engagement and called off the marriage,''
said Roy J. Bostock, chairman and chief executive of MacManus, in a
telephone interview. MacManus also owns such agencies as D'Arcy
Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications and N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going in that we had different organizational ideas
but thought we would be able to overcome those differences,'' he
said. ``We simply weren't able to, so we decided to go our separate
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard B. Fizdale, Burnett chairman and chief executive, echoed
those thoughts in a separate interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies are very good at what we do,'' Fizdale said,
``but we go about doing it in different ways that were very
difficult to pull together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those difficulties were exacerbated in the USA,'' he added,
``because as we got to major, more sophisticated markets, the
issues we faced became less simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger A. Haupt, vice chairman and chief operating officer at
Burnett, who joined Fizdale for the interview, said: ``It's a very
large and complex operation to try and bring together in 84
countries two companies that over time developed differently. We
came to the conclusion that proceeding would ultimately not be in
our best interest.''
</P>
<P>
   And there may not be anything wrong with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would congratulate both of them for not doing this deal,''
said Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media newsletter
published by Myers Consulting Group LLC in New York, ``because it
was hard to imagine these two together.''
</P>
<P>
   A merger ``would have produced a very strange animal,'' he said,
because the media services agencies are ``the antithesis'' of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Mandese praised Televest as ``being the best `commodities' buyer
in the business'' with ``tough negotiators'' who concentrate on
purchasing television commercial time ``efficiently and cost
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Starcom as ``strategically driven,'' focusing on
``creating a sense of brand with original research and proprietary
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussions to link Starcom and Televest were closely
watched because of speculation that a combination would presage a
merger of Burnett and MacManus; both are privately owned, and they
share clients such as Coca-Cola, General Motors and P &AMP; G. The
no-go disclosure came as a surprise because trade publications had
reported that the negotiations were fairly far along.
</P>
<P>
   But in a joint statement, Bostock and Fizdale said that top
executives had made a ``mutual decision'' against merging.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we have a great deal of respect for one another,''
Fizdale and Bostock said in the statement, ``we had enough
fundamental differences of opinion on how best to run such a
massive operation, especially in the U.S., that we have chosen not
to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about suggestions that personnel issues helped derail the
merger, Bostock said in the telephone interview, ``We never got to
who would do what'' because ``we never got past the organizational
issue.'' Irwin Gotlieb is president and chief executive of Televest
and Jack Klues, an executive vice president at Burnett, is chairman
of Starcom.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scrapping of the merger, which would have created a
media services behemoth with the likely name of Starvest, Bostock
said that ``global media consolidation is going to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he added, MacManus would now revive plans, which had
been tabled during the merger talks, to ``develop our own
independent global media company,'' effective Jan. 1. The
stand-alone unit would combine Televest, which covers the United
States, with media services operations in markets like Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As for Starcom, any fallout from the merger's abandonment is
being cushioned by a skein of recent media assignments from large
marketers like Diageo, with billings estimated at $150 million;
Sara Lee Corp., with billings estimated at $100 million, and
Walgreen Co., with billings estimated at $40 million. A Starcom
sibling, LB Media in London, was named to handle the consolidated
British television buying account for Procter &AMP; Gamble, with
billings estimated at $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   Televest has also recently gained a plum assignment; Coca-Cola
formally named the agency to help develop a worldwide television
programming strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Kari Bjorhus, manager for marketing communications at Coca-Cola
in Atlanta, confirmed a report of the assignment this week in the
trade publication Advertising Age. Televest will seek television
series in various markets, beginning in Europe, for Coca-Cola to
buy or sponsor. Shows would be licensed to television networks in
exchange for advertising time.

NORTH KOREA OFFERS LOOK AT SECRET PLANT, AT STEEP PRICE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ North Korea has demanded that the United States pay
hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to inspect a huge
underground center that U.S. intelligence analysts fear houses a
nuclear-weapons program, Clinton administration officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The United States rejected the request during meetings this week
in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between North Korean
officials and a U.S. government delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we expected, the North Koreans brought up the issue of
compensation, and we flatly rejected it,'' said State Department
Spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how much money the North Koreans had demanded, Rubin said
payment of the fee was ``so not on as a possibility that I don't
care to get into the figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Other administration officials said the fee would have been
hundreds of millions of dollars; one put it at $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans have denied that the complex, which is being
built on a mountainside about 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the
former North Korean nuclear research center, is intended to be used
for a nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   They have repeatedly said U.S. inspectors could visit the site
as long as Washington agreed to pay a large fee in compensation for
what the North Koreans describe as the administration's slander.
</P>
<P>
   The North Korean representative at the United Nations, Kim Chang
Guk, said last week that the United States could inspect the site
``on condition that when it is confirmed not to be a nuclear
facility, the United States should pay compensation for slandering
and defaming my country.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies fear that by building the complex,
North Korea may have decided to abandon a four-year-old agreement
with the United States in which North Korea pledged to give up its
nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation, led by Charles Kartman, President Clinton's
special envoy on North Korean issues, left Pyongyang on Wednesday
after 12 hours of negotiations over three days with a team from the
North Korean Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The talks ended as Clinton began a trip to Asia that will
include a visit to South Korea, where the issue of the North Korean
construction site is expected to be among the major topics
discussed with President Kim Dae-jung.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the U.S. delegation to North Korea had pressed for
access to the site. ``We told them that access to the site is
essential,'' he said. ``We've expected that this would be
difficult, and we told the North Koreans, as we've said before,
that verbal assurances, as they are wont to give, are simply
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said the construction of the underground
site may not yet have technically violated the accord, because
there is no evidence that North Korea has begun pouring cement for
a new reactor or a reprocessing plant to convert nuclear waste to
bomb-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   But if the United States determines that North Korea has revived
its nuclear program, Rubin said, ``it would go against the entire
letter and spirit of the objectives of the agreement, and it would
affect the viability of the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has expressed growing concern over North
Korea's intentions after several provocative acts, including the
underground construction near Yongbyon and the test firing last
August of a missile over Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Clinton named former Defense Secretary William Perry
to review U.S. policy toward North Korea. Administration officials
say Perry is being asked to study ways to salvage the 1994 nuclear
agreement with North Korea, which had been among the
administration's proudest achievements in foreign policy.

REPUBLICANS ENDORSE LIVINGSTON, EJECT OTHERS
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to correct name of the Cannon Office Building, update

(htv) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two weeks of bloodletting over their
leadership, House Republicans sent a mixed message Wednesday about
the image they want to project in the coming 106th Congress: they
kept some leaders and threw out others, producing a team with a
strong conservative cast that includes the party's first black
leader.
</P>
<P>
   In what was a foregone conclusion, the party unanimously
endorsed Rep. Robert Livingston of Louisiana as its nominee for
speaker. He will replace Newt Gingrich, who resigned under pressure
after the party lost seats in the Nov. 3 midterm elections.
Livingston is to be elected speaker by the whole House on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans kept Dick Armey as majority leader after an intense
four-way struggle and Tom DeLay as majority whip. Both men, who are
strong conservatives, are from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But they ejected John Boehner of Ohio as Republican Conference
chairman, replacing him with J.C. Watts of Oklahoma, the first
black Republican in a leadership role in modern times. And they
repudiated John Linder of Georgia as chairman of the National
Republican Congressional Committee, replacing him with Thomas Davis
of Virginia. Both Boehner and Linder bore some blame for the
party's midterm stumble, in which it lost five House seats.
</P>
<P>
   The party put two women in its lowest leadership positions.
</P>
<P>
   The voting by secret ballot Wednesday took place behind the
closed doors of the ornate caucus room in the Cannon Office
Building. Emerging midway through the day, Livingston stood with
some of his new team, including Armey, with whom he and DeLay have
had frosty relations.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a tone of low-key conciliation, Livingston pronounced
his party ``united,'' adding: ``We're all going to have to work
together,'' a daunting task that will entail ``reaching out to
Democrats,'' given the party's narrow six-vote majority and the
strength of its ideological wings on the left and on the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the American people to know that they are going to get
good, clean, honest, efficient government from us,'' Livingston
added. ``We muffed our message a little bit in the last
elections,'' he conceded. ``We may have slipped, but we haven't
fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's priorities, he and others made clear, would be to
save Social Security and enact tax cuts before the elections in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats sitting on the sidelines gloated that the Republicans
had failed to make a clean sweep of their leadership and put a
fresh face on their party. ``On the issues, there is no difference
between Newt Gingrich and the new Republican leaders,'' said Roy
Romer, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The most intense action of the day came during the protracted
four-way race for majority leader, the No. 2 in command. Armey won
a majority of votes only after a third ballot, and seemed somewhat
the bloodier for it. A relieved Armey described the ordeal as a
``merry chase.''
</P>
<P>
   But his closest challenger, Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, an
ardent conservative and charter member of the revolutionary class
of 1994, brooded after the battle: ``Steve Largent has been too
slow and too small his whole life, and this is just one more
occasion,'' he said, a reference to criticism early in his football
career, which was rocky in the beginning but culminated in his
induction into the Hall of Fame. ``But I will tell you that I'm not
accustomed to losing, and I don't like to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Also spurned for majority leader was Rep. Jennifer Dunn of
Washington, the first woman to aim for a top leadership position,
who declared that even her attempt to run for office was a
milestone.
</P>
<P>
   And a fledgling effort to draft Dennis Hastert of Illinois as
majority leader fell flat. In the first round of balloting, Armey
won 100 votes, Largent 58, Ms. Dunn 45 and Hastert 18. With no one
winning a clear majority of 112, the person coming in last,
Hastert, was dropped and a second ballot was held. On the second,
Armey won 99, Largent 73 and Ms. Dunn 49. On the third, Armey won
127 and Largent 95.
</P>
<P>
   Once Hastert and Ms. Dunn were eliminated, the moderates had no
one to support. They have never liked Armey, but some said
Wednesday that they found Largent too inflexible and inexperienced
and had no choice but to support Armey.
</P>
<P>
   ``There clearly was an anti-Armey sentiment in the conference,
and people felt it was time to get rid of him,'' said one moderate
who did not want to be identified. ``But in the end, the moderates
just couldn't go with Largent. It was more like going with the old
devil we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all moderates agreed. ``He'd look you in the eye and act as
though he was listening to you, then do the opposite,'' said one,
reflecting a ``complete puzzlement'' as to how Armey got elected.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio of New York, who ran Armey's campaign, said the
Texan won in part because there was a change above him, a change
below him and people wanted a steady hand at the tiller.
</P>
<P>
   After retaining Armey, the party ousted two other incumbents
from its hierarchy. In what some described as a burst of
indignation, Republicans rejected Boehner as conference chairman.
The chairman is responsible for presenting the party's message to
the public and communicating leadership decisions and party policy.
</P>
<P>
   Watts blamed the leaders directly for the party's losses in the
midterm elections. ``I'm a public relations major,'' he said. ``And
one of the things I found out in public relations is it's very hard
to P.R. a bad product. And we had a very bad product as Republicans
coming down the stretch. And whether it was true or not, the
perception was the presidential problems and Monica Lewinsky became
our agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But this criticism was mild compared with what Boehner said on
the Sunday after the Nov. 3 elections. He went on television and
placed the blame for Republican losses foursquare at the feet of
Gingrich. ``The problems, in terms of managing the House, were
mostly in the speaker's office,'' Boehner said on the ABC News
program ``This Week.'' And, he said, the resignation of Gingrich
represented ``enough change.''
</P>
<P>
   But after voting Wednesday to retain Armey, some Republicans
said they were desperate to present some change in leadership and
took it out on Boehner. Watts beat him, 121-93.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for chairman of the campaign committee, Davis beat
Linder 130 to 77. Davis is a fiscal conservative but one of the few
prominent Republicans who supports abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I was chosen this year tells you a lot about how
we've listened to voters,'' Davis told reporters. ``Two years ago,
I wouldn't have been electable in this conference.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the leadership ladder, Tillie Fowler of Florida
was elected vice chairwoman of the Republican Conference and
Deborah Pryce was retained, unchallenged, as secretary of the
conference.

CATHOLIC LEADERS DECRY RACISM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CECILE S. HOLMES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ America's Catholic bishops deplored racism
Wednesday as a sinful scar on religious and secular life, urging
local dioceses help end it within the church and across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In their fall session, the bishops also adopted a statement
relating church teaching to personal and public behavior. Titled
``Living the Gospel of Life: A Challenge to American Catholics,''
it condemns abortion, physician-assisted suicide, capital
punishment and other attacks ``on innocent human life.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was adopted after extended discussion, including
calls from a liberal bishop that a document ``on life'' should also
specifically oppose ``weapons of mass destruction.'' The statement
was not adopted until a sentence was added condemning violence
against abortion clinics and physicians who do abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic elected officials are the statement's most direct
target. It advises them to espouse church teaching in speaking and
voting on related legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call on them to reflect on the grave contradiction of
assuming public roles and presenting themselves as credible
Catholics when their actions on fundamental issues of human life
are not in agreement with church teaching,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Joseph A. Fiorenza of Houston said most Catholic leaders
in his region conform to the statement's call for a ``consistent
ethic'' of human life. The church views and teaches that life is
``a continuum that applies from conception through birth to natural
death.''
</P>
<P>
   The bishops have charted a centrist course this week, balancing
competing voices and interests in the conference and in the 60
million-member American church. Tuesday, they elected Fiorenza, a
moderate and a longtime advocate of racial justice, as their
president. Bishop Wilton D. Gregory of Belleville, Ill., was
elected conference vice president, becoming the first black to hold
that post. Their elections sounded a conciliatory note in sharp
contrast to the social discord portrayed in the discussion on
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Racism is not an individual problem, the bishops said in an
informal report presented by Bishop Curtis Guillory, auxiliary
bishop to African-Americans in the Diocese of Galveston-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Dismantling racist attitudes in a democracy where citizens once
purchased blacks as slaves, forced Indians onto reservations and
denied equal education to Hispanic immigrant children calls for
systematic solutions, the bishops said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Race is the number one socially defining issue in the United
States,'' the report stated. Despite progress, churches remain
segregated, stereotypes are taken as accurate and racism breeds
violence, Guillory said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial incidents still remind us it is a scar on society and
the church,'' the bishop said. Earlier this year in Jasper, Texas,
49-year-old African-American James Byrd Jr. was beaten, chained to
the back of a pickup and dragged to his death. A few weeks ago in
Virginia, a black man was burned and beheaded. There are 140
Internet sites pushing racial hatred, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's three bishops and Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony
linked the statement on ``the sanctity and dignity of human life''
to the racism discussion. ``The racism discussion comes in on the
dignity aspect,'' Guillory said. Fellow Bishop James A. Tamayo,
Houston diocesan auxiliary to Hispanics, added that respecting that
dignity means removing barriers created by ethnicity, gender or
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The national bishops published a statement in 1979 calling
ending racism. Three years ago Houston's three bishops issued a
pastoral letter, ``Many Members, One Body,'' urging parishes cease
allowing ethnic differences to divide people.
</P>
<P>
   The national church and the Houston diocese are increasingly
diverse and multicultural. Among ethnic groups there are an
estimated 3.4 million African-American Catholics, 22 million
Hispanics, 2 million Asians and 500,000 Native Americans. Among the
Houston diocese's 1.2 million Catholics, a figure including those
not registered with a parish, there are 500,000 Hispanics, 80,000
blacks, 73,000 Asians, and a small number of Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Houston bishops issued their letter, workshops have
been held in about 50 percent of the diocese's 160 parishes to
teach reconciliation, Guillory said. Those workshops explore
stereotypes, build trust and link ethnically diverse people.
Parishes have exchanged pastors for Sunday worship across racial
lines. Some churches ``twin'' with others, he said, so that a
mostly white suburban parish may operate an outreach in a Hispanic
inner-city one.

 A TASTE OF HOME FOR U.S. TROOPS IN KUWAIT

   CAMP DOHA, Kuwait _ Only a few U.S. soldiers actually landed
here before President Clinton called off air strikes against Iraq
last weekend. Most of them are going home soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the camp itself, the main funnel for Army troops into
Kuwait, stands as evidence that military planners expect their
return, or at least a long U.S. presence, in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   There is a movie theater here, with free popcorn, that runs all
day. There are 2,000 bicycles, six personal self-propelled
watercraft, two boats, sailing lessons and 85 sets of scuba gear,
as well as a growing number of private or semiprivate rooms with
television sets, videocassette recorders and microwave ovens.
Soldiers can eat free hot dogs and hamburgers at Uncle Frosty's
Desert Oasis.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, workers busily spackled the joints of new walls
and set up ventilation ducts in a new section of a gymnasium that
is already huge, with dozens of treadmills, Stairmasters and
Nautilus machines, a basketball court and an aerobics room, not to
mention the big television set that blares MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they are going to put in a sauna,'' a spokeswoman
for the Army, Capt. Tamara Parker, said as a group of visiting
British soldiers gawked at the distinctly American scale of the
gym.
</P>
<P>
   What all the amenities boil down to is making a larger number of
troops comfortable for a longer period of time. The complex, Camp
Doha, was founded in the gulf war in 1991. It has slowly expanded
into a permanent and extremely well-stocked post for 800 or 900
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly an ongoing United States commitment to assure
our neighbors here in the Middle East of our long-term commitment
to this region,'' the head officer, Lt. Col. Sean Finnegan, said
Wednesday. ``We are also here as part of deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the frills the camp, on the gulf outside of Kuwait
City, has a major military objective. The Army keeps on standby
enough tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, artillery, medical
helicopters and other gear to outfit 5,200 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that troops can arrive here, receive their
equipment and be armed and in the field in less than a day. That is
exactly what happened in February, in the last U.S. confrontation
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In more peaceful times up to 1,500 soldiers rotate through Doha
to a desert firing range 30 miles from the Iraqi border for three
months of training, partly with the Kuwaiti military. In addition
to keeping a force in the region the training also keeps the
equipment ready for battle.
</P>
<P>
   If the accommodations seems deluxe, military officials say, it
is to make up for the higher potential for danger. The soldiers
seem blase about their surroundings. Specialist Kasson Carter, 23,
of Charleston, S.C., who was watching friends play video games in
Uncle Frosty's, said Doha reminded him of another posting where the
United States has had to keep its soldiers for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, but I'm used it,'' he said. ``I've been in Korea,
where they have as much as here.''

BELLE OR WILLIAMS, WHOM WILL THE YANKEES SIGN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most baseball decisions are based on numbers _
productivity, home runs, runs batted in. But amateur psychology has
played a large role in the New York Yankees' decision to pursue the
volatile slugger Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won a record 125 games in 1998 with extraordinary
clubhouse harmony, with the steady Bernie Williams inhabiting a
corner locker and a leadership role. Because they have been unable
to reach a new agreement with Williams, who is a free agent, the
Yankees may sign Belle by the weekend and replace one of the team's
most stable personalities with another talented player who is well
known for his explosive temper and perceived selfishness. Club
officials have asked around and asked themselves: How would Belle
fit in?
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the Yankee organization believe that Belle can
be successfully indoctrinated into the clubhouse of Manager Joe
Torre, and that the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox may forward
offers for Belle Thursday or Friday, with both teams knowing that
the slugger _ who drove in 152 runs for the Chicago White Sox last
summer _ wants to command the highest salary in the game, at $14
million a season. The Yankees might be willing to dangle a three-to
four-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee officials Wednesday played host to Brian Jordan, another
free-agent outfielder, at Yankee Stadium, and afterward, Jordan
said he was interested in the Yankees, in part because of their
history and because of their dedication to winning. Executives with
other teams strongly believe, however, that Jordan will sign with
the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, Williams' agent, has asked for a meeting with the
Yankees' principal owner, George Steinbrenner, a summit that may
occur as soon as Thursday in Florida. Boras, who could not be
reached for comment Wednesday, has maintained that there was a
vigorous market for Williams' skills, though he would not identify
the teams involved. But it appears that at the very least, the
number of teams involved in the bidding for Williams has dwindled.
And some of those that might have interest do not appear to be
willing to give Williams anywhere near the $100 million figure that
Boras mentioned when the center fielder became a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was expected to meet Thursday with officials from the
Boston Red Sox, one of three teams known to be in the running for
his services; the Yankees and the Arizona Diamondbacks, too, are
fully acknowledging continued interest in him.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, however, have made it clear that they were not
willing to give Williams the sort of package to which Boras has
referred; all along, members of the organization have suggested
that any offer would contain no more than five years and maybe a
little bit more than $11 million a season. (Neither Boras nor
Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman will say whether the team has
actually made an offer.) Arizona officials are saying privately
that they would like to have Williams, but that ultimately, they
might be willing to offer a four-year deal for something in the
range of $9 million to $10 million a season.
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the Yankees eventually will have forwarded the
best offer for Williams. Cashman reiterated Wednesday that in any
event, he wants a viable hitter in the middle of his lineup. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Cone, the veteran pitcher, was asked by club officials
about how Belle would fit in among his peers. Speaking from his
Connecticut home Wednesday, Cone said, ``I think everybody feels
we've got enough leaders in the clubhouse to give him some
coverage.'' &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Apart from the Yankees' Belle-Williams intrigue, there continues
to be a flurry of negotiations and dealing around the game:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Boston Red Sox, wary, too, of being unable to sign either
Williams or Belle, have expressed interest in trading for Montreal
outfielder Rondell White.
</P>

LOUISIANA COMPANY MAKES BARGAIN DEAL FOR PILGRIM N-PLANT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: La.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEC Energy has agreed to transfer its Pilgrim nuclear power
plant in Plymouth to a Louisiana utility in a complex
cash-and-financing transaction, according to people familiar with
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, expected to be announced Thursday, will make New
Orleans-based Entergy Corp. one of the largest new operators aiming
to sell generation services as New England states open power
markets to competition.
</P>
<P>
   While hardly lucrative for BEC, the parent of Boston Edison Co.,
the agreement will clear the way for the local utility to pursue
plans to expand its electricity marketing-and-distribution
businesses, or to sell itself outright.
</P>
<P>
   BEC has already sold its nonnuclear generating assets as part of
the state's electricity deregulation plan passed last year. Under
the legislation, designed to lower electricity prices,
investor-owned utilities are selling their plants to outside
companies like Entergy, which will compete to provide homes and
businesses with power.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; People familiar with the matter said that under an agreement
signed by executives of both companies Wednesday night, BEC would
transfer Pilgrim to Entergy in return for $80 million to $90
million in cash, depending on audits of the assets.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Entergy will receive as much as $266 million in new
BEC borrowings to cover the costs of cleaning up the plant when it
ceases operations, scheduled for 2012.
</P>
<P>
   The deal doesn't come close to covering the $650 million book
value of &UR;  &LR; Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   But with deregulation plans removing nuclear rate guarantees,
analysts had grown concerned whether BEC could operate Pilgrim
profitably at all, let alone sell it for anywhere close to its face
value.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with similar difficulties, other nuclear plant operators
in the region have failed to find any buyers and have closed
facilities outright, such as the Maine Yankee reactor in Wiscasset,
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   But people familiar with the thinking of BEC executives said the
company was pleased to avoid that outcome and to strike a deal that
will keep the 670-megawatt Pilgrim facility &UR;  &LR; in operation. Its
continued power supply will also keep prices stable in the region,
an important factor as BEC shifts to become a distribution and
marketing organization.
</P>
<P>
   While other utilities are scrambling after gas-fired power
plants, Entergy is pursuing a contrarian strategy to take advantage
of its relatively strong record as a nuclear operator. Entergy's
five other reactors have never been on the federal government's
``watch list'' of the worst-run nuclear facilities. In 1997 the
plants operated at 90 percent of their total capacity, compared
with an industry average of 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim's staff of about 675 will become Entergy employees, and
people familiar with the deal said Entergy doesn't anticipate
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   However, these people said Entergy won't recognize contracts
covering about half of Pilgrim's work force and instead plans to
begin negotiations with their union, the Utility Workers Union of
America, to reach new agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The union had previously filed a complaint to the National Labor
Relations Board against BEC, charging the company hadn't bargained
in good faith over the terms of the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, Entergy was bidding for Pilgrim against
a competing offer from AmerGen Energy Co., a joint venture of Peco
Energy Co. in Philadelphia and British Energy PLC.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the discussions said the key to Entergy's bid
was its treatment of the cleanup costs at Pilgrim, which are
similar to those facing all nuclear plants licensed to run for 40
years after their start date.
</P>
<P>
   Pilgrim's license expires in 14 years, at which time BEC
estimates it will cost $620 million to clean up radioactive
materials there.
</P>
<P>
   But Entergy executives believe they can achieve the same results
for just $585 million by coordinating efforts with cleanups at the
five other nuclear reactors they own, in Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Charges collected from ratepayers to cover the cleanup now stand
at just $180 million, and won't top $200 million before the sale of
Pilgrim is expect to close in early 1999. To make up the
difference, BEC will also provide Entergy with up to $266
million &UR;  &LR; that the Boston utility plans to borrow, said people
familiar with the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   That will increase the size of the cleanup fund to $466 million.
Entergy then plans to earn enough by investing that money to cover
the remaining costs of the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   BEC also expects to receive credits from a nuclear-insurance
fund in coming years that it values at $31 million, said people
familiar with the matter. After the sale BEC will have about 2,250
employees, far fewer than its headcount of 4,800 in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Entergy closed Wednesday at 29 3/16, down 5/16. BEC was off 1/16
at 40 15/16.

BIG THEATER COMPANY MOVES TO A NEW STAGE: BANKRUPTCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for light rewrite and addition of 4 grafs at end; in 10th
graf, corrects Drabinsky's age from 48 to 49)  (mk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Livent Inc., the Broadway theater company, filed for bankruptcy
protection Wednesday, less than six months after Michael Ovitz,
once widely considered the most powerful person in Hollywood, took
over the company.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ovitz, former president of Walt Disney Co.,
and his new management team filed a lawsuit against the company's
founders, the impresario Garth Drabinsky and his partner, Myron
Gottlieb.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses the two men of having misled Ovitz, who
invested $20 million in Livent, by hiding the fact that the company
was losing millions of dollars on its expensive productions of
musicals like ``Ragtime,'' ``Showboat'' and ``Phantom of the
Opera.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also contends that Drabinsky and Gottlieb gave
themselves more than $7.5 million in ``kickbacks'' by funneling
company money to another corporation in Toronto that Gottlieb
owned.
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz and Livent's new managers maintain that Drabinsky and
Gottlieb had ordered the company's accountants to manipulate the
financial books so that more than $60 million of extravagant
spending on advertising, salaries for the shows' huge casts and
elaborate sets were hidden and never cut into the profits the
company reported in its financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit further contends that in an effort to keep the
matter covered up, Drabinsky and Gottlieb tried to gain the
cooperation of Livent's senior financial executive, Gordon
Eckstein, by offering him greatly increased compensation.
</P>
<P>
   The company's severe financial straits are already taking a toll
on the many productions that the company now has in major cities in
North America. On Tuesday night, the cast of one of its productions
of ``Ragtime,'' which has been touring the United States and is now
playing in Minneapolis, was told that the rest of the tour,
including stops of several weeks that had been scheduled for
Seattle and Boston, had been canceled.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the allegations, Drabinsky and Gottlieb, who were
suspended from their jobs in August and formally dismissed
Wednesday by the company's board of directors, said in a statement
that Ovitz and Roy Furman, Livent's new chief executive and a
former Wall Street investment banker, were trying to blame them for
their own poor business decisions and miscalculations.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb said they would vigorously defend
themselves against the allegations. In addition, Drabinsky filed
his own lawsuit against Ovitz, Furman and other Livent executives
charging that they had acted together ``in a conspiracy to injure
him.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time that Drabinsky, 49, a man known for his
artistic vision, abundant confidence and high-spending ways, has
built a sprawling entertainment company, only to be dismissed
because of accounting issues.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Drabinsky, a former entertainment lawyer, founded
Cineplex Odeon in Toronto and built it into an 1,800-screen chain
across the United States and Canada. But in 1989, MCA, one of the
company's big investors, dismissed him amid questions of his
accounting practices. Critics had accused the company of
understating expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky and Gottlieb said in their statement Wednesday: ``This
is a sad day for live theater and a sad day for Livent
shareholders. New management is facing the consequences of their
actions of recent months. Rather than growing the company, they
have wasted resources on accountants and lawyers in a protracted
campaign to inflict injury to our reputations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of nurturing the creative potential of the company,
they have diminished it. Instead of focusing on growing the company
and building shareholder value, they have relentlessly focused on
discrediting us.''
</P>
<P>
   They added that Ovitz and Livent had filed the suit against them
on the same day that the company filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act ``to
deflect attention from their own ill-conceived decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy filing Wednesday in Manhattan will give the
company many months to reorganize its finances while it continues
to produce shows. With the protection from creditors that comes
with filing for a reorganization under Chapter 11, Livent will not
have to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on almost
$200 million of debt until it can renegotiate the terms with its
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   The debt, which was mostly used to pay for the construction of
new theaters in New York; Chicago; Vancouver, British Columbia, and
Toronto, is now consuming most of Livent's cash, leaving the
company unable to keep up with its daily expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The company is scrambling to arrange some new short-term
financing so that it can meet its payroll and other day-to-day
costs.
</P>
<P>
   After months of delay, the company also released corrected
financial statements Wednesday for 1996, 1997 and the first two
quarters of 1998. They show that Livent's entire equity has been
eaten up by its bills. That means that the company's debts are now
greater than the value of its theaters and other assets.
</P>
<P>
   The corrected statements were the first financial details that
Livent has released since Aug. 10, when it said it had discovered
serious accounting irregularities and was suspending Drabinsky and
Gottlieb while it investigated the scope of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lack of financial information, securities
regulators in the United States and Canada suspended trading in
Livent's stock. It is not clear whether, with the release of the
corrected financial statements, the regulators will now let the
stock trade again.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the civil suits and countersuits, Livent is under
investigation by securities regulators in both the United States
and Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have begun a criminal
investigation into the company's activities.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of their own investigation, Ovitz and his managers
in their suit detailed a trail of unusual business transactions
that they say were handled by Drabinsky, a lawyer, and Gottlieb, an
accountant. With the transactions and secret side deals attached to
some Livent contracts, Ovitz's lawsuit says, the two men were able
to enrich themselves by millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the lawsuit says, the two men told the
company's accountants to hide the millions of dollars the company
was losing on shows either by shifting the costs to other accounts
so that they never affected the bottom line or by excluding the
amounts entirely from the company's official set of books.
</P>
<P>
   Drabinsky had directed the company's accountants to keep a
separate set of ledgers from the company's official books so that
he could track Livent's ``real'' expenses, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit says that Drabinsky and Gottlieb were able to make
improper payments of more than $7.5 million to themselves by asking
an engineering company working on a theater construction project to
inflate the bills it sent to Livent. The engineering company, the
suit says, would then pass the amounts to Drabinsky, Gottlieb or to
a Toronto company, King Commodity Services Ltd., which is
controlled by Gottlieb.

FAREWELL TO EWBANK: VIGNETTES OF A TRUE COACH AND FRIEND
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Schmitt, the Jets' center when they won Super
Bowl III in 1969, recalled how his former coach and general manager
took a chance on him when no one else was interested and eventually
surprised him with a contract bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson Boozer, the Super Bowl tailback, laughed as he told how
that contract generosity was not always what it appeared to be.
</P>
<P>
   From Texas to Pennsylvania, from Louisiana and Mississippi to
New Jersey and Long Island, the old-timers had smiles in their
voices Wednesday. They were saddened that Weeb Ewbank, the pro
football coach who had touched and often changed their lives, died
Tuesday at age 91, but in telephone interviews they remembered the
fun days with Ewbank and the lessons they learned.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Namath talked about upsetting Ewbank with his rash guarantee
that the Jets would beat the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III.
</P>
<P>
   Two keys to that victory were Matt Snell's running and Dave
Herman's blocking, and both players told how Ewbank had cut through
the mumbo jumbo to devise the winning formula. Hank Stram talked
about coaching against Ewbank and Walt Michaels talked about
coaching for him.
</P>
<P>
   Here are their stories:
</P>
<P>
   JOHN SCHMITT, who owns an insurance company in Milford, Conn.:
``I was a 297-pound tackle from Hofstra, and nobody in pro football
wanted me. Weeb signed me as a free agent for $8,500 a year, which
was $1,000 more than my father was making at the time, and made me
a center. He was like another father to me, but he was tight with
money. When he was negotiating a contract, he had tears in his eyes
if he gave you a raise. After the Super Bowl, I wanted $30,000 for
the next year. He said, `When I had Jim Parker in Baltimore, he was
the greatest tackle ever, and he made only $27,500.' I said,
`Coach, that was many years ago.' Weeb finally said, `OK, you've
got a deal, $30,000.' I said how about a three-year contract with a
$3,000 raise each year. He said, `That's a $100,000 deal.' `I said,
`Yes, Coach, but I think I'm worth it.' He agreed and asked me to
sign a blank contract and he would fill in the numbers. Can you
imagine anyone signing a blank contract now? But I signed it, and a
few days later my copy arrived in the mail. He gave me $1,500 more
than we had agreed on.''
</P>
<P>
   EMERSON BOOZER, who supervises a drug program in the town of
Huntington on Long Island: ``The man was a great teacher and knew
how to put you in a relaxed state, but he was tough with money.
After the Super Bowl, when my contract was up, I met with Sonny
Werblin, the team president. I was making $20,000 a year. He agreed
to raise me to $30,000 the next year and $35,000 the year after. He
said Weeb would finalize it the next day. So I saw Weeb. He closed
the door and said: ` Werblin said to give you $5,000 more next
year. I'm going to give you $10,000 more.'''
</P>
<P>
   JOE NAMATH, a television analyst living in Tequesta, Fla., on
his Super Bowl guarantee: ``You can't print the things he said.
Weeb said, `They'll put that on the bulletin board.' I said, `Hey,
Coach, if they need clippings from that bulletin board, then
they're in deep trouble.' But I felt bad that I did upset him. We
had our times when we didn't get along and I grew through that.
Coach Bear Bryant told me the people you go to are very important
when you turn pro. I wanted to play for Weeb and what he
accomplished with Johnny Unitas.''
</P>
<P>
   MATT SNELL, who owns a construction company in Jersey City,
N.J.: ``Weeb was smart. Before the Super Bowl, he told us we've
just got to run the ball and we'll win the game. We didn't have any
idea which plays would work, but we finally found one play: 19
Straight. We would run behind Winston Hill at offensive tackle and
cut inside or outside. Of my 28 carries, I must have run that play
12 or 15 times. Weeb told Joe Namath, `Let's keep running it until
they stop it.' They never stopped it.''
</P>
<P>
   DAVE HERMAN, a financial planner in New York: ``For the Super
Bowl, Weeb moved me from guard to tackle. I weighed 255 and I had
to block Bubba Smith, who must have weighed 320. After the game,
Weeb said to me, `How many guys could I ask to do that?' I was
proud of that. I loved him. My daughter was born with cerebral
palsy, and he made me bring her to Saturday workouts so he could
talk to her. In recent years, I talked to him every two weeks. The
last time was a week ago, and the first thing he said was, `How are
the kids?'''
</P>
<P>
   HANK STRAM of Covington, La., a pro football analyst: ``A coach
has to accumulate talent, assess it and make it play like it's
supposed to and win. He did all of that extremely well, and I never
thought he got the credit he deserved. One time when we played at
Kansas City, both benches were on the same side of the field. We
had 30 yards of space and they had 30. But on the opening kickoff,
the ball is still in the air and he's running toward it and there
he is, next to me, swinging his arms back and forth across his
chest. From then on, I called him the Penguin.''
</P>
<P>
   WALT MICHAELS, semiretired, Pennsylvania: ``He always said don't
try to win too many games until you have enough people to win the
whole thing. In our first year with the Jets, he said, `We don't
have a lot of players, so let's take the heat and build this
thing.' We did. He used to say: `Coaching is like riding a
motorcycle. Stay in it long enough and you'll get killed.' At least
he survived it.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHNNY SAMPLE, a Super Bowl defensive back and now a talk-show
host in Philadelphia: ``He coached Otto Graham, Johnny Unitas and
Joe Namath, three of the greatest quarterbacks who ever played. His
knowledge of offense was great. He didn't work much with defensive
players, but he used to come into our meetings with little hints.
Once, he told me to get up on a receiver and jam him. That was in
1958, and no one had ever thought of that before.''
</P>
<P>
   DON MAYNARD, a Hall of Fame wide receiver and now a financial
planner in El Paso, Texas: ``I've played under nine head coaches
and 42 assistant coaches, and I've learned how not to coach. He
knew how to do it. He was always open to suggestions. I wanted to
round out certain pass patterns and he didn't like the idea, but I
showed him and he agreed. As a result, when I ran a 10-yard out, I
turned my head and Joe Namath would have the ball in my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   LARRY GRANTHAM, a linebacker on the Super Bowl Jets and now a
manufacturer's representative in Olive Branch, Miss.: ``We had a
lot of fun with him. He was a master of double talk. He would stand
in front of a crowd and talk longer and say less than anyone. He
would call a players' meeting before a trip and say: `How many of
you want your pre-game steak rare? How many medium? How many well
done?' If the numbers didn't add up or if someone didn't vote, we
had to do it again. We kept it going pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   ARTIE DONOVAN, defensive tackle for Ewbank's champion Colts in
1958 and 1959 and the owner of the Valley Country Club in Towson,
Md.: ``He kept me in the league eight more years so I didn't have
to go back to New York and become a cop. I think he was as good a
coach as there's ever been. He took the Colts and the Jets, two of
the worst teams ever to play football, and made them champions.
During World War II, if the Navy had made him and Paul Brown spies
instead of football coaches, we'd own Russia now.''

CONNECTICUT DEAL WITH PATRIOTS `POSSIBLE,' VP KRAFT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  BOSTON _ Amid reports that an agreement in principle could be
imminent between the Patriots and the state of Connecticut, the
prospect arose that an era could be ending for the Boston area's
haunted football franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president Jonathan Kraft said Wednsday night,
``There's no deal as we talk right now.'' Asked if there might be
Thursday, he said, ``It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the deal told the Globe Wednsday night that the
new facility, which would be located in downtown Hartford, would
include more than $100,000 earmarked toward improving the road at
the junction of Interstates 84 and 91 to allow better access.
</P>
<P>
   Tailgating and guaranteed exiting from the stadium within one
hour would be added enticements for current season ticket-holders
to make the 2 1/2-hour drive 10 days a year.
</P>
<P>
   Sources also say current season ticket-holders would be
accommodated while the team explores a season ticket base with
residents of the Greater Hartford area. It was also learned that
there would be no personal seat licenses sold and the revenue
stream would be expected to come from ticket sales, luxury boxes,
and premium-type seating.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Revolution, also owned by the Krafts, would
remain in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   While it had been thought that the Patriots might stay at their
current practice facility in Foxborough and play their games in
Hartford, that would not be the case because a new practice
facility would be built near Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Despite strong media reports, the league remained cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no announcement,'' said NFL spokesman Greg
Aiello. ``There are two issues here. First of all, any move would
require a three-quarters vote of the other NFL owners, and
secondly, a move by the Patriots to another New England site would
be viewed as positive by the league.''
</P>
<P>
   The league also confirmed that nothing could stop the city of
Boston from building a stadium and luring an expansion franchise if
the Patriots moved. But that, too, would require a three-quarters
vote, and team owner Bob Kraft, a powerful member of the expansion
committee, probably would not allow such a thing to happen.
</P>
<P>
   There are no territorial rules in the NFL; therefore, there
could be 10 teams in Chicago or eight in Boston as long as the
league owners approved by a three-quarters vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a July interview with the Globe, commissioner Paul Tagliabue
spoke positively of a possible move to Hartford by the Patriots if
they could not resolve their longstanding problems regarding
building a facility in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 20, 1993, Tagliabue said Foxboro Stadium was ``an
unacceptable venue for the long-term future of the Patriots.'' And
about a month later, the state of Connecticut was trying to float
$252.1 million in bonds to fund a new stadium for the Patriots.
Five years later, the plan has resurfaced.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest relocation report regarding the Patriots, who
at various times in the past have been rumored to be headed for
Memphis, Nashville, Birmingham, Ala., and, most recently, St. Louis
and Providence.
</P>
<P>
   During their nomadic formative years, the Patriots at various
times called Boston University's Nickerson Field, Fenway Park, and
Harvard Stadium home before settling in to
Schaefer/Sullivan/Foxboro Stadium in 1971. But those were mere
neighborhood shifts compared to this proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Some close to Kraft can't imagine him moving the franchise out
of the Boston area, considering that he was born and raised in
Brookline, has been a season ticket-holder, and prevented it from
moving to St. Louis by purchasing it from James Busch Orthwein for
almost $200 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Kraft has attempted to find a permanent home for the
Patriots in a facility that would meet NFL standards for the new
millennium. Time and time again, he has been rebuffed, starting in
South Boston, where residents protested the prospect of disrupting
their neighborhood as much as they did a proposed 70,000-seat
waterfront stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's frustration with House Speaker Thomas Finneran has led
to this situation. In reality, the difference between the
Finneran/House infrastructure proposal and the Kraft/Senate
proposal is about $15 million in the public assistance the owner
would receive to build a new stadium. But so far, nobody in
Massachusetts is budging.
</P>
<P>
   So as early as Thursday, Kraft might have to sign an agreement
in principle with the state of Connecticut or lose out on a viable
option.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' staff spent most of their time Wednesday
scrambling for answers regarding the media reports.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players seemed caught in an awkward spot.
</P>
<P>
   From a purely personal viewpoint, Drew Bledsoe would be quite
upset if the Patriots moved to Hartford because he and his family
are building a home in Medfield, where they wanted to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Now that move may be short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult for myself and for our players who have
settled into this area,'' said Bledsoe. ``When you sign to play for
a team, you hope it's the only team you ever play for so you can
put down roots and stay in one place. From that standpoint, it's
tough, but I understand in my conversations with Bob what he's had
to go through to get a stadium built in this area, and if this is
going to happen, then you can't blame him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said it would be a sad day if the Patriots moved,
because of the fan base they've built in southeastern Massachusetts
and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have friends who come in here to play against us and they're
amazed at the fan support we receive here,'' said the quarterback.
``We have a great following of fans who really support us and give
us quite a home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, ``our facility is the laughingstock of the
league. It's not a major league facility. And it's amazing to me
and to a lot of people that we can't get $1 of public money
allocated toward a new home for our team. It's tough to see other
cities allocate money for stadiums when here in New England, we
have an owner who is willing to build the stadium himself with help
from the state for the infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe said a perfect example of the rabid fan support was that
the Atlanta Falcons couldn't sell out their own facility, the
Georgia Dome, but when they came to Foxboro Stadium this month, the
place was jammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the frustrating thing,'' said Bledsoe. ``I think teams
in other areas of the country would love to have the support we do.
That part is already in place. But if we have to move, we have to
move if it means the franchise can flourish with a new facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Browne, the NFL's senior vice president of communications
and government affairs, said Wednsday night that the league would
be willing to comment only when there is an agreement. Browne did
not seem concerned about the Patriots moving out of a major TV
market like Boston, nor did Tagliabue appear concerned about that
in July.
</P>
<P>
   While the Kraft years have probably been the best in Patriots
history in terms of on-field success, they also have been
turbulent. There was the acrimonious departure of coach Bill
Parcells to the New York Jets after the 1997 Super Bowl. More
recently, high-profile players such as Dave Meggett and Ben Coates
have faced sexual assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kraft bought the team, he's been trying to get out of
Foxboro Stadium. At first, he hoped the Patriots would be part of a
Boston megaplex deal. When that fell through, Kraft was assured by
then-Governor William Weld that he would be accommodated for having
prevented the franchise from moving out of the region.

<P>
   David Schippers, who will lead the questioning of Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr for the Republicans in Thursday's Judiciary
Committee session, has made much of being a lifelong Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the former prosecutor was harsh in his comments
about the president last month when he outlined the Republicans'
case to the committee. He said there was ``substantial and
credible'' evidence that Clinton lied under oath and that the
nation's judicial system might have been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If lying under oath is tolerated and, when exposed, is not
visited with immediate and substantial adverse consequences, the
integrity of this country's entire judicial process is fatally
compromised, and that process will inevitably collapse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, 68, made his mark as the chief federal prosecutor in
Chicago. He has been in private practice since 1967 and is a
longtime friend of Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who is the chairman of
the committee.

<P>
   Abbe David Lowell, the chief lawyer for the Democrats on the
Judiciary Committee, is a Washington insider with a firm grasp of
Congress and politics. He built his reputation defending Democratic
politicians like former House Speaker Jim Wright, who resigned in
1989 amid accusations of ethical violations.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell, 46, was born in New York City, reared in Westbury, on
Long Island, and received his undergraduate and law degrees from
Columbia University. He is a partner in the Washington law firm of
Brand, Lowell &AMP; Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   In an argument to the Judiciary Committee last month, he held
that the president's having an improper sexual relationship and
lying about was not an impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an attempt to organize his staff to spread
misinformation about the progress of the war in Vietnam,'' he said.
``Or about a break-in of the Democratic headquarters at the
Watergate, or even about how funds from arms sales in Iran were
diverted to aid the contras in Nicaragua.''

<P>
   David Kendall
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's chief private counsel, has waited
a long time for an opportunity to confront Starr. Kendall, 54, has
represented Clinton in Whitewater matters for nearly five years but
has rarely appeared in public to defend the president. His chief
weapons have been legal briefs and scathing correspondence to the
Office of Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall endured months of criticism for his handling of the
Monica Lewinsky investigation, urging the president to remain
largely silent while mounting a vigorous counterattack against
Starr. But Clinton remains in office and Starr must now defend his
investigation before Congress and a special master appointed by the
judge supervising the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall made his reputation in death-penalty and First Amendment
cases after compiling a gilded resume: Rhodes Scholar, Yale Law
School, a Supreme Court clerkship. But it will be as the
president's lawyer in only the third presidential impeachment
inquiry in U.S. history that Kendall will long be remembered.

DAVENPORT SURVIVES; SELES OVERCOMES FLU 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two points away from being bounced out of the opening
round of the Chase Championships for the second consecutive year,
Lindsay Davenport, assured of finishing the year at No. 1, reminded
herself how irritable she would be if she let her year finish on an
unflattering note. So pride prevented a first-round fall Wednesday
night as Davenport, who trailed Sandrine Testud by 6-4, 5-4 before
restoring order, scrambled into the quarterfinals at Madison Square
Garden with a 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-0 comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's close encounter with premature defeat at this
year-ending event was far less painful than Monica Seles' opening
night ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to eat since Sunday night, when a flu bug took up
residence in her stomach, and unwilling to do much of anything
except sleep ``for the last 50 hours,'' Seles, who had not won a
match at the Chase Championships since compiling her triplex of
titles here from 1990 to 1992, somehow raised herself from her
sickbed Wednesday night and punched in for work. After enduring
first-round defeats in 1996 and 1997, the fifth-seeded Seles wasn't
about to let a virus ruin this year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was she about to allow her opening-round opponent, Anna
Kournikova, get away with a performance marred by 17 double faults.
</P>
<P>
   So Seles, grunting more out of discomfort than habit, soldiered
her way to a 6-4, 6-3 victory that put her in a quarterfinal
meeting with five-time champion Steffi Graf, whose resurrection
after her seventh bout with surgery, this time on her wrist, has
been nothing short of masterly.
</P>
<P>
   But Graf's two-tournament winning streak has not surprised
Seles. ``Steffi's such a perfectionist,'' said Seles, whose
determined 65-minute disposal of Kournikova provided further
evidence that she, too, is blessed and cursed by that trait. ``I
don't think people have given her enough credit for that,'' Seles
said of Graf, who leads their career rivalry, 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-year-old Kournikova, the Corel WTA Tour's resident
glamour girl, led her incipient rivalry with the 24-year-old Seles,
1-0, after defeating the former No. 1 by 7-5, 6-4 this year at Key
Biscayne, Fla., where Kournikova eventually bowed to Venus Williams
in the all-teen-age final.
</P>
<P>
   But Seles was a distracted player then, wasting away from the
worry of watching her father, Karolj, slowly losing his battle with
stomach cancer. After his death in May, she vowed to put her tennis
blinders back on, and stormed to the French Open final just three
weeks later. And Wednesday night, despite feeling lethargic from
her illness and pessimistic about the bad luck that seems to strike
her here of late, Seles put herself in harness with such discipline
that she committed just five unforced errors, 31 fewer than her
healthy opponent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As usual, Kournikova cut a dashing figure on the court: she wore
a daisy barrette on the crown of her head, and thanks to an
abbreviated cropped top that didn't quite meet the waistband of her
navy tap pants, she flashed her tanned midriff with every shot.
</P>
<P>
   But her flawless appearance was undermined by her paralysis at
the service line. A purveyor of bruising ground strokes and
graceful volleys, Kournikova was inefficient when the task turned
to holding serve. She lost the opening set with her ninth double
fault, and quadruple double faults in the next-to-last game of the
second set gave Seles the opportunity to serve out the victory at
5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 17 double faults that made Seles' life a fraction
less difficult Wednesday night, Kournikova pumped out 22 others in
Moscow and 17 in Zurich. ``I think if I'd served better, the match
could've went a different way,'' said the loser, who seemed unaware
that Seles was under the weather.

</P>
<P>
   ``My Love Is Your Love''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Houston. Arista. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Whitney's new effort is mostly like old times.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Whitney Like You've Never Heard Her Before,''
proclaims the sticker on Whitney Houston's first studio album in
eight years. Such false advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The singer-actress's return to recording something other than a
soundtrack is actually, often pleasantly, familiar. Pulling from
the gospel roots she displayed breathtakingly well on the
``Preacher's Wife'' soundtrack, Houston joins Lauryn Hill on a
cover version of Stevie Wonder's ``I Was Made to Love (Him),'' a
reworking that's as memorable as her take on ``I Will Always Love
You'' on ``The Bodyguard'' soundtrack. And ``It's Not Right But
It's Okay'' is as sister-girly as all that was ``Waiting to
Exhale,'' the movie and soundtrack featuring Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are such by-the-numbers big ballads as ``I Learned
From the Best,'' ``You'll Never Stand Alone'' and ``When You
Believe,'' her overemoted duet with fellow pop diva Mariah Carey.
You have to expect those exercises in riffs and octaves from a
Grammy favorite who made her rendition of ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' a top seller. The surprise comes when the often
predictable rapper Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott, as guest
producer, tastefully reveals Houston as a sensual being on ``Oh
Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   And leave it to Houston's most familiar collaborator, producer
Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds, along with Daryl Simmons, to draw out
one of her most stirring vocal performances on ``Until You Come
Back.'' Proof that Whitney like we've heard her before is really
quite fine.

   Success expands Jewel's sweet tooth

   ``Spirit''
</P>
<P>
   Jewel. Atlantic. 13 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: I'm OK, you're OK, Jewel's OK. OK?
</P>
<P>
   A pure product of what Joni Mitchell called ``the star-making
machinery,'' 24-year-old vocalist Jewel Kilcher has enjoyed a
peculiarly accelerated career. When her first album, ``Pieces of
You,'' was released in 1995, she flaunted a vagabond image and
talked about sleeping in her car. As her new album arrives, she's a
multi-platinum Lilith Fair alumna who is already the subject of a
best-selling parody (a spoof of her poetry collection, ``A Night
Without Armor'').
</P>
<P>
   No wonder she dedicates ``Spirit'' to her mother, who is also
her manager. But such success exaggerates Jewel's gifts as a
songwriter. She is unbearably trite in the winsome way that only
introspective college-age guitar strummers can be. ``If I could
tell this world one thing,'' she sings in an ever-soothing voice,
``it would be that we're all OK.'' Next stop: ``Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the advantage of stardom is that you get to spend
lots of money on your records, and ``Spirit'' is resplendent in a
subdued folk-pop-country way. The seductive studio craft lends a
sense of significance to what is ultimately pretty innocuous.

<P>
   ``Human Being''
</P>
<P>
   Seal. Warner Bros. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   No one else projects romantic anguish amid such lush upholstery
as Seal. Like Sade, another celebrated English mononym, he has
become a global soul-soother by evoking not ache's desolation but
its multi-hued cornucopia of emotion, its limitless swank. ``Human
Being,'' the latest album from the Grammy Awards mainstay, feels
like the aural equivalent of a ride in a late-model BMW through
some deserted city of the heart. The production is immaculate, the
music a slick urban noir soundtrack that ripples with hints of
techno and trip-hop, its somber themes offset by an insistent
rhythmic pulse and Seal's soaring appeals. Class act that he is,
the vocalist connects even without the luxe trappings. ``Lost My
Faith,'' which briefly matches Seal with an acoustic guitar, boasts
the old-school folkie grit of Otis Redding _ grit with a little
extra polish.

   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Partnered with the protean Nashville ensemble Lambchop, whose
horn arrangements sprawl from English Beat-style exuberance to the
ragged dirge of a New Orleans funeral procession, Athens-based Vic
Chesnutt finds the coherence lacking in his previous effort (1996's
major-label debut, ``About to Choke''). As ever, he populates his
songs with a gallery of amusingly observed characters (``a man
dripping with Vitalis,'' a ``self-ordained Faustian'') and treads a
shaky tightrope between the absurd and the profound (he's a Flying
Wallenda of deceptively casual couplets). What's new is how the
songwriter happens onto a surprising Al Green falsetto in the
beseeching ``Maiden'' and, in the brooding, Dylanesque folk-rock of
``Parade,'' truly paints a masterpiece, evoking an existential
sadness that may be one of the forgotten qualifiers of great art.

   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his techno-ambient brethren, Talvin Singh is a
cross-pollinator. But this British-born producer brings something
new to the usual mixture of sample loops, synth washes and digital
rhythms: the hot mystique of his Indian heritage. Overlain with
such traditional Indian instruments as sitars and tablas, Singh's
debut album can transport you from the heart of Bombay to a London
rave in a split second. Sometimes, the instruments switch purposes.
The gorgeous keyboard layers of ``Traveller'' bring to mind a
sunrise over the Ganges, while the rat-a-tat tablas on ``Eclipse''
are every bit as intense as the most cutting-edge drum-and-bass
track.

GIANTS' KANELL IS BENCHED AFTER COACH WINCES AT TAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Early Monday morning, hours after his
team's 37-3 loss to the Green Bay Packers, New York Giants coach
Jim Fassel examined the tape of the game in his office, staring
soberly at the image of quarterback Danny Kanell. He knew Kanell
had not played well, but he was looking for signs that Kanell was
still seeing the field properly, still thinking, still in control.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel never found what he had hoped to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most telling was one play the Giants had practiced repeatedly
the week before _ a pass on the goal line. It was executed entirely
wrong, with Kanell looking away from a wide-open receiver and
toward one in double coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In that moment and in others the next two days, Fassel came to
his decision to pull the plug _ temporarily at least _ on the
20-game Danny Kanell era. He had seen enough to believe that Kanell
was mentally overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, it was Kanell's backup, Kent Graham, taking the snaps
with the first-string offense as the Giants prepared for Sunday's
home game against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell waited behind the starting unit, helmet in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving Danny a timeout,'' Fassel said of Kanell, whose
two-year record as the Giants' starter is 10-9-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny has a future and I'm not putting him on the shelf and
forgetting him. But something's wrong. It's hard for me to believe
he hasn't lost some of his confidence. It's never an easy thing to
do when it involves a young quarterback, but as a coach you have to
make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much more confidence can he lose? How much more shattered
can he get? I think he needs to regroup to collect his thoughts,
and I need to win this game right now. I need a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fassel said he had no timetable for how long Graham
would play over the remainder of the season, he made it relatively
clear that Graham was not embarking on a one-game tryout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent does not need to look over his shoulder after a bad
series, bad pass or bad game,'' Fassel said of Graham, whom he
coached as an assistant with the Giants in 1992 and the Arizona
Cardinals in 1996. ``I have a lot of confidence in Kent.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid was how Kanell, who will be 25 next week, or Graham,
who is 30, figure in the plans of the team. Based on comments made
by people within the organization during the past year, Graham has
never been viewed as someone the team would build around.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants could draft a quarterback next spring or sign a
veteran who becomes a free agent this winter, or Kanell could
regain his starting job in three weeks and restore the franchise's
faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   What happens if Graham is productive and the Giants play better
is less clear, although he could be the starter who shepherds the
offense while the Giants nurture a quarterback drafted in the first
round next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Mike Cherry, the third-string quarterback with the
best throwing arm on the team. Fassel said he would use him in the
fourth quarter of remaining games in which the Giants lead or trail
by a significant number of points.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, like others in the organization, wants to see Cherry, a
sixth-round draft pick last year, in action. Cherry has been in for
just a few plays in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Kanell and Graham were both low-key in their public reactions to
Fassel's decision Wednesday, although Kanell looked unhappy and
Graham looked rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably disagree with this,'' said Kanell, who has thrown
for 11 touchdowns and 10 interceptions in his 10 starts this year.
``But only because I'm a competitor. At the same time, I respect
his decision. I believe, from what he has told me, that he's
looking out for my best interests and he's looking out for the
team's best interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to characterize the opportunity he has been given, Graham
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got my foot in the door. That's probably the best way of
saying it. I have a lot to prove, but I'm thankful for the
opportunity to get that chance at least to prove it.''

   ATLANTA _ ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' (R) _ The kind of
movie you'll love or hate, depending on your mood. Johnny Depp and
Benicio Del Toro tear through the neon desert, high on anything
they can get. Directed with hallucinatory flair by Terry Gilliam
(``12 Monkeys''), it's both a tribute to and a cautionary tale
about excess. With Christina Ricci as a waifish Barbra Streisand
fan who has a bad trip. Grade: B

   _ ``Can't Hardly Wait'' (PG-13) _ You won't want to wait ... for
the movie to end. This teen comedy about an end-of-the-school-year
all-night party shirks subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us
there faster. Jennifer Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the
just-graduated senior class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive

boyfriend. Grade: C

VERMONT COURT TAKES UP GAY MARRIAGES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Alaska, Hawaii)  (rl) 
 BY CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ When Nina Beck went into labor and frightening
complications developed, her lesbian partner, Stacy Jolles, tried
to go into the emergency room with her. But she was stopped at the
door, she said, and asked, ``Who are you? Do you have legal papers
to be there?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beck's son, Noah, was born with a heart defect, and died
last year at age 2{. But, Ms. Jolles said Wednesday, ``Noah is very
much here with us today. He would want us very much to be married,
and he would want us to pursue this to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke in the lobby of the Vermont Supreme Court on the day
that Vermont became the central arena for the push for same-sex
marriage in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii seemed positioned to become the first state to legalize
same-sex marriage after a 1993 state Supreme Court preliminary
decision leaning in its favor; then an Alaska court case seemed to
put that state next in line. But in this month's elections, Alaskan
and Hawaiian voters rejected the idea in ballot initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is Vermont's turn. The state Supreme Court heard oral
arguments Wednesday morning in Baker vs. State of Vermont, a
lawsuit filed by Ms. Beck and Ms. Jolles, another lesbian couple
and a gay male couple seeking the right to marry. The court is
expected to rule within months.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least in the gay community, the eyes of the world are on
Vermont right now,'' said Greg Johnson, a Vermont Law School
professor who helped represent the gay couples in the Alaska case.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of Alaska and Hawaii, Johnson said, was that work in
the courts was not enough. ``The reason we have some hope here in
Vermont is not just because the jurisprudence is good but the body
politic is markedly different than in Alaska and Hawaii,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's legislature has passed extensive laws protecting gay
men and lesbians from discrimination, and the state has been in the
vanguard on recognizing ``second-parent adoptions'' _ allowing the
member of a gay or lesbian couple who is not the biological parent
of a child to officially become the second parent.
</P>
<P>
   But Vermont's Supreme Court has not been easily categorized as
liberal or conservative. And the state, though known as home to a
liberal, back-to-the-land contingent, also has a strong streak of
traditionalism. So no one is making confident predictions about
when, if ever, same-sex marriage will be allowed here.
</P>
<P>
   In questioning lawyers Wednesday, some of the justices seemed to
challenge the ban on same-sex marriage more than the proposal to
lift it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why isn't that gender discrimination?'' Justice Denise Johnson
asked. ``A man can't marry another man because he's a man.''
Another justice questioned the argument that marriage should be
linked to procreation, noting that given recent advances in
biology, it may eventually be possible for a homosexual couple to
procreate.
</P>
<P>
   Arguing on behalf of the couples Wednesday, their lawyer, Beth
Robinson, recalled the California Supreme Court's decision 50 years
ago to overturn the law against interracial marriage, and urged the
court to emulate it. She compared the popular disapproval of
interracial marriage then to attitudes toward same-sex marriage
today. The California decision ``was controversial, it was
courageous and it was correct,'' Ms. Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for the state of Vermont, which is defending a law that
includes a definition of marriage as being between a man and a
woman, Eve Jacobs-Carnahan argued that ``the state has an interest
in supporting marriage and protecting it from potentially
destabilizing changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Ms. Johnson if the state saw marriage as a fundamental
right, Ms. Jacobs-Carnahan responded, ``Yes, but it's a fundamental
right between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The state, in its brief, also argues that such decisions
concerning social policy should be left to the legislature and
defends the state's interest in ``furthering the link between
procreation and child rearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the arguments on both sides did not differ
significantly from those in Hawaii and Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of spectators clustered in the Montpelier courthouse
lobby, in what local officials said was the biggest hubbub at the
court in recent memory. But there was not a hint of nastiness
between partisans.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way the court rules, though, both sides said, it is
likely that the losing side will seek a state referendum to
overturn the decision, and under Vermont's laws, the earliest such
a referendum could be held would be 2002.

SPORTS COLUMN: BONILLA, BELLE AND NOW WHAT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the news conference at Shea Stadium Wednesday
announcing his second coming as a Met, Bobby Bonilla remarked that,
well, yes, controversy ``seems to follow me; I don't know why.''
Oh, someone asked, kind of like Albert Belle? For Albert Belle, the
knight errant of the White Sox, has, strangely enough, been on the
minds of New York baseball fans of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``No! No!'' cried Bonilla, thrusting his arms in the air in the
classic I'm-not-guilty mode. ``Hold on! Time out! Not like that at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bonilla has found himself in hot water at times because,
as he said, ``I put my foot in my mouth a couple of times, and I
couldn't hold my temper a few times,'' his problems were unlike
those of Belle, who not only verbally but also physically abused
people, from throwing baseballs at cameramen to using a sports
utility vehicle to chase after and perhaps recklessly frighten kids
who had been playing a Halloween prank on him at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Belle is apparently being courted by the Yankees _
there he was the other day, for example, playing golf with no less
a personage than Yankees Manager Joe Torre. Can the Yankees be
serious in opting to sign Belle to their outfield and allow Bernie
Williams, the superb performer and sterling citizen, to depart the
center-field pasture at Yankee Stadium? Is this just a ploy to make
Williams understand that he and his family will not starve at the
reported offer of wages by the Yankees of nearly $60 million for
five years?
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, the first time around at a Met, arrived in 1992 as a
savior of sorts for the embattled Queens team. And was he ever
going to enjoy himself. He knew New York was going to be a tough
town, but he figured he could handle it _ after all, he grew up in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out he couldn't quite handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's going to wipe this smile off my face,'' he said
famously at the first news conference.
</P>
<P>
   His smile disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   When that last quotation was about to be repeated to him
Wednesday, he cut the sentence off at the pass. ``I'm not going to
get into that one,'' he said, smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla said he has learned from his three and a half years as a
Met. He said he has grown from it, and hopes to profit from that
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different this time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And well it might be. Bonilla showed up the last time carrying
the burden of being the man to change the fortunes of the Mets
single-handedly, and, as a switch-hitter, from either side of the
plate, too. Now he has star-quality operatives like Mike Piazza and
John Olerud and Rey Ordonez and Al Leiter to share the pressures of
seeking a National League East flag.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, 35, recalled a column in The Daily News in his first
Met years depicting him as a baby and an accompanying cartoon
showing him in a diaper. It was upsetting then, but he said he can
laugh at himself now.
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke about dealing with controversial topics in an
honest, straightforward manner. But he did not seem to come clean
when asked about quotes attributed to him the other day in The Los
Angeles Times criticizing Tommy Lasorda, who was the general
manager of the Dodgers part of last season after Bonilla was traded
to the team. He said he was misquoted.
</P>
<P>
   One was reminded of when Reggie Jackson joined the Yankees and
said in a magazine article that he was ``the straw that stirred the
drink,'' and offended his teammate Thurman Munson. Another Yankee,
seeking to take the edge off the comment, said to Munson, ``Maybe
it was taken out of context.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For six pages?'' Munson replied.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla Wednesday also said about Belle: ``He can play. And he
could deal with New York. He'd get lost on the Yankees. They've got
a lot of wonderful players there. But New York likes someone like
him. He creates controversy. They like when it gets crazy. But at
the end of the year, they'd say: `He hit 50 homers. He's a pretty
good player.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And, as it is said, so it goes. It is no secret in sports that
if you can produce to make your team win, then those involved in
the team's fortunes will forgive most if not all of your sins.
</P>
<P>
   Fans could easily come to love the sneer of Fatuous Albert. When
he was the belle of ball in Cleveland, he was routinely getting
standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   If Bonilla returns to health _ and he says the Achilles' heel,
sore left wrist and abdominal problems that put a crimp into last
season for him and his batting average (.249) are substantially
better _ and returns to bashing baseballs, it won't matter what he
says about Lasorda or anyone else, the fans will be smiling, even
if he isn't.

TESTING OF LIVE HIV VACCINE ON TERMINALLY ILL PROPOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Researchers from the University of Massachusetts and
Harvard University are proposing to inject live but genetically
disabled AIDS virus into a group of terminally ill cancer patients
to see if the approach might be feasible as a vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, discussed publicly at an AIDS meeting Wednesday, is
the latest wrinkle in a long-running debate about human tests of a
live-virus vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that some AIDS researchers and funding
agencies have been cool to the proposal, Dr. John Sullivan, an AIDS
researcher at UMass Medical School in Worcester, said he and
Harvard researcher Ronald S. DesRosiers are scheduled to discuss
ethical issues raised by the proposal with officials at the US Food
and Drug Administration next month.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said testing potentially hazardous drugs or vaccines in
terminally ill patients has ample precedent, adding that cancer
specialists have told him the proposal is feasible and some
patients would volunteer. He spoke at a meeting on ``AIDS at the
Millennium'' sponsored by Lemuel Shattuck Hospital and the
Massachusetts Medical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said in an interview that he got the idea of testing a
live-virus vaccine in cancer patients when his father was dying of
cancer four years ago. His father would have volunteered, Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   An international group of physicians who specialize in AIDS care
have offered themselves as guinea pigs for a live-virus HIV
vaccine, but others have criticized their proposal as premature.
</P>
<P>
   Live but ``attenuated'' viruses, which have been modified to
make them harmless while stimulating a protective immune response,
have been highly effective against other diseases. But skeptics say
AIDS is different because HIV inserts its genes into the immune
cells of people it infects, perhaps doing damage that could take
years to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``People turn their backs and say this is a crazy idea,''
Sullivan said. ``I think some people have made up their minds that
this approach is not going to work, but I would call that
scientific hubris.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan argued that human trials of a live attenuated HIV
vaccine, as a genetically crippled virus is called, should proceed
in case other vaccine strategies fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wait 20 years before we start looking seriously at a
live attenuated AIDS vaccine in humans, it will be 40 years before
we could deploy it,'' Sullivan added.
</P>
<P>
   It would take so long to develop a live HIV vaccine, Sullivan
and others said, because volunteers would have to be monitored for
years to make sure the disabled virus did not cause delayed immune
damage, which would be disastrous if such a vaccine were widely
deployed.
</P>
<P>
   One cause for concern comes from a Massachusetts patient of
Sullivan's and a handful of others in Australia who were
accidentally infected through blood transfusions by mutant strains
of HIV that were missing one gene, called ``nef.'' Though the
patients did not seem to suffer ill effects for years afterward,
recent studies have shown evidence of immune system damage.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of a live-virus vaccine point to evidence from
DesRosier's lab at the New England Regional Primate Center in
Southborough that an experimental live-virus vaccine protected
monkeys against infection by multiple strains of the natural simian
AIDS virus, called SIV.
</P>
<P>
   However, another Harvard researcher, Ruth Ruprecht, reported
last July that some monkeys sickened and died of immune-system
damage after getting a vaccine based on a live disabled SIV.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the AIDS virus he and DesRosiers propose to test
in cancer patients would lack four different genes, while earlier
live-virus vaccines lacked only one.
</P>
<P>
   Not all AIDS vaccine experts dismiss the proposal. ``We would
like to see safety work done on live attenuated HIV vaccines
because, if all other approaches fail, we believe we will have to
come back to a live attenuated vaccine, and the more data we have
the better,'' said Dr. Seth Berkley, president of the International
AIDS Vaccine Initiative in New York.

DRUG COSTS BOOST HEALTH INSURANCE PREMIUMS FOR EMPLOYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts employers are facing the biggest
increases in health insurance premiums in almost five years as drug
costs skyrocket, America ages, and technology continues to crank
out better, costlier treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The rate hikes mirror a national trend of swelling health care
expenses that highlight the limits of managed care's promise to
contain costs.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, employers are reporting premiums will rise 4 percent to
15 percent for 1999, after several years of negligible or low
single-digit increases.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, who on average pay about 30 percent of the
overall &UR;  &LR; premium, will see their bills rise as employers, which
pick up the balance, pass along the higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever increases there are will be passed along to
everyone,'' said Kenneth E. Thorpe, professor of health policy at
Tulane University in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   While few observers believe there will be a return to the
spiraling costs of the late 1980s when average yearly premium
increases grew beyond 18 percent, many think the nation is entering
a new era of persistent health care inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Though not all 1999 contracts between employers and their
insurers are completed, the anecdotal evidence so far points to
some of the biggest increases in years.
</P>
<P>
   Polaroid Corp. in Cambridge, whose 6,500 Massachusetts workers
saw no increases for the last two years, is experiencing a 5
percent jump in health care premiums for 1999. At Boston-based
Gillette Co., which has 5,510 employees in Massachusetts, premiums
are going up 4 percent to 8 percent in 1999, compared with a 4
percent increase in 1998 and a small reduction in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit, however, are smaller employers. Bull HN Information
Systems in Billerica, which has 500 employees in Massachusetts,
expects its premiums to spike 15 percent, more than double its 1998
increase. In 1997, premiums for Bull were flat compared with 1996
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a very large company, and our ability to influence
our rates is contained at best,'' said Cecile Wright, vice
president of human resources at Bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing increases anywhere from 5 percent to 13 percent,
or higher, and that's for large employers,'' said Susan Connolly, a
partner at William M. Mercer Inc., a benefits consulting firm in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, as managed care gained ascendancy as the
nation's dominant form of health insurance, costs took a dramatic
downward turn. Managed care insurers, while emphasizing preventive
care, eliminated redundant or unnecessary care, drove hospital
prices down, and slashed payments to physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Now, insurers have run out of places to cut, and costs are
starting to creep back up.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the nation, premiums are also surging anew. Oxford
Health Plans Inc. in Norwalk, Conn., this month said premiums for
employers its serves are expected to jump 9 percent on average.
Humana Inc. of Louisville, reported increases averaging 10 percent,
and Oakland, Calif.-based Kaiser Permanente, the nation's largest
HMO, said its 1999 rates would also rise substantially. Federal
employees, the largest single group of employees in the nation,
with over 9 million workers and dependents, are seeing a 12 percent
increase in the premium of their standard HMO policy in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Culprits behind the cost resurgence, according to the
Washington Business Group on Health, a research group funded by
large companies, include:
</P>
<P>
   --Rising pharmaceutical costs. Once a miniscule portion of
overall health care costs, drugs now take up more than 15 percent
of the average overall health care budget. That figure is rapidly
rising, thanks to a record number of new medications, many of which
are revolutionary but also expensive, such as Viagra, the
anti-impotence drug, and Prozac, an antidepressant. Thorpe of
Tulane estimates that about one-third of premium increases seen
next year is due to rising drug costs.
</P>
<P>
   --Advancing technology. Science continues to produce a dazzling
array of new technologies to treat everything from infertility to
brain tumors. As these treatments become standard, insurance
companies must pay for them, and pass along the cost in the form of
higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   --Aging population. &UR;  &LR; As baby boomers enter their 40s and 50s,
the cost of their care grows. Medical expenditures for men 45 to 54
years old, for example, are 45 percent greater than for those
between 35 and 44, according to Thorpe.
</P>
<P>
   --Insurance economics. Insurers have kept premiums low in the
past few years in bidding wars to win market share. But the
premiums have not kept up with medical inflation, and the result is
that 57 percent of health plans in America lost $768 million
combined in 1997, according to the Washington Business Group on
Health. Now the emphasis for HMOs is on profitability and higher
premiums. Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, for example, is expected to
increase premiums by an average of 6 percent to 8 percent in 1999,
after rate increases averaging just 2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   --Consumer demand. Gone are the days when patients passively
waited for their trusted doctors to issue orders. Patient
empowerment has turned people into savvy, aggressive consumers who
seek and demand the latest treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care's current inability to tame these forces point to a
new frontier for the industry, specialists say. Managed care, in
short, must live up to its name and manage care, not just cost.
That means devising more efficient and effective ways to treat and
manage costly illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes and asthma.
This will help bring costs down in the long run, health care
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next phase of managed care has got to move from managing
cost to truly managing care,'' said Sally Coberly, director of
policy for the Washington Business Group. ``We need to treat people
in their totality, have processes in place to manage diseases.
That's where we can have a more lasting impact on costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, premiums are expected to continue their climb. This
year, however, a funny thing happened at the negotiating table _
employers didn't push back that hard, consultants said. One
possible reason: many expected even steeper increases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers are getting larger rates increases than they have in
the past, but they seemed to be accepting of that,'' said Steve
Sadowski of William M. Mercer, who has negotiated with HMOs on
behalf of employers for six years.
</P>
<P>
   At Polaroid, Bill Hubert, manager of benefits, is watching to
see if managed care can continue to deliver quality care without
letting prices get out of hand. ``Now we'll see how effective
managed care can be,'' he said.

BRAZIL PREOCCUPIED WITH MYSTERY TAPES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Washington and Wall Street may be
breathing a sigh of relief now that a rescue package for the
Brazilian economy has been stitched together. But the political
leaders who will have to hold up Brazil's end of the bargain have
suddenly become preoccupied with another troublesome question: who
fabricated the mysterious tapes and documents that implicate
Brazil's president in potentially impeachable offenses?
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the re-election of Fernando Henrique Cardoso last
month, potentially compromising recordings of intercepted telephone
calls between senior government officials, including Cardoso, were
left under a highway underpass here. About the same time, an
anonymous person sent a series of faxes highly unfavorable to the
image of the president to a government minister, who made them
available to the press in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   The faxes purport to show that since 1994, Cardoso and three
allies have maintained a secret offshore bank account and slush
fund in the Cayman Islands with a balance of $368 million. In coded
language, the faxed correspondence describes deposits and transfers
made by a company in the Bahamas, CH, J&AMP;T Inc., whose initials
correspond to those of its supposed owners.
</P>
<P>
   The audiotapes, on the other hand, raise questions about the
propriety of the government's handling of the $19 billion
privatization of the state telephone company. Edited transcripts
published this week indicate that those who were tapped talked with
embarrassing and even vulgar frankness about friends and enemies:
the minister of communications, for instance, has acknowledged that
he referred to a senior aide to the treasury minister as ``a
blockhead,'' though, he asserted, only ``in an affectionate
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The matter has quickly become a distraction for the Brazilian
Congress at the precise moment that Cardoso had been hoping to
focus the attention of legislators on the $41.5 billion loan and
credit package agreement reached with the International Monetary
Fund last week.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is contingent on the Brazilian government adopting
a series of budget cuts and administrative reforms, most of which
would need to be approved by both houses of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly the president is confronting something no one
expected, something that can consume the energy of his
government,'' said Alexandre Barros, a political analyst and
commentator in Brasilia. ``Clearly someone is trying to pull the
rug from under his feet, and whether the charges are true or false,
there is an element of wear and tear in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso's spokesman, Sergio Amaral, has dismissed the entire
dossier as a crude forgery. ``Of course he does not own any
companies abroad,'' Amaral said at a news conference in Brasilia
last week, adding that the only assets the president has overseas
are two bank accounts in New York City with a total of about
$23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly everything about the documents seems to indicate
they are fraudulent. Though officials in the Bahamas have confirmed
the existence of the company named in the correspondence, questions
have arisen about the authenticity of signatures, and the letters
contain misspellings and very awkward syntax, as if written by
someone whose native language is not English.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, press accounts here have been openly skeptical
about the effort to make Cardoso, who has a reputation for personal
rectitude, look like the Brazilian equivalent of Carlos Salinas de
Gortari of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the incidents have provoked several rounds of
finger-pointing and speculation as to who is attempting to do in
the president, who is scheduled to be inaugurated for his second
four-year term in January.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a senator said that former president Fernando Collor
de Melo offered to send him a copy of the dossier and suggested to
him that he make the information public. Collor, who resigned in
1992 just as the Congress was about to vote to impeach him on
corruption charges, has denied making any such proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Cardoso angrily attacked those behind the intrigue,
calling them ``farceurs and forgers'' and indirectly pointing a
finger at Collor. ``It is necessary to express to the nation the
indignation I feel at seeing people with no credibility whatsoever
returning again to the public scene with insinuations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More enigmatic is the role played by Paulo Maluf, a former mayor
and governor of Sao Paulo, the country's largest city and state.
Maluf is nominally an ally of the president, but has long harbored
presidential ambitions of his own, and admitted that his daughters
also had a copy of the dossier and offered it to leaders of the
main opposition party, who rejected the overture.
</P>
<P>
   Maluf asserted that the women ``acted on their own account'' and
without his knowledge. But he has also lashed out at members of
Cardoso's Cabinet, saying their aim was to discredit his party.
</P>
<P>
   The president's supporters have had to mute their criticisms of
Maluf's conduct, though. The reason: If the financial rescue
package crafted by the Cardoso government and the IMF during two
months of difficult negotiations is to pass in the Congress, the
support of legislators loyal to Maluf is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, the Senate majority leader and one of
Cardoso's closest political associates, last week appeared to
rebuke Maluf, saying the plot against Cardoso was ``reprehensible''
and that if Maluf was involved in any way, ``obviously it is an
attitude that is disconcerting and does not dignify him.'' But, he
continued, ``I am not going to break with Maluf.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensing a political opportunity, opposition parties are now
demanding a full-scale parliamentary investigation, which could
drag on for months. Cardoso's supporters have resisted that effort,
but then the head of the federal police announced the start of an
official investigation and said he would call on all those whose
names are mentioned in the affair, including Cardoso, to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Amaral, the presidential spokesman, said Cardoso was willing to
cooperate ``because it is necessary to bring an end to this infamy
based on rumors.''

STARR PLANS TO TELL HOUSE PANEL OF PATTERN OF LIES BY CLINTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent counsel Kenneth Starr plans to tell a
House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday about repeated lies and
``misuse of presidential authority'' by President Clinton to cover
up his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In 58 pages of remarks prepared for the opening session of the
committee's impeachment inquiry, Starr accused Clinton of a
``pattern of obstruction of justice, false statements and misuse of
executive authority'' to undermine a federal grand jury
investigation and Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short, the evidence suggests that the president repeatedly
used the machinery of government and the powers of his office to
conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the American
people, from the judicial process in the (Paula) Jones case and
from the grand jury,'' Starr says in the testimony delivered late
Wednesday to the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement dismissing Starr's release as
a repeat of his earlier impeachment report ``in new wrapping
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr also is prepared to summarize his four-year criminal
investigation of the president and how prosecutors had drafted,
then decided against sending, a report to Congress a year ago
outlining possible impeachable offenses by Clinton stemming from
sworn testimony about his business dealings in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The report had detailed sworn testimony by Clinton that he knew
nothing about a fraudulent $300,000 loan from a federally backed
savings and loan run by David Hale, a former municipal judge in
Little Rock, Ark. Hale testified that Clinton urged him to make the
loan.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared remarks, Starr says he and his deputies decided
against referring the incident to Congress after concluding ``it
would be inconsistent with the statutory standard because of the
difficulty of establishing the truth with a sufficient degree of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said at the time ``there were still two outstanding
witnesses who might later corroborate _ or contradict'' the
allegations that Clinton lied about the loan. The witnesses are
former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker, who was convicted in a related
case and sent to prison, and Clinton's former Whitewater business
partner Susan McDougal, who was jailed for contempt for refusing to
cooperate with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr was given the green light to go beyond the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair by committee Chairman Henry Hyde, who also
signaled a renewed interest among Republican committee members in
whether Clinton was involved in campaign fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hyde announced plans Wednesday to subpoena four
more witnesses, including Deputy White House Counsel Bruce Lindsey,
the president's closest confidant, and Robert S. Bennett, a private
lawyer who represented Clinton in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said the panel will vote Thursday on whether to subpoena
Lindsey and Bennett, along with Daniel Gecker, attorney for
Kathleen Willey, and Democratic financier Nathan Landow, who had
contacts with Willey before she publicly accused Clinton of an
unwanted sexual advance.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's announcement came hours after Clinton left on an economic
mission to Asia, which will keep him out of the country during the
first few days of televised hearings and debate by the deeply
divided Judiciary Committee. The hearings were set to begin at 10
a.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by Republicans to expand the investigation beyond the
Lewinsky affair _ and to limit Democrats' ability to challenge
Starr's investigation _ drew protests from committee Democrats and
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an impeachment in search of a crime,'' complained
James Jordan, spokesman for Democrats on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters shortly before
the president departed that the Republicans appear to be on an
unconstitutional ``partisan adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart complained that Republicans are seeking to muzzle the
president's defenders while attempting to broaden their
investigation. ``They have rediscovered all of their old bad habits
and since they don't like where it's going they're going to try to
find something else,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who cautioned that he would tolerate no attacks on Starr,
said he has no plans to yield to Democratic complaints. ``The
Democrats want to stick to Monica Lewinsky. We want to look at
everything. That's the big difference,'' the Illinois Republican
told reporters after a strategy session with GOP colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton's legal team, which is being allowed to
participate in Thursday's hearing, Hyde warned that no questions
would be allowed about controversies surrounding Starr's
investigation of the president, such as contacts with Jones'
lawyers and an inquiry into illegal leaks of grand jury
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Efforts to utilize these proceedings as a forum to inquire
about nongermane matters, such as investigations into the conduct
of the investigation, that are pending before other bodies, shall
not be permitted,'' Hyde wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hyde has written the Justice Department for a memo
that provides a detailed argument for appointing an independent
counsel to take over the criminal investigation of Democratic
fund-raising abuses. Attorney General Janet Reno previously refused
to provide the memo, written by former prosecutor Charles LaBella,
to congressional committees. Under threat of contempt, she allowed
key committee members to read the document.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, who has been given two hours for his opening remarks,
plans to dispute claims by Clinton and many of his supporters that
his relationship with Lewinsky was a private affair and not the
proper subject for a special prosecutor to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating many of the 11 allegations that prompted the House to
launch the presidential impeachment investigation _ only the third
in the nation's history _ Starr said Clinton's behavior with the
former White House intern ``is not a private matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence ... suggests that the president ... misused his
authority and power as president and contravened his duty to
faithfully execute the laws,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also plans to draw parallels between the help Clinton and
his aides gave Lewinsky in her New York job search after learning
she was being subpoenaed in the Jones lawsuit and the financial aid
his supporters gave Webster Hubbell when he was under investigation
in the Whitewater case.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a top presidential assistant, several wealthy
Democrats funneled $550,000 in consulting work to Hubbell after he
left his high-ranking post at the Justice Department. Hubbell, a
long-time friend of Clinton and former law partner of first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, has declined to cooperate with Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the $550,000 was given to Mr. Hubbell for little or no
work,'' Starr said. ``This rush of generosity obviously gives rise
to an inference that the money was essentially a gift. And if it
was a gift, why was it given? This money was given despite the fact
that Mr. Hubbell was under criminal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   After learning that Jones' legal team wanted to question
Lewinsky, Clinton used White House aides and former U.N. Ambassador
Bill Richardson in an effort to find Lewinsky a job, Starr argued.

SORENSTAM SWINGING FOR TRIPLE CROWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Annika Sorenstam has a simple goal this week. She
wants to end another great season with another impressive victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam wants to end the official Ladies Professional Golf
Association season by winning the PageNet Tour Championship, which
begins Thursday at the Desert Inn Golf Club. It has been another
memorable year for Sorenstam, who at age 28 has a chance to capture
a rare triple crown _ the money title, the Rolex Player of the Year
Award, and the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average. Sorenstam
won all three honors in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   With $1,077,498 in winnings, Sorenstam has already clinched the
money title. Meanwhile, she has virtually clinched the scoring
average race (69.88) over Dottie Pepper (70.44), and Sorenstam also
leads the points standings for player of the year. Se Ri Pak is in
second place for that honor, but Sorenstam will win the award
unless Pak wins the Tour Championship and Sorenstam finishes lower
than third.
</P>
<P>
   If Sorenstam shoots a four-round score of 284 or better, she
will become the first LPGA player to finish the season with a
scoring average under 70. And Sorenstam is well-rested and
confident, with fond memories of winning last year's Tour
Championship in a sudden-death playoff against Lorie Kane and Pat
Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a special event, and I love the golf course,'' said
Sorenstam of the Desert Inn's par-72, 6,373-yard layout. ``It's
tricky, it's narrow, it's long. I'm looking forward to playing
it,'' she said, adding, ``If it's windy, it will be difficult. It's
a narrow course to begin with, and the greens are fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big event for me _ a lot can be decided this week.
I've had a lot of time to practice the last few weeks, so I'm as
ready as I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sorenstam is one of the favorites, the competition should
be intense in a field reserved for the year's top 30 money winners.
Dale Eggeling, 31st on the money list, will replace the pregnant
Tammie Green, 19th in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   There are six players in the field who have won at least twice
this year _ Kelly Robbins, Karrie Webb, Liselotte Neumann, Danielle
Ammaccapane, Pak and Sorenstam.
</P>
<P>
   Pak has won four times this year, including two majors _ the
McDonald's LPGA Championship and the United States Women's Open.

   LIVENT SUED AS IT FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION
</P>
<P>
   Livent, the Broadway theater company, filed for bankruptcy
protection, just six months after the company was taken over by
Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood talent agent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ovitz and his new management team filed a
lawsuit against the company's founders, Garth Drabinsky and Myron
Gottlieb, contending the two men fraudulently misled Ovitz into
investing in Livent by hiding the fact that the company was losing
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Livent's raising of the financial white flag underscores larger
questions about the future viability of a company that helped
define the outer reaches of theater extravagance.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL ECONOMY CONTRACTS BY 1.5 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Fanning widespread fears that Brazil is plunging into a
full-fledged recession, the government announced that the economy
contracted by 1.5 percent in the third quarter from the second
quarter and said that key indicators pointed toward an even more
pronounced slump over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS POST BROAD GAINS LATE
</P>
<P>
   Late-session surges drove stocks to broad gains as investors
more thoroughly digested the Federal Reserve's decision on Tuesday
to cut interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average gained
54.83 points, to 9,041.11. The Nasdaq did even better, climbing
18.92 points, or just more than 1 percent, to 1,897.44. The S&AMP;P 500
rose 5.16 points, to 1,144.48.
</P>
<P>
   Argentina raised $1 billion in seven-year debt, extending a
bond-sale binge and proving it can still tap international markets.
</P>
<P>
   TIGHTER RULES SEEN FOR HEDGE FUNDS
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. regulators tighten their scrutiny of hedge funds,
officials say they will likely require the often secretive funds to
reveal more about how much debt they use and the risks they take
with their money.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON'S STANCE ON CHEAP IMPORTS
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the Clinton administration, it is acceptable for
Russia and other countries to export their way to recovery as long
as those exports do not land here. Clinton is right to seek
protection from a deluge of temporarily cheap steel imports, but
there are good and bad ways to do that. So far the administration
has not chosen the best course of action.
</P>
<P>
   SALES FALL 4 PERCENT FOR GLAXO WELLCOME
</P>
<P>
   Glaxo Wellcome, the world's second-largest drug maker, said that
its 1998 sales through Oct. 31 fell 4 percent, within market
forecasts, as increased sales of asthma drugs failed to offset
slowing growth for other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   PROFIT UP 4.8 PERCENT FOR CAMPBELL SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Campbell Soup, which makes about 75 percent of the soup sold in
the United States, said that first-quarter profit rose 4.8 percent
because of cost cuts and higher-than-expected sales. Net income
rose to $264 million, or 58 cents a diluted share, matching
analysts' estimates. Campbell reduced spending, expanded overseas
and shed some businesses.
</P>
<P>
   SURGERY SET FOR CHIEF EXECUTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management said its chief executive, John Drury, was
scheduled to have a mass removed from his brain. But the company
said the operation was not life threatening and that Drury was
expected back at work within a week to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ALLIED SIGNAL CASE IN LOWER COURT
</P>
<P>
   In an advance for Allied Signal, the company said a federal
appeals court had given jurisdiction over the company's attempt to
expand the board of AMP with its own directors back to a district
court judge, who is likely to lift a preliminary injunction he
imposed last month barring the board election.

IF THESE OLD WALLS COULD TALK ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Me and Gretz, we go way back. I was eight
days shy of my 10th birthday and Wayne Gretzky was not quite 19
when he first visited me. I remember it so well, this breeze of a
boy from Edmonton scoring a power-play goal with the Oilers down,
7-0, to break up goaltender Mario Lessard's shutout bid.
</P>
<P>
   He would collect two goals and an assist that night in the
Oilers' 9-3 loss. All told, I've seen 171 of his goals _ including
his most historic, on March 23, 1994 _ and 412 of his points. Only
Marcel Dionne was more prolific in my presence and he was around me
night in and night out for 12 years. Gretzky and I spent a ton of
time together between October of 1988 and February of 1996 but not
so much before or since.
</P>
<P>
   We had joy, we had fun, we had one Stanley Cup title run. But so
much for all of our seasons in the sun. The reality is, I'm getting
on in years and so is he. At 31, I'm absolutely ancient for a
sports facility. I'm so old, people think my columns are the work
of guys named Domitian and Vespasian.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, the crowned prince of puck, turns 38 in January. I'm
not suggesting there's a rocking chair calling his name but the
Kings' newest center, Olli Jokinen, was born the same year (1978)
Gretzky began his pro career with the Indianapolis Racers.
</P>
<P>
   Me and Gretz, we're both showing signs of wear, though I don't
mind admitting he has withstood the ravages of time a lot better
than I. It's no secret I'm well past my prime, or have you not
heard the Kings are leaving me next fall for a comely crib on the
other side of town? Talk about stealing from the cradle; my
replacement hasn't even been christened yet!
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Gretzky's New York Rangers are taking on the Kings
tonight and I couldn't be more melancholy. It's the 303rd
regular-season visit the game's greatest player will pay me. It's
also the last. Just seeing him set up behind the net or glide
across the ice, one skate resting atop the other, is going to bring
back enough memories to flood the surface.
</P>
<P>
   For one night, anyway, that won't be condensation forming
puddles on the ice. It'll be my tears.
</P>
<P>
   From that first time he graced me with his presence, on Dec.22,
1979, I've had a soft spot for Gretzky. Those first nine years he
spent with the Oilers, I made him feel so at home, it's little
wonder the day came when he actually was storing his sticks and
hanging up his skates under my roof.
</P>
<P>
   In 31 regular-season visits as an Oiler, Gretzky left 30 of them
with at least one point. In that span, I saw him pull out hat
tricks twice and collect more than three points four times on his
way to 26 goals and 68 points. All told, Gretzky has collected at
least one point in 258 of his 302 trips to see me.
</P>
<P>
   His sleight of hand has been a sight to behold. His right hook?
Well, that was another story. For sure, the Lady Byng was created
for fighters such as Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   When people think of me and Gretz they think of the 1982 Miracle
on Manchester that drained the life out of his Oilers or the goal
he scored 12 years later as a King to pass the king himself, Gordie
Howe. But one of my most vivid memories is of the night he and I
got caught in the middle of the worst fracas on ice that didn't
involve Russian ice dancer Pasha Grishuk.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the whole thing and believe me, I was wiping the blood off
my side boards for days. It happened on Feb.28, 1990, in a game _
understand, I use that term loosely _ against the Oilers that
produced 86 penalties totaling 356 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gretzky, a noted pacifist, entered the fray, sort of. He jumped
an Oilers skater to keep him from bruising Brian Benning.
</P>
<P>
   As I also recall, I was filled to the rafters that night.
Indeed, it was my fifth sellout in 12 days, my 25th of the season
and my 49th since the start of the 1988-89 season, Gretzky's first
with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   My stock soared in the NHL as soon as Oilers owner Peter
Pocklington traded Gretzky to the Kings along with Mike
Krushelnyski and Marty McSorley for Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas,
three first-round draft picks and $15 million in cash. Just like
that, I was no longer the poor man's Forum. A Montreal wannabee no
more, I proceeded to ride Gretzky's jersey shirttails all the way
to a place in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   Me and Gretz had many memorable moments. They'll have to raze me
before I forget Roy Orbison singing the national anthem in
Gretzky's first game as a King, on Oct.6, 1988, and Wayne then
going out and scoring on his first shot on his way to a four-point
debut.
</P>
<P>
   His seven-point night against Quebec in February of 1989 was a
kick and I can live the rest of my days off the energy that coursed
through my concourses during Games 3 and 4 of the 1993 Stanley Cup
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing compared to the night in 1994 when he notched his
802nd goal to break Howe's goal-scoring record. Hundreds of
photographs were snapped of me and Gretz and the puck during and
after that game against Vancouver, many of them in a closet-sized
room off the Kings' dressing room where players, movie stars and
minimum-wage workers streamed through to have their pictures taken
with The Accommodating One.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the photographs from that night have made it to the
Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. That makes me happy, knowing I'll
be hanging on hockey's hallowed walls long after my own have
crumbled and fallen. &QL;

JULIUS CAESAR WATTS JR.: A REPUBLICAN OF FIRSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla.)  (See also CONGRESS-REPUBS) 
(af) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. was in an expansive mood
Wednesday, his 41st birthday, after being elected chairman of the
Republican Conference and promising to put ``feet and words and
message'' to his party's policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a party of men and women, and red, yellow, brown, black
and white Americans,'' he said. ``I think we want to say to
everybody that you're welcome in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oklahoma congressman's language of inclusiveness was a small
paradox, in a way, because for much of his political career _
indeed, for much of his life _the adjectives most often linked to
him were ``the first'' and ``the only.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Eufaula, Okla., where his father was the first black
police officer, Julius Caesar Watts Jr. helped to integrate
Jefferson Davis Elementary School. He was not the only black child
at the school honoring the president of the Confederacy (there was
one other), but he was the first black quarterback at his high
school.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the University of Oklahoma football team to
consecutive Orange Bowl victories, in 1980 and 1981, he played
professional football in Canada for several years. In 1990 he
became the first black to win statewide elected office in Oklahoma,
capturing a seat on the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, which
regulates oil and gas utilities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he was elected to Congress from the Fourth District in
southwestern Oklahoma. For two years, there was one other black
Republican in the House, Gary A. Franks of Connecticut, but when
Watts won re-election in 1996 and Franks did not, Watts found
himself the only black Republican in the House.
</P>
<P>
   He is the only black who does not belong to the Congressional
Black Caucus, and Wednesday he became the first black Republican
ever elected to a leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in many ways he talks like a consummate team player, and has
been seen by his party colleagues as one. His remarks to reporters
Wednesday could have been taken from the Republican hornbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about everybody working together as a team to make
sure that we cut people's taxes, that we strengthen our national
defense, that we strengthen Social Security, we continue working on
a health-care system to make it better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Partisan bromides aside, Watts, an ordained Baptist minister, is
acknowledged as an inspiring speaker. He was picked by his party to
deliver its response to President Clinton's State of the Union
Message in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm just old enough to remember the Jim Crow brand
of discrimination,'' he said then. ``In my lifetime there have been
some great and good laws that took some evil and ignorant laws off
the books.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ``if legislation is the answer to the racial
divide in our nation, then why _ in God's name, in our time _ has
the division grown?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is,'' he said, ``our problems can't be solved by
legislation alone. In fact, government sometimes rubs the wound
raw, and makes the healing harder.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to extol the Republican ideals of self-reliance,
responsibility, morality. ``We must be a people who dare _ dare to
take responsibility for our hatreds and fears and ask God to heal
us from within.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts' words have occasionally been more pungent, as when he
referred to ``race-hustling poverty pimps,'' black politicians
whose careers, he said, hinged on keeping many black people
dependent on government. (That remark, in a interview in The
Washington Post two years ago, caused a furor as Watts insisted he
was not referring to the Rev. Jesse Jackson.)
</P>
<P>
   Watts has deplored President Clinton's conduct in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal but has not said what he thinks should be done
about it. His deputy press secretary, Tobi Edwards, said he would
wait until the House Judiciary Committee conducted its business
before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   Watts and his wife, Frankie, have five children from
grade-school age to their early 20s. The congressman and his wife
were already planning a birthday celebration Wednesday night,
before his election to the leadership post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably going to be a bigger party than we thought,''
Ms. Edwards said. But not a wild one. The congressman is a
teetotaler.

RUEGAMER GETS READUY FOR POSSIBLY LAST GAME AS A DEVIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the scariest sight on wheels since the Wizard of Oz
tornado scene. Grey Ruegamer. On a bike. In the locker-room shower.
Naked.
</P>
<P>
   Need more? Check out his freezer. You'll find a fish head tucked
under the Stouffer's.
</P>
<P>
   That's the free-spirited Ruegamer. Then there's the other side,
the one who enjoys working with special education children, the one
former teammate Kyle Murphy describes as a ``great guy and true
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder may have summed it up best when he
described the senior as ``complex, mean, smart, tender, obnoxious.
He's 14. He's 44.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many shades of Grey, but the one the Sun Devils will
miss most is the tough-nosed player on the football field. Unless
ASU beats Arizona and advances to a bowl, Nov. 27 will be
Ruegamer's last game in a Sun Devil uniform.
</P>
<P>
   His preference for the bizarre sometimes overshadows his
accomplishments: First team All-Pac-10 in 1997, Lombardi Award and
Outland Trophy candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He always plays hard, but this season his aggressiveness has
raised some eyebrows. Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti accused the Sun
Devils' offensive line of chop-blocking, and several of the plays
under question involved Ruegamer.
</P>
<P>
   Some have wondered if the center might feel the backlash in the
postseason, when coaches vote for the all-conference team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not concerned about what Pac-10 coaches think,'' he said.
``That stuff doesn't matter to me. I'm just (ticked) off because of
his accusation. It isn't intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everything else about Ruegamer is. He often has crazy
bumpersticks or messages, like ``Maggotfest,'' taped to his helmet.
He'll walk around ASU's locker room wearing nothing but a glove in
a, well, odd place. Or he'll ride around naked on a bike to lighten
up a glum locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that one from Jake (Plummer),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He received some noteriety this summer when he spent a weekend
helping a friend of his mom's castrate sheep. The process was done
in the Basque tradition, which means teeth are used instead of a
scalpal because it is less painful to the animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more worried about the sheep than me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did about 200.
</P>
<P>
   There are still people walking around Tempe who believe
Ruegamer's mom is a buffet waitress at a Las Vegas casino.
</P>
<P>
   He started that story after growing tired of those who knew
nothing about his Nevada hometown and assumed he was raised in a
hotel. So he ran with it.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, both parents are doctors. His father is a
veterinarian, his mother a Ph.D. Is she appalled by her son's
behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Are you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   ``She hunts mountain lions in her spare time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This was confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   A recent question-and-answer session with Ruegamer in the ASU
game program offered these tidbits:
</P>
<P>
   If you could live anywhere, where would you live?
</P>
<P>
   ``Underwater, on the ocean floor.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to switch places for a day with . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``A grizzly bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense. If there's one thing that defines Ruegamer, it's
his toughness. Credit his older brother Shane, his long-time
sparring partner growing up. When the boys were young, their
father, Alan, bought them boxing gloves so they would stop
wrestling in the house and breaking things.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'd cry, he'd start beating the hell out of me again,''
he said. ``He taught me a lot of things in the process of kicking
my (butt). He's actually great. So are my parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Shane is now about six inches smaller now than the 6-foot-5,
305-pound Grey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' he said. ``I guess I mutated.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruegamer makes no excuses for his behavior. ASU linebacker Joe
Cesta, Ruegamer's roommate, believes he ``does it for his own
enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ruegamer: ``I'm like a little kid. If I have too much
sugar, I get hyper. Sometimes I get incredibly bored. I could
entertain myself for hours on end just by creating things to amuse.
I don't see it as being that off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruegamer stands out on and off the football field, and coaches
already are bemoaning the fact that he won't be back next season.
</P>
<P>
   He looks forward to his future, which likely will be in the NFL,
but he'll miss his experience at ASU and the relationship he's
developed with teammates and coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't trade it,'' he said. ``Not many guys can say
they've been to the Rose Bowl. We've done so many good things here.
I've been fortunate to experience all these things college football
has to offer. I got to do a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   And he certainly did them his way.

SOME MOORE OFFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - He has thought about the play a countless number
of times, rewinding it in his head, wishing there was something,
anything he could have done to make the outcome different.
</P>
<P>
   But each time Cardinals wide receiver Rob Moore replays the
closing seconds of last Sunday's game, the result always is the
same.
</P>
<P>
   He gets mauled in the right corner of the end zone by Dallas
cornerback Kevin Smith and quarterback Jake Plummer's pass falls
incomplete. Then, Moore looks for a pass-interference penalty, but
there is no call, and the Cardinals lose, 35-28.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thought I had was if I could have just squeezed it
a little more,'' he said. ``I thought it slipped out of my hands.''
</P>
<P>
   The film showed otherwise. Smith knocked away the ball but not
until after a severe case of static cling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to expect to get calls like that,'' Moore said. ``But
when it starts happening time after time. . .Sure, it was
interference. But (for an official) to make that call, that's a
gutsy call.''
</P>
<P>
   The play was symbolic of Moore's season.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Moore led the NFL in receiving yards (1,584),
catches of at least 25 yards (20) and first-down grabs (68) in
making the NFC Pro Bowl team.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Moore's production has dropped dramatically. He has
only 34 catches (down 23 from this time a year ago) for 487 yards,
a 14.3 average.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are simple. For much of the first half of the
season, he was slowed because of a nagging hamstring. He also has
played in an offense that has been one of the league's worst.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last month, in the middle of his slump, the ``New York
Times'' wrote that Moore, who is in the last year of his
$2.8-million-a-year contract, could be headed to the New York
Giants at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where they got that,'' said Moore, a Hempstead,
N.Y., native who came to the Cardinals in 1995 from the New York
Jets in a draft-day trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it didn't come from me. When I left there, (the New
York media) was saying that I was asking for too much money, that I
was demanding a trade. I heard so many things.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he's happy in the Valley of the Sun and could see
re-signing.
</P>
<P>
   `How can you beat this?'' he said of the weather. ``I got
married here. I had my (two) kids here. (Wide receiver Frank
Sanders) and I are like brothers. Guys like Aeneas (Williams) and
Anthony (Edwards) . . . I have an allegiance to so many players on
this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played with so many quarterbacks. Now, I look at Jake
(Plummer), and can't help but want to be part of his growth
process. He's so young but already doing things that takes people
years to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he won't even think about his free-agent options
until the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an opportunity to get to the playoffs and that's
very important to me,'' Moore said. ``I've only been there once
before. We have a great chance to enjoy what that's like.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he isn't upset about his production ``because we have
a lot more wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, 4-12 a year ago, are 5-5 and in the running for a
wild-card spot going into Sunday's game at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, Moore has had two of his three best
games this season. He had five catches for 107 yards in the 17-15
victory at Detroit on Nov. 1. Last Sunday, he had three receptions
for 77 yards, including a 57-yarder in the closing seconds that
gave the Cardinals first and goal at the 5.
</P>
<P>
   He was tackled from behind by safety Kenny Wheaton after it
appeared he would score or at least get out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed I didn't get into the end zone,'' Moore
said. ``I still think I was trying to do the right thing. I wasn't
thinking about the clock. I just ran out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals are going to continue to try to get the ball to
Moore for big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a down-the-field receiver. He should be averaging 15 to
18 yards a catch,'' offensive coordinator Marc Trestman said. ``At
times, we've had him open, but he's been victim of some bad luck.
In (last Sunday's) Dallas game, we had him open on a go-route and
just missed him. In the first Dallas game, he beats (cornerback
Kevin) Smith by 20 yards, and we get sacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man of tremendous character, and I know things have not
gone exactly the way he has wanted this season, but he means so
much to us and we want him here.'' &QL;

WHY IS JAVA SUCH A BIG DEAL? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: In the 1st and 2nd grafs, (plus plus) should be replaced with
plus symbols.) 
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Java, the programming language at issue in the contract dispute
between the Microsoft Corp. and Sun Microsystems, is fundamentally
different from other computer languages like C, C(plus plus),
Pascal or Basic.
</P>
<P>
   Other programming languages are dependent on the underlying
operating system that controls the basic functions of the computer
running the programs. A program written in C(plus plus) for an
Apple Computer Macintosh will not work on a personal computer using
the Microsoft Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But Java _ invented by Sun Microsystems, which controls Java
licensing _ is intended to act as a lingua franca of computing.
Java enables software to be used over networks _ especially over
the Internet _ by many kinds of computers running sundry operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Java, a graphic artist with an Apple Macintosh
computer running the Mac operating system, an engineer on a Sun
Microsystems Sparc work station running a version of the Unix
operating system and a student with a Pentium-chip personal
computer running the Microsoft Windows operating system can all
play poker with one another on the Yahoo World Wide Web site.
That's because the poker game is written in Java, which can operate
on those different computers at the same time, over the network.
</P>
<P>
   But this works-anywhere flexibility also means that, from a
programmer's point of view, Java makes all operating systems equal.
And that poses a serious threat to Microsoft, whose market
dominance is based the fact that its Windows operating system is
the industry standard _ controlling the basic operations of some 90
percent of PCs sold.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary as Java may sound, though, programs written in
this language are not always impressive. For any given computer to
use a Java program, each line of code _ or each block of reusable
code known as an ``object'' _ must be interpreted before it can be
understood by the operating system, which then must translate it
yet again for its instructions to be understood by the computer's
microprocessor chip.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Java's speed has improved a great deal in the last
18 months, all this translating means that running a Java program
can still be excruciatingly slow compared with running the same
program written in a language like C.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the Java interpreter, known as the ``virtual machine''
or VM software, is also the language's greatest strength. It allows
for the ``write once, run anywhere'' capability that enables
programmers to create a single piece of software that can be
understood by any major operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Java software can not only cut development time for
individual programs but can also result in programs that have a
much larger potential market than programs written in other
languages.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, once a user installs Java _ which happens
automatically when a Web browser is installed _ the Java virtual
machine resides permanently on the user's hard drive. From then on,
it stands ready to run a Java program whenever it is needed. This
is what is known in computer jargon as a ``platform'' _ that is,
foundation software on which other programs run.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage this holds for the Internet is that tiny bits of
Java code, known as applets, can be sent to and used by any kind of
computer that has a Java virtual machine. The small size of the
applets makes them usable even on computers with slow Internet
links like dial-up modems.
</P>
<P>
   All of this poses a threat to Microsoft because it marginalizes
the importance of Microsoft's platform, the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the conventional computing world, in which programs run on
only one operating system, Microsoft's Windows tends to be a
self-perpetuating monopoly. If a user has invested several thousand
dollars in software that will run only on Windows, he is not likely
to switch to a Macintosh computer or to install, say, a Unix
operating system, because in addition to the cost of the new
machine, he will have to buy all new software.
</P>
<P>
   But if at some point in the future that same user could purchase
all Java software, he would have much more freedom to change
computers and operating systems. While that is not now possible, a
number of major software developers, including International
Business Machines Corp., its Lotus subsidiary and Corel Corp. have
committed to major development of Java software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun's lawsuit traces to Microsoft's obtaining a Java license
from the company in 1996 and then setting to work altering parts of
the virtual machine. To be sure, some changes made Java run more
efficiently on Windows machines, but other alterations stripped the
translator of certain capabilities _ functions that Sun contends
Microsoft wanted to keep the sole province of the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun lawsuit asserts that these changes violated the 1996
licensing agreement. And many in the software industry are watching
this case with great apprehension:
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft is allowed to distribute a nonstandard form of
Java, the resulting industry fragmentation would mean that
different Java code would have to be written for different
operating systems. That might remove a threat to Microsoft, but for
the lingua franca of computing, the resultant babble of variants
would destroy the Java language's greatest strength. &QL;

STARR TO CITE PATTERN OF OBSTRUCTION; WIDENING INQUIRY SEEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to update; smoothing throughout)   (htv) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, will insist
in the House impeachment hearing on Thursday that President Clinton
not only obstructed justice by covering up his affair with Monica
Lewinsky but also threw up ``roadblocks and hurdles'' time and
again that slowed the prosecutor's other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Starr's prepared testimony for the House
Judiciary Committee's first hearing was released Wednesday night,
Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, the committee's chairman, announced
that Republicans would subpoena four new witnesses amid signs that
the panel's majority was seeking to broaden the inquiry far beyond
the Lewinsky matter to try to show a larger pattern of obstruction
of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also sought a Justice Department report on campaign finance
investigations concerning Clinton, and the department indicated it
was likely to provide it.
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Starr ran through a litany of the
investigations he has conducted since he was first charged with
examining the president's failed Whitewater real estate venture,
and said, ``The pattern of obstruction of justice, false
statements, and misuse of executive authority in the Lewinsky
investigation did not occur in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   He complained that his office ``had to litigate in the courts as
our investigation ran into roadblocks and hurdles that slowed us
down.'' Unlike the prosecutors who investigated Presidents Reagan
and Carter, Starr said, ``We have been forced to go to court time
and again to seek information from the executive branch and to
fight a multitude of privilege claims asserted by the
Administration _ every single one of which we have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, for the first time, Starr announced that he has exonerated
the Clinton administration from any wrongdoing in the firings of
seven employees in the White House travel office and into whether
White House officials misused confidential FBI files of White House
and government employees in their own and previous administrations.
</P>
<P>
   As for Whitewater, Starr said he had drafted an impeachment
referral in late 1997 that outlined accusations that Clinton had
testified falsely at the trial of his business partner Jim McDougal
and the former governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. But Starr said
he never sent the referral, because he said the evidence was not
substantial enough.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Starr's testimony dealt with the Lewinsky matter, on
which he referred 11 potential articles of impeachment to the House
in September. Starr summed up his view of the president's hostility
to his investigation in these terms:
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next several months, it became apparent that the
strategy to win had many prongs.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, the president denied the truth publicly and
emphatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, he publicly promised to cooperate with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third, the president deflected and diverted the investigation
by telling aides false stories that were then relayed to the grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fourth, he refused invitations to testify to the grand jury
for over six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifth, his administration delayed the investigation through
multiple privilege claims, each of which has been rejected by the
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixth, surrogates of the president attacked the credibility
and legitimacy of the grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seventh, surrogates of the president attempted to convince the
Congress and the American people that the matter was unimportant.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said Republicans wanted to take depositions from Bruce
Lindsey, the Clinton confidant who is deputy White House counsel
and from Robert Bennett, Clinton's private attorney in the sexual
harassment case brought by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He said the committee would also question, Daniel Gecker, the
lawyer for Kathleen Willey, a White House volunteer who has said
the President made a sexual advance to her, and Nathan Landow, a
Democratic developer and fund-raiser close to the White House who
counseled Ms. Willey on whether she should testify in the Jones
case.

OREGON COACH TAKES WRONG TURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Some final thoughts as Chop-gate gets put to
rest:
</P>
<P>
   The absurdity in the recent tiff between Oregon and Arizona
State had less to do with what Ducks Coach  &UR; Mike Bellotti said than
how he said it.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to accuse ASU's offensive line of questionable tactics
during a conference call with media covering the Sun Devils. And he
brought it up unsolicited.
</P>
<P>
   If Bellotti truly believes ASU is guilty of repeated
chop-blocking, fine. Inform the Pac-10. Call Coach  &UR; Bruce Snyder
and hash it out. Raise the issue at the next coaches' meeting. But
to go public before doing any of these things is bunk.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Bellotti's statement implies ASU coaches the
tactic, and that's damaging. The truth is ASU probably has
chop-blocked, but as a product of aggressive, overzealous play, not
intent.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sun Devils need to learn to rein it in a bit, so be it.
But the argument that it's coached? Forget it. The Sun Devils
haven't been called for a chop-block this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bellotti has done an amazing job at Oregon and represents the
conference well. He builds his teams around the talent of his
players and gets the most out of them. And he recruits well.
</P>
<P>
   If only he could choose his words as well as his players. &QL; 
Around the Pac &QL; 
Although  &UR; Jim Lambright has received heat for Washington's 5-5
start (3-4 in the Pac-10), Huskies strong safety  &UR; Nigel Burton was
quick to come to the defense of his head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched the man sleep in his office,'' he said. ``I've
come up at 11 o'clock at night and the doors are still open for us
to watch film. I've watched him do every conceivable thing other
than jump through Hula Hoops to get this team to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambright recently signed a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Stanford has lost 13 of its past 16 games, Coach
 &UR; Tyrone Willingham's job doesn't appear to be in danger, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were a lot of other schools . . . there would be a lot
of pressure,'' Athletic Director  &UR; Ted Leland said. ``But we're
trying to portray the image of stability, and I think Tyrone
portrays that image for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've hit a bump in the road here, but I don't think it's time
to panic.''
</P>
<P>
   This could be the first winter since 1993 that the Pac-10 will
go without a coaching change.
</P>
<P>
   California Athletic Director  &UR; John Kasser isn't taking any
chances.
</P>
<P>
   He has mailed highlight tapes of the Golden Bears to organizers
of the two Christmas Day bowls in Honolulu as well as the Las
Vegas, Sunshine and Alamo bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawaii bowls will take the No. 4 and No. 5 Pac-10 teams. The
Vegas bowl has an at-large berth available, and the remaining two
have commitments to conferences whose lower-tier teams might not
have the required six victories.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the catch. California (5-5, 3-4) might not either. It has
to beat Stanford on Saturday first.
</P>
<P>
   Bowl update: Four conference teams have met the criteria for a
bowl invitation: UCLA, Arizona, Oregon and Southern California.
Three others _ ASU, Washington and Cal _ need one more victory.
</P>
<P>
   Washington appears to be in danger of not leading the conference
in attendance for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies' average of 71,356 beats UCLA's 70,117, but UCLA has
one home game left _ vs. USC _ and Washington finishes at
Washington State. &QL; 
Quote of the week &QL; 
``I've never had anybody do that to me in 23 years. I was mad,
angry, embarrassed.'' _ UCLA defensive coordinator  &UR; Nick Aliotti,
on recent public criticism of him by Coach  &UR; Bob Toledo. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: Corbin Jones.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Clinton's 1996 campaign finance practices, Hyde wrote to
Attorney General Janet Reno, seeking unrestricted access to a
memorandum from Charles G. LaBella, the former top prosecutor for
campaign finance abuses, in which he recommended that an
independent counsel investigate the president and Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, obtained by The New York Times, Hyde said that
because he wanted to wrap up his impeachment inquiry expeditiously,
``I do not believe that the committee can or should wait for you to
finish your preliminary inquiry of possible crimes of the president
or your campaign finance investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde once again said that he intended to finish his
investigation by the end of the year. But Democrats and the White
House accused the Republicans of ranging far beyond Starr's charges
of 11 possible impeachable offenses in the Lewinsky case and of
trying to start a battle over lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an effort to pick a partisan food fight they've been
reduced to picking up Ken Starr's leftovers,'' said Jim Kennedy. a
White House spokesman. ``They are even trying to out-Starr Starr by
breaching the attorney- client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here is an impeachment in search of a crime, and
in another 48 hours we will be reopening the Vincent Foster case,''
said James Jordan, the spokesman for Democrats on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., said the fast-moving events meant
that ``this is going to be a long involved process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, is likely to cooperate with Hyde's
request for the memorandum written by LaBella, department officials
said. First, however, judicial approval must be obtained to
disclose grand jury information in the report. The Justice
Department could go to court to seek permission as early as
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The activity and partisan positioning came a day before Starr is
to take center stage before Congress, set free for the first time
in his investigation of the president to give a wide-ranging public
presentation of his case against the president. In his prepared
testimony, Starr argued that his case against Clinton has nothing
to do with sexual liaisons and he protested that his office had
taken no pleasure in investigating the sordid affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The propriety of a relationship is not the concern of our
office,'' Starr said. ``No citizen who finds himself accused in a
sexual harassment case, or in any other kind of case, can lie under
oath or otherwise obstruct justice, and thereby prevent the
plaintiff from discovering evidence and proving her case.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr took on one of the major White House defenses, the
argument that the perjury he alleges Clinton committed is a
personal crime far below the level of ``high crimes and
misdemeanors'' the Constitution sets as a standard for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   He said in his statement: ``History and practice support the
conclusion that perjury, in particular, is a high crime or
misdemeanor. Perjury has been the basis for the removal of several
judges. As far as we know, no one questioned whether perjury was a
high crime or misdemeanor in those cases. In addition, as several
of the scholars who appeared before you testified, perjury seems to
have been recognized as a high crime or misdemeanor at the time of
the founding.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr subtitled the final section of his statement
``Reflections.'' In it, he defended the work of his office over
nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lewinsky investigation, Starr said neither he nor his
staff ``relished'' the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff and I agree with the sentiments expressed by Chairman
Hyde in the Nov. 9 hearing when he said, `I'd like to forget all of
this,''' Starr said, adding: ``I mean, who needs it?''
</P>
<P>
   He also detailed his legal background, dating to his position as
a law clerk in 1973, and attempted to joke about his lack of
political acumen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person is, of course, deeply affected by his or her
experiences,'' Starr said. ``For my part, my experience is in the
law and the courts. I am not a man of polls, public relations, or
politics _ which I suppose is obvious at this point. I am not
experienced in political campaigns.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starr will have two hours on Thursday to make his case before
the committee, and Republicans are hoping that he will be a
compelling speaker who can improve his tarnished public image and
focus the American public on his charges that the president
committed perjury, obstructed justice and abused the power of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said the hearing would give Starr ``the
capability, without his words being distorted by the White House,
to talk to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr will then be questioned for a half hour apiece by the
committee's Republican and Democratic senior investigators, David
Schippers and Abbe Lowell. The 37 committee members will then
question him and when they are done White House lawyers have been
granted 30 minutes to cross-examine him.
</P>
<P>
   The White House on Wednesday grudgingly accepted the
Republicans' offer of a half hour, although it had wanted 90
minutes. Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, said that the
difference in time allotted to the prosecutor and to the White
House ''is not consistent with the standard of fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde told reporters Wednesday that he would be ``liberal'' with
the half-hour time limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're on a line of questioning and they need more time, I
will grant them more time,'' he said, ``I wish to control the time.
They're not being mistreated at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has informed the White House that Clinton's lawyers will
not be allowed to question the prosecutor about the controversies
surrounding his investigation, which include questions about his
contacts with Paula Jones' lawyers and an investigation of whether
his office had leaked grand jury information.

EXCERPTS FROM STARR'S PREPARED REMARKS TO JUDICIARY COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the opening statement
of the independent prosecutor, Kenneth Starr, prepared for delivery
before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday as it considered
impeachment proceedings against President Clinton. The material was
made available to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   It bears mention that well before January 1998, the President
used Government resources and prerogatives to pursue his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The evidence suggests that the
President used his secretary Betty Currie, a government employee,
to facilitate and conceal the relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The President used White House aides and the United States
Ambassador to the United Nations in his effort to find Ms. Lewinsky
a job at a time when it was foreseeable _ even likely _ that she
would be a witness in the Jones case. And the President used a
government attorney _ Bruce Lindsey _ to assist his personal legal
defense during the case.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the evidence suggests that the President repeatedly
used the machinery of Government and the powers of his office to
conceal his relationship with Monica Lewinsky from the American
people, from the judicial process in the Jones case and from the
grand jury. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I want to emphasize that our referral never suggests that the
relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky in and of
itself could be a high crime or misdemeanor. Indeed, the referral
never passes judgment on the President's relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. The propriety of a relationship is not the concern of our
office.
</P>
<P>
   The referral is instead about obstruction of justice, lying
under oath, tampering with witnesses and misuse of power. The
referral cannot be understood without appreciating this vital
distinction.
</P>
<P>
   This case raises the following initial question: Is a plaintiff
in a sexual harassment lawsuit entitled to obtain truthful evidence
from the defendant and from associates of the defendant, in order
to support her claim? That should be easy to answer. No citizen who
finds himself accused in a sexual harassment case, or in any other
kind of case, can lie under oath or otherwise obstruct justice and
thereby prevent the plaintiff from discovering evidence and proving
her case.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, filed a Federal
sexual harassment suit against President Clinton in 1994. The
President denied those allegations. We will never know whether a
jury would have credited Ms. Jones' allegations. We also will never
know whether the ultimate decision maker would have found that the
alleged facts, if true, constitute sexual harassment. When the
President and Ms. Jones settled the case last week, the Eighth
Circuit Court of Appeals was still considering the preliminary
legal question whether the facts as alleged could constitute sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   After the suit was first filed in 1994, the President attempted
to delay the trial until his Presidency was over. The President
claimed a temporary Presidential immunity from civil suit. The case
proceeded to the Supreme Court. At oral argument, the President's
attorney specifically warned our nation's highest court that if Ms.
Jones won, her lawyers would be able to investigate the President's
relationships with other women, as is common in sexual harassment
cases. The Supreme Court rejected the President's constitutional
claim _ and did so by a 9-to-0 vote. The Court concluded that the
Constitution did not provide such a temporary immunity from suit.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was simple and powerful: No one is above the law. The
Supreme Court sent the case back for trial with words that warrant
emphasis: ``Like every other citizen who invokes'' the District
Court's jurisdiction, Ms. Jones ``has a right to an orderly
disposition of her claims.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Supreme Court's decision, the parties started to
gather the facts. The parties questioned relevant witnesses in
depositions. They submitted written questions. They made requests
for documents.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual harassment cases are often ``he said-she said'' disputes.
Evidence reflecting the behavior of both parties can be critical _
including the defendant's relationships with other employees in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Such questions can be uncomfortable, but they occur every day in
courts and law offices around the country. Individuals take an oath
to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. And
no one is entitled to lie under oath simply because he or she does
not like the questions or because he believes the case is frivolous
or financially motivated or politically motivated. The Supreme
Court has emphatically and repeatedly rejected the notion that
there is ever a privilege to lie. The Court has stated that there
are ways to object to questions; lying under oath is not one of
them.
</P>
<P>
   During the fact-gathering process, Judge Susan Webber Wright
followed the standard principles of sexual harassment cases. Over
repeated objection from the President's attorneys, the judge
permitted inquiries into the President's relationships with
Government employees. On Jan. 8, 1998, for example, Judge Wright
stated that questions as to the President's relationships with
other employees ``are within the scope of the issues in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   In making these rulings, Judge Wright recognized that the
questions might prove embarrassing. She stated that ``I have never
had a sexual harassment case where there was not some
embarrassment.'' She also stated that she could not protect the
parties from embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Let me summarize the five points that explain how the
President's relationship wLth Ms. Lewinsky _ what was otherwise
private conduct _ became a matter of concern to the courts. This is
critical to fully understand the nature of the Committee' s
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   One. The President was sued for sexual harassment, and the
Supreme Court ruled that the case should go forward.
</P>
<P>
   Two. The law of sexual harassment and the law of evidence allow
the plaintiff to inquire into the defendant's relationships with
other women in the workplace, which in this case included President
Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Three. Applying those settled legal principles, Judge Susan
Webber Wright repeatedly rejected the President's objections to
such inquiries. The Judge, instead, ordered the President to answer
the questions.
</P>
<P>
   Four. It is a Federal crime to commit perjury and obstruct
justice in civil cases, including sexual harassment cases.
Violators are subject to a sentence of up to 10 years imprisonment
for obstruction and up to 5 years for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Five. The evidence suggests that the President and Ms. Lewinsky
made false statements under oath and obstructed the judicial
process in the Jones case by preventing the court from obtaining
the truth about their relationship. . . .
</P>
<P>
   On at least six different occasions _ from Dec. 17, 1997,
through Aug. 17, 1998, the President had to make a decision. He
could choose truth, or he could choose deception. On all six
occasions, the President chose deception _ a pattern of calculated
behavior over a span of months.

PADRES' FINLEY DUE FOR VISIT ON MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Free agency in baseball is marked by plenty of ebb and
flow.
</P>
<P>
   One can wake up one day and be certain that the Diamondbacks
will sign left-hander  &UR; Randy Johnson. The next day, a completely
different feeling. The same thing with center fielder  &UR; Bernie
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the tide carried in right-hander  &UR; Todd Stottlemyre,
with Arizona making an offer. On Wednesday, team officials were
waiting for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears that another jewel will wash ashore Monday.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Joe Garagiola Jr. said center fielder  &UR; Steve
Finley, who helped the San Diego Padres reach the World Series,
will visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in the upper echelon as far as defensive outfielders are
concerned (Finley won National League Gold Gloves in 1995 and
1996). He's always been a solid hitter who happened to have an off
year last year (.249, 14 homers, 67 RBIs), but he was still the
everyday center fielder of a team that made it to the World
Series,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks were one of the first clubs to contact Finley
after the season, said Finley's agent,  &UR; Tommy Tanzer, and the
attention increased after the Los Angeles Dodgers signed
Diamondbacks center fielder  &UR; Devon White to a three-year, $12.4
million deal Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in what the Diamondbacks have to say. It is
an intriguing situation,'' Tanzer said. ``You wonder how extensive
their off-season moves will be. Could they bring in three top guys?
That's something you don't often see.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be that the Diamondbacks are focusing on Finley, 33,
because the tide might be taking Williams back toward the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are taking a long look at  &UR; Albert Belle and had
 &UR; Brian
 &UR; Jordan in for a visit Wednesday, but upon leaving his meeting,
Jordan said the team's No. 1 goal is to re-sign Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks still claim they have not made offers to
Williams and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will head to the West Coast in the next few days to
check out the Dodgers and Anaheim Angels. He could make a decision
on a new team by early next week, sources said. And Garagiola said
Stottlemyre continues to consider Arizona's offer. The team has not
disclosed details. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: of months.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Dec. 5, 1997, Ms. Jones' attorneys identified Ms. Lewinsky as
a potential witness. Within a day, the President learned that Ms.
Lewinsky's name was on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   After learning this, the President faced his first critical
decision. Would he and Monica Lewinsky tell the truth about their
relationship? Or would they provide false information _ not just to
a spouse or to loved ones _ but under oath in a court of law?
</P>
<P>
   Eleven months ago, the President made his decision. At
approximately 2:00 A.M. on Dec. 17, 1997, he called Ms. Lewinsky at
her Watergate apartment and told her that she was on the witness
list. This was news to Ms. Lewinsky. And it bears noting that the
President _ not his lawyer _ made this call to the witness.
</P>
<P>
   During this 2:00 A.M. conversation, which lasted approximately
half an hour, the President could have told Ms. Lewinsky that they
must tell the truth under oath. The President could have explained
that they might face embarrassment but that, as a citizen and as
President, he could not lie under oath and he could not sit by
while Monica did so. The President did not say anything like that.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, according to Ms. Lewinsky, the President
suggested that she could sign an affidavit and use _ under oath _
deceptive cover stories that they had devised long ago to explain
why Ms. Lewinsky had visited the Oval Office area. The President
did not explicitly instruct Ms. Lewinsky to lie. He did not have
to. Ms. Lewinsky testified that the President's suggestion that
they use the pre-existing cover stories amounted to a continuation
of their pattern of concealing their intimate relationship.
Starting with this conversation, the President and Ms. Lewinsky
understood, according to Ms. Lewinsky, that they were both going to
make false statements under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation between the President and Ms. Lewinsky on Dec.
17 was a critical turning point. The evidence suggests that the
President chose to engage in a criminal act _ to reach an
understanding with Ms. Lewinsky that they would both make false
statements under oath. At that moment, the President's intimate
relationship with a subordinate employee was transformed into an
unlawful effort to thwart the judicial process. This was no longer
an issue of private conduct. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The legal process continued to unfold, and the President took
other actions that had the foreseeable effect of keeping Ms.
Lewinsky ``on the team.'' The President helped Ms. Lewinsky obtain
a job in New York. His efforts began after the Supreme Court's
decision in May 1997 _ at a time when it had become foreseeable
that she could be an adverse witness against the President. These
job-related efforts intensified in December 1997 after Ms.
Lewinsky's name appeared on the witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Jordan, who had been enlisted in the job search for Ms.
Lewinsky, testified that he kept the President informed of the
status of Ms. Lewinsky's job search and her affidavit. On Jan. 7,
1998, Mr. Jordan told the President that Ms. Lewinsky had signed
the affidavit. Mr. Jordan stated to the President that he was still
working on getting her a job. The President replied, ``Good.'' In
other words, the President, knowing that a witness had just signed
a false affidavit, encouraged his friend to continue trying to find
her a job. After Ms. Lewinsky received a job offer from Revlon on
Jan. 22, Vernon Jordan called the President and said, ``Mission
accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   As is often the situation in cases involving this kind of
financial assistance, no direct evidence reveals the President's
intent in assisting Ms. Lewinsky. Ms. Lewinsky testified that no
one promised her a job for silence; of course, crimes ordinarily do
not take place with such explicit discussion. But Federal courts
instruct juries that circumstantial evidence is just as probative
as direct evidence. And the circumstantial evidence here is strong.
At a bare minimum, the evidence suggests that the President's job
assistance efforts stemmed from his desire to placate Ms. Lewinsky
so that she would not be tempted _ under the burden of an oath _ to
tell the truth about the relationship. Monica Lewinsky herself
recognized that at the time, saying to a friend, ``Somebody could
construe or say, `Well, they gave her a job to shut her up. They
made her happy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And given that the President's plan to testify falsely could
succeed only if Ms. Lewinky went along, the President naturally had
to be concerned that Ms. Lewinsky at any time might turn around and
decide to tell the truth. Indeed, some wanted her to tell the
truth. For example, one friend talked to Ms. Lewinsky about the
Dec. 28 meeting with the President. The friend stated that she was
concerned because she didn't want to see ``[Monica) being like
Susan McDougal'' and did not want Monica ``to lie to protect the
President.'' Needless to say, any sudden decision by Ms. Lewinsky
to tell the truth, whether out of anger at the President or simple
desire to be law-abiding, would have been very harmful to the
President. That helps to explain his motive in providing job
assistance. . . .
</P>
<P>
   After the public disclosure of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky and the ongoing criminal investigation, the President
faced a decision. Would he admit the relationship publicly, correct
his testimony in Ms. Jones' case and ask for the indulgence of the
American people? Or would he continue to deny the truth? For this
question, the President consulted others. According to Dick Morris,
the President and he talked on Jan. 21. Mr. Morris suggested that
the President publicly confess. The President replied ``But what
about the legal thing? You know, the legal thing? You know. Starr
and perjury and all.'' Mr. Morris suggested they take a poll. The
President agreed. Mr. Morris called with the results. He stated
that the American people were willing to forgive adultery but not
perjury or obstruction of justice. The President replied, ``Well,
we just have to win, then.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several months, it became apparent that the
strategy to win had many prongs. First, the President denied the
truth publicly and emphatically. Second, he publicly promised to
cooperate with the investigation. Third, the President deflected
and diverted the investigation by telling aides false stories that
were then relayed to the grand jury. Fourth, he refused invitations
to testify to the grand jury for over six months. Fifth, his
Administration delayed the investigation through multiple privilege
claims, each of which has been rejected by the Federal courts.
Sixth, surrogates of the President attacked the credibility and
legitimacy of the grand jury investigation. Seventh, surrogates of
the President attempted to convince the Congress and the American
people that the matter was unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   The first step was for the President to deny the truth publicly.
For this, political polling led to Hollywood staging. The
President's California friend and producer Harry Thomason flew to
Washington and advised that the President needed to be very
forceful in denying the relationship. On Monday, Jan. 26, in the
Roosevelt Room, before members of Congress and other citizens, the
President provided a clear and emphatic public statement denying
the relationship.

TUCSON OPEN ADDS SPONSOR AND $500,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Tucson Open, dumped to satellite status for 1999
while searching frantically for a title sponsor, got some good news
Wednesday on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest was a two-year commitment from Touchstone
Energy, an alliance of electric cooperatives in 36 states.
Touchstone Energy, which comes to the fore after Chrysler pulled
out after last year's tournament, is the fifth title sponsor for
the event in the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Touchstone Energy Tucson Open also received a $500,000
contribution from the PGA Tour, which basically relegated the
tournament to secondary status by scheduling it Feb. 22-28 against
the World Golf Championship Match Play in Carlsbad, Calif. _ the
first of three world tour events slated for next season. The
$500,000 will allow the sponsoring Tucson Conquistadores to boost
the '99 purse to $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were prepared to stage a profitable tournament without a
title sponsor, but the development of our relationship with
Touchstone Energy assures us of the opportunity to further serve
the interests of (area charities),'' said Dan Rorbach, tournament
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The additional purse money (from the tour) also will certainly
help us attract the best golfers available.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the top 64 players in the world will be playing in
the WGC Match Play, including Tucson's defending champion, David
Duval, Rorbach pointed out that numerous big names still will be
eligible. Among those who would fall into that category are Nick
Faldo, John Daly, Tom Kite, Corey Pavin, Fuzzy Zoeller and Craig
Stadler.
</P>
<P>
   The Conquistadores also announced a television deal that will
put the tournament on the Golf Channel on Thursday and Friday, and
on CNBC on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, country-western singer Vince Gill has agreed to
serve as host for the Vince Gill Celebrity Pro-Am on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Touchstone Energy Tucson Open is the 13th name change for
the tournament since it was founded in 1945. The event has an
estimated economic impact of $12.2 million on southern Arizona. &QL;

 WASHINGTON: the relationship.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The President also made false statements to his Cabinet and
aides. They then spoke publicly and professed their belief in the
President.
</P>
<P>
   The second step was to promise cooperation. The President told
the American people on several television and radio shows on Jan.
21 and 22 that ``I'm going to do my best to cooperate with the
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The third step was the President's refusal to provide testimony
to the grand jury despite six invitations to do so and despite his
public promise to cooperate. Refusing invitations to provide
information to a grand jury in a Federal criminal investigation
authorized by the Attorney General of the United States _ and one
in which there is a high national interest in prompt completion _
was inconsistent with the President's initial January promise to
cooperate and with the general statutory duty of all Government
officials to cooperate with Federal criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   As a fourth step, the President not only refused to testify
himself, but he authorized the use of various Governmental
privileges to delay the testimony of many of his taxpayer-paid
assistants. The extensive use of Governmental privileges against
grand jury and criminal investigations has, of course, been a
pattern throughout the Administration. Most notably, the White
House cited privilege in 1993 to prevent Justice Department and
Park Police officials from reviewing documents in Vincent Foster's
office in the days after his death.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lewinsky investigation, the President asserted two
privileges, executive privilege and a government attorney-client
privilege. A subordinate Administration official, without objection
from the President, claimed a previously unheard-of privilege that
was called the protective function privilege. The privileges were
asserted to prevent the full testimony of several White House aides
and the full testimony of the sworn law-enforcement officers of the
Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   In asserting executive privilege, the President was plowing
headlong into the Supreme Court's unanimous decision 24 years ago
in United States v. Nixon. There, the Supreme Court ruled that
executive privilege was overcome by the need for relevant evidence
in criminal proceedings. And thus, it came as no surprise that
Chief Judge Norma Holloway Johnson rejected President Clinton's
effort to use executive privilege to prevent disclosure of relevant
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In asserting protective function and government attorney-client
privileges, the Administration was asking the Federal courts to
make up one new privilege out of whole cloth and to apply another
privilege in a context in which no Federal court had ever applied
it before. And thus it again came as little surprise that the
Federal courts rejected the Administration's claims. Indeed, as to
the government attorney-client claim, the D.C. Circuit and the
District Court, like the Eighth Circuit a year ago, stated that the
President's position not only was wrong but would authorize a
``gross misuse of public assets.'' The Supreme Court refused to
grant review of the cases notwithstanding the Administration's two
strongly worded petitions.
</P>
<P>
   This point bears emphasis: The Administration justified its many
privilege claims by claiming an interest in protecting the
Presidency, not the President personally. But that justification is
dubious for two reasons. First, Presidents Carter and Reagan waived
all Government privileges at the outset of criminal investigations
in which they were involved. The examples set by those two
Presidents demonstrate that such privilege claims in criminal
investigations are manifestly unnecessary to protect the
Presidency. Second, these novel privilege claims were quite weak as
a matter of law. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The fifth tactic was diversion and deflection. The President
made false statements to his aides and associates about the nature
of the relationship _ with knowledge that they could testify to
that effect to the grand jury sitting here in Washington. The
President did not simply say to his associates that the allegations
were false or that the issue was a private matter that he did not
want to discuss. Instead, the President concocted alternative
scenarios that were then repeated to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The final two tactics were related: (I) to attack the grand jury
investigation, including the Justice Department prosecutors in my
office _ to declare war, in the words of one Presidential ally _
and (II) to shape public opinion about the proper resolution of the
entire matter. It is best that I leave it to someone outside our
office to elaborate on the war against our office. But no one
really disputes that those tactics were employed _ and continue to
be employed to this day.

EDITORIAL: DELAYS IN PARADE PERMITS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 19: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People who hold views unpopular with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and
his administration routinely have to go to court to win the right
to hold marches in New York City. This week a U.S. District Court
judge struck down the city's parade permit law as unconstitutional.
Judge Leonard Sand found that the law violated First Amendment
rights because it sets no time limits on when the Police Department
must act on a permit request.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing more than 20 parade requests, the court found that
some groups got a quick response. But others were made to wait for
weeks or months before getting an answer. In the case before the
court, the Million Marijuana March Organization sought a parade
permit last January and was finally denied the request in April.
The court was particularly disturbed by the delayed treatment of
two requests to march against police brutality. The lack of a time
frame creates the danger that delay could be used to censor speech.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third time in four months that federal judges have
ruled against Giuliani for suppressing constitutionally protected
protests. The mayor's impulse so far has been to lambaste the
federal judges making the rulings. Now that the ordinance has been
invalidated, he had better turn his energies toward creating a
process that safeguards the free-speech rights of his critics.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 19: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When one of the Supreme Court's most conservative members,
Justice Antonin Scalia, writes a decision strengthening civil
rights enforcement, it is worth taking note. It happened this week
in a closely watched discrimination case from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The decision concerned a collective bargaining agreement between
the International Longshoremen's Association and the Port of
Charleston. Like most labor agreements these days, it contained a
clause requiring workplace disputes to be submitted to arbitration.
A federal appellate court interpreted the clause as stripping a
longshoreman, Caesar Wright, of his right to sue under the
Americans With Disabilities Act. Wright could not go to court with
his claim of discrimination, the court said, because his union had
effectively waived that right when it negotiated the arbitration
clause.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a unanimous Supreme Court has now rejected this
watering down of federal protection. Vaguely worded arbitration
clauses in labor contracts, the justices held, cannot bar access to
federal court by employees seeking to vindicate their rights under
federal civil rights laws. ``The right to a federal judicial forum
is of sufficient importance to be protected against
less-than-explicit union waiver'' of the right to go to court, said
Scalia, writing for the court.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointingly, the court stopped short of finding that even an
explicit waiver would be unenforceable. But that may not matter for
most employees. Few labor agreements currently contain explicit
waivers of federal civil rights claims.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 19: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first appearance of the new House Republican leaders
Wednesday suggested that the party has incorporated all the easy
parts of the message the public sent in the Nov. 3 elections.
``Teamwork'' and ``unity'' were the words of the day. There was no
mention of the social issues so dear to the hearts of the party's
right wing, and many nods to the importance of Social Security and
health care. Rep. Robert Livingston, who will be the new speaker,
announced that he regarded the party not as a ``big tent'' but a
``big ship'' that keeps moving steadily on course even when, on its
decks, the crew is going in all different directions.
</P>
<P>
   We can be pretty sure the incoming speaker has not been wasting
his time at the movies. In the year of ``Titanic,'' not a lot of
new leaders describe themselves as captains of really big ships
that keep forging ahead in one direction. Actually, Livingston
extended the metaphor to point to a specific type of ship, the
aircraft carrier, as an example of teamwork under the guidance of
the Constitution. In that context it is a heartening sign that he
is ready to take charge in a chaotic situation that calls for
strong leadership in the House.
</P>
<P>
   That institution has certainly appeared rudderless lately, and
this is precisely the moment when, among all branches of
government, it has to provide direction. As the House Judiciary
Committee struggles with the nation's most pressing political
crisis, Chairman Henry Hyde has been floundering desperately,
lurching first one way and then the other, without any apparent
plan. The House has the constitutional burden of judging President
Clinton and finding a punishment that fits the evidence, and as
Livingston has to see that the judiciary committee does not run
into the icebergs that Hyde seems not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republicans' leadership election, all the new officers
vowed to get behind the GOP ``agenda,'' but the makeup of the team
suggests that the Republicans have not figured out which way they
want to go. Dick Armey, a symbol of the surly approach that
Livingston wants to leave behind, survived a serious challenge to
keep his job as House majority leader. Another tough guy, Tom
DeLay, who was unchallenged in re-election as whip, was the point
man for former Speaker Newt Gingrich's assault on party reformers
on the campaign finance issue.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news came when J.C. Watts of Oklahoma became the
first black Republican elected to a leadership role. Watts' strong
ties to the social conservatives and his personal popularity helped
win him the fourth spot, party conference chairman. But if the
Republicans were also sending a message of inclusion, it was a
commendable impulse both in terms of policy and politics. Watts is
the only black Republican in the House, and overwhelming black
support for Democratic candidates was a main reason for key
Republican losses in the election. Given the choice between writing
the black vote off or trying to win it, the party made the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Watts' new job involves communicating the party's message, and
his well-known talents as a public speaker should serve the party
well. But first, somebody is going to have to give him a message to
deliver.

IRAQI DISSIDENTS MAY BE A SHAKY BRIDGE TO SADDAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Changes throughout.)  
(htv) 
 By James Risen and Barbara Crossette   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, committed to renewed
support for Iraqi dissidents, is finding the opposition groups so
weak and divided and penetrated by Iraqi agents that it is
uncertain how to form a united front capable of toppling Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton caught the dissident groups and even some U.S.
officials off guard last weekend when he said the best way to avoid
another crisis with Iraq was a change in Baghdad's government.
After aborting a planned air strike, he said the administration
would do more to support ``forces of change in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also embraced a new law that many in the Pentagon and
his administration had criticized as a waste of money. It calls for
Washington to provide $97 million worth of military equipment and
other resources to the dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged that the president's
address suddenly revived a policy that many critics believe had
been on the back burner. Indeed, the president's announcement came
weeks after the top U.S. commander in the gulf, Gen. Anthony C.
Zinni, dismissed the new law, saying ``I don't think these things
have been thought out.'' Now, the White House and State Department
are moving quickly to try to fill in the blanks.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the Iraqi groups themselves have misgivings about
new U.S. backing. Leaders of some of the smaller groups say the
United States may do little but revive discredited projects that
lack popular support inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the president's address, Martin Indyk, an assistant
secretary of state, met with Ahmed Chalabi, the leader of the Iraqi
National Congress, a dissident group that has been out of favor
with the administration since its operations in northern Iraq were
decimated by the Iraqi army two years ago. Chalabi lobbied Congress
to pass the $97 million funding plan, and now hopes to push the
administration to designate his group as a prime beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's support ``represents a policy reversal,''
Chalabi said. ``They have opened their arms.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration also is accelerating efforts to help unite
feuding Kurdish and other groups into a cohesive opposition. These
include an influential Iranian-backed Islamic Shiite group. That
group, the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic Revolution of Iraq, met
privately with Clinton administration officials in Washington three
months ago, according to other dissident leaders. It is the largest
group among Shiites in southern Iraq and may now be willing to take
part in a U.S.-sponsored military action against Saddam, if Tehran
approves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, more than a dozen opposition groups in London were
asked to meet with a British government official the day after
Prime Minister Tony Blair said Britain supported the efforts to
undermine Saddam's regime.
</P>
<P>
   But all together, the number of dissident groups and their
competing interests have hampered Washington and London in their
search for a way to topple Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials acknowledged Wednesday that
they are not yet ready to decide which groups would receive U.S.
support, and whether any would receive arms. Under the terms of the
law, called the Iraq Liberation Act, the president has until the
end of January to announce which groups will receive U.S. support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are intensifying our engagement with the opposition groups
by strengthening our economic and political support for them,''
said the State Department spokesman, James Rubin. ``With respect to
arming them, we haven't ruled that out, but we think it is
premature to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Another senior State Department official was equally cautious.
``We have to be realistic about how we go forward,'' he said.
``Working with the opposition to help them unify to create an
alternative is a critical first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress say they are not convinced that the
White House is serious. ``They have taken a step towards support
for the Iraq Liberation Act, but I don't see that they have really
made a commitment to overthrow Saddam,'' said a senior Republican
Senate aide. ``And that's the purpose of the act.''

<P>
   Some Iraqi dissident groups, which are divided across ethnic and
sectarian lines, worry about U.S. and British intentions, saying
that any plan that provides support for the Iraqi National Congress
will have little support inside the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning, I realized that this is not for changing
the regime in Iraq,'' said Sami Faraq, who writes a weekly column
for a London-based weekly newspaper, Free Iraq. ``This just to give
cover to other activities, like influencing the situation in the
north of Iraq, to make the Kurdish movement look like part of the
opposition to Saddam Hussein, when in reality they are completely
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   Saad Jabr, the publisher of Free Iraq and the son of a former
prime minister of Iraq in its days of a British-installed monarchy,
recommended an indictment of Saddam for crimes against humanity and
total diplomatic isolation for his regime, among other measures.
</P>
<P>
   He also recommended spending ``big money'' on an effective
satellite system for broadcasting to Iraq. A number of exiles
mentioned that the Radio Free Iraq broadcasts that the United
States has now begun are too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think America is serious, unfortunately, about
removing Saddam Hussein,'' Jabr said in an interview. And if the
Clinton administration wants to count on any serious support within
the country, the Iraqi middle class living mostly in Baghdad or
other towns in the country's Arabic, Sunni Muslim heartland, needs
a psychological boost, Iraqi dissidents said.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Abbas Mehdi, a university professor who is
chairman of the Union of Independent Iraqis, a group linking about
30 small groups, said the United States has embraced sanctions that
cut into the living standards of the Iraqi middle class whose
support it would need if Washington were to open up Iraqi politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanctions are destroying the people and the country,'' he
said. ``They have weakened the people who now have to depend on
Saddam Hussein more than ever. It pains me to see how people talk
about the U.S. in the Middle East, not only in Iraq. People are
angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new U.S. interest, many U.S. officials have grown
wary of investing too much time or resources into groups that often
seem more intent on fighting each other than toppling Saddam. Since
the end of the Persian Gulf War, Saddam has exploited their
differences and managed to subvert them, rather than the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. options have been so limited that the Central Intelligence
Agency has been secretly funding one group that agency officials
know has been betrayed by Iraqi agents, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi National Accord, a group made up of former military
officers and other defectors from the Baghdad regime, is still
receiving CIA backing more than two years after Iraq revealed that
it knew all about the dissident group's covert efforts to subvert
Saddam's rule. In June 1996, Iraq rounded up and executed about 100
army officers and others suspected of involvement with the group,
making it clear that he had agents inside the group.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they strongly suspect that the INA, with
offices in Amman, Jordan and London, is still riddled with double
agents.

 &HT;    SEC officials drop ball again
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Bobby Gaston had his way, people would never notice
the men who officiate football games for the SEC. No such luck this
week.
</P>
<P>
   SEC football officials are making news for a game that already
has been played _ Arkansas-Tennessee _ and a game that is about to
be played _ Florida-Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the SEC officiating crew made an incorrect ruling
in last week's Arkansas-Tennessee game when Arkansas punter Chris
Akins kicked the ball out of the back of the end zone after a snap
had gone over this head. Officials on the play awarded Tennessee a
safety, which cut the Arkansas lead to 24-22 with 2:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston said Wednesday that officials actually should have given
Tennessee the option of taking the ball where it was kicked plus a
half-the-distance penalty. That would have given Tennessee the ball
on the 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were entitled to an an option they didn't get,'' said
Gaston, who was in his car listening to the game on the radio when
he heard what happened. ``When I called both coaches on Monday,
neither was aware of the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Vols not come back and won 28-24, it would have been a
disastrous mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any excuses, but in the heat of the moment I
might have missed the call, too,'' Gaston said. ``It was the first
time I had seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials will be under scrutiny again Saturday when they
travel to Tallahassee to work the Florida-Florida State game. Two
years ago, Florida coach Steve Spurrier blistered the SEC crew,
which he claimed let Florida State beat up quarterback Danny
Wuerffel in a 24-21 loss.
</P>
<P>
   He carried his crusade against late hits all the way to the
Sugar Bowl, even making a video tape for the media. With a Big 12
crew working the game, Florida beat Florida State in a rematch
52-20.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's biggest advantage in Saturday's game is that the
Gators have a healthy quarterback in Doug Johnson. FSU will be
playing with backup Marcus Outzen. Spurrier has been low-key on the
topic this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all I need to say on the subject,'' Spurrier said.
``People know how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaston said he had discussed the topic this week with Florida
assistant Lawson Holland and that his officials will call the game
consistent with the rules. There will be an SEC technical advisor
at the game to talk to the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll bring it up before the game,'' said Gaston.
``Steve knows we will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   COACHING BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Auburn continues search for a coach
</P>
<P>
   _ The coaching grapevine tells us Auburn's coaching search will
continue into next week and the school hopes to make a decision
either just before or just after the SEC Championship game Dec. 5.
Athletics director David Housel is mum on the interview process,
but it is known he talked with Temple coach Bobby Wallace on
Monday. We also believe that, despite his suggestions to the
contrary, Ole Miss coach Tommy Tuberville is still a very viable
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Auburn interim coach Bill Oliver will not return to the school
if he is not named head coach. That much we know. What we don't
know is where Oliver will land. He says he'll probably go fishing
and introduce himself to his wife. We think Florida coach Steve
Spurrier, a long-time admirer, will give Oliver a strong look if
his defensive coordinator, Bobby Stoops, gets a head-coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ole Miss officials are getting a little weary of Tuberville
getting involved in the coaching derby again this season. They gave
Tuberville's assistants healthy raises last year after he came
close to going to Arkansas. They also have drawn up some plans for
new facilities for the football program. Tuberville's name has been
linked with Auburn, South Carolina and even Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   _ After catching heat from the family of quarterback Michael
Bishop, Kansas State coach Bill Snyder finally let Bishop talk to
the media this week. He refused media access for most of the season
after Bishop made some ill-advised comments, but the family thought
it was hurting Bishop's chances at the Heisman Trophy. They were
right. Now it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   BOWL BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of bowl situation
</P>
<P>
   _ If Miami wins the Big East championship, Florida might go to
the Orange Bowl, even if it doesn't beat Florida State. The Orange
Bowl wants the Gators because they have not been to the bowl since
Jan. 1, 1967, which was the last game as a college player for coach
Steve Spurrier. It was, coincidently, Bobby Dodd's last game as
Georgia Tech coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Tennessee wins the SEC championship and plays in the Fiesta
Bowl, the Sugar Bowl will get the first pick after the
national-title game is set. The Sugar Bowl's top game? Florida
State vs. 10-1 Notre Dame. That only happens if Kansas State is in
the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ That Florida appears headed to the Bowl Championship Series
improves the chances of Georgia getting into the Citrus Bowl
against Wisconsin, Ohio State or Michigan. The Bulldogs can
strengthen that position by beating both Ole Miss and Georgia Tech.
If Georgia loses one or both, the Citrus might be tempted to take
Kentucky and Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Arkansas (8-1) beats Mississippi State on Saturday, it will
do no worse than the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1. Folks in Dallas would
love to match the Razorbacks with Texas (7-3), particularly if the
Longhorns can upset No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M next week.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Gator Bowl's No. 1 game? Georgia Tech vs. Notre Dame. If
Notre Dame doesn't make it into the Bowl Championship Series, it in
effect becomes a Big East team and gets that slot.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   2012: The year Kansas State would reach the .500 mark in
all-time victories if it won every game between now and then.
</P>
<P>
   7.7: Millions of dollars in profit earned by Big Ten athletic
departments last season. The conference generated $403.2 million in
revenues and had $395.5 million in expenses.
</P>
<P>
   1982: The last year that Auburn and Alabama played and neither
team was ranked. It has happened only five times in the previous 61
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   .713: The NCAA record for pass completion percentage for a
single season. It was set in 1983 by Steve Young of BYU. Going into
Saturday's final regular-season game with New Mexico, Central
Florida's Daunte Culpepper has completed .738 of his passes.

 &HT;    Nostalgia the theme in Tenn. St. season finale
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A grand ol' time is expected in Nashville on Saturday
when Tennessee State plays its last regular-season game at historic
Hale Stadium, better known as ``The Hole.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (8-2), hosting Texas Southern, won their first Ohio
Valley Conference title and clinched a berth in the Division I-AA
playoffs last week with a 46-44 victory over Murray State. The game
will be a homecoming of sorts for Texas Southern coach Bill Thomas,
a former player and coach at Tennessee State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be bringing back those guys who played in the
Hole, band members who performed there, Tiger Belles who ran track
there and even ushers who guided people to their seats,'' Tennessee
State third-year coach L.C. Cole said. ``It should be a memorable
day for everybody, including this football team. I didn't think
this kind of success would come so soon, but we came here with a
plan and everybody bought into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly quarterback Leon Murray, a 6-3, 205-pound junior
from Shreveport, and senior receiver Tyrone Butterfield, who
surpassed the 1,000-yard mark in receiving twice since transferring
from Michigan a couple of years ago. Against Murray State, Murray
completed 28 of 54 attempts for an OVC-record 491 yards and four
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine showdown
</P>
<P>
   As many as 70,000 people could be in Orlando this weekend as
Florida A&AMP;M (9-1) meets surprising Bethune-Cookman (8-1) in the
Citrus Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   After beating South Carolina State, North Carolina A&AMP;T and
Hampton on the road, Bethune has put itself in position to win the
MEAC title outright.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the Wildcats' five-game victory streak should end,
they are assured a spot somewhere in postseason play _ in either
the I-AA playoffs or the McDonald's Heritage Bowl in Atlanta on
Dec. 26.
</P>
<P>
   For FAMU, tied with Bethune and Hampton in the MEAC, a victory
would almost assure one of the eight host spots in next week's
first round of I-AA playoffs, along with a share of the conference
title.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer Bowl set
</P>
<P>
   Livingstone College, which won the Central Intercollegiate
Athletic Association (CIAA) championship for the second year in a
row, will play in the Atlanta-based Pioneer Bowl again. The Blue
Bears (7-3) from Salisbury, N.C., will face SIAC champion Tuskegee
(9-1) Dec. 19 at Morris Brown's Herndon Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Tuskegee won't end its regular season until Thanksgiving Day,
when it takes on Alabama State at the Cramton Bowl in the annual
Turkey Day Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk State coach Darnell Moore has become one of the first
casualities of the postseason. After compiling a five-year record
of 26-27, including a 2-9 mark in the team's first year as a member
of the MEAC, Moore's contract was not renewed. ... Jackson State,
which has led I-AA in attendance all but one year during the past
decade, is expected to draw a crowd of 55,000 Saturday when it
faces SWAC-rival Alcorn State in the annual Capital City Classic in
Memorial Stadium in Jackson, Miss.

 &HT;    Clemson fires West in 2-8 season
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With Clemson one defeat away from its worst season in
nearly a quarter-century, head coach Tommy West was abruptly fired
Wednesday amid speculation that his successor might be his one-time
boss: Danny Ford.
</P>
<P>
   West, in his fourth year as head coach, has three years left on
his contract and one game left to coach at Clemson: Saturday
night's season finale against arch-rival South Carolina. With
Clemson 2-8 overall _ and, at 1-7 in the ACC basement, already
assured of its worst finish in the conference _ a loss to the 1-9
Gamecocks would match the Tigers' worst record since going 2-9 in
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised,'' said West, who was informed of his
firing Wednesday by Clemson athletics director Bobby Robinson, the
man who hired West in November, 1993. ``It really kind of caught me
off guard. I said if a decision's been made, I'd like to know. So I
was really caught off guard.'' Robinson told West that he was fired
but could coach Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years at Clemson, I never enjoyed working with
anyone more,'' said Robinson who praised West's ``class, dignity
and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't meet our expectations as far as the won-loss
record,'' said Robinson. ``That's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   West is 30-28 at Clemson. After a 5-6 debut, his next three
teams went to bowl games. But this year's Tigers, with a young,
inexperienced offensive line, have lost seven of their last eight
games, including the last four. Five of those losses were by seven
points or less. West informed his team at a meeting before
Wednesday's practice. ``Our players were in shock,'' he said. ``I
wanted them to hear it before anyone else told them. What effect
it's going to have on them (Saturday), I don't know.'' As for
West's successor, Robinson said, ``You'd like to get someone in as
fast as possible. But time is not as important as making sure we
get the best coach in America for Clemson football.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates include Tommy Bowden, whose Tulane team is 9-0
and who's become the hottest coaching commodity in the land. While
Tommy Tuberville of Ole Miss has also been mentioned, there is
growing support among older Clemson alumni and IPTAY boosters for
Ford, who took Clemson to the 1981 national championship.
</P>
<P>
   And what would West advise his successor? ``Don't have a losing
season.''

 &HT;    Anderson rests ankle but says, `I'm fine'
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons running back Jamal Anderson, who is third in
the NFL with 1,066 rushing yards, did not practice Wednesday
because coach Dan Reeves decided it would be best if Anderson
rested his sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson suffered the injury in the first quarter of Sunday's
31-19 win over San Francisco, but finished the game with 31 rushes
for 100 yards and two TDs.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, he wore a removable cast on his lower
left leg, but Wednesday he was in athletic shoes on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's listed as questionable on the injury report,
Anderson insists he'll play Sunday when Atlanta (8-2) meets the
Bears (3-7).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine, I'm fine,'' is all he said as he jogged off the
field Wednesday, with no apparent limp.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson spent nearly an hour in the training room Wednesday
morning wearing a boot that sends a mild electrical current into
the body to stimulate blood flow and expedite healing.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is second in the NFL with 11 touchdowns (Terrell Davis
has 17), tied with Barry Sanders for second-most 100-yard games
(Davis has eight), leads the NFL in third-and-1 rushes, converting
all seven of his tries to first downs, and is second in the NFC
behind Emmitt Smith (70) with 63 first downs.
</P>
<P>
   In his absence, rookie Ken Oxendine (12 carries, 19 yards) and
9-year veteran Harold Green (14 carries, 31 yards) worked with the
first-team offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game plan wouldn't change (if Anderson didn't play),''
Reeves said. ``I think Ken gives us a chance with his running
instincts to get the job done, but I would rely too on Harold
because of his experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Other injury news
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver and kick returner Tim Dwight practiced Wednesday
for the first time since he strained a medial collateral knee
ligament Oct. 25 against the Jets, but he's still listed as
doubtful for Sunday's game. Reeves said Dwight was a little stiff.
... Cornerback Ronnie Bradford, who played a few snaps on punts
Sunday in his first action since straining an MCL Oct. 25, worked
part-time with the No. 1 defense Wednesday. There is a chance he
could replace Michael Booker, who has played well in three starts,
in the starting lineup against the Bears.
</P>
<P>
   No sellout likely
</P>
<P>
   Falcons president Taylor Smith talked with NFL officials
Wednesday about getting extra time to sell out Sunday's home game
against the Bears so that a local TV blackout could be lifted.
Also, general manager Harold Richardson and director of
marketing/sales Rob Jackson talked with Atlanta-area corporate
sponsors about guaranteeing to purchase the remaining tickets to
aid the process. League rules stipulate that home games must be
sold out by 1 p.m. the prior Thursday in order to be televised in
the local market. But with about 19,000 tickets still left for the
game, at an average price of $30 apiece, neither local corporations
or WAGA, Channel 5, the local Fox affiliate that would televise the
game, was willing to put up nearly $570,000 in order to guarantee
the sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Bad News Bears
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's practice was bizarre Wednesday as No. 3 quarterback
Moses Moreno, a rookie, took all the snaps with the No. 1 offense,
and the No. 1 tailback was James Allen, who began the season on the
practice squad. To top it off, offensive coordinator Matt
Cavanaugh, a 14-year backup quarterback in the NFL, ran the scout
team offense. Chicago quarterback Erik Kramer, who has missed the
last two games with shoulder tendinitis and a possible tear of the
rotator cuff, threw before practice but did not participate. Exams
have not revealed a tear, but Kramer, who Reeves and the Falcons
tried to sign as a free agent last year, keeps describing symptoms
matching a tear.
</P>
<P>
   Also, quarterback Steve Stenstrom did not practice because of a
strained non-throwing shoulder but said he'll be 100 percent by
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That left Moreno, a seventh-round draft choice out of Colorado
who has completed 1-of-2 passes for 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with first-round draft choice Curtis Enis, a running
back, out for the season with a torn ACL, Edgar Bennett has become
the starting tailback but missed Wednesday's practice with back
spasms. That left former Oklahoma star Allen, who has no carries as
a pro, working with Glyn Milburn at running back.
</P>
<P>
   Still a Falcon
</P>
<P>
   Running back Byron Hanspard, who tore the anterior cruciate
ligament and patella tendon in his knee in the final preseason
game, misses playing. But he said he's not suffering extra just
because his teammates are having so much fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a lot of my playing through Jamal,'' Hanspard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, at the beginning, everybody was trying to get used
to each other and feel things out. This year, we know each other,
we're happy with each other, we love each other. There's no, `I'm
the man,' or, `He's the man.' I don't see any cockiness in the
locker room. It's all `we' and no ``me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling, playing better
</P>
<P>
   Left tackle Bob Whitfield is playing very well lately, and he
said it's reasonable to assume that when things are going so well
for the team, players pick up their individual games. Whitfield has
a reputation for being inconsistent, but lately he's been very
solid.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start winning, it changes your mentality and how you
look at the game, how you are at home, how you talk to your kids,''
he said. ``You start feeling like you're playing better. You want
to keep that roll, and you have that confidence that you're going
to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's mother, Eartha, is feeling good, too. She cooks a
meal for the team at the beginning of every season. Friday, she's
doing it a second time, as the team has been invited over to
``Mama'' Whitfield's, about five minutes from team headquarters in
Suwanee.
</P>
<P>
   Extra points
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Chris Chandler leads the NFL with a 118.5 passer
rating in the fourth quarter, completing 22-of-31 passes (71
percent) for 386 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. ...
The Falcons worked out offensive linemen Steve Zahursky (6-foot-6,
310 pounds), who has been with the Jaguars, Steve Scifres (6-4,
300), who has been with the Cowboys and Panthers, and tight end Bob
Rosenthal (6-3, 240), who has been with the Raiders. ... Kicker
Morten Andersen, who scored seven points against the 49ers, has 401
points as a Falcon, passing kicker Norm Johnson (395) to move into
second place in franchise history. Kicker Mick Luckhurst leads with
558.
</P>
<P>
   Bears boys
</P>
<P>
   First-year defensive tackle Shawn Swayda, who was active in last
Sunday's game against the 49ers, was cut last year as a defensive
end by the Bears, who drafted him in the sixth round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no resentment,'' he said. ``I'm sure they don't think
much of me. I didn't play well when I was there. I couldn't have
made any team last year. I wasn't ready to play. This year, I was
ready to play, and I don't think there's too many teams I wouldn't
have made. That's the way I look at it.

 &HT;    Hurdles all but cleared for Holyfield vs. Lewis
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After eight weeks of conference calls and facing a
possible repeat of last year's nightmarish fizzled negotiations,
officials representing Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis finally
have reached an agreement in principle for a heavyweight title
unification March 13 at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a deal,'' said Milt Chwasky, an attorney representing
Lewis, whose camp resolved some final issues with promoter Don King
and pay-per-view distributor Time Warner late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner executive Lou DiBella said, ``Other than some
signatures, there's nothing really stopping this now.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight, which officially will be announced Nov. 30 at a
Garden news conference, will unify Holyfield's WBA and IBF belts
and Lewis' WBC title. Holyfield will earn at least $20 million.
Lewis and his promoters will take in a total of $9.5 million,
although the boxer will end up with closer to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lone potential deal-breaker was a dispute over the payment
schedule of the $9.5 million. Dino Duva, one of Lewis' promoters,
even sent out a press release earlier in the week, charging King
with ``trickerations'' by and that he was changing the terms of a
deal. that had been verbally agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   Duva's move even upset Chwasky, who expressed surprise told a
reporter, ``Oh, (bleep),''when learning of the release from a
reporter. Holyfield's attorney, Jim Thomas, expressed relief that
felt relieved matters have been settled, but Thomas said of Duva,
``I get the feeling someone on Lennox's side doesn't want this
fight to happen. What good is going to come out of calling names?
We're trying to make a deal happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Training Tyson
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Brooks, Holyfield's assistant trainer, is close to
accepting a deal to become Mike Tyson's next trainer. It's But it's
not clear whether Brooks would leave Holyfield's camp immediately.
Technically, Brooks could train Tyson for his Jan. 16 comeback
against Francois Botha and then help trainer Don Turner prepare
Holyfield for the Lewis bout. Thomas said he hadn't discussed the
matter with Holyfield yet.
</P>
<P>
   King's return
</P>
<P>
   Don King will promote his first card in Atlanta since the
Holyfield-Vaughn Bean title fight with a program card Friday night
at the Atrium in Stone Mountain. Tickets, at $35 and $15, are
available are on sale at the Atrium box office or by calling
404-298-6546.
</P>
<P>
   The main event will pit Atlanta female boxer Isra Girgrah
against Angela Buchanan, who was knocked out in the third round by
Girgrah in April. Girgrah has not fought since, in part because of
management entanglements.
</P>
<P>
   But Girgrah's focus these days is primarily on women's champion
Christy Martin. The two fought last year, with Martin winning a
decision, but Girgrah has sought a rematch ever since. There is a
chance the two might may meet on the undercard of Holyfield-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is ever definite until the contract is signed, but
hopefully it will go through,'' Girgrah said. ``I want a rematch
with Christy, or fight somebody high in the rankings.

 &HT;    Clemson going into game with injury, defense concerns
 &HT;    By Norman Arey and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ CLEMSON vs. South Carolina, Saturday, 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers will play their season _ and head coach Tommy West's
_ finale with major injury concerns on defense. Cornerback Antwan
Edwards is still questionable with a pulled hamstring that kept him
out of the Georgia Tech game, and linebacker Chris Jones is on
crutches with a sprained ankle. Linebacker O.J. Childress, who has
played sparingly the last three games with a sprained knee, is
probable, defensive end Terry Bryant is doubtful with a sprained
ankle and defensive end Adrian Dingle is questionable, also with a
sprained knee.... Before his dismissal, West said the program was
better ``in every area'' than the one he inherited from Ken
Hatfield in 1993 _ from on-the-field performance to academic
progress to attendance.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE vs. North Carolina, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   When Duke hosts North Carolina, the Blue Devils will be trying
to snap a seven-game losing streak against the Tar Heels. One
reason UNC has been so dominant is that it has been able to run the
ball against Duke. Carolina has outrushed Duke 236.2 yards to 54.4
yards over the past five games. ``We consider this the biggest
football game of the year,'' said coach Fred Goldsmith, who never
has beaten UNC. . . . Tailback B.J. Hill had 124 yards rushing
against Maryland last week and broke Duke's freshman rushing record
with 701 yards. . . . Scottie Montgomery (58 catches) and Richmond
Flowers (46) rank third and fourth among ACC reception leaders. . .
. Duke ranks in the middle of the conference in total offense and
defense _ fifth in total offense (348 yards per game) and sixth in
total defense (354.2).
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE vs. Florida, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles are trying to prepare quarterback Marcus Outzen
for Florida's pass rush, but coach Bobby Bowden says it has been
difficult. ``We haven't even come close to facing a pass rush like
they've got,'' Bowden said. ``A lot of times you're worried about
assignments, and you think if you can get a body on the right guy,
you can beat him. But against Florida, you can get your body on the
right guy and still get beat.'' Bowden said Florida is FSU's
biggest rival. ``They don't have many players we haven't tried to
recruit and we don't have many that they haven't tried to get.''
Florida State returned to the top of the nation in total defense
this week. The Seminoles had dropped to second before holding Wake
Forest to 179 total yards in last week's 24-7 victory. . . . The
Seminoles lead the ACC with 38 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND vs. N.C. State, Saturday, 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The 42-25 win over Duke last week not only snapped an 11-game
ACC losing streak, but it marked the most points the Terps scored
since a 52-0 win over Wake Forest in 1996.... Maryland picked off
an ACC single game-tying seven passes against Duke, three by
cornerback Cliff Cosby.... Quarterback Randall Jones came off the
bench to have the best game of his career, completing six of 13
passes for a personal-best 98 yards and two touchdowns. He became
the first Maryland quarterback in 20 years to rush for more than
100 yards with 115 yards.... Despite being second in the ACC in
rushing with 164.3 yards a game, the Terps are near the bottom
nationally in most other offensive categories: 97th in points
(18.1); 104th in total yards (278.1) and 106th in passing yards
(113.9).
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA at Duke, Saturday, noon
</P>
<P>
   Coach Carl Torbush says his Tar Heels know that Duke is
dangerous. ``They've lost three games that they could have won,''
Torbush said. ``They're like us in that their record could be
better with a few breaks. This Duke team is the most physical
running football team of any Duke team I can remember. This is a
cross-town rivalry in the truest sense, and I think it'll be a
dogfight.'' . . . Receiver Na Brown is within one reception of the
school record of 155. . . . Junior cornerback Dre Bly is the ACC's
all-time interception leader with 19. . . . Freshman Rufus Brown
leads the Tar Heels with 385 yards rushing, which ranks 10th in the
ACC. . . . Quarterback Ronald Curry leads all ACC freshmen and is
seventh overall in the conference in total offense (139.7 yards per
game).
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE at Maryland, Saturday, 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Torry Holt's record-shattering season might be getting headline
attention, but the 6-3 Wolfpack needs a win Saturday to erase any
doubt about a bowl bid. With a loss they probably have to beat
North Carolina next week just to get any invitation. State has won
just once in its last five road games, and that was a 46-39
thriller at Clemson on Oct. 31.... Holt needs seven more receptions
to own the ACC single-season reception mark of 77; he already has
the single-season yardage record with 1,338. With 3,113 yards, Holt
needs 208 yards over the next two games to become the ACC careere
receiving-yardage leader. ... Tailback Rahshon Spikes, out since
hurting his shoulder in the Georgia Tech game Oct. 10, will play
Saturday. In his place, freshman Ray Robinson has rushed for a
team-high 664 yards.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA at Virginia Tech, Nov. 28
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers have this weekend off before closing out their
season against Virginia Tech. When the Cavs take the field on Nov.
28, coach George Welsh will be coaching his 300th Division I
football game. ``That's a lot of games _ that's my first thought,''
Welsh said. ``I never thought I'd be around this long. But some
guys have 300 wins and, to me, that's even more amazing.'' Welsh is
concerned that Virginia Tech has blocked so many kicks this season.
The Cavs will practice only twice this week before working a normal
week next week. ``I don't want to leave it on the field this week.
This is the 12th week of the season. You have to be very careful.''
. . . Virginia leads the ACC in rushing offense at 227.1 yards per
game, which is 10th nationally. Thomas Jones leads the ACC with
124.8 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST at Georgia Tech, Saturday, 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Demon Deacons coach Jim Caldwell said he thinks Desmond Clark,
the ACC's career receiving leader, will be ready to play Saturday
against Georgia Tech. Clark has missed two games because of a knee
injury. ``Desmond practiced earlier this week and looked good,''
Caldwell said. ``He tried to go last week, but he wasn't ready. But
he's much better this week.'' . . . Caldwell said it's important
for his 3-7 Deacons to finish the season positively. ``Our focus
has been good, even though our season hasn't gone as well as we
would have liked,'' he said. ``It's important for us to end the
season on a good note. We do a lot of recruiting in the Atlanta
area.'' . . . Wake ranks second in the conference in passing
offense (265.7 yards per game) but is next to last in passing
defense.

 &HT;    How to salvage any season
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A victory on college football's ``Rivalry Saturday''
is so big it can turn a good season into a great season. For
struggling teams, it can transform a bad season magically into
something much better.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe one game can make such a difference? Ask Auburn
defensive tackle Charles Dorsey.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been a fun year at Auburn. The Tigers are 3-7. Their
head coach, Terry Bowden, quit at midseason. There is daily
speculation about who the new coach will be. Almost all the
headlines have been negative. But all the heartache Auburn has
endured this season, Dorsey said, will disappear if the Tigers can
find a way to beat archrival Alabama on ESPN Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we beat Alabama, people are going to forget about all the
hurt we've been through,'' Dorsey said. ``That's how big this one
game is.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're a fan, this is the game you have to live with for an
entire year. If your team loses, you have to face the fans of the
other team at work, at church, at the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks here want us to win them all, but if we have to lose
one, they sure don't want it to be against Florida,'' said Florida
State coach Bobby Bowden, whose Seminoles host Florida on Saturday
(3:30 p.m., ABC). ``When you get a rivalry within one state, it
gets pretty intense.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of intense rivalry games will be played Saturday, while
others, such as Arkansas-Mississippi State, have major postseason
implications. Here are 10 of the best and what's at stake:
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 2 Kansas State at No. 19 Missouri: Kansas State clinched a
berth in the Big 12 championship game with a victory over Nebraska,
but it needs a win over Missouri to keep alive any hope of
advancing to the Fiesta Bowl for the national title game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Southern California (7-3) at No. 3 UCLA (9-0): UCLA already
has clinched the Rose Bowl but needs to keep winning to stay in
contention for the Fiesta Bowl and the national championship. USC
has enough athletes to exploit the Bruins' bad defense and would
love to knock them out of the big game.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 4 Florida (9-1) at No. 5 Florida State (10-1): The winner
of this one not only gets bragging rights but also will be on the
doorstep to the Fiesta Bowl if any of the top three stumbles down
the stretch. Florida coach Steve Spurrier is winless in Tallahassee
in four trips.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 11 Michigan (8-2) at No. 7 Ohio State (9-1): Michigan has
won eight in a row since starting the season with two losses. If
they beat the Buckeyes for the ninth time in 11 years, the
Wolverines go back to the Rose Bowl. Ohio State goes to Pasadena if
it wins and if Wisconsin loses to Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Carolina (1-9) at Clemson (2-8): It is the worst
combined record for these two teams going into the game. Clemson's
Tommy West will be coaching his last game after being fired
Wednesday. South Carolina's Brad Scott is also under fire. Both
teams need something to salvage their respective seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ Auburn (3-7) vs. Alabama (6-4): Alabama needs a win to cap off
a good comeback season under second-year coach Mike Dubose. Auburn
is playing for pride.
</P>
<P>
   _ No. 9 Arkansas (8-1) at Mississippi State (6-3): The
Razorbacks can clinch the SEC West with a victory, while the
Bulldogs can pull into a first-place tie with Arkansas with a win.
</P>
<P>
   _ North Carolina (4-5) at Duke (4-6): It's a better rivalry in
basketball, but these two schools, separated by 12 miles, really
don't like each other. A win would keep the Tar Heels alive for a
bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ Indiana (4-6) at Purdue (7-4): The game dates back to 1891,
and since 1925 they have played for the Old Oaken Bucket. The
Boilermakers are going to a bowl for the second year in a row,
thanks to quarterback Drew Brees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yale (5-4) at Harvard (4-5): This rivalry is the third-oldest
in college football, dating back to 1875. Yale can earn a share of
the Ivy League title
</P>
<P>
   with a victory.

 &HT;    SEC officials drop ball again
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If Bobby Gaston had his way, people would never notice
the men who officiate football games for the SEC. No such luck this
week.
</P>
<P>
   SEC football officials are making news for a game that already
has been played _ Arkansas-Tennessee _ and a game that is about to
be played _ Florida-Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the SEC officiating crew made an incorrect ruling
in last week's Arkansas-Tennessee game when Arkansas punter Chris
Akins kicked the ball out of the back of the end zone after a snap
had gone over this head. Officials on the play awarded Tennessee a
safety, which cut the Arkansas lead to 24-22 with 2:56 left.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston said Wednesday that officials actually should have given
Tennessee the option of taking the ball where it was kicked plus a
half-the-distance penalty. That would have given Tennessee the ball
on the 5-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were entitled to an an option they didn't get,'' said
Gaston, who was in his car listening to the game on the radio when
he heard what happened. ``When I called both coaches on Monday,
neither was aware of the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the Vols not come back and won 28-24, it would have been a
disastrous mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making any excuses, but in the heat of the moment I
might have missed the call, too,'' Gaston said. ``It was the first
time I had seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials will be under scrutiny again Saturday when they
travel to Tallahassee to work the Florida-Florida State game. Two
years ago, Florida coach Steve Spurrier blistered the SEC crew,
which he claimed let Florida State beat up quarterback Danny
Wuerffel in a 24-21 loss.
</P>
<P>
   He carried his crusade against late hits all the way to the
Sugar Bowl, even making a video tape for the media. With a Big 12
crew working the game, Florida beat Florida State in a rematch
52-20.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's biggest advantage in Saturday's game is that the
Gators have a healthy quarterback in Doug Johnson. FSU will be
playing with backup Marcus Outzen. Spurrier has been low-key on the
topic this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all I need to say on the subject,'' Spurrier said.
``People know how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaston said he had discussed the topic this week with Florida
assistant Lawson Holland and that his officials will call the game
consistent with the rules. There will be an SEC technical advisor
at the game to talk to the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll bring it up before the game,'' said Gaston.
``Steve knows we will do that.''
</P>
<P>
   COACHING BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Auburn continues search for a coach
</P>
<P>
   _ The coaching grapevine tells us Auburn's coaching search will
continue into next week and the school hopes to make a decision
either just before or just after the SEC Championship game Dec. 5.
Athletics director David Housel is mum on the interview process,
but it is known he talked with Temple coach Bobby Wallace on
Monday. We also believe that, despite his suggestions to the
contrary, Ole Miss coach Tommy Tuberville is still a very viable
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Auburn interim coach Bill Oliver will not return to the school
if he is not named head coach. That much we know. What we don't
know is where Oliver will land. He says he'll probably go fishing
and introduce himself to his wife. We think Florida coach Steve
Spurrier, a long-time admirer, will give Oliver a strong look if
his defensive coordinator, Bobby Stoops, gets a head-coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ole Miss officials are getting a little weary of Tuberville
getting involved in the coaching derby again this season. They gave
Tuberville's assistants healthy raises last year after he came
close to going to Arkansas. They also have drawn up some plans for
new facilities for the football program. Tuberville's name has been
linked with Auburn, South Carolina and even Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   _ After catching heat from the family of quarterback Michael
Bishop, Kansas State coach Bill Snyder finally let Bishop talk to
the media this week. He refused media access for most of the season
after Bishop made some ill-advised comments, but the family thought
it was hurting Bishop's chances at the Heisman Trophy. They were
right. Now it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   BOWL BUZZ
</P>
<P>
   Keeping track of bowl situation
</P>
<P>
   _ If Miami wins the Big East championship, Florida might go to
the Orange Bowl, even if it doesn't beat Florida State. The Orange
Bowl wants the Gators because they have not been to the bowl since
Jan. 1, 1967, which was the last game as a college player for coach
Steve Spurrier. It was, coincidently, Bobby Dodd's last game as
Georgia Tech coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Tennessee wins the SEC championship and plays in the Fiesta
Bowl, the Sugar Bowl will get the first pick after the
national-title game is set. The Sugar Bowl's top game? Florida
State vs. 10-1 Notre Dame. That only happens if Kansas State is in
the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   _ That Florida appears headed to the Bowl Championship Series
improves the chances of Georgia getting into the Citrus Bowl
against Wisconsin, Ohio State or Michigan. The Bulldogs can
strengthen that position by beating both Ole Miss and Georgia Tech.
If Georgia loses one or both, the Citrus might be tempted to take
Kentucky and Tim Couch.
</P>
<P>
   _ If Arkansas (8-1) beats Mississippi State on Saturday, it will
do no worse than the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 1. Folks in Dallas would
love to match the Razorbacks with Texas (7-3), particularly if the
Longhorns can upset No. 6 Texas A&AMP;M next week.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Gator Bowl's No. 1 game? Georgia Tech vs. Notre Dame. If
Notre Dame doesn't make it into the Bowl Championship Series, it in
effect becomes a Big East team and gets that slot.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   2012: The year Kansas State would reach the .500 mark in
all-time victories if it won every game between now and then.
</P>
<P>
   7.7: Millions of dollars in profit earned by Big Ten athletic
departments last season. The conference generated $403.2 million in
revenues and had $395.5 million in expenses.
</P>

 &HT;    Mississippi State LB Carroll cleared to play
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart and Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ALABAMA vs. Auburn, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting out Saturday's Mississippi State game, linebacker
Travis Carroll has been cleared to play. Carroll has been dealing
with a shoulder injury since preseason. ... In four road games this
season, Alabama has been outscored 51-9 in the first half. The
Crimson Tide trailed 17-0 at halftime last week against Mississippi
State. In fact, Alabama did not score a TD in the first half of any
of its road games. ... Alabama has given up just three turnovers in
its last 17 quarters of play. ... QB Andrew Zow needs 222 yards
passing against Auburn to become the fifth player in school history
to throw for more than 2,000 in a season. ... SS Tony Dixon had 14
tackles against Mississippi State, giving him 25 over his last two
games. ... Alabama has a five-game winning streak over Auburn at
Legion Field.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS at Miss. State, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas coaches said they were under the impression that a
player could ``get rid'' of the ball, as punter Chris Akin did
against Tennessee when he kicked the ball out of the end zone, but
that the rules don't specify methods allowed. The league said
Tennessee should have had the option of getting the ball or taking
the safety.... Representatives from the Sugar and Cotton bowls will
be in Starkville on Saturday. Arkansas would earn a berth in the
Sugar Bowl if it reaches the SEC Championship game, or the Cotton
if Mississippi State wins the SEC West. ... The two touchdown
catches by Anthony Lucas against Tennessee set an Arkansas career
mark. Lucas, who now has 17, also established a single-season mark
with nine.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN at Alabama, Saturday, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman quarterback Gabe Gross continues to be bothered by a
shoulder injury suffered last Saturday against Georgia. Gross,
however, is expected to play Saturday. ... Linebacker Tavarreus
Pounds, who also has a shoulder injury, is still uncertain. With
all the problems Auburn had this season, a win over Alabama would
ease a lot of the pain. ``I guarantee, if we win, a lot of people
will forget about our troubles this season,'' defensive tackle
Charles Dorsey said. ... Receiver Karsten Bailey now has 142 career
catches, breaking the school record of 141 held by Terry Beasley.
Bailey caught nine passes for 114 yards in last week's game against
Georgia. . . . Auburn has intercepted at least one pass in six
consecutive games. The Tigers have seven interceptions in the last
two games.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA at Florida State, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Reggie McGrew continues to be bothered by a bad
back, which has kept him out of the last two games. But he said he
can't give his back any more time to heal and will not miss
Saturday's game. ``I gave it as long as it's going to get,'' McGrew
said. ``It's time to go.'' ... Defensive end Willie Cohens still
has bone fragments in as knee but passed on surgery in order to
play. The other end, Tim Beauchamp, has a sprained ankle but also
will play. ... Coach Steve Spurrier said the Gators will try as
many as seven new players on the kickoff-coverage team. ... After
taking a beating against South Carolina, QB Doug Johnson probably
will start the game in the shotgun. ... RB Terry Jackson, who has
an ankle , is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY at Tennessee, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats practiced Wednesday night so players could attend
the funeral of Christopher Scott Brock, a boyhood friend of QB Tim
Couch who was killed with UK defensive lineman Arthur Steinmetz in
a traffic accident. The team is scheduled to travel by bus this
morning to Somerset, Ky., for the funeral of Steinmetz, who was
sitting out the season after transferring from Michigan State. ...
All players, coaches and school officials are abiding by a gag rule
against commenting on manslaughter and drunken-driving charges
against center Jason Watts, who remains hospitalized. Watts, the
driver in the accident, was 1 1/2 times over the state
blood-alcohol limit of .10, police said. ... WR Quentin McCord
returned to practice Tuesday for the first time since spraining an
ankle against Georgia and is listed as probable.
</P>
<P>
   LSU at Notre Dame, Saturday, 1:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Gerry DiNardo is playing down his return to Notre Dame,
where he was an All-American guard on the Irish's national title
team of 1973. Instead, he thinks his team (4-5) can still qualify
for a bowl if it can win its final two games with Notre Dame and
Arkansas. ``If you had watched Sunday's practice, you would not
know this was a 4-5 team that was supposed to be much better than
it was,'' DiNardo said. ... DE Arnold Miller says that, after
beating Notre Dame 27-9 in the Fiesta Bowl, the Tigers are not in
awe of the Irish. The two teams also met earlier last season, with
Notre Dame winning 24-6. ``Since we played them twice before, we
know we can dominate them,'' Miller said. ... Defensive tackle
Anthony McFarland needs four sacks in his last two games to set the
LSU season record. McFarland has eight.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI at Georgia, Saturday, 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels spent the off week trying to shore up their
secondary, which was torched Nov. 7 against Arkansas. Receiver Ken
Lucas has been spending some time at cornerback. ... In the '90s,
Ole Miss has split its eight meetings with Georgia. ... Since the
SEC went to divisional play in 1992, Ole Miss is 11-9 against teams
from the SEC East. Coach Tommy Tuberville is 7-4 against the other
division. ... Tuberville's 25 wins in his first 43 games at Ole
Miss is the second-best start for a coach in school history. John
Vaught was 29-13-1 in his 43 games in Oxford. ... Saturday's game
will be a homecoming for AD John Shafer, who was on Georgia's staff
for 16 years. ... Assistant Hugh Nall was a center on Georgia's
national championship team in 1980. Graduate assistant Scott
McDuffie played briefly for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE vs. Arkansas, Saturday, 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   For the third year in a row, the Bulldogs have a chance to win
the SEC West. But the Razorbacks have dashed their hopes both
previous times. An MSU win would forge a tie with Arkansas, and it
could clinch with a win over Ole Miss. ... Lost in James Johnson's
showing last week as SEC offensive player of the week was that he
got 87 of his school-record 237 rushing yards in the fourth quarter
against the Crimson Tide. His 312 all-purpose yards also are a
school mark ... QB Wayne Madkin's numbers have improved so much
over the last four games _ 41-for-74 passing, 715 yards, six TDs
and one interception _ that offensive coordinator Lynn Amedee has
returned to his booth in the press box. He had been on the field
while Madkin, a redshirt freshman, was learning.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA at Clemson, Saturday, 6:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecocks can't erase their 1-9 record, but players and
coaches agree that a win over Clemson would make the offseason a
little nicer. ``This game stands on its own,'' coach Brad Scott
said. ... Linebacker Willie Offord has a sprained knee and might
not play. ... South Carolina finished winless (0-8) in the SEC for
the first time since joining the conference in 1992. ... Tailback
Boo Williams left the Florida game with a turf toe but is expected
to play Saturday. ... Williams returned four kickoffs for 109 yards
against the Gators. South Carolina and Kentucky have attempted more
fourth-down conversions (26) than any teams in the SEC. South
Carolina has made 15 of the attempts.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE vs. Kentucky, Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Al Wilson is still suffering from a pulled groin but
is expected to play. Others among others nursing injuries are
linebackers Raynoch Thompson (bruised knee) and Eric Westmoreland
(ribs), receiver Peerless Price (ribs) and cornerback Steve Johnson
(concussion). All are expected to play. ... Tennessee's goal is to
hold Kentucky's offense to less than 300 yards and 17 points.
That's the goal for every game the Vols play. The Wildcats had 634
yards in last season's game with Tennessee. ... Tennessee has won
17 regular-season and 14 home games in a row. ... TB Travis Henry
now has run for more than 100 yards in three of his last four
games. ... Tennessee is 9-2 in its last 11 games against ranked
teams, including 4-0 this season.
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT vs. Tennessee, Nov. 28
</P>
<P>
   Coach Woody Widenhofer said his offensive line has improved and
played a solid game in last week's 55-17 loss to Kentucky. The
Commodores did reel off a number of impressive big plays: a 50-yard
run by Jared McGrath, a 73-yard TD pass from Greg Zolman to Tavarus
Hogans _ Vandy's longest of the season _ and a 96-yard kickoff
return for a TD by Jimmy Williams. RB Lew Thomas also gained 51
yards on the ground. ... Zolman, who aggravated a shoulder in the
Kentucky game and was lifted for David Wallace, is expected to be
ready. But CB Fred Vinson (sprained foot) won't return to practice
until Sunday and might be questionable for the last game of his
college career. Vinson, a pre-season All-American, has missed parts
of three games with injuries.

   In this colorful and informative piece, Rodgers, a popular
cooking teacher known as Mr. Thanksgiving, offers facts and lore
about three staples of the holiday dinner: turkey, cranberries and
pumpkin. A few tidbits: Israelis eat the most turkey of any
nationality. Farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate, so females must be artificially
inseminated. Colonial Americans called cranberries ``bounce
berries'' because bounciness was an indication of a cranberry's
freshness. (slugged:

   Why do we celebrate Thanksgiving on the last Thursday of
November? Because of the 19th-century crusade by Sarah Josepha
Hale, editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book,'' who persuaded Abraham
Lincoln to proclaim the holiday, history buff Malehorn tells us.
Before that Thanksgiving was a haphazard celebration _ in fact, in
colonial times the word ``celebration'' was not quite apt. It was a
somber, religious occasion, spent in prayer in chilly village
churches. (slugged:

 &HT;    Work on Stone Mountain spillway nears end
 &HT;    By Scott Bernarde and Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Metro anglers are wondering about the status of the
boat ramp at Stone Mountain Park's large lake, which has been
closed since September for work on the spillway near the dam. Bob
Cowhig, director of planning and construction for the Stone
Mountain Memorial Association, said work is about 60 days ahead of
schedule and the ramp should be back to normal well before the
initial prediction of mid-spring, maybe even in January.
</P>
<P>
   The ramp is closed because the water level is down to 6 feet; no
motors are allowed because the lower level could expose boaters to
dangerous structures above or just below the surface. Cowhig said
construction would be finished in about two weeks, weather
permitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The construction is about to be completed,'' Cowhig said.
``Once that's done, bring on the rain.'' Rain will help bring the
water level back to full pool.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ramp being closed, anglers are finding ways to wet a
line, either from the bank or from small boats and canoes carried
to the water. And some have been having good luck catching bass.
``I've talked to some fishermen who wanted to know if we could just
leave it the way it is,'' Cowhig joked.
</P>
<P>
   Hike on Foote
</P>
<P>
   The newly opened Len Foote Hike Inn lodge at Amicalola Falls
State Park will be showcased on tonight's ``Georgia Outdoors
Show,'' 7:30 on GPTV. The 21-room lodge, operated by the nonprofit
Appalachian Education and Recreation Services, is a five-mile hike
from the park. Reservations are required and accepted as much as 11
months in advance by calling 770-389-7275 and outside metro Atlanta
at 800-864-7275. Rates are $55 double occupancy.

<P>
   State championship begins
</P>
<P>
   Another large field is expected for the 11th annual Georgia
State Bass Fishing Championship/Highland Marina Invitational this
weekend on West Point Lake near LaGrange. Tournament director
George Marovich says more than 500 men and women, all qualifying by
finishing in the top five in significant tournaments held on
Georgia lakes in the past year, will compete for about $50,000 in
cash and prizes. First place is guaranteed $15,000. Last year's
field of 256 boats (512 anglers from six states) was the largest
bass tournament on West Point. Practice rounds are today and
Friday, with competition beginning at safe light Saturday and
Sunday. For information, call 706-882-3437.

 &HT;    IRL rules unlikely to attract CART
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The competition between the Indy Racing League and the
CART circuit appears likely to carry into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   The IRL announced new engine rules and new guidelines Tuesday
for its 3-year-old series. And although it made some changes in
engine dimensions, horsepower, even sound, the IRL stood fast about
the concept of teams owning their engines rather than leasing them
from manufacturers as CART does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a series, and we want additional competitors, but
we're going to stay with the principles developed by our founder,
Tony George,'' said Leo Mehl, executive director of the IRL. ``The
main issue is leasing. I've been told that (CART) will not budge on
that issue. There is no reason another group (such as CART) could
not take this basic program, which controls cost, controls speed,
and adapt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehl said CART drivers and teams would be welcome at
Indianapolis and all other IRL events, if their cars comply with
IRL rules.
</P>
<P>
   The split has kept most of the sport's best-known drivers, who
were under contract with CART, away from the Indianapolis 500.
Those missing from the showcase race included Al Unser Jr., Michael
Andretti and Bobby Rahal, who recently retired.
</P>
<P>
   Selwa leaving Panoz
</P>
<P>
   Jim Selwa, chief operating officer of Panoz Motor Sports since
1997, is leaving Panoz to pursue other interests in the automotive
industry. He will, however, remain with Panoz as a consultant.
Replacing Selwa is Tres Stephenson, former executive director of
Sebring International Raceway. International stars raced at Road
Atlanta during October's Petit Le Mans. Now, the grass-roots guys
take over, as the Sports Car Club of America has its American Road
Race of Champions, Friday-Sunday. For more information, call
770-455-7222.
</P>
<P>
   Drag racing
</P>
<P>
   Duluth's Warren Johnson and other NHRA leaders were honored
Tuesday for winning championships in their respective professional
categories at the 1998 NHRA Winston Drag Racing awards ceremony at
the Cerritos (Calif.) Center for the Performing Arts. Drag racing
fans in Georgia have known for weeks that Johnson sewed up another
Pro Stock crown, but they might be surprised to learn that Mike
Stryker, crew chief for Johnson's GM Goodwrench Pontiac Firebird,
was named the Parts America Mechanic of the Year for his efforts in
helping Johnson to a fourth Winston Pro Stock championship. ...
Mark Osborne, who beat Johnson in the Atlanta Nationals, will jump
from the seat of a Pro Stock car into that of a Pro Stock Truck in
the 1999 NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series, driving a Chevy S-10 Pro
Stock Truck for James Kessinger, owner of Kessinger Motorsports of
Lawrenceburg, Ky.

 &HT;    Wolfe welcomed in Atlanta
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlantans welcomed Tom Wolfe warmly at Atlanta History
Center on Wednesday night, but not as warmly as he had feared.
</P>
<P>
   The author of ``A Man in Full'' jokingly said that he half
expected to be greeted with a firebomb or at least a blowtorch
after several reviews of the novel portrayed him as a literary
Sherman burning Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novel isn't pro-Atlanta, it isn't anti-Atlanta,'' Wolfe
told the predominantly white crowd of 500. ``I hope it is
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly ``Bo'' DuBose, president of the Atlanta History Center,
introduced Wolfe with these comments: ``If you look in the mirror
and you don't like what you see, don't blame the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   If there were any disgruntled Atlantans in the audience, none
spoke up. Wolfe drew applause and laughter as he described a scene
at PlannersBanc with financially beleaguered protagonist Charlie
Croker at a ``workout'' session with bankers determined to recover
the half-billion dollars he owes them. And there was even more
laughter when Wolfe read a chapter set on Turpmtine, Croker's vast
South Georgia quail-shooting plantation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked afterward if he had shot any birds, Wolfe smiled and said
he had been relegated to the buckboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offered a chance to shoot, but I'm sure they were
relieved when I declined.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said he toured the plantations with friends Mack and Mary
Rose Taylor and was amazed at the luxuriousness he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living naively in the East, I thought the ultimate in
conspicuous consumption was flying a Gulfstream V private jet. And
since a lot of these plantations seemed to be owned by real estate
developers, I decided to use one in the novel. I originally set it
in New York, and had Charlie Croker flying back and forth to
Georgia, but that didn't work, so I moved it to Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe said he made a dozen trips to Atlanta for periods of five
or six days each beginning in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not consider myself an authority on Atlanta. Everything I
know about Atlanta I put in the book.''
</P>
<P>
   The author reiterated comments he made earlier this month about
the vibrancy of Atlanta as a setting for a novel. He cited the
multicultural area of Vietnamese, Asian and Hispanic immigrants
along Buford Highway as one example of how Atlanta is becoming an
international city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new and fascinating world,'' he said. ``Atlanta is one
of the most exciting cities in the country and a blueprint of what
cities will be like in the future _ edge cities where the
development occurs in places like Perimeter Mall and Cumberland
Mall. There should be 25 or 50 novels about Atlanta by now. What
are these novelists doing?''
</P>
<P>
   After the lecture and before a $600-a-plate black tie dinner to
benefit the Margaret Mitchell House, Wolfe fielded questions about
the book at a press conference and downplayed any hints of
controversy involving Mayor Bill Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   When one reporter asked if he was bothered by the fact that
Campbell had said he hadn't read the novel, Wolfe replied, ``That's
all right. There's not going to be a quiz.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe explained that the novel was not intended to be a roman a
clef.
</P>
<P>
   ``The book is fictional, with as realistic a setting as I could
get,'' Wolfe said. ``Small details mean a lot. I was very upset
week before last when I learned something that was too late to put
in the book. I heard that one of the plantations I had visited had
a cage where a cougar was kept. It had a drain and all the cougar
did was eat, drink a lot of water and urinate. The cougar urine was
collected and spread around the perimeter of the plantation to keep
out the varmints such as foxes and other animals that killed quail.
That was a beautiful nugget of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe admitted that he has been surprised by all of the pre-and
post-publication hype surrounding the novel. Referring to a
question about Wolfe Watch _ a daily roundup of Tom Wolfe minutiae
in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution _ he laughed and said it made
him feel like the Beatles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a reporter at the New York Herald Tribune when the
Beatles first arrived in America in 1964,'' he said. ``All day long
we'd get these bulletins, `They're over Greenland now!' ...
`They're coming over Nova Scotia ...'
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Journal-Constitution, you made me feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe continues his march through Atlanta today, sharing a
morning meal with the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau and
lunch with members of the Piedmont Driving Club. At 7:30 p.m., he
heads to Borders Books &AMP; Music in Buckhead, where staffers are
bracing for a crowd of several thousand fans seeking to get an
autographed copy of ``A Man in Full.''

NORMAN WORKS TO HELP FUTURE GOLFERS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Greg Norman, you've just won the first tournament
you entered since undergoing shoulder surgery seven months ago.
What are you going to do next?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out it won't be Disneyland. But it might wind up another
sort of wild ride he'll remember for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be a guinea pig,'' Norman said Sunday at Sherwood
Country Club after winning his own Franklin Templeton Shark
Shootout for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Norman will reunite next month with Dr. Richard Hawkins of the
Steadman-Hawkins Clinic in Vail, Colo., where Hawkins rebuilt a
rotator cuff so worn out Norman's shoulder was disjointing during
backswings in April.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Hawkins will turn this shark into a laboratory rat
while his family hits the slopes at Vail this Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go over to the clinic and they're going to put
wires and needles in me to figure out what happens with the body
during the golf swing,'' said Norman, who teamed with fellow
Australian Steve Elkington to finish 54 holes at 27-under-par and
then fired three more birdies to win a three-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to do it here (at Sherwood during the Shootout),
but we really couldn't get it all dialed in. We'd like to get the
input of all the other players, too. Get Steve's swing on there,
see what happens with his body because he's got such great rotation
and torque. When you're talking to Steve, he's talking about
different muscles than what I talk about.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm very much interested in doing that. I want to make a
study of it, to tell you the truth. I personally want to find out
what muscles fire first from the downswing, and that will teach you
what muscles to work on physically. And that will help kids 20
years behind us, 30 years behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said golf is just catching up to other sports in that
kind of scientific analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've used computers to improve swimming, they've used
computers to improve hurdling, baseball, pitching, everything...
tennis _ you can go right across. But it hasn't really been done in
depth in golf and I want to be the guinea pig for it and see what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who turned professional in 1976, thinks his injury
wasn't so much the result of golf, but rather was exacerbated by
it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most fit players on the PGA Tour, Norman has a long
and varied history in athletics _ many of them involving an
overhead arm motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a big swimmer,'' he said. ``I used to be a
competitive middle distance swimmer, so all that overhead swimming
was not good for me. Having that and playing rugby, football in
Australia _ it's all overhand stuff. Cricket, bungee jumping _ all
that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf wasn't the sole reason for my shoulder. There were a lot
of other things going on as well in my past. Golf didn't help it.
It just accelerated the problem. It was a culmination of my
upbringing as a kid, the sports I did. That's why I want to go into
(research and development) with these golf swings.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering what transpired last week and during Norman's 75-win
career, this research and development is coming after the product
is already a huge success in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   But you never know. It might lead to bigger sharks down the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Norman thinks so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids that are 4, 5 or 6 years old,'' he said. ``That will help
(teach) them what muscles to develop.''
</P>
<P>
   Names in the game: Gary Marshall of Canoga Park hit a
hole-in-one Monday on the 167-yard, par-3 13th hole at Industry
Hills Eisenhower. That's remarkable enough, but well down the
remarkable list for the 57-year-old Marshall. He also won a car _ a
new Lexus _ for his effort. There's more, much more: It was the
second time in three months Marshall has hit a hole-in-one to win a
car _ he also did it in August at Porter Valley Country Club. And
finally... Marshall has only one arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I aim for the pin,'' is his simple explanation for his
extraordinary accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was one of 22 disabled golfers in a field of more than
200 players competing at Eisenhower in the Casa Colina Adaptive
Sports Golf Classic. Money raised by the tournament supports
Pomona-based Casa Colina's rehabilitative- adaptive sports program,
which fields six wheelchair sports teams. &QL;

IRVIN: STREAK WAS GOOD, BUT WINNING MUCH BETTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A reluctant Michael Irvin walked out of the
Cowboys locker room yesterday and tried to set the record straight
about ``the streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Measuring his words carefully, the Cowboys receiver admitted his
disappointment over the no-catch performance Sunday in the team's
35-28 victory against the Arizona Cardinals. That performance
snapped his team-record streak of catching a pass in 117
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Although Irvin said he was ``OK'' with the end of the streak
because of the victory, he has mixed feelings about his diminishing
contributions to the offense because ``the personal battles are
important to all great players.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey shouldn't go out of his way to
talk to him about the end of the streak. Instead, he said Gailey
should remain focused on Sunday's matchup against the Seattle
Seahawks (5-5). Gailey said earlier this week, if he needed to, he
would talk to Irvin about his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan's concern needs to be Seattle, not Michael this or
Michael that,'' Irvin said. ``I don't want to make it an issue.
Maybe we can put it to rest. So we all can focus on Seattle. It's
behind us. We won the game. That's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin has caught six passes in the past three games _ three
against the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants and none on
Sunday _ dropping him from fourth to 15th in the NFL, with 44
receptions.
</P>
<P>
   But Irvin said these frustrations pale in comparison to last
season's nightmarish 6-10 campaign, especially considering the
Cowboys (7-3) won the past three games and sit atop the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say it's nothing to me,'' said Irvin,
referring to losing the streak and not catching many passes.
``Because it is. If I said it's nothing, I'd be lying. But that's
still a Polaroid. The Mona Lisa is winning games. I'm not saying I
don't want to win the Polaroids. But I'm OK losing some of the
Polaroids. As long as I win the Mona Lisa. Now, I have a problem
with losing both. But I can deal with losing the Polaroids.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coaches say the biggest reason for Irvin's drop-off is
that opponents are going out of their way to take Irvin out of the
offense, forcing quarterback Troy Aikman to beat them with
receivers Billy Davis and Ernie Mills, who have combined for 49
receptions, 932 yards and six touchdowns this season.
</P>
<P>
   Although understanding of the strategy, Irvin believes he will
have to play a larger role if the Cowboys are to reach the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman agreed, but also said the Cowboys will throw the ball
where the defense dictates and won't force any passes to Irvin in
double coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys receivers coach Dwain Painter said the coaches are doing
everything they can to make Irvin a playmaker again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael has always been a big part of the game plan,'' Painter
said. ``We will continue working to get him the ball. The playbook
is very thick, and we keep adding yellow pages from the new plays.
We are definitely going to do more things to try to get him the
ball.''

 OAK CREEK RAIN BOWS LURK AMID RED ROCKS, FALL COLORS

<TEXT>
<P>
   OAK CREEK, Ariz. - The Red Rock Country around Sedona is as much
a secret as the Grand Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, has either heard of it, seen pictures of it
or been there.
</P>
<P>
   New-Agers flock to the rock spires, expecting the planets or
something to line up just right, producing a religious rapture.
People with lots of money come to spend it. It's easy to pay $200 a
night at a Sedona resort.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Creek Canyon just to the north of the city is perhaps the
second-most-famous canyon in Arizona. With good reason.
</P>
<P>
   At the lower end of the canyon, the red formations are nothing
short of spectacular. As U.S. 89A rises through the canyon toward
Flagstaff, the reds turn more to whites as the limestone cap
becomes more evident.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Creek Canyon simply is one of the most beautiful places in
Arizona. It doesn't produce the awe of size, a quality that draws
millions to the Grand Canyon. It's more of a mix of Bryce and Zion
canyons in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   With all the ogling and hiking and rapturing, sometimes Oak
Creek itself doesn't get its just praise. It may be the most
beautiful creek in Arizona. It has everything from quiet stretches
on the flats to boulder-filled, tumbling stretches. And its
riparian vegetation is stunning, especially now that the leaves are
turning on its lower stretches.
</P>
<P>
   Slide Rock State Park midway through the canyon attracts huge
crowds to sun themselves or play in the water on the rock shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But we haven't talked about fishing. OK, anglers, think about
these beautiful surroundings plus catching a brown or rainbow
trout.
</P>
<P>
   Some big trout are taken from Oak Creek, but most are stockers
from the Arizona Game and Fish Department. The stream is stocked
twice a month until January, then resumes in March.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Thomas and Rick Verbalaitis, both fly-fisherman from
Phoenix, tackled the stream on Monday. Thomas is a veteran,
Verbalaitis a stranger to small-stream fly-fishing.
</P>
<P>
   A hike to the western fork of the creek can produce wild trout,
but Thomas and Verbalaitis decided to stay along the highway to
fish the main creek.
</P>
<P>
   At a local sporting goods store, they were told that the best
fishing had been toward the upper end of the creek. The operator
said to start just above Junipine Resort and head upstream.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable private land along the stream. But finding
access points isn't a major problem. Several U.S. Forest Service
campgrounds offer access, as do spots where the road passes near
the stream. Except in the campgrounds, parking means a pullout from
the highway. Campgrounds charge a fee for gaining access.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't like fishing Canyon or some other smaller creeks,''
Thomas said. ``At Canyon, you can get access almost anywhere. And
it's more open water. You can make some long casts. Here, you make
short casts, and if you hook a fish, it has no place to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and Verbalaitis fished a stretch of the creek where the
water tumbles over boulders into small pools. Thomas examined the
bottoms of submerged rocks to determine the aquatic trout food
available and began fishing with a No. 14 bead-head, squirrel-hair
nymph.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his casts were no more than 10 feet. He'd cast to the
top of a pool and allow the fly to float through. One trout struck
the fly, another the strike indicator.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting cold now, and the state's bumper crop of
grasshoppers has all but disappeared in higher country. Hopper
dry-fly patterns were good from spring through summer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas switched to a No. 6 hopper pattern and got immediate
results. Both a brown and a rainbow struck the fly.
</P>
<P>
   Verbalaitis got two hard strikes on the hopper pattern before he
began having tackle problems.
</P>
<P>
   It was tranquil fishing. Pools were stacked one after another in
the boulders. The anglers moved slowly from pool to pool. The trout
weren't large, but they were there.
</P>
<P>
   The turning trees, the pines, the rock formations and the
crystal stream made this fishing a quality experience. The trout
only made it better. &QL;

TOBIN TO OFFENSIVE LINE STARTERS: STAY HEALTHY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The Cardinals got another scare on their
offensive line Wednesday when center  &UR; Aaron Graham woke up with
fluid on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   He missed practice when sent for a magnetic resonance imaging
test. No structural damage was found. Graham is expected to play
Sunday when the Cardinals (5-5) visit the Washington Redskins
(2-8).
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals already have depth problems up front.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Matt Joyce, their first backup at both tackles and guards, had
a plate surgically implanted Tuesday into a broken bone in his
right hand. He'll be out at least two weeks. Rookie tackle  &UR; Anthony
Clement suffered a setback in his rehabilitation from surgery on a
herniated disk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starters have stayed intact since we got (left guard)
 &UR; Chris Dishman (strained neck) back, so that's encouraging,''
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said. ``But our depth is going down. That has
weakened us. I hope our starters stay healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham was diagnosed with knee chondromalacia (roughness under
the knee that causes irritation) and is day-to-day. That he is not
seriously injured is the good news for the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that with Graham out of Wednesday's workout,
 &UR; Allen
 &UR; DeGraffenreid was forced to spend most of his time as backup center
behind  &UR; Mike Devlin, who moved up to the first team.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches have to find a backup tackle and had hoped to give
DeGraffenreid, a tackle in college, a tryout Wednesday.
DeGraffenreid will get his audition this morning instead. If the
coaches like what they see, he'll become backup to  &UR; Lomas Brown on
the left side and
 &UR; James Dexter on the right.
</P>
<P>
   If the coaches aren't satisfied with DeGraffenreid's work at
tackle they plan to promote  &UR; Jon Clark from the practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   Clement initially projected to return for the Nov. 29 game at
Kansas City. Doctors won't clear him until he can work out without
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Clement on Wednesday said he believes he will make it back this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can run and do the drills, then I get so much pain I can't
continue,'' Clement said. ``I'll go easy for another week and then
we'll see.'' &QL; 
More injuries &QL; 
Two other key players _ starting outside linebacker  &UR; Tony McCombs
(toe) and backup middle linebacker/special teams contributor
 &UR; Mark &UR; Maddox (knee) _ did not practice.
</P>
<P>
   McCombs is listed as probable for the Washington game; Maddox
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the injuries, Tobin said the team's return to practice
after coming up short against Dallas went ``really well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players realize where we are,'' Tobin said. ``They were
bitterly disappointed after the Dallas game (a 35-28 loss). They're
young guys with better ability to bounce back than the coaches
sometimes.'' &QL; 
Volunteering information &QL; 
New practice-squad receiver  &UR; Andy McCullough, who was signed
Tuesday after quarterback  &UR; Corey Sauter was waived, said averaging
just under 20 yards a catch from quarterback  &UR; Peyton Manning last
season at Tennessee ``is something I can tell my kids, when I have
kids. How many players can say they caught passes from a
quarterback like that?''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough also will have some ugly stories for his kids about
the hazing of rookies by the Saints, which he suffered in training
camp before being waived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was terrible,'' McCullough said. ``I don't know what they
hit me with but I was hit by something. It just got out of hand. I
don't want to talk about it, but that's a chapter I can put in my
book someday.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Mike Moten, a practice-squad lineman from Florida whose locker
is next to McCullough's, couldn't resist an opening jab at his new
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded him that we never lost to Tennessee,'' Moten said.
``I asked him to show me his SEC ring.'' &QL;

TROJANS COULD TAKE THIS ONE, BY THE BYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The great debate at Spaulding and Howard Jones
fields this week is the impact of USC's bye last Saturday. While
UCLA was defeating Washington in Seattle, the Trojans were resting,
relaxing and spending extra time preparing for the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, byes haven't done USC much good. They're 10-8-2
against UCLA after a bye, including the 1996 game, when they darted
to a 24-7 halftime lead before the Bruins rallied to win in double
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   But this year may be different. The bye gave Trojans receiver R.
Jay Soward time to rest his sprained ankle, and it gave USC's
first-year coaches a chance to scrutinize video of the Bruins'
potent attack.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona coach Dick Tomey is rooting for UCLA _ if the Bruins are
in the Fiesta Bowl, Arizona could play in the Rose _ but he doesn't
think the Bruins can overcome the bye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised,'' he said. ``It's a big advantage
to have a bye week late in the season against a rival who is
playing that week.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA coach Bob Toledo believes the bye is an advantage for the
Trojans _ ``It's a huge thing in their favor'' _ but the players
aren't so sure. They believe bye weeks can ruin a team's momentum,
which the Trojans had after impressive victories over Washington
and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have a bye, sometimes it ruins our timing, sometimes
it doesn't,'' UCLA guard Andy Meyers said. ``Really, a bye is only
three days (off). I don't think it will affect the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pacific-10 teams are 6-2 following byes this season,
including Cal's victory over USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make the argument both ways,'' Bruins offensive tackle
Kris Farris said. ``I prefer the rest, but some people think it
makes you rusty. Last year, we had byes before the Arizona and
Washington games, and those were arguably the two best games we
played.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting a record: A capacity crowd of 90,000 is expected,
meaning UCLA will set a single-season attendance record and lead
the Pac-10 in attendance for the first time in school history.
</P>
<P>
   The full house will boost UCLA's average to approximately
74,100. The school record is 69,812, set in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, Washington leads the league (71,356 per
game) but has no home games left.
</P>
<P>
   Scout stuff: Anticipation for the annual scout-team scrimmage
Wednesday afternoon was so high Toledo stopped practice to realign
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were thinking about the scrimmage, and I told them to
pick it up a little,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the intense, 15-minute scrimmage concluded without
a fight.
</P>
<P>
   More grades: UCLA's entering freshman football players (1994-97)
had an average high school grade-point average of 3.15 _ tops among
teams ranked in this week's Associated Press Top 25. Their average
SAT score (990) was second among top 25 teams, behind Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.15 and 990 numbers ranked second to Stanford in the
Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's four-year graduation rate for classes entering school
from 1988-91 was 57 percent _ fifth in the Pac-10 behind Stanford,
Oregon State, Oregon and USC.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Right tackle Brian Polak has not practiced this
week because of a sprained right knee and ankle. Asked if there's a
chance he won't play Saturday, Polak scoffed: ``No way.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Polak may not be fit to play every down. Josh Webb is
ready in reserve.

 By HAL MALEHORN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Nearly all American schoolchildren learn the standard
Thanksgiving story: how the Pilgrims survived their first miserable
winter, and how the following fall they feasted with friendly
Indians to celebrate a successful harvest.
 &HT;    But many of us are unaware that the holiday is rooted in
European tradition, that it was a somber, religious holiday in
colonial times and that it was through the efforts of one
determined 19th century woman that it became celebrated on a fixed
day in November.
 &HT;    Many misconceptions surround that first Thanksgiving. It is
indeed true that the Pilgrims' tables were spread with nature's
bounty that 1621 autumn. But the foods were quite different from
those on which we feast today. Turkey might well have graced the
boards, but there likely was other wild game as well, so readily
available from the woods nearby.
 &HT;    Bee-tree honey and native fruits, berries and nuts also likely
satisfied appetites at that banquet, along with fish and shellfish
that abounded close to shore.
 &HT;    Corn, native to the New World, was probably prepared either as a
pudding or baked into cakes. Pumpkins (or pompions, as they were
called) were eaten boiled, for there was little molasses or flour
to bake them into pies.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving in America actually had its origins in Europe well
before any westbound voyagers from that continent ever hoisted
sail. In many parts of the Old Country, in fact, residents had for
centuries held observances of ``Harvest Home,'' a time when farmers
joined forces with neighbors to bring in their crops. This shared
labor was usually followed by festive dancing and food and drink.
 &HT;    Sometimes European governments decreed days of rejoicing among
the populace in thanks for a major victory in battle, or for the
end of a plague or for deliverance from some natural disaster.
 &HT;    In the early decades of American colonial life, Thanksgiving Day
did not always call for making merry. To the contrary, some church
fathers took a dim view of too much jollity. Attendance at worship
was required, where thanksgivers endured hours-long sermons and
prayers in chilly village churches.
 &HT;    Thanksgiving long ago was not uniformly observed on a single
date. Sometimes two or more Thanksgivings were announced within the
same calendar year. For example, during our War of Independence
special days of gratitude were proclaimed following our major
victories on the battlefield.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Continental Congress ordered a day of thanks
after our military alliance with France was signed. Several years
later there was a call for a national celebration of the British
surrender at Yorktown. On each such occasion grateful citizens
thronged to churches to express their thanks.
 &HT;    When the Constitutional Convention gathered in 1787, one
delegate proposed mandating an annual day of thanksgiving across
the land. However, as most of his fellow delegates saw the matter
as rightly belonging to the 13 states-to-be, that provision was
omitted from the landmark document.
 &HT;    In spite of this early congressional reluctance, Presidents
George Washington and James Madison each proclaimed a nationwide
thanksgiving observance. For his part, though, Thomas Jefferson,
viewing the presidency as a strictly civil post, found himself ``in
no position to direct the religious exercise of constituents.''
 &HT;    Since most thanksgiving observances early in our nationhood
occurred only at the discretion of the governor of the various
states, the time chosen for such an event ranged from September
through January. The success in fixing a single date on which to
observe Thanksgiving can be attributed to Sarah Josepha Hale,
editor of ``Godey's Lady's Book.''
 &HT;    In 1846 she began a crusade to set aside the last Thursday in
November as an official national holiday. Each autumn thereafter
she published in her magazine's pages an enthusiastic editorial on
the desirability of such an event.
 &HT;    Each year her November issue focused on that special day,
relating warm stories of family reunions. Mrs. Hale encouraged her
readers to urge their governors to agree on just one date.
 &HT;    When the Civil War broke out in 1861, Mrs. Hale's campaign
faltered for a while. But after the Union victory at Gettysburg,
President Abraham Lincoln set aside a day of thanksgiving and
prayer. Relieved at the recent repulse of Robert E. Lee's rebel
forces, Northern citizens had ample reason to rejoice.
 &HT;    Six weeks later the persistent Mrs. Hale wrote to Lincoln,
urging him to establish Thanksgiving as an annual national event.
Because the last Thursday was already being so proclaimed by
governors of most of the northern states, Mrs. Hale argued, Lincoln
should make it official.
 &HT;    And so, on Oct. 8, 1863, Lincoln decreed a national Thanksgiving
for the last Thursday in November _ not in honor of military
success, but rather ``for a year filled with blessings of fruitful
fields.''
 &HT;    The following year Lincoln renewed his proclamation, and ever
since our nation has seen fit to continue the tradition. And so
today millions of Americans gather each November to enjoy families,
friendships and abundant food _ the same blessings so important to
the Pilgrims in 1621.

 &UR; From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURKEY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is only assumed that wild turkeys were served at that first
Thanksgiving in 1621. The firsthand accounts of the menu simply
mention ``fowl.'' We do know that the Pilgrims had venison, cod and
lobster on the table, so why don't we have surf and turf or fish
cakes instead of turkey?
</P>
<P>
   The turkey is an impressive bird, with its bronze feathers,
unusual head markings and showy tail. Even a hardened critic like
Brilliat-Savarin _ a French gourmand who, in 1825, uttered the
phrase, ``Tell me what you eat and I will tell you what you are'' _
said, ``The turkey is certainly one of the handsomest gifts the New
World made to the Old World. ... [It] is the largest and, if not
the most subtle, at least the most tasty of our domestic birds.''
Just looking at its corpulent figure it gives one a feeling of
abundance and well-being.
</P>
<P>
   The wild turkey is native to North and Central America and was
domesticated by the Aztecs. No one knows when the first turkeys
traveled to Europe, but they seem to have been brought to Spain by
conquistadors in the early 1500s. The turkey quickly established
itself as the bird to serve at festive occasions, especially in
Italy, France and England, and was bred into a plumper version.
</P>
<P>
   This new improved turkey was brought back to the Americas, where
it was crossbred with its wild cousin to make the breed we know
today. The turkey was not a strange bird to the Pilgrims _ they
were well acquainted with it, and must have been relieved to find a
familiar food in this strange land.
</P>
<P>
   No one really knows how the turkey got its name. There are many
explanations, none definitive. Some think that early explorers,
believing they were close to India, misidentified the bird and
called it tuki, an Indian name for peacock.
</P>
<P>
   Because it also resembled the guinea fowl, which came from
Africa via Turkish merchants, it could have picked up the name by
another misappropriation of origin. (Guinea fowls were also called
turkeys.) Or it could have gotten its name from one of its calls,
which sounds like ``turk, turk, turk.''
</P>
<P>
   Because turkeys were so abundant in Colonial America, they were
a major source of nourishment for our country's forefathers. In a
well-known letter to his daughter, Benjamin Franklin expressed his
dismay over the eagle's being chosen as the official United States
bird.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the eagle's ``bad moral character,'' he went on to
say, ``I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the
representative of our country! The turkey is a much more
respectable bird, and withal a true original native of America.''
</P>
<P>
   While about 675 million pounds of turkey are served each
Thanksgiving, in recent years its healthy profile and versatility
have changed the turkey from a holiday bird to one that competes
with other meat and poultry on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, Americans do not eat the most turkey. In 1997, it
was estimated that Israelis ate about 25.7 pounds per capita, while
we weighed in at 18.7 pounds. Runner-up was France, at 13.4 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most turkeys are of the White Holland variety, which have a lot
of the white breast meat that more than 70 percent of Americans
prefer. In fact, farm-raised turkeys are so chest-heavy that they
cannot get close enough to mate. All farm-raised female turkeys are
artificially inseminated.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRANBERRIES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure that cranberries were served at the first
Thanksgiving, but the cranberry was a very important food to the
Pawtuxet Indians, so historians assume that they would have offered
it as a contribution to the feast. Instinct must have taught the
Indians that the tart berries are an excellent source of Vitamin C,
because they used them in many dishes.
</P>
<P>
   They ate them raw and boiled with maple syrup, but perhaps the
most common use was in pemmican, which was a kind of low-tech
energy bar made with berries, dried venison meat and melted animal
fat. Pemmican kept well, and went with the Indians on long
journeys.
</P>
<P>
   The Pilgrims probably referred to cranberries as ``fenberries,''
a common fruit in old England which they resembled. The cranberry,
however, gets its modern name from the Dutch and German settlers,
who called it a ``crane berry.'' When the cranberry vines bloom,
the blossom looks like the head and bill of a crane. Eventually,
the name became cranberry.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Americans called them ``bounce berries,'' referring to
their bounciness. Bouncing berries are an indication of freshness;
bruised, old berries don't bounce.
</P>
<P>
   A recipe for cranberry sauce is included in the very first
printed American cookbook, Amelia Simmons' ``American Cookery,''
which appeared in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   Canned cranberry sauce first hit the shelves in 1912, a product
of the Cape Cod Cannery Company, which eventually became the Ocean
Spray Preserving Company. The president of the company was a Boston
lawyer, Marcus L. Urann. In 1930, Urann organized a merger between
his company and two other cranberry canneries to form the Cranberry
Canners, Inc., a cranberry farming cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperative, which eventually acquired Urann's former
company name after a few months of squabbling, now provides more
than 70 percent of the world's cranberries.
</P>
<P>
   If you've ever wondered how many cranberries are in a 12-ounce
bag, the number is 360, give or take a few berries.
</P>
<P>
   PUMPKIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pumpkin pie was certainly not included in the first feast. The
Mayflower's stores of wheat had long been depleted, and the first
planting had failed. No wheat, no pie crust. As with so many other
foods, the Indians taught the Pilgrims about pumpkin. Along with
beans and corn, it was one of the three major foods in the Native
American diet throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   There is some argument over the pumpkin's origin. Some botanists
say it is a New World vegetable, and others claim it was known in
Europe before the Exploration Age. It is likely, however, that the
European ``pumpkins'' in the pre-Columbus era were really gourds,
and that we can truly claim the pumpkin as an American native that
deserves a place of honor at the Thanksgiving meal.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians probably roasted pumpkin over an open fire or boiled
it with maple syrup. Pumpkin pudding became one of the favorite
dishes of the Puritan era. The pumpkin flesh was scooped out, mixed
with milk, spices and syrup, then returned to the pumpkin shell,
where it was roasted for hours in hot ashes. It is easy to see
where the basic recipe for pumpkin pie filling came from.
</P>
<P>
   Known to the settlers as pompion _ the name given by French
explorers in the late 1500s _ pumpkin saved them from starvation in
the lean early years of their colony.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first recipes for pumpkin pie appeared in 1655 in a
British book called Queens Closed Open. This version represents the
then current taste for highly seasoned foods and includes thyme,
rosemary, cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper, cloves and apple. Amelia
Simmons included ``pompkin pie'' in the first American cookbook,
published in 1796.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the modern pumpkin pie can be dated back to 1929.
In that year, Libby, McNeil and Libby bought a small pumpkin pie
cannery, Dickinson Canning Company. The little cannery's pride and
joy was its special eating pumpkin, now called the Dickinson
variety. Eating pumpkins, very different from the jack-o'-lantern
varieties grown for their size and appearance, are elongated and
buff-colored with thin walls. The Dickinson is noted for its bright
orange color, creamy texture and fresh taste.
</P>
<P>
   Libby's took years to develop its own strain, improving upon the
Dickinson, called ``Select.'' Today, Libby's, a division of Nestle,
Inc., plants more than 4,000 acres of pumpkins annually.

 By ELIZABETH LEVANG  
 From ``Holiday Hope: Remembering Loved Ones During Special Times of
the Year,'' published by Fairview Press 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The holiday season calls up wistful memories and returns us to
faraway places, to scenes filled with the scents and sounds of
warmth and happiness. No other time of year evokes such strong
images of family togetherness.
 &HT;    For all its nostalgia and sentimentalism, however, the holiday
season is a difficult and often debilitating period for those who
are bereaved. More than anything, the holidays seem to accentuate
what others have and they have lost.
 &HT;    A time of year that once was joyous now often becomes almost
unbearable. Thanksgiving, Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year's are
days to endure rather than enjoy.
 &HT;    A friend whose 17-year-old son died in a car accident once
confided, ``I'd like to rip Dec. 25 off my calendar forever.''
 &HT;    Those with loved ones who have died experience a special pain or
burden during the holidays. Your lives have been altered, and your
family togetherness has been disturbed forever. Trying to reconcile
your reality with the idealized picture of the holidays projected
by the media causes even more emotional pain.
 &HT;    The expectations put on the bereaved, both socially and
emotionally, can feel overwhelming. You may have parties to attend,
gifts to purchase and a tree to be bought and trimmed. You are
expected to get in the spirit and join in the festivities just like
everyone else, yet in your heart is a gnawing pain and the constant
fear that you won't make it.
 &HT;    A close friend once remarked how much she had come to hate
Thanksgiving. ``The family focus hurts me,'' she said. ``I feel
somehow out of place. It's a depressing and lonely time for me.
Both my parents are dead and I don't really feel like I have much
to give thanks about.''
 &HT;    Comparing yourself to others, isolating ourselves, feeling
jealous, lonely, depressed or angry are some of the reactions that
you may experience during the holiday season. Many also feel guilt
from time to time, or are totally overwhelmed with sorrow.
 &HT;    Still, there are ways to survive the holidays, and with a change
in attitude and a bit of planning, they can become tolerable, and
even enjoyable. How can you better handle your grief during the
holidays?
 &HT;    First, acknowledge your pain. You miss your loved one. It is
agonizing not to be able to spend this joyous time with him or her.
Feel free to share your pain with friends and family. By
acknowledging and sharing your feelings, you allow others to
support and care for you. Rather than pushing your feelings down
and hoping they will stay hidden, you need an opportunity to
resolve them. Only by letting the hurt out will you make room for
healing.
 &HT;    Second, take charge of your life and don't leave things to
chance. This does not mean putting yourself on a rigid schedule,
but rather deciding in advance what you would like to do and with
whom. By taking charge, you give yourself things to look forward to
rather than things to dread. Occupying yourself lends a purpose to
your days and keeps you from feeling sorry for yourself.
 &HT;    Third, think more realistically and positively. What you think
has a dramatic effect on how you feel. When you form positive yet
realistic expectations for the holidays and accept your own
limitations, you reduce the tensions and pressure you face. Now,
how do you put these three new attitudes into practice? Here are a
number of specific coping strategies:
 &HT;    + Be honest. Your feelings are legitimate. Trust that you know
what is best for yourself. If a gathering of family or friends is
too painful, make your apologies and leave.
 &HT;    + Accept and seek support. Let your family and friends know how
they can be of assistance. If hanging ornaments on the tree feels
overwhelming, ask a friend to lend a hand. If neighbors offer to
bake cookies or wrap gifts, graciously accept their help and good
intentions.
 &HT;    + Be kind to yourself. Look for ways to nurture and care for
yourself throughout the holidays. Perhaps buy yourself a special
gift, sign up for a massage or do that something you've always
wanted to do. And at the very least, treat yourself to an
occasional smile.
 &HT;    + Have a plan. Talking with friends and family about what you
want and don't want to do during the holidays can be very helpful.
Being prepared lessens anxiety.
 &HT;    + Alter traditions. Since circumstances have changed, old
traditions may need replacing. Even simple changes, like serving
another dish instead of turkey or opening gifts later in the day,
may make you more comfortable.
 &HT;    + Start a new tradition. Start afresh by adding one new
tradition each year. Attending a seasonal play, decorating a
special tree outdoors or reciting a favorite poem before opening
gifts are some examples.
 &HT;    + Shop early. Avoid the holiday atmosphere by completing
shopping early. Rely on catalogs or the telephone, or enlist the
aid of a supportive friend.
 &HT;    + Decrease your commitments. Grief saps energy, so you may need
to pare down your commitments. Consider buying instead of baking
cookies, cutting down on the number of cards you send or having an
artificial rather than a fresh tree.
 &HT;    + Cherish your memories. Religious services, Christmas concerts
or other holiday events can trigger memories of your loved one.
While some may be painful, memories need to be cherished, for they
are an enduring and intimate connection to your loved one.
 &HT;    + Give tribute. The holidays can be a special time to honor your
loved one. Donating money to a special cause, offering to help
someone in need or volunteering your time and talents to a local
charity are some ways to do this.
 &HT;    + Be hopeful. The pain and stress of the holidays is very real.
Still, with some trial and error, things will get better.
 &HT;    + Remember the life of your loved one. More than anything else
at this time of year, you may feel a strong need to know that your
loved one has not been forgotten. Setting a plate at the table,
hanging a stocking on the mantle or retelling stories about him or
her are just a few ways to reassure yourself that the spirit of
this special person lives on.

 By RICK RODGERS  
 From ``Thanksgiving 101,'' published by Broadway Books 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Rick Rodgers, often called Mr. Thanksgiving, gives holiday
cooking classes nationwide. Below he answers questions about
choosing from among the myriad types of turkey on the market.
 &HT;    + Other than gender, are there any differences between hen and
tom turkeys? Is one more tender than the other?
 &HT;    Hens are female turkeys, weighing from 8 to 16 pounds. Male
toms, bred to yield a high proportion of the white breast meat that
most Americans prefer, weigh 14 to 26 pounds. The size of the bird
relates to its age. Turkeys are often labeled ``young,'' because no
commercial turkey is much older than 26 weeks.
 &HT;    Thanks to modern animal husbandry methods, there is no
difference in flavor or tenderness between toms and hens. In the
old days, a younger bird meant a more tender one, and while an old
tom had plenty of flavor, it was also tougher.
 &HT;    + What are the differences between fresh and frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    There are actually three designations for fresh and frozen
turkeys.
 &HT;    _ ``Frozen'' turkeys have been deep-chilled at 0 degrees or
below. They are at their best if defrosted and cooked within one
year of purchase. (If you've ever wondered how your supermarket can
give away free frozen turkeys as premiums at Thanksgiving time,
it's probably because they are using up last year's surplus.)
 &HT;    _ ``Fresh'' birds have never been chilled below 26 degrees, and
have a correspondingly short shelf life. (Turkey freezes at eight
degrees lower than water does.) Fresh turkeys are readily available
at supermarkets or butchers. You rarely have to special order them
anymore, unless your butcher requires that you do so or you are
concerned about getting a certain size. Buy fresh turkey no earlier
than two days before roasting, even if the ``sell-by'' date on the
label is later. I always buy a fresh turkey.
 &HT;    _ Turkeys kept at temperatures between 0 and 26 degrees are
considered ``hard-chilled.'' You won't see turkeys labeled
hard-chilled, though, as each turkey producer is allowed to create
its own name for this designation, as long as it isn't misleading.
Holding turkey at this temperature range prolongs shelf life and
has little effect on quality.
 &HT;    + What about frozen turkeys?
 &HT;    Frozen turkeys are the least expensive, but freezing dries out
the meat, and more moisture is lost down the drain during
defrosting. Good turkey producers always inject the birds with a
moistening solution to replace the lost liquid. The best frozen
turkeys have been injected only with wholesome ingredients like
broth, vegetable oil and seasonings.
 &HT;    Also, frozen birds require advance planning to defrost. I hardly
have enough room in my refrigerator at holiday time as it is,
without a huge turkey taking up all the space while it thaws for
three to five days.
 &HT;    Considering the minor difference in price between frozen and
fresh (or hard-chilled, which is almost as good as fresh) turkeys,
why not get the best you can afford?
 &HT;    + If I do buy a frozen turkey, how do I defrost it?
 &HT;    First and foremost, never defrost a turkey at room temperature.
 &HT;    Allow enough time for the turkey to thaw. It takes a full 24
hours to defrost each five pounds of turkey in the refrigerator.
So, if you want a 25-pound turkey to be thoroughly defrosted by
Thanksgiving morning, you must buy it by the preceding Sunday at
the latest. (I'd buy it on Saturday, just to be sure.)
 &HT;    If you are in a hurry, a second-best option is to defrost the
bird in a large sink of cold water, allowing 30 minutes per pound,
changing the water and turning the turkey often. Do not add warm
water to hasten the process.
 &HT;    Don't defrost a turkey in the microwave oven. The turkey is
irregularly shaped, and some parts of the bird will cook while
others are still defrosting. Besides, most microwave ovens won't
hold a bird larger than 12 pounds.
 &HT;    + What about self-basting birds?
 &HT;    Self-basting birds, available fresh and frozen, have been
``enhanced'' (in the eyes of the producer) with flavorings, some
natural and some artificial. They purport to make the turkey moist
_ I say these make the turkey soggy and wet, and predisposed to
fall apart when lifting it from the pan.
 &HT;    They say the basting liquid makes the turkey taste better _ I
say a turkey tastes good enough without fake flavorings. I want to
promote turkeys that taste like turkey, not canned soup.
 &HT;    And I like to baste the bird, so the concept of ``self-basting''
leaves me cold. Not only does opening the oven and basting give the
cook an idea of the turkey's progress, but the hot basting liquid
helps to brown and seal the skin and hold in the juices.
 &HT;    + My farmers' market has organic, free-range birds. Are they
worth the price?
 &HT;    The terms organic and free-range are not recognized by the USDA.
Butchers, farmers and restaurants can use them as marketing terms,
but they cannot use them in labeling (although they can be written
on signs advertising the product).
 &HT;    Generally, ``organic poultry'' has been raised on organically
grown, antibiotic-free feed. ``Free-range'' turkeys, which are
often organic, have been raised in a relatively spacious
environment that gives them access to open spaces.
 &HT;    Many turkeys that are not called free-range may have been raised
in henhouses with the same amount of space. The term free-range may
make you think of wide-open skies, but it's no guarantee that the
birds have ever been outside _ it just means that the door to the
henhouse is open and they can go out if they want to.
 &HT;    These birds can be excellent, but, again, they still need to be
cooked carefully for fine results. They are significantly more
expensive than ordinary fresh turkeys, and whether they are worth
it or not is up to you.
 &HT;    + My specialty butcher carries wild turkeys. What are they like?
 &HT;    Today, most wild turkeys are actually farm-raised. They are very
full-flavored, but not gamy like hunter-bagged wild turkeys. Most
true, wild turkeys are so tough that cooks roast only the tender
breast and stew the dark meat. I like to say they are to regular
turkeys what sourdough bread is to white bread. Some people just
like the complex flavor of the former better than the latter.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys look much different from regular ones, with a high,
humped breastbone and freckled white skin. While wild turkeys may
look meaty, they actually have a very low meat-to-bone ratio. Their
weight ranges from only six to 12 pounds. Allow about 1 1/2 pounds
per person.
 &HT;    Wild turkeys are very lean and should be roasted only to 170 to
175 degrees, or the meat will dry out. The dark meat may be a
little pink, but it is safe to eat. If you prefer your dark meat
more well-done, just pop the sliced meat back into a 400-degree
oven for a few minutes _ it will probably be cooked by the time you
get around to serving the mashed potatoes.
 &HT;    + My neighbor swears by kosher turkeys. What makes them
different?
 &HT;    Kosher turkeys are raised free-range in a manner similar to
organic turkeys and are fed antibiotic-free feed. They are
slaughtered and salted according to Jewish dietary laws. Some cooks
feel that the method of slaughtering gives the birds a fresher,
cleaner taste. The salting seasons the turkeys and makes their meat
somewhat firmer than that of regular birds.
 &HT;    These extra steps are labor-intensive, so kosher turkeys always
cost more. Many kosher turkeys are frozen, so be sure to defrost
them properly to protect your investment.

 ROLAND SAYS DEAL NEAR TO MOVE PATRIOTS TO HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, CONN. _ Gov. John Rowland of Connecticut said
Wednesday that only technicalities remained to be worked out in a
deal to build a stadium for the New England Patriots in downtown
Hartford. Connecticut's chances for luring the team seemed to
improve Wednesday afternoon when a Massachusetts legislator, who
had blocked money for a new stadium near Boston, said he would do
nothing to try to keep the team.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, a Patriots official said publicly for the
first time that a Hartford move could happen. ``There is not a deal
done, but I won't deny there's a possibility of it,'' said Stacey
James, the team's director of media relations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials involved in the negotiations said they hoped to hold a
celebratory ceremony with the Patriots owner, Robert Kraft, as soon
as Thursday. And a senior Democrat in the Connecticut legislature
said that Rowland, a Republican, had told him to expect an
announcement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Rowland and other officials cautioned that the legal
and financial fine points were already taking longer than they had
expected and that objections from either side could derail the
project. ``Everything's still going in the right direction,''
Rowland said as he shuttled, tieless and in shirt sleeves, between
his office and the stadium war room he has set up at the Capitol.
``There's 18,000 little things that can go wrong. But we're all
very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, memories of previous failed deals with sports teams led
some local officials to preach caution. ``I'll believe it when I
see it,'' said Michael Peters, the mayor of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in a sign of optimism, Rowland delayed for a
second day his scheduled departure to New Orleans for the meeting
of the Republican Governors Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Rowland summoned two dozen legislative and
business leaders to the executive residence, where he showed off
drawings of the proposed stadium and explained how it would be paid
for. The stadium would be part of a $350 million redevelopment
project that would include a convention center and a hotel, state
officials said. The state had already committed $300 million to
build a redevelopment project on the site, known as Adriaen's
Landing. Kraft would pay no money for the stadium, but would be
expected to help pay for another part of the project, possibly the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thomas Finneran, speaker of the Massachusetts House,
was once again refusing to come to the aid of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes them special?'' Finneran asked at a news conference
outside his office. ``What makes them different? What makes them
entitled to a deal that goes beyond the bounds of anything that's
reasonable and quite frankly bullies and pillages the taxpayers?''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Senate has promised money to help build a new
stadium in Foxboro, where the Patriots now play, 30 miles south of
Boston. But a Massachusetts deal has been held up in the House, and
Finneran said he planned to do no more for the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft proposed to spend $200 million for a new stadium near the
current one, and in return he wanted the state to pay $72 million
to buy land, build roads, and install lighting and other utility
lines. The Massachusetts Senate passed the package, but the House
would not approve more than $57 million, which killed the deal for
Kraft.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greg Aiello, the National Football League's vice president of
public relations, said a change of playing site would require the
approval of 24 of the league's 31 clubs. ``The fact that the
Patriots would be staying in New England would be viewed as a
positive by the rest of the league,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A special session of the Connecticut Legislature would be called
next month to approve the project. ``We don't want to give
Massachusetts time to react,'' said a senior official involved in
the talks.
</P>
<P>
   As sketched by legislative and administration officials, the
deal calls for a 65,000-seat open-air stadium with a grass surface.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would last for 30 years, and the stadium would be
paid for with the sale of bonds. State officials said that to pay
off the bonds, Kraft would pay the state a 10 percent cut of
tickets, concessions and parking.

LAUTENBERG SAYS HE'LL SEEK 4TH TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Frank Lautenberg, a three-term New Jersey
Democrat who was widely thought to be considering retirement, said
Wednesday that he would run for re-election in 2000, mainly because
he believed that the Democrats would regain control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from Jerusalem, where he is traveling on Senate
business, Lautenberg said the Democrats' unexpectedly strong
showing in the midterm elections had convinced him that his party
would pick up the five seats needed to take back the Senate in
2000. ``I think the Democrats have gained their credibility back,
despite the president's problems,'' he said. ``People believe we
know how to do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg, 74, said his decision to run again, which was first
reported in The Star-Ledger of Newark on Wednesday, was prompted by
reasoning that if the Democrats retake the Senate, he may have the
choice of becoming chairman of the Budget Committee or the
Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over
transportation programs, an area of interest to him.
</P>
<P>
   Lautenberg is the ranking minority member on the Budget
Committee, which would make him first in line to become chairman in
a Democratic-led Senate. And the Democrat who is ahead of him on
the Environment and Public Works Committee, Sen. Max Baucus of
Montana, may choose to become chairman of the Finance Committee
instead, Lautenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever we've enjoyed in the past with legislative successes
could get even better,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   There is some skepticism among New Jersey politicians about
whether Lautenberg will really stay in the race. In both parties,
there is speculation that he is gearing up to do fund-raising just
so he can retire old campaign debts or that he made the
announcement simply to maintain his influence in the Senate and in
New Jersey political circles.
</P>
<P>
   But Lautenberg denied any such motivations. ``I've said I'm
going to run, and I intend to,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His announcement is likely to freeze campaign preparations by
several other Democrats, including Rep. Robert Menendez of Union
City, N.J., who has said that he would not challenge Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the senator's decision, some political analysts said,
some Republicans may abandon the idea of running for Senate and set
their sights on the 2001 race for governor instead. The Republicans
mentioned as possible Senate candidates include Jersey City Mayor
Bret Schundler, state Sen. William Gormley of Mays Landing and
Essex County Executive James Treffinger.
</P>
<P>
   In his first Senate campaign, in 1982, Lautenberg attacked his
Republican opponent, Rep. Millicent Fenwick, who was 72 at the
time, as being too old. Reminded of that Wednesday, the senator
said things were different in his case because he had seniority and
would not be struggling to find his way around the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty fit and aggressive,'' he said. ``My kids will tell
you I'm the one who tires them all out.''

EDITORIAL: UNSEATING SADDAM HUSSEIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 19: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weary of endless confrontations with Iraq, President Clinton,
Congress and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain are now rallying
around the idea of overthrowing Saddam Hussein. The thought is
certainly alluring. The installation of a democratic government in
Baghdad would probably eliminate the threat of Iraqi aggression.
Unfortunately, the only sure way to reach that goal is for American
troops to invade Iraq and capture Baghdad, a risky prospect few
Americans would support.
</P>
<P>
   Toppling foreign governments is no easy trick, and replacing
them with democratic leaders can be even harder. The American
record is not encouraging. The Central Intelligence Agency
engineered coups in Iran and Guatemala in the early 1950s,
consigning those two countries to years of corrupt, undemocratic
leadership. In Iraq, political disintegration and civil war could
easily follow a coup and prove as destabilizing to the Persian Gulf
region as the Saddam regime has.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is an especially difficult target for outside intervention
because opposition groups are weak and divided, state sanctions
against dissent are severe and Saddam has executed potential
antagonists in the Iraqi military and security services. A palace
coup seems unlikely, even in the face of sustained American aerial
bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is more likely to pursue a strategy of political and
military encirclement, depending heavily on Iraqi groups long
estranged from Baghdad. These include Kurdish guerrillas in the
north and Shiite forces in the south. One proposal is to assemble
and arm an opposition army under the protection of American
warplanes in a remote region of Iraq. The leaders of this group
would then establish an alternative Iraqi government that would be
recognized by Washington and its allies.
</P>
<P>
   Even if feuding between opposition groups can be stilled long
enough to form such a united front, the next step would inevitably
involve a military offensive by this alliance against Baghdad. This
cannot hope to succeed without mechanized American ground forces
and air strikes. Absent that help, thousands of Iraqi rebel
soldiers would probably be slaughtered by Saddam's Republican
Guards.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans are no more appealing. The CIA has few reliable
friends in Baghdad and is in no position to encourage an
insurrection within Saddam's inner circle or to conduct a campaign
of sabotage against Iraqi utility plants and broadcast stations. A
CIA effort to kill the Iraqi leader would not only violate a
presidential ban on assassination but would also invite retaliation
against American leaders. Encouraging a popular rebellion by
beaming American radio broadcasts into Iraq would seem a futile
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The White House and the Pentagon are well aware of all these
problems, and were openly skeptical about plotting against Saddam
until Clinton unexpectedly embraced the idea earlier this week. If
Clinton and members of Congress are serious about trying to
overthrow him, they need to level with the American people about
the potential financial and human costs. The project will not be
cheap or bloodless. Nor is it likely to succeed without an American
invasion and occupation of Iraq. Keeping Iraq isolated and
controlling its weapons of mass destruction through aggressive
inspection is an imperfect policy, but it is more practical than
anything else that has been proposed.

NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS MAKER SHIFTING TO DIRECT SALES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Nutritional supplements maker Pharmanex Inc. said
it has begun pulling all of its products from store shelves as it
shifts to a new direct-sales model.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows Pharmanex's purchase this summer by Provo,
Utah-based Nu Skin Enterprises, a multilevel marketer, which will
begin selling the suburban Simi Valley company's herbal and dietary
supplements through independent sales contractors. The transition
should be complete by Jan. 15, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The move is ``calculated to take advantage of the growth in
direct sales in the United States,'' Pharmanex President Bill
McGlashan said in a written statement. McGlashan said direct
selling ``represents a more attractive way to differentiate the
benefits . . . of Pharmanex products.''
</P>
<P>
   Nu Skin Chief Executive Steven Lund described the shift as ``the
logical next step'' in the integration of Pharmanex into the Nu
Skin organization. The company said Pharmanex products such as
green tea capsules and the cholesterol-lowering yeast product
Cholestin will be available for sale by Nu Skin's approximately
500,000 sales representatives internationally, though the reps are
not required to carry the products.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nu Skin and Pharmanex have come under government scrutiny
in the last year. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is trying
to prevent the firm from selling Cholestin, insisting that its
contents constitute a drug and require government approval. A
federal judge is currently considering the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   And in February, the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office
accused Nu Skin of operating a pyramid scheme related to the sale
of electricity services. Nu Skin later settled those charges with
the state while denying the charges.

SMALL SALE AT CHRISTIE'S YIELDS PRICES TO MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The dealers and collectors who jammed Christie's Park
Avenue salesroom Wednesday night kept a watchful eye on prices as
Impressionist and 19th-century artworks by masters like Monet and
Signac, Cezanne and Bonnard, spun around on the turntable. Only
when a top-quality work was offered did the room come alive with
bidders. Even then, heads remained cool, and only 14 works out of
the 43 offered exceeded the expected price.
</P>
<P>
   The sale totaled $44.9 million, less than its low estimate of
$47.6 million. Only 35 of the works found buyers.
</P>
<P>
   One of Wednesday night's most popular paintings, and the most
expensive work of the evening, was Monet's ``Boatmen at
Argenteuil'' (1874), being sold by the heirs of the Paris dealer
Paul Durand-Ruel. The sun-dappled scene of sailors and rowers,
which had not been on the market since 1895, was estimated at $6
million to $8 million. Three people seriously wanted the painting,
and after bids flew around the room, it went to David Nahmad, a
Manhattan dealer, for $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite surprising, the number of people who really
fought to buy it,'' said Franck Giraud, head of 19th-century and
Impressionist art at Christie's. ``It was Impressionism at its
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuillard's ``Conversation (Terra Cotta Pot),'' a tapestry-like
1895 domestic interior from the artist's Nabi period, had four
people who wanted to take it home. It sold to an unidentified
bidder for $4.7 million, the second highest price ever paid for a
painting by the artist.
</P>
<P>
   (Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   Christie's had an advantage over Sotheby's, which had its sales
of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art on Monday and Tuesday
evenings. After those sales produced mixed results, Christie's
warned sellers of the tepid market (as both auction houses
generally do, given the chance), and in some cases, reserves _
secret minimum prices agreed upon by the sellers and the auction
house _ were obviously lowered.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in some cases, made the difference between selling a
painting and not selling. Often, works sold for far below their low
estimates. Courbet's ``View of Ornans and Its Steeple'' (1858),
which had been owned by the British Rail Pension Fund Collection
until it was sold at Sotheby's in London in 1990, was again on
offer Wednesday night. It went to an unidentified telephone buyer
for $607,500, far below its $800,000 low estimate.

<P>
   Monet was well represented, but the results were mixed. His
``View of the Water Lily Pond'' (1917-19) was estimated at $6
million to $8 million but sold to an unidentified telephone bidder
for $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another Monet, ``The Ducal Palace,'' a 1908 scene of the Grand
Canal in Venice with the palace reflected on the water, was
estimated at $3.5 million to $4.5 million. Nobody was willing to
pay more than $2.7 million, and it went unsold.
</P>
<P>
   Other water scenes performed well. Signac's ``Concarneau.
Morning Calm. Opus 219 (Larghetto),'' from 1891, was painted at a
time when the artist was inspired by his love of music, combining
colors that were divided and then harmonized in much the same way a
composer produces a melody. The scene of boats on the water was
expected to bring $2.5 million to $3.5 million. Three bidders tried
to buy it, and the painting eventually sold for $4.4 million to
David Nash, the former director of Impressionist and modern art at
Sotheby's, who now runs Mitchell-Innes &AMP; Nash, a Madison Avenue
gallery with his wife, Lucy Mitchell-Innes.
</P>
<P>
   Another strong price was paid for Bonnard's ``Tea in the
Garden'' (1891). Estimated at $800,000 to $1.2 million, it finally
sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   An 1877 Cezanne landscape, ``The Winding Road,'' had three
people wanting it, but at the right price. It sold to an
unidentified bidder for $2.8 million, its low estimate.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, pastel dancers by Degas brought big prices, but
not on Wednesday night. ``Le Pas Battu'' (1879), estimated at $2
million to $3 million, remained unsold when nobody wanted to pay
more than $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   As generally happens when bidding is controlled, bottom-fishers,
especially dealers, came out in full force. ``Prices have been so
strong until now that dealers couldn't afford to buy,'' said
Abigail Asher, a Manhattan dealer. ``It was clear tonight that the
Impressionist market is still trying to find its price point.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some happy buyers were seen leaving the sale. Scott
Black, president of Delphi Management in Boston, took home a
Bernard and a Toulouse-Lautrec. ``Good paintings found buyers,'' he
said. ``But overall the evening was pretty lackluster.''

PATRICK CLANCY, 76, FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE CLANCY BROTHERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rl) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Clancy, who helped start a folk revival as a founding
member of the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, died on Nov. 11 at
his home in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Bill Haller, his son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   As the eldest of the Clancy Brothers, Clancy toured the world
singing Irish songs, often with thousands of audience members
singing along. Although the Clancy Brothers got started as Irish
expatriates in New York, where they were part of the Greenwich
Village folk revival of the 1950s and '60s, the group's rowdy,
good-humored performances created an enduring image of Irish
tradition and spurred a rediscovery of folk styles back home in
Ireland. Clancy also started a folk-music label, Tradition, that
documented Appalachian music, blues, Celtic and ethnic music.
</P>
<P>
   Clancy was born in Carrick, in rural Tipperary, where he and his
brothers soaked up traditional music. During World War II he went
to England to join the Royal Air Force, and worked as an airplane
mechanic in England and India. After the war he and his brother
Tom, who had sung pop music in Ireland, came to the United States.
They worked at a brewery in Newark, N.J., and sold insurance in
Cleveland before moving to New York.
</P>
<P>
   In postwar bohemian Greenwich Village, they acted in and
produced off-Broadway plays, including Sean O'Casey's ``Plough and
Stars'' at the Cherry Lane Theater. Joining the scene around the
White Horse Tavern, they became friendly with such authors as Dylan
Thomas, Delmore Schwartz and James Baldwin, and musicians such as
Woody Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, Patrick Clancy assembled Irish music for
Folkways Records and the early Elektra label. He started his own
label, Tradition, in 1956. His brother Liam arrived in the United
States that year, collecting Appalachian songs and also settling in
New York. The three brothers began singing Irish songs at parties
and quickly developing a local following.
</P>
<P>
   They were joined by another Irish expatriate, Tommy Makem, and
started recording for Tradition in 1959. They traveled the
folk-club circuit and performed at the Newport folk festivals. A
1961 appearance on ``The Ed Sullivan Show'' brought them a national
following.
</P>
<P>
   In concert, they wore Arran wool sweaters and sang rollicking
versions of rebel songs, drinking songs and love songs _ among them
``The Jug of Punch'' and ``Carrickfergus'' _ interspersed with tall
tales and poetry recitations. Columbia Records signed the group in
1961, and it eventually made about 40 albums.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Clancy returned to live in Carrick in 1964, and bought a
dairy farm. But he continued to perform frequently with his
brothers. After 1969, the group's lineup fluctuated, sometimes
including a fourth Clancy brother, Robert, and later a nephew,
Robbie O'Connell. Patrick Clancy gave his last performance in July
in Carrick.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary; his brothers Liam and Robert;
two sisters, Peg and Joan; five children, Leish, of Philadelphia;
Rory, of Carrick; Orla of the Netherlands; Maura, of Carlow,
Ireland, and Conor, of Dublin, and three grandchildren.

JUDGE WILL NOT EASE CONSTRAINTS ON EMBASSY BOMB SUSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: All names are CQ) 
(mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge has refused to lift the highly
restrictive jail conditions placed on three defendants arrested
after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Africa last August,
according to a court transcript made public Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Leonard Sand of U.S. District Court in Manhattan issued
his ruling after visiting the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
lower Manhattan on Tuesday, and making a personal inspection of the
secure unit where the three men have been held in virtual
isolation, with their communications to the outside world almost
entirely shut off.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the three men, arguing that the restrictions were
inhumane and unconstitutional, had asked Sand to lift them or at
least to grant their clients access to the jail's rooftop exercise
area and allow them to mingle with one other.
</P>
<P>
   But Sand, who had indicated earlier that he was concerned about
what he called ``the totality of all of these conditions,'' said he
had concluded after visiting the institution that the security
measures were legitimate, reasonable and taken in accord with due
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some of the precautions seem a little excessive, I think it
is because the objective is to accomplish something that is very
difficult to accomplish,'' Sand said, according to a transcript of
a hearing on Tuesday after his visit to the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not paranoia on the government's part,'' the judge
added, citing the federal government's desire to prevent the
defendants from communicating with people outside the jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a realization,'' Sand said, ``based on past experience,
that there is a risk that persons who have engaged in conduct which
the defendants have been accused of engaging in have communicated
to their cohorts messages which have been detrimental to the
security and well-being of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In isolating the defendants, the government moved under a rarely
used federal rule that allows prison officials to limit an inmate's
contacts to prevent ``acts of violence and terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have not said publicly what concerns they may have
about the defendants' potential involvement in such acts, but the
rule allows the government to impose restrictions when officials
believe that there is ``a substantial risk'' that an inmate's
communications ``could result in death or serious bodily injury.''
</P>
<P>
   The three men have been indicted along with several others,
including Osama bin Laden, who prosecutors suspect was the
mastermind behind the embassy attacks and who remains at large.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have said they are apprehensive about
potential acts of terrorism against Americans, particularly in
retaliation for the missile strikes that the United States launched
in August against bin Laden's camps in Afghanistan and a
pharmaceuticals plant in the Sudan, where officials suspected that
chemical weapons also were being manufactured.
</P>
<P>
   Sand agreed to a defense request to let the defendants call
their families three times a month each, instead of once a month.
</P>
<P>
   The three defendants include Mohammed Saddiq Odeh and Mohamed
Rashed Daoud al-'Owhali, who have each been charged with separate
counts of murder in the deaths of more than 200 people in the
attacks on the U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   They have also been charged, along with the third man, Wadih el
Hage, in a broader conspiracy to kill Americans overseas. All three
men have pleaded not guilty to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Odeh and al-'Owhali declined to comment on the
ruling, while el Hage's lawyer did not reply to a message left with
his office requesting a comment. Prosecutors also refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   The defense lawyers had argued in court Monday that the
restrictions should be lifted because they were causing
psychological damage to their clients and interfering with their
abilities to prepare their legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal prosecutor, Patrick Fitzgerald, argued against
removing the restrictions, including the one prohibiting the men
from the jail's roof.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the case of another suspected terrorist who, several
years ago, had tried, unsuccessfully, to escape from the roof.

BLACK OFFICERS SENT TO TROUBLED PRECINCT SUE CITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than a year after Police Commissioner Howard
Safir announced he would put more black officers into the Brooklyn
police precinct where prosecutors charge that a Haitian immigrant
was beaten and sodomized, two black sergeants who were transferred
there have filed a federal suit alleging that the move violated
their civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The multimillion-dollar suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan, says the sergeants, Philip Tai and John
Robertson, suffered emotional distress and embarrassment after
their involuntary transfer to the 70th Precinct in Flatbush in
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeants have not said they were mistreated by other
officers at the station house once they arrived there. Their
lawyer, Peter Blessinger, said the suit was filed because the
transfers were ordered solely because the sergeants are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other arenas, the police commissioner has said that race,
gender, religion and sexual orientation have no place in
assignments and transfers of police officers,'' he said. ``But
these sergeants were transferred based solely on race. If there's
nothing wrong with this, why not start transferring all the Jewish
officers to Williamsburg?''
</P>
<P>
   Blessinger said that several other black officers transferred
along with his clients to the 70th Precinct had filed similar
lawsuits against the city.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said that while
he could not comment on the specific suit, ``it is the police
commissioner's prerogative to transfer members of the service
according to the needs of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir publicly announced his intent to transfer black officers,
particularly Haitian-Americans, to the 70th Precinct on Aug. 19,
1997, after four white officers were charged with attacking Abner
Louima in a police car after his arrest in a street brawl on Aug.
9, 1997, and later beating and sodomizing him at the station house.
The officers are facing federal civil rights charges in U.S.
District Court in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said he would transfer at least 10 minority officers into
the precinct, which was then 74 percent white, a move lauded at the
time as an effort by the department to establish a better rapport
with the large Caribbean community in Flatbush.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference then, the commissioner said: ``I think we
need to move some more Haitian police officers into the seven-o who
can relate to that portion of the community that is Haitian. We
need to move some additional African-American police officers into
the seven-o.''
</P>
<P>
   Those statements may have given Tai and Robertson the hook they
needed to sue the city, said Lance Liebman, a professor of labor
law at Columbia University Law School, noting that the Supreme
Court has ruled that personnel decisions must be race-neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the police commissioner decides that white officers are
particularly good on Madison Avenue and assigns them there,'' he
said, ``and that black officers are better in other places, my
prediction is that the court will say that this is not
satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Noel Leader, a member of 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who
Care, an organization of black officers, said he thought it was
good that the Police Department recognized that more black officers
were needed in minority communities, but added, ``The problem is
that they need to increase the number of African-American officers
across the board instead of just moving them around.''

GUILTY PLEAS IN FRAUD AND PYRAMID SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Three officials of a small brokerage firm pleaded
guilty Wednesday to a securities fraud and pyramid scheme that
bilked more than 7,000 people of more than $120 million during a
10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   According to investigators, the three officials illegally sold
the municipal bonds and government securities of their clients and
kept the proceeds or used those bonds as collateral for personal
and commercial loans to benefit themselves and business ventures
that they had started.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they sold another type of security over and over
again in a pyramid scheme. These securities were backed by the
lease payments of government agencies on office equipment.
Officials illegally sold the same security several times, using the
proceeds of the most recent sales to make bogus interest payments
on the earlier sales, said Faith Hochberg, the U.S. attorney for
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money was used for major and minor purchases,
including a $21,000 backhoe, a new home, about $670,000 in men's
clothing for employees of the firm and $1 million payment to the
Resolution Trust Corp. for overcharges they made to the securities
account of the failed Elysian Federal Savings Bank in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The pleas involved officials of the the firm, First
Interregional Equity Corp., based in Millburn, and its subsidiary,
First Interregional Advisors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the officials' illegal activities became clear
after March 1997, when agents from the FBI and IRS and Security and
Exchange Commission officers, armed with search warrants, raided
its offices and interrupted efforts by the conspirators to close
down the company and shred documents that outlined their
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defendants lied to and stole from investors who were
family friends and elderly people, not nameless and faceless people
in the open market,'' Ms. Hochberg said. ``Every time they wanted
money for anything they stole it, and no customer was too close a
friend or too elderly.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials who pleaded guilty were the firm's president,
Richard Goettlich, 42, of Mendham, who is the son of Herbert
Goettlich, the founder of First Interregional Equity Corp.; Anthony
Gianninoto, 50, of Califon, who was the company's treasurer and
controller; and Eileen Laine, 46, of Millburn, who supervised the
firm's data processing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, before U.S. District Court Judge Maryanne Trump
Barry, the three admitted to securities fraud, income tax evasion,
money laundering and conspiracy charges that carry penalties of up
to 20 years in prison. Sentencing is set for March 22. Ms. Hochberg
said the investigation was continuing to determine whether any of
the firm's other employees were involved in the complicated
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   The First Interregional case, in its use of unregistered
securities backed by equipment leasing contracts that are sold
multiple times, mirrors an even larger alleged pyramid scheme
involving the defunct Bennett Group of Syracuse, N.Y. That case is
slated to go to trial next month in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District in Manhattan. That case, believed to be the
largest pyramid scheme in the country's history, is said to involve
more than $1 billion and 12,000 investors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As early as 1996, the SEC was investigating First Interregional,
said Andrew J. Geist, the associate regional director of the
agency, and they had been the object of fines and other sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the agency's on-premises examinations of First
Interregional in that year, according to court papers, Goettlich
had not only submitted false documentation but also bugged the
office and telephones being used by the examiners, all in an effort
to obstruct the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 5,400 people with claims against First Interregional
Equity Corp. for selling their securities have settled their
claims. But 1,750 people who had claims against First Interregional
Advisors Corp. for the leasing fraud have not seen any money yet.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harrison Goldin, the bankruptcy trustee for First
Interregional Advisors Corp., said many of the investors they had
heard from were ``small, unsophisticated investors'' who were
solicited for the pyramid leasing scheme because they had done some
business in government securities with the company.

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THE scholars rarely if ever mentioned Weeb Ewbank's name when they
called the roll of great pro football coaches. But Weeb, short and
round with a face like Edmund Gwenn in Miracle on 34th Street, had
as many moments of pure bliss as any of them.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, he coached the Baltimore Colts, and Johnny Unitas,
when they outlasted the Giants in 1958, in the first sudden-death
game ever played. He coached the New York Jets, and Joe Namath,
when they shocked the Colts, and everyone else, in the third and
most historic of all Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The coach with the oddly lyrical name was too modest and decent
to gloat when his Jets won 16-7 over the team that had fired him a
few years earlier. In fact, what he had was a kind of out-of-body
experience.
</P>
<P>
   An injured Unitas had come off the Baltimore bench in the second
half, and he was passing on every down as the final seconds ticked
away, in a futile effort to rally the Colts. And on the New York
sideline, a few writers who had gathered for the countdown saw
Ewbank cup his hands and yell across the field, and across the
years:
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, John, no interceptions now.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in time and space, Weeb wasn't aware that he was offering
encouragement to the quarterback of his former team, from an era
long gone.
</P>
<P>
   Weeb Ewbank died Tuesday, and it was a little odd to read the
accounts that said the cause of death was unknown. He was 91 and
had pushed the clock as far as it would go. He had retired from
coaching 25 years ago. In January, the Jets will celebrate the 30th
anniversary of their blockbuster Super Bowl win.
</P>
<P>
   Their coach made it to the Hall of Fame, even though his record
wouldn't impress you. He had one more victory than losses, 130 to
129, over 20 years. But he won championships in both leagues and
helped develop two of the great and distinctive quarterbacks the
game has known.
</P>
<P>
   Unitas was the classic model, with his crew cut and black
high-top shoes. Namath was a rebel in white sneakers, Broadway Joe,
with hair that was almost a national scandal, cascading down his
neck and over his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Joe and the Jets put the upstart AFL on equal footing with the
old guard, and paved the way for decades of incredible growth. They
were a raggedy bunch to have been the instruments of such change.
But they did it with Namath's showmanship and a cast of characters
that included 10 or 11 Texans, depending on how you counted them.
</P>
<P>
   The ``A'' list included John Elliott, Jim Hudson, Pete Lammons
and George Sauer, all of them ex-Longhorns. That group alone gave
the Jets a second identity: the University of Texas at Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were Don Maynard (Texas Western), Bake Turner (Texas
Tech), Curley Johnson (Houston), Winston Hill (Texas Southern),
Carl McAdams, who played at OU, and Sam Walton, no, not the one who
founded Wal-Mart. This Walton went to East Texas on a basketball
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott started out as a high jumper. Hill played tennis. And
those were the tackles.
</P>
<P>
   To Ewbank, Texans were larger than life, and faster. ``These
guys, these Texans,'' he would say, shaking his head. Maynard was
one of his favorites. Weeb called him ``The Human Crab,'' the kind
of guy ``who would kick in water,'' that being next to impossible
except for a really crabby guy.
</P>
<P>
   Maynard made it to the Hall of Fame as a wide receiver on legs a
sparrow would have rejected. ``Don told me he got hit on the leg
once,'' said Turner, ``and it swole up big as a broomstick.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Talamini qualified as Weeb's 11th Texan. The chunky
Kentuckian played eight years for the Oilers, was an All-Pro six
times and was traded when he asked to renegotiate his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank tossed all those personalities into the blender and came
up with a championship team, which is what great coaches do. He was
not a comic, but his easy nature kept his players loose _ not that
Namath needed much help. The Colts had lost only one game all year.
They had a terror at tackle, Bubba Smith, and a driven young coach,
Don Shula.
</P>
<P>
   The story that defined the '69 Super Bowl had to do with
Namath's boast that the Jets would win, when almost no one thought
they could. On the morning of the game, Ewbank attended church in
Miami. Of course, church is where most coaches go to repent. But
after the services, as he moved through the receiving line, Weeb
complimented the minister on his sermon. Then, on a whim, he asked
a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me, Reverend,'' he said, ``who do you think will win the
big football game this afternoon?''
</P>
<P>
   According to Weeb, the minister cast his eyes upward and held
out his arms. With a gentle smile he said, ``Whomsoever the Lord
nameth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought right then,'' claimed Ewbank, ``that our chances
were pretty good.''

 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr will insist in
the House impeachment hearings today that President Clinton used
the ``machinery of government'' to obstruct justice by covering up
his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   He will also argue that Clinton repeatedly threw up ``roadblocks
and hurdles'' that slowed the prosecutor's other investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But after recounting his allegations in the Lewinsky case, Starr
will disclose that he has found no evidence suggesting any
impeachable offenses in the FBI files controversy or the White
House travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
   He also will reveal that he had considered sending Congress an
impeachment referral in late 1997 on evidence that Clinton may have
known about an illegal government loan in the Whitewater land
development project that the the Clintons had invested in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drafted a report,'' he said in his testimony, released
Wednesday evening. ``But we concluded that it would be inconsistent
with the statutory standard (of impeachment) because of the
difficulty of establishing the truth with a sufficient degree of
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   As Starr's prepared testimony for the House Judiciary
Committee's first hearing was made public Wednesday night, Rep.
Henry Hyde, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, announced that
Republicans would supboena four new witnesses in the investigation
of Clinton amid signs that the committee majority is now seeking to
broaden the inquiry far beyond the Lewinsky matter to show a larger
pattern of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's appearance before the committee will provide the nation
its first opportunity to hear the controversial prosecutor explain
the conduct of his investigation, which began four years ago and
has cost $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   And the text he delivered to Capitol Hill on Wednesday night
indicated that he will offer a strong defense of his office,
despite Democratic efforts to portray it as a ``partisan witch
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence suggests that the president repeatedly tried to
thwart the legal process in the Jones case and the grand jury
investigation,'' the Starr statement says. ``That is not a private
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence futher suggests that the president, in the course
of these efforts, misused his authority and power as president and
contravened his duty to faithfully execute the laws. That, too, is
not a private matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House dismissed Starr's statement as a repeat of his
earlier impeachament referral ``in new wrapping paper.'' ``The only
new thing in the statement is on page 46 and 47 in which he
declares the president is innocent in the FBI files and travel
office matters,'' it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Republican committee members had hoped that Starr's appearance
today would reinvigorate an impeachment process that many say has
lost its steam.
</P>
<P>
   But with more than two-thirds of the America saying they have
had enough of the Lewinsky scandal, Republicans outside the
Judiciary panel are leery of pushing forward with the impeachment
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Hyde said his committee would take the inquiry
wherever ``the truth leads us'' and that his committee would ``talk
about anything that is credible and substantive'' including whether
Hubbell had accepted ``hush money'' in exchange for his silence.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said his committee would issue subpoenas for four new
witnesses to testify: Bruce Lindsey, a top presidential adviser and
longtime confidant of the president; Robert Bennett, the
president's personal attorney in the Paula Jones case; Daniel
Gecker, the former attorney for Kathleen Willey, a former White
House volunteer who claims the president made an unwanted sexual
advance on her in 1993; and Nathan Landow, a Maryland fund raiser
who committee investigators believe may have information about the
Willey case.
</P>
<P>
   The new witnesses were expected to be questioned first in
private depositions and the list may expand to include others.
Republicans would decide from the depositions whether to summon
them, or call additional witnesses, at public hearings. Gecker and
Landow could be called as early as next week, followed by Lindsey
and Bennett during the first week of December, GOP officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans also showed a renewed interest in campaign
fund-raising allegations against the president. Hyde asked the
Justice Department for a prosecutor's memo that provided a detailed
argument for appointing an independent counsel to take over the
criminal investigation of fund-raising abuses in the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is impeachment in search of a crime,'' said Jim Jordan,
the Democratic committee spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   The memo by Charles LaBella, former chief of the Justice
Department's campaign finance task force, contains grand jury
information which by law must be kept secret. But it is possible to
seek the release of the memo through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats viewed the new witnesses with suspicion and complained
that Hyde was attempting to violate attorney-client privilege by
seeking testimony from attorneys, not subjects of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extraordinary that the chairman has unilaterally made
null and void 200 years of American jurisprudential precedence,''
Jordan said. ``The Democrats will not sit idly by and allow Mr.
Starr to offer up allegations and conspiracy theories for which he
has offered no evidence to this committee. Nor will he be permitted
to accomplish through innuendo or character assassination what he
has failed to prove in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The hearing will open with statements from Hyde and Conyers,
followed by Starr's testimony. David Schippers, chief investigative
counsel, and his Democratic counterpoint, Abbe Lowell, will each be
given 30 minutes to address the committee. That will be followed by
questioning from members. The White House attorneys will be given
the final word, with 30 minutes to refute Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will attempt to show that the president tried to keep
Lewinsky on his team by helping her get a job in New York after
realizing that she could become an adverse witness against the
president. For example, Starr will discuss how Vernon Jordan, the
president's close friend and golfing partner, interceded on
Lewinsky's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, knowing that a witness had just signed a false
affidavit, encouraged his friend to continue trying to find her a
job,'' Starr's testimony states. The White House has disputed this
version of the job placement for silence scheme, pointing out that
Lewinsky has testified that no one promised her a job for her
silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``At bare minimum, the evidence suggests that the president's
job assistance stemmed from his desire to placate Ms. Lewinsky so
that she would not be tempted _ under the burden of an oath _ to
tell the truth about the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing other areas of his investigation, Starr noted that
``the pattern of obstruction of justice, false statements and
misuse of executive authority in the Lewinsky investigation did not
occur in a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over the investigation of the Whitewater land deal
in August 1994, Starr said he has essentially become the
independent counsel of four other investigations: the suicide-death
of presidential aide Vincent Foster; the firing of the White House
Travel Office; misuse of FBI files; and the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Starr details on Hubbell's involvement with a
failed savings in loan in Arkansas known as the Madison Guaranty
Savings and Loan. Hubbell, a former law partner of Hillary Rodham
Clinton, did work for the savings and loan in 1985 and 1986 when he
and Clinton worked at the Rose Law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Starr contends that Rose may have assisted Madison in legal work
on a land development known as Castle Grande. the deal was
structured to avoid state banking regulations and involved
violations of federal criminal law, Starr states.
</P>
<P>
   As the criminal investigation was beginning in 1994, Starr said,
Hubbell received payments totalling nearly $550,000 from several
companies and individuals, many of whom were wealthy campaign
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the $550,000 was given to Mr. Hubbell for little or no
work,'' Starr said. ``This rush of generosity obviously gives rise
to an inference that the money was essentially a gift. And if it
was a gift, why was it given? This money was given despite the fact
that Mr. Hubbell was under criminal investigation for fraudulent
billing and was a key witness in the Madison Guaranty
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending his office, Starr states that his investigation has
resulted in the conviction of 14 people, including Hubbell;
Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker and former Clinton business
partners Jim and Susan McDougal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In sum, this office has achieved a superb record in the courts
of law,'' stated Starr, who underlined the word law in an apparent
reference to the court of public opinion and spin doctors on
Capitol Hill. ``We go to court and not on the talk show circuit.
And our record shows that there is a bright line between courts and
polls. It leaves the polls to the politicians and spin doctors. We
are officers of the court who live in the world of law.''

 &HT;    Sequins, Escada and gossip capture snazzy crowd
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton and Richard Eldredge
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ These were, to say the least, Atlanta's heavy-hitters.
The 150 people who paid $600 a plate to attend a benefit dinner in
honor of author Tom Wolfe had one message for the man who lampoons
their like ``A Man in Full'' Essentially, they said: No hard
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd's attendance garnered a $90,000 donation toward the
refurbishment of the Margaret Mitchell House.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit-goers at the black tie affair _ including those
who've read some or all of ``A Man in Full'' _ were gracious hosts
to Wolfe, who says he's astounded at the feathers already ruffled.
They got all gussied up for their visitor from New York, they
laughed at his jokes, doted over his pretty wife (Sheila) and
toasted him roundly before the night was through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to a black-tie event in the middle of the week is not
one of my favorite pastimes,'' said CNN executive Pat Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, she made a mad dash home to change from her
business clothes into a beaded black jacket by Zelda and a black
skirt she'd purchased in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Outfits worn by the women attending ranged from the elaborate to
elegant, matronly to modern. Standouts include: Star 94 morning
radio personality Vicki Locke, who wore a black sequined pantsuit;
chief Mitchell House fund-raiser Mary Rose Taylor wore an Escada
ensemble consisting of a gray velvet brocade jacket with olive
overtones, olive silk slacks, a semi-sheer blouse and olive
Ferragamo shoes; Atlanta Magazine publisher Susie Love wore a black
crepe suit with silver piping; philanthropist Melita Hayes wore a
black velvet cloak trimmed in multi-colored frizz that she
purchased at a wearable art fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to wear something else, but I changed my mind at
the last minute,'' Hayes said. ``It's a pretty snazzy crowd we've
got here; especially for a weeknight.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of snazzy: Wolfe stayed true to form by wearing an
off-white, double-breasted, three-piece suit with spectator shoes
that matched his blue-and-white poplin shirt and silk handkerchief.
His wife wore a pale blue, fringed, skirted suit by Christian Dior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta is much more style-conscious than New York,'' observed
Wolfe, who deplores the sight of casually-dressed people in first
class airline seats. ``There's a little more propriety in dress
(here) than in New York, where all the barriers are down.''
</P>
<P>
   Although civility prevailed outwardly, some attendees were prone
to gossip amongst themselves at the lecture prior to the dinner.
Some of the comments overheard:
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I drove down to Charleston last weekend and we
read the book to each other as we went. We actually finished it. I
didn't know Charleston was such a drive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lunch with Wolfe and (developer) John Portman when he
was in town six years ago. After lunch, I was walking back with
John and he turns and says to me, 'I think I just met my match.'''
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``How far are you in the book? Answer: ``I read the
acknowledgements and had to take a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be me in the book. He's described me down to my
shoes. I have more hair though.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to love Georgia Tech football. I guess that alone was
worth giving him $30.''
</P>
<P>
   Man one: ``I'm 400 pages into it already. How far are you?'' Man
two: ``You're way ahead of me. Mine's back-ordered on Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he wrote two books and stuck them together with
Scotch tape. It's pretty impausible that a real estate developer
would also own a food company. Charlie Croker, Please! People like
that don't exisit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could skip 10 pages and not miss the flow.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense that Atlanta's real reaction to ``A Man in Full'' is
still in the offing was evoked by New York Times Atlanta bureau
chief Kevin Sack. Sack has been spending weeks shadowing Wolfe and
wondered how warmly he'd be received here. ``I don't think that the
city can judge whether it's an unkind portrayal or not until people
have had the chance to read the book.

EDITORIAL: THE REPUBLICAN LEADERS CAST OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS overline, 3rd graf, That institution ..., to recast
House's role) 
(af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Nov. 19: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first appearance of the new House Republican leaders
Wednesday suggested that the party has incorporated all the easy
parts of the message the public sent in the Nov. 3 elections.
``Teamwork'' and ``unity'' were the words of the day. There was no
mention of the social issues so dear to the hearts of the party's
right wing, and there were many nods to the importance of Social
Security and health care. Rep. Robert Livingston, who will be the
new speaker, announced that he regarded the party not as a ``big
tent'' but a ``big ship'' that keeps moving steadily on course even
when, on its decks, the crew is going in all different directions.
</P>
<P>
   We can be pretty sure the incoming speaker has not been wasting
his time at the movies. In the year of ``Titanic,'' not a lot of
new leaders describe themselves as captains of really big ships
that keep forging ahead in one direction. Actually, Livingston
extended the metaphor to point to a specific type of ship, the
aircraft carrier, as an example of teamwork under the guidance of
the Constitution. In that context it is a heartening sign that he
is ready to take charge in a chaotic situation that calls for
strong leadership in the House.
</P>
<P>
   That institution has certainly appeared rudderless lately, and
this is precisely the moment when, among all branches of
government, it has to provide direction. As the House Judiciary
Committee struggles with the nation's most pressing political
crisis, Chairman Henry Hyde has been floundering desperately,
lurching first one way and then the other, without any apparent
plan. The House has the constitutional burden of examining
President Clinton's conduct and recommending appropriate
punishment, and as speaker, Livingston has to see that the
judiciary committee does not run into the icebergs that Hyde &UR;  &LR; seems
not to notice.
</P>
<P>
   After the Republicans' leadership election, all the new officers
vowed to get behind the GOP ``agenda,'' but the makeup of the team
suggests that the Republicans have not figured out which way they
want to go. Dick Armey, a symbol of the surly approach that
Livingston wants to leave behind, survived a serious challenge to
keep his job as House majority leader. Another tough guy, Tom
DeLay, who was unchallenged in re-election as majority whip, was
the point man for former Speaker Newt Gingrich's assault on party
reformers on the campaign finance issue.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest news came when J.C. Watts of Oklahoma became the
first black Republican elected to a leadership role in modern
times. Watts' strong ties to the social conservatives and his
personal popularity helped win him the fourth spot, party
conference chairman. But if the Republicans were also sending a
message of inclusion, it was a commendable impulse both in terms of
policy and politics. Watts is the only black Republican in the
House, and overwhelming black support for Democratic candidates was
a main reason for key Republican losses in the election. Given the
choice between writing the black vote off or trying to win it, the
party made the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   Watts' new job involves communicating the party's message, and
his well-known talents as a public speaker should serve the party
well. But first, somebody is going to have to give him a message to
deliver.
