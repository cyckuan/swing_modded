<HEADLINE> Agreement on African Diamond Ban  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council imposed a diamond ban
Wednesday on Sierra Leone's rebels in a bid to strangle their
ability to finance a civil war that has already cost the lives of
tens of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   The embargo is for an initial 18 months. The council could
decide to extend it if the government hasn't reasserted its
authority over Sierra Leone's diamond mines, 90 percent of which
remain in rebel hands.
</P>
<P>
   Mali abstained from the vote, saying it opposed the resolution's
reference to illegal diamonds being shipped through Liberia. Mali's
U.N. ambassador, Moctar Ouane, said the reference was
''unacceptable'' because West African nations have not completed an
investigation into the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But Sierra Leone's U.N. ambassador, Ibrahim Kamara, hailed the
council's willingness to name names and to acknowledge that Sierra
Leone's war wasn't about ideology or tribal differences but rather
about diamonds and people trying to make illegal profit off them.
</P>
<P>
   ''At last, the Security Council has come to realize that the war
in Sierra Leone is cast in gemstones,'' Kamara told the council.
</P>
<P>
   Britain sponsored the resolution as a way to reign in rebels of
the Revolutionary United Front, who restarted Sierra Leone's civil
war in May by taking 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   The diamond embargo makes it illegal to buy Sierra Leone
diamonds, except those that have a certificate of origin from the
government. Since there is no certification process yet in place,
the ban would initially cover all diamond sales.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based organization Global Witness reported in October
that rebels earned $200 million a year from 1991 to 1999 in illicit
diamond sales.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have begun a system which will immediately make it more
expensive and more difficult for the traders to deal in conflict
diamonds -- some people call them blood diamonds -- from Sierra
Leone,'' British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the embargo would be followed up with other resolutions
on prosecuting Sankoh and other rebel members -- perhaps even with
an international tribunal -- and strengthening the U.N. peacekeeping
mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The council vote, he said, would ''give people hope in Sierra
Leone that the world is actually taking some action that is going
to mean a bit of peace and prosperity for them in I hope the not
too distant future.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's vote had been held up by disputes over whether to
set a time limit for the diamond embargo and whether to name
Liberia as a transit point for illicit diamond sales.
</P>
<P>
   France had pressed for a time limit, while the United States and
Britain initially sought an open-ended ban.
</P>
<P>
   The United States voted for the resolution, but Deputy U.S.
Ambassador Nancy Soderberg said Washington did so with a
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States strongly believes that sanctions, to have
meaning and force, must be tied to a change in the behavior that
prompts imposition of sanctions in the first place -- not an
arbitrary date on the calendar,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution expresses concern at reports that diamonds were
being shipped through Liberian ''territory'' -- a softening of the
original draft which referred more directly to the Liberian
government.
</P>
<P>
   Council members were warned Friday by Oluyemi Adeniji, the top
U.N. envoy in Sierra Leone, against naming Liberia as a conduit for
the diamonds because the country's president, Charles Taylor, is
trying to free 222 U.N. peacekeepers from India and 11 unarmed U.N.
observers still surrounded by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is Sankoh's closest ally and west African governments and
the United Nations relied on him to negotiate freedom for some 500
U.N. peacekeepers held hostage in Sierra Leone for several weeks by
the rebels in May.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the diamond ban, the resolution calls for an
exploratory hearing to be held in New York to assess the role that
diamonds have played in the Sierra Leone conflict. And it calls for
a panel of experts to examine the link between the sale of diamonds
and the purchase of arms in Sierra Leone.

<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A shy, but joyful Elian Gonzalez was seen riding his bicycle
in his hometown and splashing in a pool at a nearby resort as state television
Wednesday night aired some of the first images of the boy since his return to
Cuba a week ago. With soft music playing in the background, the video clips
chronicled part of the surprise visit Elian and his family made Tuesday
afternoon to Cardenas, where the child was born and raised. On the streets of
the small port city, scores of residents cheered as a bus carrying the family
drove by.

Canada Law Allows Spanking of Kids
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Parents and teachers can spank children under Canadian law,
but the issue should be reviewed because public attitudes have changed, a judge
ruled Wednesday. The decision by Ontario Superior Court Judge David McCombs
rejected a challenge by child advocacy groups of the law that they said violated
the constitutional rights of children. Section 43 of the Criminal Code says
''every school teacher, parent or person standing in place of a parent is
justified in using force by way of correction ... if force does not exceed what
is reasonable.''

Israeli Parties Vow To Leave Govt.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Two parties in Ehud Barak's ruling coalition Wednesday said
they would leave his government ahead of a U.S.-hosted peace summit, possibly
depriving the prime minister of the broad consensus he says he needs to make
peace. Natan Sharansky's immigrants party and the National Religious Party
indicated that they cannot remain in government with Barak appearing ready to
make land concessions to the Palestinians that are too broad. Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in a summit with President Clinton in
the United States next week to try to reach a peace accord.

NH Justice's Impeachment Recommended

   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Lawmakers recommended impeaching the state's highest
judge today, saying he lied under oath to hinder their investigation of the
Supreme Court. After six hours of debate, the House Judiciary Committee voted
that there was enough evidence that Chief Justice David Brock may have perjured
himself to warrant sending the matter to the Senate for trial. ''There seems to
be a pattern here of deception. It may be over small things, but some of these
small things contributed to obstruction of justice,'' said Rep. Benjamin
DePecol.

Audit: Taxpayers Overpaid $25M
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of taxpayers overpaid $25 million in income
taxes that should have been credited to their accounts or refunded by the
Internal Revenue Service, according to an independent audit that cites computer
problems as the main culprit. Thousands more individuals, families and
businesses forfeited their rights to refunds or credits, or were at risk of
doing so, that totaled $335 million. These taxpayers failed to file late tax
returns in time for legal deadlines to qualify for the money. The IRS says it
has returned or credited the money owed.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 5, Brewers 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP)-- Mike Lieberthal hit a three-run home run and
Randy Wolf allowed one run in seven innings as the Philadelphia
Phillies extended their winning streak to a season-high five games
with a 5-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal's 13th homer capped a four-run fifth inning off
starter Jamey Wright (4-2).
</P>
<P>
   Ron Gant, Bobby Abreu and Scott Rolen opened the fifth with
consecutive singles before Lieberthal lined a 3-2 pitch 407 feet to
center.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf (8-5) allowed five hits, struck out seven and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Wright gave up four runs on eight hits in four-plus innings.
Wright won three times in four previous starts since his last loss
on June 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers made it 4-1 in the seventh on singles by Marquis
Grissom and Charlie Hayes, and Geoff Jenkins' sacrifice fly.
Milwaukee added a run in the eighth on Mark Sweeney's pinch-hit
double and Luis Lopez's single.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia extended the lead to 5-2 in the ninth off David
Weathers on Lieberthal's one-out single and three consecutive
walks. With two outs and a runner on second, Wayne Gomes loaded the
bases before getting pinch-hitter Tyler Houston to fly to the
warning track in center for his seventh save in 11 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Desi Relaford's baserunning mistake cost the Phillies a run in
the second. With two outs and runners on first and second, Wolf
singled to center. Lieberthal would have scored easily from second,
but Relaford went too far rounding second. Center fielder Marquis
Grissom threw behind Relaford, who was tagged out before Lieberthal
crossed the plate.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Rolen extended his hitting streak to 13 games. ... Wright's
outing was his shortest of the season in nine starts. He pitched
into the eighth inning in each of his four previous starts. ... The
Phillies clinched their sixth straight series victory. The last
time they won five or more consecutive series was in 1995, when
they won 10 straight. ... The last time Philadelphia won five
consecutive games was May 4-9 last season.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer admits telling judge and FBI that bogus death threat was real </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A defense lawyer from Rhode Island admits he
knew a death threat he got was phony when he reported it to a
federal judge and FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had charged that the lawyer, John B. Webster,
obstructed justice by inventing the death threat against himself to
get favorable treatment for a client on trial here.
</P>
<P>
   That charge, and three others in an April indictment are to be
dropped in return for Webster's guilty plea Wednesday to a single
count of making a false statement.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Webster's client, Victor P. Samaha, and a friend of
Samaha's, Vincent Mansolillo, admitted roles in the scheme and
agreed to testify against Webster. Both are from Warwick, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Webster, 40, of Coventry, R.I., whose practice is in Warwick, is
likely to be disbarred, said his lawyer, John D. Arseneault and
Rhode Island authorities. Arseneault said they will fight to keep
his license.
</P>
<P>
   Webster faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to
$250,000 when sentenced Sept. 26 by U.S. District Judge Alfred J.
Lechner Jr. The actual term is likely to be less than two years,
without parole, under sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious charge in the indictment was the obstruction
charge, which carries up to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stemmed from Samaha's trial last year, in which
Samaha was convicted Nov. 11 of stock fraud along with another
former broker at L.C. Wegard &AMP; Co. Fourteen other brokers had
already pleaded guilty to related charges of using ''boiler room''
tactics to push low-cost, high-risk stocks on unsuspecting buyers.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal authorities have asserted for years that
Wegard was one of two now-shuttered brokerages secretly controlled
by disgraced penny-stock tycoon Robert E. Brennan after he closed
his flagship operation, First Jersey Securities Inc. in the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan, formerly of Brielle, N.J., and now living in Juno
Beach, Fla., settled a lawsuit brought by New Jersey last year by
agreeing to pay $45 million to compensate investors.
</P>
<P>
   He denied wrongdoing but consented to a finding that he used
''substantial influence'' at the two brokerages to make
''unreasonably excessive profits'' in low-cost, high-risk stocks in
which he held an undisclosed interest from 1988-95.
</P>
<P>
   During Samaha's trial, Webster raised a defense that Brennan and
others - not Samaha - were behind a scheme to cheat Wegard
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors objected, claiming it was irrelevant, and U.S.
District Judge William G. Bassler issued a tentative ruling in
their favor, but asked both sides for legal briefs on the relevance
of the ''Brennan Conspiracy'' theory.
</P>
<P>
   While the issue was pending, a story describing the objection
appeared in The Star-Ledger of Newark on Oct. 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Webster admitted that he and Samaha that night discussed a
scenario in which someone would threaten the lawyer in an effort to
convince Bassler to admit evidence of the conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, this message was recorded on Webster's cell
phone voice mail: ''Webster, you mention Robert Brennan's name in
court again, you're not going to make it home from New York
alive,'' he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   He reported it that night to federal prosecutors and the FBI but
learned the next morning from Samaha that the call was bogus,
Arseneault said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Webster went to court and met with Bassler, and
later played the message for FBI agents, he admitted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that Samaha had arranged the threat,'' Webster said.
</P>
<P>
   Webster declined to speak outside court.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the scenario discussed with Samaha, Arseneault said
''perhaps (Webster) should have been more vociferous in opposing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mansolillo admitted he had somebody make the threatening call,
telling a judge that he had Stephen Cloutier make the call from
Providence, R.I. Cloutier has not been charged. Samaha admitted
conspiring to obstruct justice. They await sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Webster was admitted to the Rhode Island bar in 1987. He was
admitted to the Ohio bar in 1984, but said that license is
inactive.

<HEADLINE> Newhouse family buys four dailies in N.J. and Pa.  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The Newhouse family, which publishes the
state's largest newspaper, expanded its presence in New Jersey with
the purchase of three daily newspapers and a Pennsylvania paper
with a strong New Jersey readership.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Jersey Advance Inc., a subsidiary of Newhouse's Advance
Publications, bought The Gloucester County Times in Woodbury,
Today's Sunbeam in Salem, the Bridgeton Evening News and the
Express-Times in Easton, Pa., from MediaNews Group Inc. of Denver.
It also purchased a group of 40 weekly newspapers in both states.
</P>
<P>
   The companies did not disclose the purchase price in their
announcement Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, which took place June 30, gives Newhouse six of New
Jersey's 18 daily newspapers and gives it a presence in the
suburban Philadelphia market. In addition to the Star-Ledger, the
state's largest newspaper, New York-based Advance owns The Jersey
Journal in Jersey City and The Times of Trenton. Approximately 40
percent of the Easton newspaper's daily circulation of 50,641 also
comes from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The sale follows other recent consolidation of newspaper
ownership. In the past 2 1/2 years Gannett Co. Inc., of Arlington,
Va., purchased four papers, including Asbury Park Press of Neptune,
to give it a total of seven New Jersey newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The companies together account for more than 70 percent of the
state's daily newspaper circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Advance, led by the Star-Ledger's daily circulation of 407,129,
now accounts for a combined daily circulation of 577,883 in New
Jersey. The combined circulation of Gannett's newspapers is
443,551, according to figures published in the latest edition of
Editor &AMP; Publisher Yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   MediaNews Group also sold newspaper operations in New Jersey and
Pennsylvania to Advance. Those holdings include a group of 40
weeklies with a combined circulation of 548,178 published in Union,
Somerset, Warren and Hunterdon counties in New Jersey plus
Northampton and Lehigh counties in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ''While this transaction was one of the most difficult decisions
MediaNews Group has ever made, we believe these newspapers will fit
much better with Advance than MediaNews,'' said president and CEO
William Dean Singleton. ''The Newhouse family is New Jersey's
largest newspaper publisher and the critical mass they bring to
these newspapers will add much value to the newspapers, their
readers, advertisers and employees.''
</P>
<P>
   MediaNews said it would use proceeds of the sales in markets
that had a better strategic fit. The nation's seventh-largest
newspaper company, MediaNews publishes 47 daily newspapers and 83
non-daily publications in 12 states, with a circulation of about 2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Advance is proud to acquire a group of outstanding newspapers
in fine markets that we know well,'' said Donald E. Newhouse,
president of Advance Publications. ''We admire Dean Singleton's
vision and leadership in building these publications, and
developing impressive teams to run them successfully. We plan to
continue his focus on serving the newspapers' readers and
advertisers and their communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Advance Publications is the nation's third largest newspaper
company with a combined circulation of 3 million and holdings that
include The Plain Dealer of Cleveland, the Portland (Ore.)
Oregonian and Conde Nast magazines, including the New Yorker,
Vanity Fair and Gourmet. Advance publishes 23 daily newspapers and
32 nondaily newspapers.

<HEADLINE> Fighter claims that leaving King delayed his shot at IBF title  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - When rising light heavyweight William
Guthrie signed on with Don King in December 1995, the promoter
promised him a title shot within a month, the fighter testified.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie quickly became the No. 1 contender, but never got a
title shot during his 14 months with King. He said Wednesday that
his title shot was further delayed when he quit King.
</P>
<P>
   During their final meeting, King ensured that Guthrie knew the
consequences by telephoning IBF founder Robert W. Lee, who told
Guthrie the bout ''would be pushed to the side'' amid any
litigation with King, the St. Louis fighter told a federal jury at
Lee's racketeering trial.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors accuse Lee and other IBF officials of taking
$338,000 in a span of more than a decade in exchange for favors and
rigged rankings.
</P>
<P>
   King, who prosecutors call an unindicted coconspirator, was the
prime beneficiary of Lee's manipulations, they maintain.
</P>
<P>
   King promised him a match with then-WBA champion Virgil Hill,
but the fight turned out to be against Tim Hillie, which Guthrie
won in 10 rounds, the fighter said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, King only paid him half of the $20,000 minimum specified
for victories, Guthrie said.
</P>
<P>
   He won his next three fights, but also got just half what his
contract called for, said Guthrie, the second fighter to testify
since Lee's trial began in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled confronting King about the money at a Las Vegas
boxing show. King, using his nickname for Guthrie, put him off.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'Don't worry about it, Chocolate,''' said Guthrie,
eliciting chuckles from the jury by booming an imitation of King
into the witness box microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he made me,'' testified Guthrie, who said he won his
first title at age 4, the diaperweight Golden Gloves. ''I've been
fighting before I met him. I didn't know him from a can of paint.''
</P>
<P>
   By January 1997, Hill had added the IBF belt, and despite being
the mandatory challenger, Guthrie said he had no bout in sight.
Guthrie went to King's home in Florida to tell the sport's biggest
promoter they were through, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Guthrie's presence, King called Lee on speakerphone. Again
imitating King, Guthrie said the promoter told Lee, ''I did all
this (expletive) work for this kid and he's not leaving me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee remained calm and a gentleman during the call, but told
Guthrie, ''You definitely are the man up for the title shot, but if
this stuff gets caught up in legal stuff and court you would be
pushed to the side,'' the boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie signed four days later with promoter Dan Goossen of
America Presents, and the next month got a letter from the IBF
informing him that Hill would be permitted an optional defense
against another fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie said he sued and won a court order that he should fight
for the IBF title.
</P>
<P>
   Hill lost the IBF and WBA belts to WBO champion Dariusz
Michalczewski in June 1997. The Polish-born German relinquished the
IBF belt rather than fight Guthrie, who won it in July 1997 by
knocking out No. 2 Darin Allen in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie, 33, said he is now 26-2 and fights as a cruiserweight,
which has a 190 pound maximum, compared to 175 pounds as a light
heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is unsure if any of the sanctioning groups rank him.
Asked if rankings are important, he said: ''They are, if I want to
be champion. But at the same time, people can make phone calls and
they're rated.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of three major sanctioning bodies for boxing in the
world, the IBF rankings and decisions play a large role in the
purses earned by boxers, of which managers and promoters get a cut.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Fritz, a spokesman for Don King Productions in Deerfield
Beach, Fla., said their policy is not to discuss the details of
contracts, but that, ''Don King sticks to every detail in the
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't influence any of the ratings committees as to whether
a guy has a title shot or not,'' Fritz said. ''We don't have any
influence on any of the governing bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   King has maintained his payments to sanctioning groups were all
legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   Four other big-time promoters have testified against Lee, and
all said payoffs were required to do business with the East Orange,
N.J.-based IBF.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 66, of Fanwood, N.J., and his son, Robert Jr., 38, of
Scotch Plains, N.J., are the only defendants on trial. They face
multiyear prison terms if convicted of conspiracy, racketeering,
fraud and tax charges.
</P>
<P>
   Former IBF championship committee chairman Bill Brennan, 86, of
Warsaw, Va., past president of the U.S. Boxing Association, a group
that became the IBF, was severed from the trial because of ill
health.
</P>
<P>
   The IBF's South American representative, Francisco ''Pacho''
Fernandez of Colombia, remains at large.

colliding on a play at first base during the Devil Rays' 4-1
victory over the Tigers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Smith hit a sharp grounder that third baseman Dean Palmer dove
to stop before scrambling to his feet and throwing to first where
Fick -- by that time straddling the bag -- caught the ball on one hop
as Smith toppled over him.
</P>
<P>
   Both players went down, but left the field on their own power.
Smith was credited with an RBI single that tied the game 1-1 in the
third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just lost the bag. I was watching Dean,'' Fick said. ''I was
kind of shocked ... I knew something was wrong from the way my neck
felt. I couldn't throw the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who sprained the medial collateral ligament in his right
knee, was hitting .311 with three homers and 14 RBIs in 20 games
since being called up from Triple-A Durham.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can never predict anything,'' Devil Rays manager Larry
Rothschild said. ''He gets his chance, takes advantage of it and
then this happens. It's just one of those things that you go
through. He has been through enough this year and hopefully he
comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Fick, batting .250 with two homers and 18 RBIs in 50 games,
separated his right shoulder. He spent time on the disabled list
last year with a left shoulder strain.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 12, Astros 9  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Luis Gonzalez went on the Tour de Enron, becoming
the first player on the Arizona Diamondbacks to hit for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez doubled in the first inning, singled in the third,
tripled in the eighth and homered off Doug Henry in the ninth
Wednesday night as the Diamondbacks rallied past the Houston Astros
12-9.
</P>
<P>
   He became the first player to hit for the cycle in Houston's new
Enron field, which opened this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who went 4-for-6, became the fifth player to hit for
the cycle this season, the 126th in NL history and 229th in the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Mike Lansing (June 10 vs. Arizona), the Chicago White
Sox's Jose Valentin (April 27 vs. Baltimore), Pittsburgh's Jason
Kendall (May 19 vs. St. Louis) and Oakland's Eric Chavez (June 21
vs. Baltimore) also accomplished the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Lee, Steve Finley and Damian Miller had three hits each
for Arizona, which outhit the Astros 16-10. Tony Womack went
2-for-5 and drove in the go-ahead run during a four-run seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Houston led 8-4 before Womack's RBI single in the sixth off
All-Star Shane Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona then went ahead in the seventh on Lee's RBI double and
Craig Counsell's run-scoring single off Jose Cabrera, and Danny
Bautista's RBI grounder and Womack's go-ahead single off Marc
Valdes (1-2).
</P>
<P>
   Arizona made it 11-8 in the eighth off Valdes on Lee's RBI
grounder and Miller's run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou, who went 3-for-5 with four RBIs, had a run-scoring
single in the ninth off Byung-Hyun Kim, who got his 14th save in 16
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Astros starter Shane Reynolds, selected for his first All-Star
game, allowed five runs and nine hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Nelson Figueroa, making his second major league start,
allowed six runs and four hits in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Valdes (1-2) pitched 1 1-3 innings for the loss, allowing
three runs -- two earned -- on three hits and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   Finley put the Diamondbacks ahead with an RBI single in the
first, but Lance Berkman hit a two-run homer in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's homer tied it in the second, and Arizona went ahead 4-2
in the third on Lee's RBI single on Gonzalez's run-scoring
grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Alou hit a three-run homer and Craig Biggio singled home a run
as Houston took a 6-4 lead in the third. Berkman hit an RBI double
in the fifth and scored on a throwing error by Miller, whose throw
from the plate to second rolled to the left-center field wall for
an error.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bill Spiers leads the Astros with seven pinch hits and is
hitting .318 (7-for-22) as a pinch hitter. ... Miller's homer gave
him a career-high eight-game hitting streak.

<HEADLINE> Orlando Magic Courts Tracy McGrady  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- With Grant Hill seemingly a lock and Tim
Duncan weighing his options, the Orlando Magic courted free agent
forward Tracy McGrady on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And they must have liked McGrady's response.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic are working on a sign-and-trade deal to add McGrady,
who played for Toronto, to a team that could include Hill, who
played with Detroit, and Duncan, who played with San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once Grant and I get here, this will definitely be the city,''
McGrady told The Orlando Sentinel. ''The East is locked up. If
Duncan comes here, it will be scary.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only the (Los Angeles) Lakers will be out West. Imagine those
matchups? It will be unfair to the league if all three of us come
here. We'll have the East. We'll be playing the Lakers for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill seems poised to leave the Pistons and sign with the Magic
for a six-year deal worth $67.5 million, with a first-year salary
of $9 million. He is scheduled to meet with Pistons president Joe
Dumars on Thursday, but Hill has told friends he's heading to
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ''If what I'm reading is true, yeah, it will be a big
disappointment,'' Dumars said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Hill, Duncan and McGrady could sign for $67.5 million in
Orlando or $86 million with their respective teams. Duncan still is
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   As for McGrady?
</P>
<P>
   ''Money is not an issue. It's all about being happy and
comfortable,'' McGrady said. ''I don't care how much I make, $67
million or $86 million. You can't spend it all anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   One scenario to get all three would involve a sign-and-trade.
The Magic could sign free agent guard Ron Mercer, and then trade
him along with several first-round draft choices and cash to the
Raptors for McGrady.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, McGrady said he won't go back to Toronto, where
he averaged 15 points and six rebounds in his third NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   McGrady said he will make a courtesy visit to the Chicago Bulls
on Friday and throw out a ceremonial first pitch for a White
Sox-Cubs game on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Frankly, it's just out of respect,'' McGrady said of the
upcoming visit. ''They wanted me before I came into this league.''
</P>
<P>
   But now he wants to be in Orlando -- preferably with Hill and
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very comfortable here,'' he said. ''I'll take a couple
of days after the Chicago visit and then tell my agent the real
deal. My No. 1 choice is Orlando.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Child Protection Deal  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Complaining that children as young as 5
are being forced to fight in wars from Africa to Latin America,
President Clinton signed an international agreement Wednesday to
ban the forcible recruitment of youths as soldiers in armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   He also signed a companion accord to protect children from being
forced into slavery, prostitution and pornography.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day, thousands of children are killed and brutalized in
fighting wars that adults decided they should fight in,'' the
president said. ''Every day around the world and even here in the
United States, children are sold into virtual slavery or traffic
for the worse forms of sexual abuse.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed the agreements during a brief visit to the United
Nations and used the occasion to mention his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the first lady has been an important advocate
for children. ''This morning, she reminded me that I should say
again, there is no worse sin in life than sending a child to kill
the people who gave him life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Wednesday, the president was speaking at a gala for a
museum housed in the USS Intrepid, a highly decorated World War II
era aircraft carrier now retired from service and permanently
berthed at Pier 86 on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   He asked the black-tie audience for their prayers and support
for the Camp David summit between Israeli and Palestinian leaders
as they ''come here to try to end an old conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reminded the audience that the United States will have
to undetake a major financial effort to support any agreement
that's reached.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are willing to make the sacrifices for peace, then the
United States must lead the way in helping to make the investments
necessary to insure that the peace has a positive impact in
ordinary people's lives,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   The two child protection agreements are protocols to an umbrella
convention on children's rights. Since its adoption in 1989, the
Convention on the Rights of the Child has been ratified by 191
nations and is the most widely accepted treaty in the history of
the United Nations, with only two holdouts -- the United States and
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States signed the convention in 1995, but has not
ratified it because of congressional concerns that the treaty may
infringe on the role of parents and impose a particular educational
curriculum. The two protocols that Clinton signed Wednesday are
stand-alone agreements he will ask the Senate to ratify this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the agreements ''represent a worldwide consensus on
basic values; values every citizen of our country shares.''
</P>
<P>
   ''In Sierra Leone, today, as many as half the rebel forces are
under 18 -- some as young as 5 or 6,'' the president said. ''In
Colombia, guerrillas have taken thousands of children from their
villages to serve as soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   The umbrella convention is a binding human rights treaty that
spells out for the first time that children have the right to
education and health care, and to be free from economic and sexual
exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   It also introduces the notion that children have the right to
participate in decisions that affect their lives, said Marjorie
Newman-Williams of the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol on child soldiers provides that no one under age 18
should be allowed to fight and says governments should not permit
compulsory recruitment of anyone under 18. The protocol would raise
the age of voluntary recruitment of soldiers from 15 to 16 and says
insurgency groups can neither recruit nor deploy people younger
than 18.
</P>
<P>
   The United States was the eighth signatory of the protocol,
joining Argentina, Cambodia, Canada, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and
Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol on the sale of children, child prostitution and
child pornography calls for criminalizing the offense of
trafficking and for cross-border cooperation between sending and
receiving countries.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol also is expected to serve as a global framework to
standardize national legislation banning the sale of children for
sexual exploitation, for illegal adoption or for use of their
organs.
</P>
<P>
   The child pornography and prostitution industry is
conservatively valued at $4 billion. U.N. estimates indicate that 1
million children in Asia alone are victims of sexual exploitation,
with tens of millions more falling prey to other abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The United States becomes the sixth signatory, joining Cambodia,
Chile, Monaco, Norway and San Marino.
</P>
<P>
   Both protocols takes effect three months after being ratified by
10 countries.

<HEADLINE> NH Justice's Impeachment Recommended  </HEADLINE>
By GENE JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Lawmakers recommended impeaching the
state's highest judge Wednesday, saying he lied under oath to
hinder their investigation of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   After six hours of debate, the House Judiciary Committee voted
17-5 that there was enough evidence that Chief Justice David Brock
may have perjured himself to warrant sending the matter to the
Senate for trial. The House will vote on the issue next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''There seems to be a pattern here of deception. It may be over
small things, but some of these small things contributed to
obstruction of justice,'' said Rep. Benjamin DePecol.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also endorsed two other articles of impeachment
alleging that Brock called a lower-court judge in 1987 in a case
involving a powerful state senator, something Brock has denied, and
that he solicited comments from a fellow justice about that
justice's divorce case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers recommended Brock be given full retirement
benefits if he resigns before a Senate trial if the House votes to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   Brock's lawyer, David Barry, said Wednesday that the committee
had lowered the threshold for impeachment too far. Historically, he
said, officials have been impeached for willful misconduct, not
poor judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''An impeachment of the chief justice based on the evidence
found will stand out as a historical aberration,'' Barry said.
''It's been a frustrating day.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time a New Hampshire Supreme Court justice was
impeached was in 1790. That judge, Woodbury Langdon, described as
''arbitrary and haughty,'' resigned before his Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   Two other articles of impeachment against Brock, one accusing
him of letting disqualified justices take part in case
deliberations and the other saying the sum of his actions warranted
impeachment, both failed.
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended earlier Wednesday that two other
Supreme Court justices accused of ethics violations, Sherman Horton
and John Broderick, be neither impeached nor reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of the Supreme Court began in April, after
Attorney General Philip McLaughlin accused former Justice Stephen
Thayer of trying to influence the appointment of an appeals panel
in his own divorce case. While investigating Thayer, he came across
ethics violations by the rest of the court.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony before the committee last month, Brock apologized
for poor judgment but said he meant no harm. He said he knew
immediately that Thayer, who resigned over the allegations, had
acted inappropriately, and he believed he was reacting to a
sensitive situation in the best possible way.
</P>
<P>
   Disclosure of Thayer's intervention prompted a group of ex-wives
of other New Hampshire judges to threaten a lawsuit in April. The
women argue they were unable to get competent lawyers or decent
divorce settlements because of their husbands' influence.
</P>
<P>
   Justices are nominated by the governor and confirmed by the
state Executive Council, an elected body that reviews nominations
and contracts. Justices serve until they reach the mandatory
retirement age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   That was an issue for some committee members in clearing Horton,
who is nearing retirement. Other lawmakers said they trusted
Broderick, to work to reform the court.
</P>
<P>
   Both judges were accused of initially failing to blow the
whistle on Thayer and of participating in cases they were
disqualified from. They said their comments in such cases were
limited to grammar, writing style and sometimes the scope of an
opinion -- but not the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you boil it all down, for me, the thing you would condemn
Justice Horton for is being a human being, and we need those on the
court,'' Rep. Andrew Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick had said he hesitated about reporting Thayer because
he was concerned about the turmoil in Thayer's personal and
professional life.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Airs First Images of Elian  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- A shy, but joyful Elian Gonzalez was seen riding
his bicycle in his hometown and splashing in a pool at a nearby
resort as state television Wednesday night aired some of the first
images of the boy since his return to Cuba a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   With soft music playing in the background, the video clips
chronicled part of the surprise visit Elian and his family made
Tuesday afternoon to Cardenas, where the child was born and raised.
On the streets of the small port city, scores of residents cheered
as a bus carrying the family drove by.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old was shown curiously rummaging through his clothes
and toys at the homes of his paternal and maternal grandparents. He
looked thrilled to find a pair of inline skates, which he tried on
over his bare feet and skated a bit down a hallway.
</P>
<P>
   At his school, Elian was greeted by his classmates, and a
teacher leaned down to show him pictures and something written in a
book.
</P>
<P>
   The clips were shown shortly before Elian's father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, received one of Cuba's top civilian awards for his
''heroic behavior' during his fight to bring his son Elian back to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had tears in his eyes when President Fidel Castro
pinned the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes medal to his dark suit after a
two-hour ceremony at the Karl Marx theater, attended by about 5,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''I owe this to all the people of Cuba,'' Gonzalez said,
following a standing ovation by the thousands in attendance,
including top government officials and the Communist Party
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not done anything out of this world,'' he said. ''I
have done what any other father would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Directly addressing Gonzalez, Castro said: ''You showed that in
the decisive moments in the history of a country, the conduct of a
man can overcome all of the traitors put together, just as those
who tried to cheapen your child.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our most important revolutionary duty is to fight to make sure
that this does not happen again,'' Castro said. ''We will keep
fighting. And we will conquer!''
</P>
<P>
   Beforehand, Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly and Gonzalez's main government adviser during the fight
for his son, read a resolution by Cuba's ruling Council of State.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Miguel Gonzalez stoically endured the most cruel
suffering of his son, of himself and of his family,'' it said.
''Resisted with his entire being the threats, the pressures and the
slanders and rejected with honor the intents to bribe and of force,
always maintaining his fidelity to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution compared Gonzalez to Cespedes, an important hero
who fought for Cuba's independence from Spain and the father of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   After a string of musical and dance performances leading to the
awarding of the medal, a huge portrait of Elian was lit up at the
back of the stage. A military man and color guard in dress uniforms
marched around the inside of the theater and up onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The television images of Elian shown in the hours before the
ceremony were the first new glimpse of the boy seen by the Cuban
public since Thursday, the day after he returned. At the time,
state television repeatedly showed images of Elian's airport
homecoming and a brief clip of him playing with children around his
age the evening of his return.
</P>
<P>
   The award is for ''extraordinary behavior in the tough battle
for the liberation of Elian,'' state media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says Elian gave a human face to its four-decade political
battle with the United States, allowing many ordinary Americans
their first close look at the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Elian, coverage has been given to an affair that
habitually was a theme only for political scientists and
specialists,'' Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National
Assembly, said in an interview published Wednesday in a special
newspaper supplement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Millions of people, housewives, people with nothing to do with
this, soon began to see the story of a Cuban boy as the daily top
news event,'' he said of how Americans followed the case.
</P>
<P>
   The supplement, titled ''Elian in the homeland,'' wrapped up
events leading up to and including Elian's return on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials long promised to prevent the kind of massive
media coverage the child experienced during the five months he
stayed with his Miami relatives while they fought to keep him in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family was given temporary custody of the boy after he
was rescued off the Florida coast. Elian's mother and 10 others
perished during a sea journey from Cuba to the United States.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Cast Ready For Action  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Well, they're all moved in and the tape is
rolling.
</P>
<P>
   CBS' ''Big Brother'' premiered Wednesday by showing the arrival
of 10 strangers the night before who will share a house (and 28 TV
cameras) for the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Houseguests, are you ready?'' asked host Julie Chen, as the
contestants gathered at the threshold of the 1,800-square-foot home
built at a Los Angeles-area studio lot.
</P>
<P>
   They stepped into the house, where the dozens of cameras and
microphones will track their cohabitation on national TV and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, disappointingly, fadeout. With no time for preliminary
squabbles and hanky-panky, the hour was a mostly breathless buildup
to the series to come, which CBS will air five nights a week
(Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who by day is the news reader for CBS' ''Early Show,'' did
a perky to-and-fro with another host, Ian O'Malley, who gave a tour
of the house, showing off the infrared cameras in the bedrooms and
the chickens in the enclosed backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Footage of the original Dutch version of ''Big Brother'' served
as background -- and padding.
</P>
<P>
   House rules (so to speak) for the series were covered: Every two
weeks, the housemates will nominate two colleagues for expulsion,
and TV viewers will vote out one of them by a phone poll. Then,
from the three remaining players, the audience will choose the
winner -- who will be $500,000 richer.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the first time, the 10 contenders were announced and
profiled:
</P>
<P>
   -- Jamie, a beauty queen who works for a Seattle dot-com company.
She expects to miss her daily lattes.
</P>
<P>
   -- George, a jolly roofer from Rockford, Ill. Says what he'll
miss most is his family and his 23rd wedding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   -- Eddie, a hunky lad from Commack, N.Y., who lost his left leg
to cancer. A wheelchair basketball star and a student at the
University of Texas, he vows, ''I'm not gonna quit. I have the
stamina.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Josh, described as a ladies' man and a college student who
says he plans to bring to the house a pair of work gloves and a box
of condoms.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cassandra, a New Yorker who works as a communications
specialist at the United Nations and wonders how she will maintain
her dreadlocks without a stylist's assistance.

<P>
   In keeping with CBS' game plan that ''Big Brother'' should
attract young demographics, the residents skew young and
attractive. Of the 10, only George, Cassandra and Karen would be
obvious ringers on MTV's house-sharing series ''Real World.''
</P>
<P>
   The ''Big Brother'' Web site, maintained by America Online, was
activated shortly after the broadcast ended on the East Coast. The
site has bios for each resident, quotes about them from housemates,
even details of the contents of the suitcases they were permitted
to carry in.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, viewers will get at least four live Internet video
feeds from the house around the clock. CBS picks the cameras used
at any given time, editing out nudity and profanity.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Big Brother'' debut aired right after the sixth weekly
episode of ''Survivor'' (where health club consultant Joel was
voted off the island by his tribe). Setting the pace for TV's
so-called reality craze, that castaways competition was the first
series to make a ratings dent in ABC's hit ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''

<HEADLINE> Fiji Army Declares Exclusion Zone  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's military stepped up the pressure on
rebels holding 27 hostages in Parliament, closing off access to the
area Thursday and giving two days for scores of rebel supporters to
leave the complex in return for amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insisted the declaration of a military exclusion zone
around the parliament complex was not a prelude to an operation to
free the hostages -- who include the former prime minister and
members of his government. But they expressed frustration with the
standoff that has dragged on for 47 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not the first step toward a military option,'' Lt.
Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said at a news conference. ''This is just
a step to try to resolve a situation that has gone on too long.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the military still hoped for a peaceful conclusion to
the crisis, but was not willing to let rebel leader George Speight
''dictate'' its actions and that more drastic measures have not
been ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ''There might have to be a price to be paid and we are willing
to pay it for the sake of the nation,'' Tarakinikini said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there were some signs of movement in the standoff,
with preliminary talks held between the two sides for the first
time since June 25, when a tentative agreement between rebels and
Fiji's military rulers collapsed at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sparse. Rebel spokesman Jo Nata told reporters that
talks that began Thursday morning and continued into the afternoon
likely were ''very, very exploratory.''
</P>
<P>
   Speight, who claims he has popular support for his goal of
giving priority to the rights of indigenous Fijians over those of
the ethnic Indian minority, has warned that the hostages could be
harmed if the military halts access to the compound or cuts off
utilities, as Tarakinikini said was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''It must be impressed upon the military that the blockade of
supplies will have direct implications on the security and the life
of the people who are under our care,'' Nata said by telephone from
inside the complex to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Under a drenching rain, soldiers manning the exclusive zone
seemed fairly relaxed as midnight passed and the zone order took
effect in the early hours Thursday. Under the orders, entry to the
complex is barred except to food supplies. Until now, supporters of
the rebels had been allowed in and out of the parliament complex
with little impediment, and Speight also left and re-entered
several times.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel spokesman Nata claimed up to 3,000 supporters were in and
around the compound -- a figure that appeared somewhat inflated. He
said rebels would tell all the supporters that they were free to
leave. ''But I am confident that none will leave,'' Nata said.
</P>
<P>
   Speight supporters occupied the airport at Labasa, on the
northern island of Vanua Levu, for two hours Thursday morning
before leaving peacefully, a control tower official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was pretty calm,'' he told The Associated Press by
telephone. ''They apparently wanted to give some backing to Speight
and those who were involved in the thing at the military base.''
</P>
<P>
   Two soldiers seized weapons from the base at Labasa on Tuesday
before returning them a day later. Tarakinikini blamed local chiefs
for instigating that incident and said they were capable of more
''disturbances.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a drenching rain, soldiers manning the numerous
checkpoints on the streets around Parliament seemed fairly relaxed
as the exclusion zone order took effect at midnight Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who assumed power 10 days after the
coup, has been reluctant to take strong action as long as the
hostages were not harmed.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the military support the rebel's objective of ensuring
that the rights of indigenous Fijians come first. Some members of
the crack Counter-Revolutionary Warfare unit have been among those
guarding the compound since it was stormed on May 19 and the
government of Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry -- the first Fijian
of Indian ancestry to lead the country -- was taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Indians generally have prospered since they were brought to Fiji
more than a century ago by English colonialists seeking indentured
laborers for rich sugar cane fields. They make up 44 percent of the
population, and have become dominant in commerce and now politics,
sparking resentment among the 51 percent indigenous Fijians.

   HAVANA (AP) -- A shy, but joyful Elian Gonzalez was seen riding his bicycle
in his hometown and splashing in a pool at a nearby resort as state television
Wednesday night aired some of the first images of the boy since his return to
Cuba a week ago. With soft music playing in the background, the video clips
chronicled part of the surprise visit Elian and his family made Tuesday
afternoon to Cardenas, where the child was born and raised. On the streets of
the small port city, scores of residents cheered as a bus carrying the family

Caribbean Leaders, Cuba Reach Trade Agreement
</SUBHEAD>

   CANOUAN, St. Vincent (AP) -- In a sign of warming relations with Cuba,
Caribbean leaders signed an agreement Wednesday promising freer markets and
closer cooperation on tourism projects with the communist island. The pact --
heralded by Fidel Castro in a written statement as part of a ''path toward
higher achievement'' -- also shows a growing willingness to defy the United
States, which for decades fought to curb Cuba's influence in the region. The
agreement with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom, was signed at a

Canada Law Allows Spanking of Kids
</SUBHEAD>

   TORONTO (AP) -- Parents and teachers can spank children under Canadian law,
but the issue should be reviewed because public attitudes have changed, a judge

rejected a challenge by child advocacy groups of the law that they said violated
the constitutional rights of children. Section 43 of the Criminal Code says
''every school teacher, parent or person standing in place of a parent is
justified in using force by way of correction ... if force does not exceed what
is reasonable.''

peace. Natan Sharansky's immigrants party and the National Religious Party
indicated that they cannot remain in government with Barak appearing ready to
make land concessions to the Palestinians that are too broad. Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in a summit with President Clinton in
the United States next week to try to reach a peace accord.

that there was enough evidence that Chief Justice David Brock may have perjured
himself to warrant sending the matter to the Senate for trial. ''There seems to

Audit: Taxpayers Overpaid $25M

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of taxpayers overpaid $25 million in income
taxes that should have been credited to their accounts or refunded by the
Internal Revenue Service, according to an independent audit that cites computer
problems as the main culprit. Thousands more individuals, families and
businesses forfeited their rights to refunds or credits, or were at risk of
doing so, that totaled $335 million. These taxpayers failed to file late tax
returns in time for legal deadlines to qualify for the money. The IRS says it
has returned or credited the money owed.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Becomes Leader in Free Trade  </HEADLINE>
By ELLIOT SPAGAT
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- As he prepares to leave office Dec. 1,
President Ernesto Zedillo is making Mexico one of the world's most
avid practitioners of free trade.
</P>
<P>
   The latest string of deals -- including those with Israel,
Honduras and the European Union -- puts Mexico in the major leagues
of the world's most enthusiastic backers of bilateral free trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who's willing to sign one, they'll do it,'' said Sidney
Weintraub of the Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Vicente Fox, whose victory in Sunday's elections
ended the 71-year-rule of Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, has embraced the agreements and said earlier this week that
Mexico should increase trade with its new partners.
</P>
<P>
   Free trade agreements took effect Saturday with the European
Union and Israel. Mexico signed its ninth one last week with
Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are scheduled to begin this week with Switzerland,
Iceland, Norway and Lichtenstein on a free trade agreement, and the
Zedillo administration hopes to clinch one with Panama before its
term ends Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The government recently agreed to begin talks with Singapore,
setting the stage for its first free trade agreement in Asia. It
held exploratory talks with Japan and floated the idea of an
agreement with the Mercosur trading bloc of Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   The trade pacts have sparked an export boom that has allowed
Mexico to recover from its 1995 economic meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the government has exacerbated income
disparities by benefitting sectors plugged into the global economy
and leaving behind those unprepared to compete, most notably grain
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole approach is that those who are fit to compete at the
international level will be successful and those who are not will
die,'' said Carlos Heredia, a congressional deputy of the leftist
Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo last week recited a familiar mantra to hundreds of
business leaders: Free trade alleviates poverty, makes available
higher-quality goods at lower prices, and creates jobs. The
government says that nearly half the 3.3 million jobs created in
Mexico in the past five years are export-related and that export
jobs pay better.
</P>
<P>
   ''Examples of countries that have overcome economic backwardness
in the last century are well-documented, and all of them have
pursued a common strategy: acceptance of free trade, investment and
technology,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should always be aware that open economies build bridges to
the rest of the world, while closed economies become isolated and
immobile.''
</P>
<P>
   Exports accounted for nearly 30 percent of Mexico's gross
domestic product last year, up from 13 percent in 1993, the year
before the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United
States and Canada took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's motive for the recent agreements is simple: to be less
dependent on the United States, the destination for 88 percent of
its exports last year. Two-way trade between Mexico and the United
States has tripled under Nafta to $225.9 billion last year from
$88.1 billion in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   President-elect Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive, said Mexico
should try to expand Nafta to encompass free movement of people and
a common monetary policy, cautioning that it would take 20 to 30
years. The common market should include other Latin American
countries, starting with the Mercosur bloc, he told foreign
correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's most promising agreement is with the 15-nation European
Union, a bloc of 375 million consumers. It took only a year to
negotiate the far-reaching agreement to dismantle most trade
barriers by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans agreed to lift tariffs on goods covering 82
percent of Mexican manufacturing imports immediately, with the rest
to be scrapped by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, which traditionally runs a trade deficit with Europe,
received more lenient terms. It agreed to lift tariffs on goods
representing 47 percent of European Union manufacturing imports
immediately, with the rest gradually by 2007. All tariffs will be
capped at 5 percent in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and business leaders don't expect Mexico's new trade
agreements to significantly lessen its dependence on the United
States. Still, the European Union may recapture its share of the
Mexican market lost under Nafta.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union, Mexico's second-largest trading partner,
accounted for 6.5 percent of Mexico's trade last year, down from 9
percent in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Nafta, Israel, the European Union and Central
America's ''Northern Triangle,'' Mexico has signed free trade
agreements since 1992 with Chile, Colombia and Venezuela, Bolivia,
Costa Rica and Nicaragua.

<HEADLINE> Nation Faces Possible Power Outages  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A New Hampshire nuclear power plant is out of
business for a few days, and folks throughout New England are asked
to conserve electricity.
</P>
<P>
   A blistering heat wave and problems at a power station hundreds
of miles away force electricity distributors in California to
scramble.
</P>
<P>
   With growing demand for electricity and a power industry in the
midst of a rocky transition, customers are facing another summer of
tight electricity supplies -- and possible rolling blackouts in some
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials and the power industry blame some of the
problems on the lack of adequate transmission lines, antiquated
switching systems and uncertainty about the direction the industry
is going, including the quickening pace of deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Next week Congress will consider legislation aimed at speeding
up the restructuring of the $220 billion electric utility industry,
including provisions that would impose new requirements to help
ensure reliability. The Senate last week approved a bill that would
establish a new organization that would monitor and enforce
reliability rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''The existing scheme of voluntary compliance with voluntary
industry reliability rules is simply no longer adequate,'' says
Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources committee.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Congress acts, it will come too late to ease power
supply concerns this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Power problems already have surfaced in New England and
California and ''could be an ominous sign'' of things to come with
the hottest months of the summer just ahead, said Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson, who has toured the country for a series of
electricity reliability meetings in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ''The view (at these meetings) was unanimous. If we don't work
together and fix the problem, we'll all end up sitting in the
dark,'' Richardson said Wednesday. He said he was particularly
concerned about potential power outages in the Southwest,
California and parts of the Northeast, although other areas could
be affected if there are unexpected breakdowns at power plants or
an unusual heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred on by the growing economy and increased reliance on
computers and other electrical devices, electricity demand has been
increasing about 2 percent a year, while generation capacity has
lagged. The safety cushion between expected demand under normal
circumstances and maximum electricity generation has been narrowing
and now is less than 14 percent of capacity, according to industry
figures. Not long ago it was nearly 25 percent, said a senior DOE
official.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of problems have already shown up this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For most of last week, California was under a ''stage II power
watch'' in which customers were asked to keep down electricity use
and power was withheld from some commercial users because of tight
supplies as temperatures soared in the 100-degree range. Two weeks
earlier, rolling blackouts moved through the San Francisco Bay area
after some power generators failed during a record 103 degree heat
wave.
</P>
<P>
   Although milder temperatures have eased the strain on the
state's electricity system, the problem isn't over, said Patrick
Dorinson, a spokesman for the California Independent System
Operator, which manages the state's flow of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything is on a day-to-day basis,'' he said. ''We expect
another heat wave next week.''
</P>
<P>
   In New England, a New Hampshire nuclear power plant went down
for a few days last month, triggering an appeal throughout the
region that users conserve electricity. The plant quickly resumed
operation and cooler weather arrived, ending the threat.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Sinclair, a spokesman for the agency that manages New
England's electricity grid, said the region's reserve didn't have
to be used but advisories went out to conserve electricity as a
precaution. Still he predicts ''there will be days this summer when
we need to dip into the reserve tanks'' for electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Others do not rule out the possibility of rolling blackouts in
New England should temperatures sore and some unexpected power
outage -- such as the Seabrook plant's brief shutdown in New
Hampshire -- strike in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Even areas such as the Midwest, which has more power plants this
year and most of its nuclear plants operating, could have problems
if they have a severe heat wave and some unexpected power problems,
senior Energy Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile almost half of the states have moved toward adopting --
or are planning to adopt -- a more competitive electricity market,
putting additional strains on the system, many industry experts
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of electricity is being bought and sold,'' said Bill
Brier, vice president for communications at the Edison Electric
Institute, the trade group for investor-owned utilities. ''The
system is stressed.''

<HEADLINE> Dodgers' Kreuter Drops Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Los Angeles Dodgers catcher Chad Kreuter, the
central figure in a brawl with Wrigley Field fans, dropped his
appeal and began serving his eight-game suspension Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter will miss the final five games before the All-Star break
and then the first three games after.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't want to drop the appeal, but felt it was in
the best interests of the Dodgers. If his appeal was denied, it
would have forced Todd Hundley to catch eight straight games. This
will give Hundley three days of rest during the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like I needed to appeal because I wasn't happy with the
outcome in the first place,'' Kreuter said. ''But I want to be a
team player and do what's best for the ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   The brawl on May 16 started when Kreuter said a fan struck him
in the back of the head and grabbed his cap. Kreuter went into the
stands and his teammates and coaches followed. It triggered a brawl
that delayed the game for nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beeston, baseball's chief operating officer, upheld the
eight-game suspension issued by Frank Robinson, baseball's new head
of discipline. Kreuter then appealed to commissioner Bud Selig.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 7, Padres 5  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Todd Hundley hit a tying three-run homer in the
sixth and Eric Karros a game-winning two-run shot in the eighth as
the Los Angeles Dodgers rallied from a five-run deficit to beat the
San Diego Padres 7-5 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   All of the Dodgers' runs scored on four homers. Starting pitcher
Darren Dreifort started Los Angeles' comeback with a solo homer in
the fifth, but he didn't get the decision. That went to Antonio
Osuna (1-4), who pitched two scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   With the Dodgers trailing 5-2, Padres rookie starter Brian
Tollberg walked Shawn Green leading off the sixth and made way for
Carlos Reyes, who walked Karros and then gave up Hundley's
three-run homer that tied it at 5.
</P>
<P>
   Green hit a leadoff single in the eighth off Matt Whiteside
(2-2) and Karros followed with his 24th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort's homer was a 407-foot shot off Tollberg into the seats
in left field, the third of his career and the first since last
Aug. 8 at New York. Mark Grudzielanek homered with two outs in the
fifth, cutting the Padres' lead to 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Kory DeHaan hit his first homer and had his first
three-hit game for the Padres. Ryan Klesko accounted for all three
of San Diego's runs in the first inning, hitting a two-run double
down the right-field line and scoring with two outs on the back end
of a double steal.
</P>
<P>
   DeHaan singled in his first two at-bats before hitting an
opposite field homer off Dreifort with two outs in the fourth for a
5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tollberg, who won his first two starts, lasted just five innings
for the second straight start. He allowed three runs and seven
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort remained 0-5 lifetime against the Padres. He gave up
five runs and 10 hits in five innings, struck out eight and walked
one.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego opened the first with singles by Al Martin and DeHaan,
with both scoring on Klesko's double. Carlos Hernandez drew a
two-out walk and stole second. Second baseman Grudzielanek fell
down when he fielded the throw from Hundley, allowing Klesko to

</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters got his second save in as many chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hernandez, the Padres' catcher, left after the third with a
mild lower back strain. ... The Dodgers promoted OF Mike Metcalfe
from Triple-A Albuquerque and he started in center. Metcalfe
appeared in four games with the Dodgers in 1998. To make room for
Metcalfe, OF Shawn Gilbert was designated for assignment. ...
Dodgers RHP Kevin Brown, who was added to the All-Star team along
with OF Gary Sheffield, had his scheduled start pushed back to
Thursday due to a strained back. ... Closer Trevor Hoffman will be
San Diego's lone All-Star.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez drove in Seattle's first
three runs with two homers, including a 455-foot, go-ahead shot in
the fifth, as the Mariners beat the Anaheim Angels 6-4 Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell hit a three-run homer for the Mariners, who extended
their AL West lead to 3&AMP;frac12; games over Oakland and seven over the
third-place Angels.
</P>
<P>
   John Halama (8-4) allowed four runs -- two earned -- and nine hits
in 5 2-3 innings. The left-hander, who lost four of his previous
five decisions following a 6-0 start, struck out six and walked
one.
</P>
<P>
   Kazuhiro Sasaki got three outs for his 18th save in 20 chances,
and eighth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle led 6-2 in the sixth before RBI singles by Edgard
Clemente -- his fourth RBI in 58 at-bats -- and Darin Erstad, who hit
a high chopper off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, relegated to DH duty for the second straight game
because of a stiff back, had three RBIs including a two-run double
in the second inning. The Angels' leadoff hitter, added to the
All-Star team earlier in the day, leads the majors with 135 hits
and 44 multihit games.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cooper (3-3), coming off a three-hitter against Oakland,
was chased during a four-run fifth that included Rodriguez's 24th
homer and Bell's sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, who didn't allow a homer in 28 1-3 innings over his
previous four starts, allowed six runs and nine hits in 4 1-3
innings as the Mariners won for the 14th time in 18 games,
including 11 of 16 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez homered in the first for a 2-0 lead, but Anaheim tied
it in the second when Erstad doubled after second baseman Mark
McLemore dropped Bengie Molina's popup for an error.
</P>
<P>
Notes: All three outs in the eighth against Seattle reliever Brett
Tomko were caught on the warning track. The only batter who reached
safely was Adam Kennedy, on a bloop double. ... Mariners RHP Gil
Meche was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma, allowing him to pitch on
Sunday instead of missing his regular turn during the All-Star
break. Jamie Moyer is scheduled to start Sunday for Seattle against
the Dodgers. ... INF Carlos Guillen was recalled from Tacoma. ...
Edgar Martinez failed to drive in a run for the first time in 10
games. ... Aaron Sele was the first RHP in the Mariners' 24-year
history to be selected for the All-Star game.

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Herbert Perry hit a two-run homer in the
13th inning and Mark Johnson followed with a solo shot, leading the
Chicago White Sox over the Kansas City Royals 6-3 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wunsch (3-2) pitched two shutout innings the win. Doug
Bochtler (0-1) lost for Kansas City, which outhit the White Sox
17-13.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Sanchez, who went 4-for-7, loaded the bases for Kansas City
when he reached on a bunt single with one out in the 11th. With
left fielder Carlos Lee brought in as a fifth infielder, Mike
Sweeney hit a bouncer up the middle to second baseman Ray Durham,
who stepped on second and threw to first for a double play.
</P>
<P>
   With runners at the corners in the 12th following an intentional
walk to Frank Thomas -- his AL-leading 14th, Maggio Ordonez hit into
an inning-ending double play, with the runners on both ends
appearing to reach safely,
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City led 3-2 before Paul Konerko homered in the eighth
off Dan Reichert, who allowed eight hits in a career-high eight
innings. He struck out six -- also a career high -- and walked one.
Reichert, who made his third start of the season, appeared 23 times
out of the bullpen before joining the rotation on June 24.
</P>
<P>
   White Sox starter Jim Parque gave up three runs and 10 hits in
six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McCarty had RBI doubles in the fourth and sixth innings for
the Royals. His second double -- a sixth-inning drive to the gap in
left center-field -- drove home Joe Randa, who reached on an error
by shortstop Jose Valentin, for a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City could have had a big inning, if not for a
baserunning blunder by McCarty, who stood off second with no outs
as Gregg Zaun grounded to the shortstop hole. Valentin got to the
ball but had no play on Zaun, so he threw behind McCarty, who was
tagged out by Durham, picked earlier in the day for the AL All-Star
team.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Tony Muser argued McCarty beat the tag and was ejected
by second-base umpire Jim McKean. Muser was ejected for the second
time this season -- and on the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Ordaz and Johnny Damon grounded out, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored in the second when Chris Singleton tripled and
came around on Carlos Lee's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, overlooked for the All-Star team, hit an RBI single in
the third for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City tied it in the fourth on Randa's RBI grounder and
McCarty's run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The start was delayed 31 minutes by rain. ... Sweeney went
3-for-6, his 30th multihit game of the season. He has 114 hits. ...
Johnny Damon has reached in 32 of his last 35 games with either a
hit or a walk. He was 1-for-5 with a first-inning single. ...
Thomas was 2-for-5, his 31st multihit game this season. He finished
the series 7-for-14 with two home runs and five RBIs. ... The
Royals lead the season series 4-2. ... Thomas is four RBIs short of
Luke Appling's club record of 1,116. Appling accomplished the feat
in 2,422 games, while Thomas played in his 1,454th game Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> IRS Said To Owe Taxpayers Millions  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) --Thousands of taxpayers were sent IRS notices
demanding taxes they'd already paid and thousands of others
forfeited their rights to get money back from the government, an
independent audit found.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found that the agency did not credit or refund $25
million in income taxes overpaid by taxpayers who paid late, though
still within the time allowed. Some faced federal liens because of
the error.
</P>
<P>
   And thousands of others forfeited their rights to refunds or
credits, or were at risk of doing so, that totaled $335 million.
These individuals, families and businesses failed to file late tax
returns in time to qualify for the money.
</P>
<P>
   The audit by the independent Treasury Inspector General for Tax
Administration, David C. Williams, examined 426,000 tax payments,
totaling $360 million, from 240,000 taxpayers that had been
transferred as of March 1999 to the IRS Excess Collections Account.
Payments are deposited into this account when the IRS is unable to
match them with a tax return, usually because it is late.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $360 million, the audit found that:
</P>
<P>
   --About $25 million, or 29,820 payments, immediately should have
been refunded or credited to taxpayers who filed returns late but
within the legal requirement of generally three years after the
initial due date -- usually April 15 of a given year. The audit did
not break down how many taxpayers that involved. The IRS says it
has now dealt with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   --Taxpayers forfeited $162 million, or 191,700 payments, because
they did not get a return to the IRS within the three-year window
to claim a refund or to credit the payment toward another tax year.
</P>
<P>
   --No tax return had been filed for $173 million, or 204,480
payments. But these taxpayers still could get their credit or
refund if they took action quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Tax law requires a taxpayer to file a claim for a credit or
refund of an overpayment within three years after a return is filed
or two years after the tax was paid, whichever is later. If no tax
is due, the claim must be made within two years of the payment.
</P>
<P>
   The chief culprit is the main IRS computer, which is not linked
directly to computers in the agency's 10 service centers, where
records of payment transfers to the excess account are kept.
</P>
<P>
   When a late return is filed, the computer containing a
taxpayer's main account has no record of the previous payments and
the IRS sends out a notice demanding the money.
</P>
<P>
   An IRS study from 1995 that was cited by auditors said it was
''unproductive'' to spend time tracking down people who failed to
file tax returns if they did not owe taxes and that agents
sometimes transferred payments to the excess accounts to reduce the
number of unresolved cases.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the auditors found that ''many taxpayers received
inaccurate or erroneous balance due notices, sometimes taxpayers
made additional payments in excess of their tax liabilities and, in
a few instances, taxpayers were subjected to federal tax liens.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS says it has now returned or credited the money cited in
the audit and is fixing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In a response letter, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti said
computers are being modified to prevent transfers into the excess
payment account until the three-year refund limit has expired.
</P>
<P>
   Rossotti also said the IRS will send ''periodic letters to
taxpayers with credits to remind them to file a return to receive a
credit or refund.''
</P>
<P>
   He questioned the $25 million in credits and refunds estimated
by the audit, saying an examination of two of the 10 service
centers uncovered 1,398 payments due totaling about $1.7 million.
If that rate held for the other centers, Rossotti said, the total
credited back to taxpayers would amount to about $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors said the discrepancy could be attributed to major
differences between service centers in crediting taxpayer
overpayments and responses by many taxpayers to inaccurate balance
notices they received last year.

<HEADLINE> Wust Wins Tour de France 5th Stage  </HEADLINE>
By IAN PHILLIPS
<TEXT>
<P>
   VITRE, France (AP) -- With a quarter of the Tour de France
virtually over, the race is looking good for past winners Lance
Armstrong, Marco Pantani and Jan Ullrich.
</P>
<P>
   The three men won the 1999, 1998 and 1997 tours, and despite
failing to win a stage this year, they are sitting just behind the
leaders, confident as the race starts to head south toward the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who rides for the U.S. Postal Service, is undoubtedly
in the best position of the three, with few question marks hanging
over his form and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Texan is third in the overall standings, 14
seconds behind France's Laurent Jalabert, who has held the leader's
yellow jersey for two days. His camp says he's holding back until
the Pyrenees mountains, where he hopes to take control of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ullrich, a 26-year-old rider for Deutsche Telekom, should also
thrive in the mountains. As so often before, he has had weight
problems coming into the race, and a crash diet has raised
questions about his stamina. But the German has made it to the
podium all three times he has taken part in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   He's currently 12th, 57 seconds behind Jalabert.
</P>
<P>
   The most unpredictable of the three is Pantani, who is
languishing in 79th place, 5 minutes, 26 seconds behind Jalabert.
But given the 30-year-old Italian's prowess in the mountain stages,
few are counting him out. His rivals know from experience that he
could wipe away a deficit with one trademark burst on the high
ground.
</P>
<P>
   The first mountain stage is on Monday in the Pyrenees. Later,
they head to the Alps.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the stage is set for sprint specialists.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Germany's Marcel Wust took the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   In a sprint finish in the medieval town of Vitre in Brittany,
the Festina rider narrowly beat compatriot Erik Zabel of Deutsche
Telekom.
</P>
<P>
   Wust won by inches after a late burst. He clocked a time of 4
hours, 19 minutes, 5 seconds. Italy's Stefano Zanini of the Mapei
team was third.
</P>
<P>
   The riders had to withstand rain and wind for most of the
125-mile trek from Vannes on the Atlantic coast to Vitre. Most of
the course was flat except for four climbs.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong finished in 25th place and trimmed 10 seconds off
Jalabert's advantage, but remained in third. He is now 14 seconds
behind the Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
   Jalabert, wearing yellow for the first time in five years, was
59th, but retained the yellow jersey going into Thursday's stage.
Spain's David Canada of Once is second.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's stage covers 123 miles from Vitre to Tours.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Father Honored as a Hero  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Praising Elian Gonzalez's father for shunning
bribes to defect during his seven-month fight to bring his son back
to Cuba, President Fidel Castro awarded him one of Cuba's highest
civilian honors, formally making him a modern day communist hero.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez said during the ordeal that anti-communist
Cuban exiles in Miami, who abhor Castro and his government, had
offered him $2 million if he would stay in the United States with
Elian. Gonzalez, a member of Cuba's Communist Party, said at the
time he was offended by the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''His conduct was filled with glory and he gained for always the
admiration of his people,'' Castro said at the Wednesday night
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez had tears in his eyes when Castro pinned on his dark
suit the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes medal and compared Elian's
father to Cespedes, an independence hero and the father of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''A small boy and a humble Cuban father, whom very few people
knew just a few months ago, came back converted into gigantic moral
symbols of our homeland,'' Castro told the audience of 5,000,
including top government and party officials.
</P>
<P>
   Then, directly addressing Gonzalez, Castro said: ''You showed
that in the decisive moments in the history of a country, the
conduct of a man can overcome all of the traitors put together ...
</P>
<P>
   ''Our most important revolutionary duty is to fight to make sure
that this does not happen again,'' Castro said. ''We will keep
fighting. And we will conquer!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I owe this to all the people of Cuba,'' Gonzalez, 31, said,
following a standing ovation. ''I have not done anything out of
this world. I have done what any other father would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly and
Gonzalez's adviser during the fight for his son, earlier read a
resolution by Cuba's ruling Council of State selecting Gonzalez for
the award.
</P>
<P>
   ''Juan Miguel Gonzalez stoically endured the most cruel
suffering of his son, of himself and of his family,'' it said. He
''resisted with his entire being the threats, the pressures and the
slanders and rejected with honor the intents to bribe and of force,
always maintaining his fidelity to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hours before, state television aired images of a timid
but happy Elian as he rode his bicycle and tried on a pair of
inline skates in his hometown, then splashed in a pool at a nearby
resort.
</P>
<P>
   The images, taken Tuesday afternoon during a surprise visit by
Elian and his family to their hometown of Cardenas, were some of
the first shown of the boy since his return to Cuba on June 28.
</P>
<P>
   The video clips showed scores of residents cheering as a bus
carrying the family drove down the streets of the small port city,
about 90 miles east of Havana. At his school, Elian was greeted by
his classmates, and a teacher leaned down to show him pictures and
something written in a book.
</P>
<P>
   As soft music played in the background, the 6-year-old was shown
curiously rummaging through his clothes and toys at the homes of
his paternal and maternal grandparents. His face lit up when he
seemed to recognize toys he had not seen since November, when his
mother took him with her on a boat bound for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elian became the subject of an international custody dispute
after the boat sank, killing his mother and 10 others. The boy,
then 5, was found off the coast of Florida on Thanksgiving Day,
floating on an innertube.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba says Elian gave a human face to its four-decade political
battle with the United States, allowing many ordinary Americans
their first close look at the communist nation. The case also
underscored U.S. immigration policies that Cuba says encourages its
residents to make illegal attempts to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Elian, coverage has been given to an affair that
habitually was a theme only for political scientists and
specialists,'' Alarcon said in an interview published Wednesday in
a special newspaper supplement about Elian.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, he said, many Americans heard of the Cuban
Adjustment Act, a 1966 law that allows Cubans who reach U.S. soil
to apply for permanent residency, even if they entered the country
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the televised images taken by a sole government
cameraman, all other journalists have been kept away from the boy
since shortly after he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban officials long promised to prevent the kind of massive
media coverage the child experienced during the five months he
stayed with his Miami relatives while they fought all the way to
the Supreme Court in a losing battle to keep him in the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parties Leave Government  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Two parties in Ehud Barak's ruling coalition
Wednesday said they would leave his government ahead of a
U.S.-hosted peace summit, possibly depriving the prime minister of
the broad consensus he says he needs to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky's immigrants party and the National Religious
Party indicated that they cannot remain in Barak's coalition
government as long as Barak appears ready to make the far-reaching
land concessions that could clinch a deal with the Palestinians
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in a summit
with President Clinton in the United States next week to try to
reach a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The departure also leaves Barak without a legislative majority.
Sharansky's Israel B'Aliya has four seats and the National
Religious Party has five. Their departure would leave Barak with 59
seats in the 120-member Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Prime Minister, we are not with you, we are against you,
and that means being in the opposition,'' Shaul Yahalom, a National
Religious Party deputy minister told Israel radio. It means
''leaving the government as soon as President Clinton announced the
summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky announced his intention to resign earlier Wednesday,
addressing a rally protesting the government's peace policies. The
former Soviet dissident, who has earned significant prestige among
Israelis for the nine years he spent in a Soviet Union prison in
his struggle to come here, said he would reverse his decision only
if Barak invited the hard-line opposition into the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister is traveling (to Washington) without trying
to make consensus here,'' Sharansky said. ''I prefer to be with the
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaked negotiating papers have suggested that Barak would be
prepared at a summit to give up 92 percent of the West Bank, and
Barak has said that 50,000 out of 200,000 Jewish settlers could be
forced to choose between Palestinian rule and leaving their homes.
In addition, Barak is reportedly ready to give the Palestinians
control over some suburbs of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government denied the contents of the leaks last
month, but since then, some senior ministers have confirmed them.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the National Religious Party nor Sharansky could survive
politically if they were part of a government making such
significant concessions. With both parties in opposition, Jewish
settlers would likely feel empowered to mount fierce -- even violent
-- resistance to land hand-overs, which could cripple Barak's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Both of the departing parties were the jewels in Barak's
government when he formed it last year, lending him the consensus
he said he needed to pursue peace.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, who was in Paris discussing peace process developments
with French leaders, appeared defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even if I stay with nine ministers and a quarter of the
Knesset behind me, we will do it,'' Barak said earlier Wednesday,
when rumors of the two parties' decision to resign first emerged.
The nine ministers refer to those belonging to his One Israel
party, which controls only 26 seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Though Barak still would have enough support to govern, without
legislative majority he will be vulnerable to the demands of junior
coalition parties, especially those of the ultra-Orthodox Shas
party.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, with 17 legislators, has a history threatening to vote
against peace initiatives if its demands for money to fund its
network of religious schools are not met.
</P>
<P>
   Shas leader Eli Yishai, the labor minister, said he was likely
to turn down Barak's offer to travel to Washington as a protest
against Barak's reported concessions -- but he would not say he was
about to leave government.
</P>
<P>
   That typified Shas' recent approach of keeping one leg in
Barak's ideological camp and one leg out as a means of keeping him
in line.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky said Barak could still avert his resignation by
opening up discussions for a national unity government -- something
Barak has adamantly rejected until now.
</P>
<P>
   ''I turn to the prime minister at the last moment, before the
summit in Washington, hold a summit in Jerusalem,'' Sharansky said.
''Build a national consensus, built a national unity government.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky wants the hard-line opposition into government because
he says that would slow the peace process to a rate that is
acceptable for the majority of Israelis, while building broad
support for any concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Sharansky and Yahalom said their parties' ministers would submit
their resignations at the next Cabinet meeting, on Sunday. After
that, Israeli law allows them 48 hours to reverse their decision.
The summit is to begin Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Man Kills Wife, Children  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A man shot and killed a security guard,
his pregnant wife, and three young children after the guard refused
to accept a bribe to cover up the theft of two motorcycles, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Pablo Alcala, 39, was charged late Wednesday with five
counts of murder and one count of attempted murder, said Faustino
Sanchez, spokesman for Guatemala's national police force.
</P>
<P>
   Alcala offered the bribe Tuesday evening at the rural home of
Marcelino Chuy, 37, and opened fire when Chuy refused to take the
money, thought to be $52, Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dead were Chuy's 29-year-old wife, Maria Luisa Monory,
who was eight months pregnant, and their children aged 4, 6 and 18
months. A fourth child, a boy whose age was not released, was in
critical condition Wednesday with several gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred in a tiny village about five miles outside
the colonial tourist town of Antigua, about 25 miles south of
Guatemala City.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Rolls Out New Logo, Guarantee  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak introduces a new logo and a new
commitment to customer satisfaction on Thursday, promising to
compensate riders unhappy with their experience on America's
national railway.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak passengers who believe they did not receive a safe,
comfortable and enjoyable trip will be entitled to a certificate
good for future Amtrak travel at equal cost.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know of no other passenger transportation provider that
offers anything of this kind,'' said Bill Schulz, Amtrak's vice
president for corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said the guarantee technically began on Tuesday --
Independence Day -- although Amtrak officials were preparing to
announce it Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Also being unveiled is a new logo. Gone is the ''pointless
arrow'' design that has represented Amtrak since its creation in
1971. The new design, Schulz said, depicts three parallel lines
winding their way to a horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a new look to Amtrak that allows Americans to take a
new look at Amtrak,'' Schulz said.
</P>
<P>
   Formed by Congress from a collection of failing passenger
railroads, Amtrak has struggled with financial troubles over the
years. Facing a congressional deadline to wean itself from federal
operating subsidies, the intercity railway is working to recreate
itself in image and substance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in a departure from past practices, Amtrak
officials announced plans to add new passenger routes and expand
into package delivery rather than make cuts in order to balance the
books.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak also launched a full-scale promotional campaign for new
high-speed service beginning in the Northeast and spreading to
other busy corridors throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the much-awaited ''Acela Express'' high-speed service
between Washington and Boston, originally scheduled to begin at the
end of 1999, is still not rolling. Federal watchdogs warn that
continuing delays in the start of service -- the latest target is
August -- threaten Amtrak's ability to reach self-sufficiency by the
end of 2002, as ordered by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The watchdogs also question how Amtrak is using the money it
has. Phyllis Scheinberg, associate director for transportation
issues at the General Accounting Office, told a congressional panel
in March that Amtrak is spending most of the federal tax dollars it
gets from Congress to maintain equipment rather than to invest in
new equipment or better tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials remain relentlessly upbeat about their ability
to reach self-sufficiency and the prospect of attracting travelers
frustrated with congestion on highways and in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''This satisfaction guarantee represents our promise to
travelers that Amtrak will treat you like a guest and make service
excellence the central focus of everything we do,'' said Wisconsin
Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of Amtrak's governing board.
</P>
<P>
   Schulz said Amtrak prepared for the new guarantee program by
training its 25,000 employees ''to take personal initiative and do
what is necessary to solve guest problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is counting on dissatisfied riders to bring any
complaints to the attention of an employee in hopes of getting it
addressed. But that will not be a prerequisite for seeking a
service guarantee coupon after an unsatisfactory trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think this is going to be a very powerful statement to the
guests who ride us, and to those who haven't yet tried us,'' Schulz
said.

Elian's Father Honored as a Hero
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Praising Elian Gonzalez's father for shunning bribes to defect
during his seven-month fight to bring his son back to Cuba, President Fidel
Castro awarded him one of Cuba's highest civilian honors, formally making him a
modern day communist hero. Juan Miguel Gonzalez said during the ordeal that
anti-communist Cuban exiles in Miami, who abhor Castro and his government, had
offered him $2 million if he would stay in the United States with Elian.
Gonzalez, a member of Cuba's Communist Party, said at the time he was offended
by the offer.

Mexico Becomes Leader in Free Trade
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- As he prepares to leave office Dec. 1, President Ernesto
Zedillo is making Mexico one of the world's most avid practitioners of free
trade. The latest string of deals -- including those with Israel, Honduras and
the European Union -- puts Mexico in the major leagues of the world's most
enthusiastic backers of bilateral free trade agreements. President-elect Vicente
Fox, whose victory in Sunday's elections ended the 71-year-rule of Zedillo's
Institutional Revolutionary Party, has embraced the agreements and said earlier
this week that Mexico should increase trade with its new partners.

Caribbean Leaders, Cuba Reach Trade Agreement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CANOUAN, St. Vincent (AP) -- In a sign of warming relations with Cuba,
Caribbean leaders signed an agreement Wednesday promising freer markets and
closer cooperation on tourism projects with the communist island. The pact --
heralded by Fidel Castro in a written statement as part of a ''path toward
higher achievement'' -- also shows a growing willingness to defy the United
States, which for decades fought to curb Cuba's influence in the region. The
agreement with the 15-member Caribbean Community, or Caricom, was signed at a
meeting of leaders in St. Vincent and the Grenadines.

Canada Law Allows Spanking of Kids
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Parents and teachers can spank children under Canadian law,
but the issue should be reviewed because public attitudes have changed, a judge
ruled Wednesday. The decision by Ontario Superior Court Judge David McCombs
rejected a challenge by child advocacy groups of the law that they said violated
the constitutional rights of children. Section 43 of the Criminal Code says
''every school teacher, parent or person standing in place of a parent is
justified in using force by way of correction ... if force does not exceed what
is reasonable.''

Israeli Parties Vow To Leave Govt.
</SUBHEAD>

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Two parties in Ehud Barak's ruling coalition Wednesday said
they would leave his government ahead of a U.S.-hosted peace summit, possibly
depriving the prime minister of the broad consensus he says he needs to make
peace. Natan Sharansky's immigrants party and the National Religious Party
indicated that they cannot remain in government with Barak appearing ready to
make land concessions to the Palestinians that are too broad. Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will meet in a summit with President Clinton in
the United States next week to try to reach a peace accord.

NH Justice's Impeachment Recommended
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Lawmakers recommended impeaching the state's highest
judge today, saying he lied under oath to hinder their investigation of the
Supreme Court. After six hours of debate, the House Judiciary Committee voted
that there was enough evidence that Chief Justice David Brock may have perjured
himself to warrant sending the matter to the Senate for trial. ''There seems to
be a pattern here of deception. It may be over small things, but some of these
small things contributed to obstruction of justice,'' said Rep. Benjamin
DePecol.

spoke to a convention of the American Federation of Teachers, but focused more
on health care than education. His strongest fire was aimed at those critical of
his plan to expand Medicare to cover prescription drug costs.

<HEADLINE> Rich Spending Fortunes on Tombs  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- With its black columns and stained glass
windows, Ruth Fertel's ultimate retirement spot is stylish for its
size.
</P>
<P>
   The granite mausoleum sits on a square 27-foot plot under
moss-draped trees on the edge of a bayou in Metairie Cemetery. Its
ambiance, Fertel believes, will encourage visitors to linger.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's such a beautiful and peaceful spot,'' said Fertel, who is
73. ''I just know my family is going to love visiting me there.''
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse chain built the tomb
with her longtime friend and business partner, Lana Duke, then
invited 150 friends and family to a party there. She described the
afternoon event -- with tables of food, a band and guided tours of
the sunset-beige tomb -- as a celebration of life's last stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We call it our last double,'' Fertel said, referring to a
traditional style of housing in New Orleans with two separate
living areas contained in a house. ''We each have a side and plenty
of room for our families.''
</P>
<P>
   Metairie, a non-denominational cemetery built on what was once a
race track, dates to 1872. Visitors are provided with tape recorded
tours that point out the final resting places of former governors,
generals and statesmen. Many are big.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think any place in the world builds tombs like this,''
said Richard Briede, vice president of Stewart Enterprises Inc.,
the owner and operator of the cemetery. ''Not on the scale or in
the number we do.''
</P>
<P>
   A 32-by-32-foot plot for a tomb at Metairie costs $125,000; a
one-time maintenance fee runs about $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fertel would not reveal what she paid for her tomb, but cemetery
architect Gil Bonnaffons Jr. said the structure probably cost about
$500,000, including the lot and design fees.
</P>
<P>
   Metairie does not allow marble construction. It doesn't stand up
well, Bonnaffons said. Granite is the current favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Al Copeland, founder of the Popeyes Fried Chicken chain, is
completing a mausoleum that will hold 14 caskets. Built on a raised
platform with four square fluted columns in front and a bronze
double door, it could run about $600,000, Bonnaffons said.
</P>
<P>
   Aboveground burials are fashionable around New Orleans. The
tradition, dating to 1789 when St. Louis No. 1 Cemetery was
established, springs from the city's European roots, not a response
to flooding or the city's below sea-level setting and swampy
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Tombs are grouped in small neighborhoods, with stone and cement
buildings on winding streets. Many are fenced and some have benches
outside for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The ''cities of the dead'' are a popular attraction, drawing
thousands of tourists to look at the crumbling bricks and fallen
inscriptions. The lure of Metairie Cemetery is more artistic.
</P>
<P>
   Statues of mourning angels and grieving children line the
streets. The architecture includes tombs with beautiful stained
glass windows, modeled after churches, pyramids, Roman shrines and
Islamic palaces.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive art recently led to a scheme to steal urns,
statues and other artifacts and sell them to collectors. A
prominent antiques dealer and four others received jail time for
the venture.
</P>
<P>
   Tombs are sometimes resold, Briede said. Perhaps the most famous
was when the ornate tomb of madam Josie Arlington was sold to J.A.
Morales (Arlington's remains were moved to a secret location).
</P>
<P>
   Visitors still flock to see the statue of a woman with an arm
extended to the tomb's door. Legend has it that the statue
represented one of the many women Arlington welcomed to her
brothel.
</P>
<P>
   Tombs in Louisiana are also reused.
</P>
<P>
   State law allows the remains to be removed from the casket a
year and a day after the death. They can then be deposited in a
special cache in the tomb, the old coffin discarded and the space
reused.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have generations of families interred in even the small
tombs,'' Briede said. ''They're really practical. And they're a
good investment.''

<HEADLINE> Union Teachers OK Dues Increase  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Teachers agreed to increase their union dues to
help fight private school voucher plans, which are often backed by
wealthy interests pushing for changes in state laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to help our state affiliates defeat vouchers and other
ballot initiatives and to overcome the legislative crises that
would undermine public education,'' said Bob Chase, president of
the 2.5 million-member National Education Association, which
holding its annual meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 delegates approved a five-year, $5-per-member
annual dues increase -- $3 of which would be used to fight upcoming
ballot measures including pro-voucher plans being considered in
Michigan and California. The dues also could be used to press for
other NEA policies on state ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing another controversial topic, the union signaled that
it would not stand in the way of union locals that pursue bonus pay
for teachers or locals that have a bonus pay system imposed upon
them.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution approved on the matter did not endorse such a plan,
but it moved the union closer than it has ever come toward backing
merit pay for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the NEA specifically said no compensation package should
replace pay based on seniority, nor subject a teacher's pay to the
whims of a principal. The union also refused to embrace a proposal
to base pay on how well students perform on tests.
</P>
<P>
   The union remains opposed to spending public funds on private
school educations for poor children. But in those states, voucher
plans are backed by powerful forces, Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Silicon Valley billionaire Tim Draper is backing
a Nov. 7 measure that would permit state money to go to vouchers
for private schools. In Michigan, Amway Corp. founder Richard DeVos
Sr. and his wife, Helen, have contributed at least $1 million to
help pass a proposal to provide about $3,150 of state money per
child toward private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's an enormous amount of money,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   The dues increase is expected to raise about $10 million per
year. Annual dues are now $114 and were already scheduled to
increase to $118 per year. The increase, which takes effect this
fall, will bring the cost per teacher to $123.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining $2 of the increase will pay for state and national
media campaigns promoting the value of public education.
</P>
<P>
   The dues increase comes in the wake of criticism from a
conservative legal group, which argues that the NEA reports to the
IRS that it spends no union dues on politics but yet spent millions
of dollars to help elect ''pro-education candidates,'' produce
political training guides and gather teachers' voting records.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said Wednesday the dues plan is legal; no candidates are
helped with the money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Edithe Fulton, vice president of the New Jersey Education
Association, said funds for political campaigns are raised
voluntarily. ''We work to the letter of the law,'' she said. ''It's
painfully democratic but we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The increase drew little opposition at the annual meeting, where
state and local unit members gather to set bargaining policies and
handle other business. The meeting ends Thursday with an address by
Vice President Al Gore, who was endorsed by the union. The rival
American Federation of Teachers, an AFL-CIO affiliate that also
endorsed Gore, ends its biennial meeting in Philadelphia today.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Jackson, a 33-year veteran elementary school teacher
from Peoria, Ill., said the union has expanded its support of
Republican candidates, noting a keynote speech by Illinois Gov.
George Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   In other NEA business, a group of teachers is complaining that
their pension funds are being invested in companies that spend big
bucks pushing vouchers for private schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers have no control over where states invest pension money,
but the group -- which argues for socially responsible investments --
plans to press its case Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Highlight Medicare Contrasts  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Keeping the focus on Medicare, Vice President Al
Gore says he would do more as president for the health care program
for the elderly than George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In outlining the contrast for seniors Thursday, Gore will argue
that he would spend an additional $339 billion over 10 years on
Medicare while Bush proposes no new money for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic presidential contender, will make the case
as he works his way through what is to be the final week of his
''progress and prosperity tour,'' which began June 13 as a two-week
swing to help him claim credit for the economy and reshape the
campaign debate.
</P>
<P>
   During the swing, Gore also has focused on new educational
programs and bolstering health care. His next plan is to highlight
his Republican presidential rival's views on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists argue that Gore's stand on those issues is more in
line with mainstream voters than Bush's. A feature of his swing has
been to cast the differences in staunchly populist rhetoric, where
Gore seeks to cast Bush as a defender of the rich and powerful.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a Coke and Pepsi election,'' said Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane. ''These are candidates who have very different views
and the differences are stark.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically on Medicare, Gore plans to argue that he has
offered a $75 billion plan to extend the Medicare Trust Fund until
2030, and a $255 billion plan to add a prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also would bolster funding for health care providers by $40
billion, with the money going to nursing homes, home health care
providers and others who offer Medicare-covered care.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, he says, ''has not dedicated one dime to
Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign says he has been consistent in proposing to
earmark $5 trillion over five years to save and strengthen Social
Security and Medicare, including a prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has focused tightly on Medicare all week, including during
remarks Wednesday to an American Federation of Teachers convention
in Philadelphia. His loudest applause came when he issued a
Medicare protection pledge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know what the other side thinks of Medicare,'' Gore
shouted. ''They were so determined to slash it that they shut down
the government. But the American people shut them down -- and we're
never going to let them do that again,''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ''progress and prosperity'' tour is to formally end this
week, but the theme will live on because it is resonating with the
public, Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The specific tour that kicked off four weeks ago in New York
will end,'' he said. ''The discussion will continue. You can never
have too much prosperity and progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Wednesday, Gore released a letter demanding that a
group called Citizens for Better Medicare make public its
contributors. The group has run millions of dollars in commercials
bashing Gore's Medicare plans. In response, Gore aides carefully
noted the ties of senior Bush advisers to the pharmaceutical
industry.
</P>
<P>
   At least three Bush advisers have links to the drug industry:
Former Rep. Vin Weber's lobbying firm clients include the
pharmaceutical association that funds the industry group, and
Schering-Plough; former Republican National Committee Chairman
Haley Barbour lobbies for Bristol Myers Squibb, and Charles Black's
firm lobbies for Johnson &AMP; Johnson and Smith Kline Beecham.
</P>
<P>
   One Gore adviser, former Rep. Thomas Downey, lobbies for Merck &AMP;
Co. Another, Peter Knight, lobbied for Schering-Plough before his
firm disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush's ties to the pharmaceutical industry may be a bitter
pill for them to swallow but they should give the straight dope to
the American people about those ties,'' said Lehane.

<HEADLINE> Protestants Rioting in N. Ireland  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Helicopters, army patrols and
sporadic rain dampened down violence in Northern Ireland early
Thursday, but failed to extinguish the Protestant rage that has
sparked four nights of rioting in the British-controlled province.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters hovered low over potential trouble-spots in Belfast
and British soldiers patrolled the streets of the city for the
first time in a year. Security forces sought to contain violence by
hard-line Protestants determined to overturn a ban on an Orange
Order march through hostile Catholic turf.
</P>
<P>
   British army headquarters reported on Wednesday that security
forces had contained 61 riots in Northern Ireland in the previous
24 hours -- more, the army communique said, than in all of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   And the province's chief policeman, Royal Ulster Constabulary
Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan, warned that Protestant extremists
planned to attack his officers with guns and bombs. Intelligence
indicated the attacks would ''include the use of blast bombs and
firearms,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, police exchanged fire with gunmen in a Protestant
area of north Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Protestants blocked more than a dozen roads
simultaneously at Wednesday evening's rush hour, causing one of the
worst traffic jams Belfast has ever seen. Motorists were trapped on
some gridlocked streets for two hours. Roadblocks also disrupted
traffic in several other towns around the province.
</P>
<P>
   As those protests subsided, masked youths began tossing gasoline
bombs at police armored cars and hijacking vehicles, including a
bus. Police said three officers suffered minor cuts and burns.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke from burning vehicles stained the evening sky in
south-central Belfast, where Protestant youths also pounded drums
and played anti-Catholic tunes on flutes. British army surveillance
helicopters hovered over the scenes of worst trouble. Sporadic
fireworks explosions and wailing police sirens continued in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Orange Order, Northern Ireland's once-dominant
Protestant brotherhood, insisted they weren't responsible for the
violence. But they refused to halt any protests unless authorities
let them parade Sunday down Garvaghy Road, the main Catholic
section of Portadown, an overwhelmingly Protestant town 30 miles to
the southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics in isolated districts complained that the Royal Ulster
Constabulary -- the predominantly Protestant police force and itself
the primary target for violence -- wasn't doing enough to protect
them. Several Catholic families in north Belfast reported having to
evacuate their homes after Protestants shouted death threats
outside and broke windows.
</P>
<P>
   The British army in response deployed about 100 soldiers into
north Belfast to support police units there. It was the army's
first deployment in Belfast since last July, when tensions over
traditional Protestant marches produced little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   At the Drumcree Anglican church near Portadown, a long-standing
flashpoint along the Orangemen's planned marching route, the
situation was calmer Wednesday. Army engineers adopted a previously
used tactic -- erecting a 20-foot-high steel wall across the
entrance to the Garvaghy Road, where Protestant marches have been
blocked since 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters burned tires against their side of the barricade,
sending acrid black smoke billowing back toward the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not employ the water cannon used to disperse the
crowd Tuesday, when 14 officers were reported wounded after being
bombarded with gasoline bombs, firecrackers, slingshot projectiles
and even acid.
</P>
<P>
   ''Petrol bombs, fireworks, ball bearings and acid squirted at
the police -- Those are not the weapons of democrats or legitimate
protest. They are the weapons of the bully, and the bully will not
have his way,'' said Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Peter
Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
   This week's substantial Protestant rebellion against British
authority reflects immediate anger at being forced to concede
symbolic ground to Catholics, as well as wider opposition to key
sections of Northern Ireland's 2-year-old peace accord that have
taken shape in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Sen. George Mitchell, who helped broker the accord,
said Wednesday in Belfast that he still believed ''the course for
Northern Ireland has been set irreversibly on the path for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ''These are tense days and nights. No one should
be unrealistic enough to think it will be risk- or trouble-free.''

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Trinidad's Ato Boldon set a fast
standard in an increasingly thrilling pre-Olympic summer, recording
a double at 100 and 200 meters at the Athletissima Grand Prix track
meet.
</P>
<P>
   As he ran past his rivals Wednesday, Boldon's thoughts were with
his absent friends and rivals, 100-meter world champion Maurice
Greene and reigning 200-meter champion Michael Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   '' I'm going to fight Greene and Johnson in Sydney to get the
gold,'' Boldon, a bronze medalist at the Olympics in Atlanta, said
after dancing around the stadium in front of a hugely appreciative
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Boldon recorded the second-fastest time of the year with 9.95 in
the 100 -- behind Greene's 9.91. Boldon's 19.91 in the 200 was
third-fastest this year. Johnson posted a wind-assisted 19.71 in
Pietersburg in March and 19.91 in Seville in June.
</P>
<P>
   Boldon was forced out of last year's worlds due to injury and
has shown continuous improvement since returning to the track this
season.
</P>
<P>
   But 100-meter Olympic champion Donovan Bailey of Canada -- aiming
to match last week's promising 9.98 time in Lucerne -- managed only
a fifth-place finish at 10.12 . Bailey has had mixed results since
suffering a career-threatening Achilles' tendon injury almost two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what went wrong,'' said Bailey, alternating
between disgust and disbelief. ''I wasn't running my race. I never
ran any part of that race. None. Zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic gold medalist and two-time World Champion Allen Johnson
dazzled in the 100-meter hurdles, plunging over the finish line in
this season's quickest time of 13.06.
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of ideal weather conditions and the famously
fast Pontaise track, the 29-year-old American sliced 0.04 seconds
off his own previous seasonal best.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow American Gail Devers, three-time world 100-meter hurdles
champion, was timed in 12.60 to beat Nigeria's Glory Alozie. But
she finished a weary seventh in 100 meters, .39 behind Greek winner
Ekaterina Thanou.
</P>
<P>
   Double Olympic champion Marie Jose Perec of France, meanwhile,
made a strong comeback, finishing second behind Debbie Ferguson of
the Bahamas in the women's 200, her first race in almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Perec, who won a historic double gold in the 200 and 400 in
Atlanta, has been plagued by a rare blood virus that forced her to
miss all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''After everything I've had to go through, it's superb,'' a
radiant -- and relieved -- Perec said. ''You always have a sense of
disappointment when you finish second, but I feel good. I expected
to achieve this level, so there's no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   Perec said she had no illusions about the huge challenge facing
her when she makes her reappearance before her home crowd in the
more demanding 400 in Nice on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Six-time pole vault world champion Sergei Bubka of Ukraine also
flunked his return following surgery on his Achilles' tendon last
season and failed to clear the opening height of 18 feet, 4&AMP;frac12;
inches.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time world champion Cathy Freeman of Australia took
advantage of the swift conditions to record the season's top
performance in the women's 400, clinching her 38th victory in 39
finals since the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, who won the world 400 title in Seville last August,
easily outdistanced the field and improved on American Marion
Jones' previous season best by .03 seconds. The Australian has won
every 400 she's entered this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy it's the world's leading time this year,'' said
Freeman, who will now focus on training and not compete again until
the Golden League in Oslo on July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Athletissima -- which celebrated its 25th anniversary -- isn't
part of the lucrative Golden League. Many top American athletes
therefore preferred to train at home for the upcoming U.S. Olympic
trials.

<HEADLINE> Near-Death Caddie Returns to Links  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Garland Dempsey doesn't remember meeting
Mike Smollen or Christian Ganz. Ditto for Dan Capuano and Dave
Spivak.
</P>
<P>
   But when the caddie saw the four again Wednesday, he greeted
them as if they were the most important people in his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, they are.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really hard to begin to tell you how happy I am to be
here ,'' said Dempsey, who was revived by the four Lemont
paramedic-firefighters on July 3, 1999, after he collapsed and his
heart stopped on the 15th hole at the Western Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could have been a statistic. Thanks to the Lemont Fire
Department and the EMTs out there, they kept me from being a
permanent statistic,'' Dempsey said. ''I'm really, really happy to
be here with everybody today.''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, the longtime caddie for PGA Tour player John Maginnes,
went into cardiac arrest last year after walking off the 15th tee
on a hot, humid afternoon. In the middle of the golf course and
surrounded by thousands of people, it would have been tough for an
emergency vehicle with a regular defibrillator to get to Dempsey
right away.
</P>
<P>
   But Smollen and Ganz were in a vehicle that carried an automated
external defibrillator (AED), a small, portable machine that can be
used to shock someone's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was as good as gone,'' Ganz said. ''If he wasn't
defibrillated, he would be dead today.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dempsey shows few signs of last year's ordeal. He's
about 15 pounds lighter after cutting out the fried and spicy foods
he loved, and he has scars on his right leg and chest from the
surgery. But he was back at work 10 weeks after having quadruple
bypass surgery and has resumed his normal life.
</P>
<P>
   He came back to Cog Hill Golf and Country Club on Wednesday to
thank the paramedics and tout ''Links for Life,'' a partnership
between the American Heart Association and Golf Digest that
encourages golf courses to have AEDs.
</P>
<P>
   Only a foot high and weighing about seven pounds, AEDs can be
installed almost anywhere and can save valuable time for someone in
cardiac arrest. Using two patches that are placed on the chest, the
machine analyzes a person's heart rhythm and determines whether the
heart needs to be shocked.
</P>
<P>
   If it does, an automated voice gives a command to press a button
that will deliver a shock and restart the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm impressed with how easy it is to work,'' said Dempsey, who
watched a demonstration with a look of awe on his face. ''I'm just
very happy they had one out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-five percent of Americans who suffer cardiac arrest die
because they don't receive immediate treatment, said Dr. David
Cooke, president of the AHA's Midwest Affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   AEDs cost around $3,500, about one-third the price of a regular
defibrillator. Because of their small size, they're ideal for
places where emergency vehicles might have difficulty reaching,
Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal is to improve sudden cardiac arrest and heart attack
survival rates,'' Cooke said. ''Garland's life was saved by
experts. But every person sitting here could do the same thing with
a few hours of training.''
</P>
<P>
   With their acres and acres of remote land, golf courses are
perfect spots for the machines, Cooke said. Since ''Links for
Life'' began last October, more than 600 AEDs have been sold to
golf courses throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Cog Hill installed two last month.
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey, who will work for ABC as a spotter this weekend instead
of carrying Maginnes' bag, hasn't been back to the 15th hole yet.
He joked that he wanted the paramedics to give him a ride out there
so he could check out the tire tracks they left last year.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed, but didn't take him up on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's great to have him come back and see him,'' Smollen said.
''In my 20 years, that's probably the first time I've gotten to
talk to and shake hands with somebody I've saved.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Hit With Political Problems  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Israel and the Palestinians jockey for
position for next week's summit, political problems are piling up
for Prime Minister Ehud Barak while the Palestinians are taking a
tough line in their demands.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's inclination to make concessions on West Bank land,
Jerusalem and Jewish settlers prompted two parties to pull out of
his government Wednesday, weakening his already shaky rule and
impinging on his room to maneuver at Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   But the Palestinians, sensing the chance for a successful summit
under President Clinton's supervision, are warning Israel that
giving up only part of the land for a state would not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat has his eye on virtually all of the West Bank,
Gaza and east Jerusalem. ''If the Israelis think that by giving
parts of the land to declare the Palestinian state in, then I don't
think this would bring peace to the area,'' chief Palestinian
negotiator Ahmed Qureia said Wednesday. ''Rather, it would be the
flame that would explode the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing a deadlock and a mid-September deadline, Clinton said
Wednesday he was summoning Barak and Arafat to his Maryland retreat
''to start drawing the contours of the long-awaited peace'' that
has eluded the two sides for a half-century.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his risky move at the White House, Clinton allowed
that staging a summit has its perils. But he said if Barak and
Arafat ''do not seize this moment, if they cannot make progress
now, there will be more hostility and more bitterness, perhaps even
more violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also registered his support for Palestinians
''aspirations,'' for determining their own future on their own land
-- a thinly veiled message to Israel to give ground.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is so inclined, prepared to give up far more land than
even his peace-minded mentor, the late Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, was prepared to do as he secretly began the Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing what was likely to unfold, two parties in Barak's ruling
coalition said they would quit the government -- and deprive the
prime minister of the consensus he needs to make peace.
</P>
<P>
   Natan Sharansky's immigrants party and the National Religious
Party said they could not remain now that Barak appeared ready to
make generous territorial concessions.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the price of peace appeared to be too high.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prime minister is traveling (to Washington) without trying
to make consensus here,'' Sharansky said. ''I prefer to be with the
majority.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaked negotiating papers have suggested that Barak would be
prepared at a summit to give up 92 percent of the West Bank, and
Barak has said that 50,000 out of some 195,000 Jewish settlers
could be forced to choose between Palestinian rule and abandoning
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   These settlers, and their supporters, represent the ancient
Jewish view of the West Bank -- what they call Judea and Samaria --
as part of the Jewish homeland. They are even more determined to
hold on to Jerusalem as Israel's eternal capital.
</P>
<P>
   Barak seems ready to give up at least some suburbs of Jerusalem
to the Palestinians, while some of his advisers would go further
and plant the Palestinian flag over part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Palestinian negotiator Qureia said the
parties remain far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Barak ''does not want negotiations, and he is insisting on the
summit, thinking that he will be able to make deals there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have common ground on any of the issues. There are
big gaps on all the issues -- Jerusalem, refugees and borders.''

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Rattles Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude
of 5.2 struck off Japan's northeastern coast Thursday afternoon,
and there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Meteorological Agency said the center of the quake was 19
miles below the seabed off the coast of Ibaraki state, about 62
miles northeast of Tokyo. It hit just after 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Tsuneaki Anami, an official of the Agency's Seismological and
Volcanological Department, said the Pacific earthquake had ''no
connection'' with a series of earthquakes hitting a chain of small
islands off Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake rocked the island of
Kozushima, 93 miles southwest of Tokyo. A 34-year-old fisherman was
killed in a car buried under fallen rocks on the island.
</P>
<P>
   From Saturday through Thursday afternoon, nearly 9,000 tremors,
most of them too weak to be felt by humans, had been registered on
Kozushima and nearby small islands.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
it sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

<HEADLINE> Typhoon Kirogi Heads For Japan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Typhoon Kirogi was moving north-northeast toward
Japan on Thursday afternoon after leaving at least 10 people dead
in the Philippines, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With sustained winds of 89 miles an hour near its center, Kirogi
was located as of noon about 400 miles east-southeast of Okinawa,
the Meteorological Agency said. Okinawa, the main island in Japan's
southernmost state, is about 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The typhoon was moving at a speed of 12 mph to the
north-northeast and was expected to affect coastal areas near Tokyo
by Saturday morning, weather forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, three more typhoon-related deaths were
reported Thursday, bringing the death toll there to ten,
authorities said. Kirogi and a tropical depression brought heavy
rains there earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   A mother and her daughter were killed early Thursday when their
house below a hill was hit by rock and mud slides in La Trinidad
town in the Philippines' northern Benguet Province. Another person
was killed after a wall collapsed in Cavite Province, south of
Manila, disaster management officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the weather had improved some in Manila, the government
still suspended all classes in the capital Thursday to allow
residents to recover from flood waters, which had begun to recede.

Gore To Highlight Medicare Contrasts
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Keeping the focus on Medicare, Vice President Al Gore says he
would do more as president for the health care program for the elderly than
George W. Bush. In outlining the contrast for seniors today, Gore will argue
that he would spend an additional $339 billion over 10 years on Medicare while
Bush proposes no new money for the program. Gore, the Democratic presidential
contender, will make the case as he works his way through what is to be the
final week of his ''progress and prosperity tour,'' which began June 13 as a
two-week swing to help him claim credit for the economy and reshape the campaign
debate.

   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Helicopters, army patrols and sporadic rain
dampened down violence in Northern Ireland early today, but failed to extinguish
the Protestant rage that has sparked four nights of rioting in the
British-controlled province. Helicopters hovered low over potential
trouble-spots in Belfast and British soldiers patrolled the streets of the city

hard-line Protestants determined to overturn a ban on an Orange Order march

$5-per-member annual dues increase -- $3 of which would be used to fight
upcoming ballot measures including pro-voucher plans being considered in
Michigan and California. The dues also could be used to press for other NEA

Castro awarded him one of Cuba's highest civilian honors, formally making him a
modern day communist hero. Juan Miguel Gonzalez said during the ordeal that
anti-communist Cuban exiles in Miami, who abhor Castro and his government, had
offered him $2 million if he would stay in the United States with Elian.
Gonzalez, a member of Cuba's Communist Party, said at the time he was offended

heralded by Fidel Castro in a written statement as part of a ''path toward
higher achievement'' -- also shows a growing willingness to defy the United

<HEADLINE> New Judge in Clinton Disbarment Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- After four colleagues excused
themselves from the case, a recently appointed judge says he has
not decided whether to preside over President Clinton's disbarment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The other judges -- all Democrats -- cited distant political
connections to Clinton in exercising their options to pass on the
case. The lot fell Wednesday to Pulaski County Circuit Judge Leon
Johnson, appointed June 2 by a Republican governor to fill the term
of a judge ousted by the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I have to make a decision right away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's case was assigned to Johnson after Judge Chris Piazza
stepped aside. Piazza said Clinton, as governor, had once named him
to a panel that hammered out state ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed June 29 by the Supreme Court Committee on
Professional Conduct says Clinton is unfit to be a lawyer because
of his deceptive testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case about his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The committee based its lawsuit on complaints filed by U.S.
District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the Jones
case, and by the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation.
Wright also cited Clinton for contempt and fined him $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said the Arkansas committee was acting too
harshly and his lawyer, David Kendall, has said he would fight
''vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a Little Rock lawyer, was appointed until the end of
the year. Any decision on Clinton's disbarment at the county court
level likely would be appealed to the state Supreme Court.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is up 20 points
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a 7-6 lead over decliners.

<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is ahead nine points and the Standard

</P>
<P>
   There have been no such warnings today, clearing the way for a
potential recovery this session.

<HEADLINE> Dow, Nasdaq Fall Slightly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly lower at the start of
trading Thursday as investors remained worried about slumping
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Wall Street's opening bell, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 13.79 at 10,469.81.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were slightly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 0.20 at 1,446.43, and the Nasdaq composite
index was down 4.53 at 3,858.57.
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates rising, investors have become worried that
corporate profits will suffer. In Wednesday's session, a flurry of
profit warnings sent technology stocks dramatically lower, and
investors appeared unnerved on Thursday as well.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it may be difficult for the market to advance
until companies begin reporting actual numbers later this month.

worried about slumping corporate profits. Semiconductor stocks
recovered some ground lost in Wednesday's crushing selloff, but
investors remained on edge.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 38.19 at 10,445.41.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were slightly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 1.40 at 1,447.63, and the Nasdaq composite
index was up 10.80 at 3,873.90.
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates rising, investors have become worried that
corporate profits will suffer. In Wednesday's session, a flurry of
profit warnings sent technology stocks dramatically lower.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, technology stocks were regaining their balance, but
investors had turned negative toward blue chip names, particularly
the drug stocks that have performed well in recent weeks. Johnson &AMP;
Johnson was down $1.50 to $99.50 and Merck was down $1.25 at
$75.938.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it may be difficult for the market to advance
until companies begin reporting actual numbers later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 9-to-8 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 116.49 million
shares, behind Wednesday's early pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 0.12 to 518.13.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.9 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 0.2 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.5 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Actors, Advertisers Talk Tough  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When Americans were tied to their TV sets for
news of the Persian Gulf War, they also were endlessly bombarded
with a motel commercial featuring actress Liz Zazzi.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on CNN every day, all during the Gulf War,'' Zazzi
recalls. ''A friend called me up and said, 'You're so cute, I see
you on CNN every morning. You must be SO rich.'''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, says the New York actress. Because performers receive a
flat fee for ads running on cable, Zazzi earned about $500 for an
unlimited 13-week showing of the 1991 spot.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's union actors like Zazzi and the ad industry who are at
war: Advertisers want to extend flat-fee payments to broadcast
network commercials, which currently earn residuals for performers
each time the spot airs.
</P>
<P>
   Actors, in turn, are seeking to expand ''pay-for-play'' to cable
spots. The result is a 10-week-old strike by the 135,000 members of
the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has been marked by charges and countercharges of
unfair labor practices, allegations of racial insensitivity and
economic losses for Los Angeles and New York as nonunion ad
production is driven to lower-profile areas.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes including Tiger Woods and Shaquille O'Neal, whose
commercial work requires their membership in SAG, have been pulled
into the fray. Richard Dreyfuss and other stars have lent their
fame to the cause of the mostly anonymous commercial performers.
</P>
<P>
   Each side has claimed its share of success since the May 1
strike began.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers insist their ability to produce spots has been
unaffected by the walkout because of the availability of nonunion
performers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The industry produced 862 commercials from May 15 to June 15,
the same level as if there was no strike,'' said attorney Ira M.
Shepard, representing the American Association of Advertising
Agencies and the Association of National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the industry can do that, notwithstanding strikes and
picketing and yelling and screaming, it isn't good news for the
union,'' Shepard said. ''Eventually, they've got to figure we can
do it without them. I'd much rather do it with them.''
</P>
<P>
   The guilds point to their disruption of nonunion commercial
shoots via protests and contend they have weakened the industry's
unity through interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing major ad agencies in favor of smaller firms willing to
sign interim pacts has allowed Pepsi and other companies to quietly
make union commercials during the strike, SAG and AFTRA claim in
trade paper ads running Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, the unions maneuvered Ford's Lincoln-Mercury
unit into suspending ad production during the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's decision came after SAG-AFTRA accused the company of
darkening the face of a nonunion, white stunt driver so he appeared
black in a commercial featuring black actors -- a notorious,
outdated practice called a ''paint down.'' Ford denied the
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The guild assertion that dozens of major advertisers are making
union ads through interim agreements was dismissed by Shepard as
''baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While it's conceivable some could sign, that doesn't lessen
the solidarity of the vast majority. Nor does it mean the industry
is going to change its bargaining position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders were talking tough as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're applying pressure to the advertisers in ways they've
never seen SAG-AFTRA do before,'' said Todd Amorde, chairman of the
union's strike committee. ''We intend to escalate that; we haven't
even begun to give them our best shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The actors' guilds -- energized by the new leadership of SAG
president William Daniels of ''St. Elsewhere'' and ''Boy Meets
World'' -- have been capitalizing on union ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never before have we worked so closely with the AFL-CIO; they
are helping us to make alliances with other unions,'' Amorde said,
adding that pressure from the United Auto Workers helped gain the
Ford agreement.	   At issue is money and respect, actors say.
</P>
<P>
   The ''pay-per-play'' residuals bring actors roughly $50 to $120
each time a spot airs on network television, in addition to the
minimum $478 they get for a day's production work. For cable TV
spots -- which now represent about two-thirds of all ads made -- the
flat fee is $1,000 or less for each 13-week run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be fairly paid for my distinctive contribution,''
said actor Todd Susman of Los Angeles, who plays a grouchy,
tutu-wearing tooth fairy in an electric toothbrush ad and does
other TV and radio spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''The advertising industry is boasting about record profits and
they come to the table offering us pay cuts,'' Amorde said.
Pre-sales of network commercial time for the upcoming fall TV
season reached a record $8.2 billion, a 15 percent increase over
1999, and cable and syndication ''upfront'' sales also rose
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   But unions are distorting the picture, advertisers say. They
argue that the changing television landscape has made current
residuals obsolete in any economy.
</P>
<P>
   The fee structure dates from the 1950s and '60s, when ABC, NBC
and CBS claimed virtually all the TV audience. Now, six networks
fight for 50 percent of the audience, while cable and satellite
channels claim the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes no economic sense in the television environment in
the year 2000 to pay each time a commercial is used,'' said
Shepard. ''We sorely need a modernization of the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's offer, which it characterizes as a ''residual
guarantee'' of $4,202 for an ad's 13-week unlimited network and
cable commercial run, represents a hefty 37 percent increase for at
least half of SAG members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials scoff at the proposal, saying the boost in the
fee actors would receive for cable ads is offset by the elimination
of network pay-for-play. ''It's really taking money from one pocket
and putting it in another,'' SAG spokesman Greg Krizman said.
</P>
<P>
   The unions also are seeking jurisdiction over ads made for the
Internet and a monitoring system to ensure actors are receiving
proper residuals.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to revive negotiations that stopped in April, federal
mediators have scheduled informal talks with both sides July 20 in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The strike and its outcome are being closely watched by more
than commercial performers. Next year, contracts will be
renegotiated for TV and film actors in SAG as well as for the
Writers Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to do well because there will be repercussions within
the industry,'' said SAG president Daniels. ''I think that's why
we're getting so much recognition and as much help as they can give
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad industry asserts the unions are missing an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've attempted to raise the minimum wage to more than $4,000
for one day of work,'' Shepard said. ''Nobody can say that is a
rollback and, if they don't think it will help them in future
negotiations, they're not connecting the dots.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Down 59; Nasdaq Loses 41  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly lower Thursday as investors
remained worried about slumping corporate profits. Technology
issues, including the largest blue chips, led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   In morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 59.49 at 10,424.11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower, having given up
earlier gains. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 5.18 at
1,441.05, and the Nasdaq composite index was off 41.18 at 3,821.92.
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates rising, investors have become worried that
corporate profits will suffer. In Wednesday's session, a flurry of

   Thursday, technology stocks were regaining their balance, but

drug stocks that have performed well in recent weeks. Johnson &AMP;
Johnson was down $1.50 to $99.50 and Merck was down $1.25 at
$75.938.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it may be difficult for the market to advance
until companies begin reporting actual numbers later this month.
Even then, argued Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at
SG Cowen Securities, investors will apply fierce standards.
Technology stocks, which are still expensive relative to many
old-economy stocks, will face the toughest scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''When an asset is expensive, very minor disappointments can
kill the stock,'' he said. ''With very high valuations, there's
very little room for error. They take them out and shoot them if
anything goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of high-profile technology stocks tumbled.
Hewlett-Packard fell $3.125 to $116.50, IBM fell $2.875 to $100.875
and JDS Uniphase lost $8.75 to $110.25.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 289.51 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, breadth was much worse, with three stocks falling
for every two that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 4.21 to 514.05.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Off on Good Weather  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Good growing weather depressed grain and soybean
prices Thursday in early dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Slumping corn sank further after the National Weather Service
called for wet, cool conditions in mid-July. The short-term picture
already has showers coming to prime growing regions this week,
which boosts prospects for a record crop this year.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans also were pressured by the benign weather outlook for
the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat's decline was only minimal, as Egypt's purchase of U.S.
wheat offset pressures from the harvest and from the drop in corn
and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for September delivery fell &AMP;frac14; cent to $2.58&AMP;frac12; a bushel;
December corn fell 2&AMP;frac12; cents to $2.01&AMP;frac12; a bushel; September oats
fell
&AMP;frac12; cent to $1.01 a bushel; November soybeans fell 6 cents to $4.66 a
bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef futures were mixed in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, while pork futures were higher.
</P>
<P>
   August live cattle rose 1 cent to 67.82 cents a pound; August
feeder cattle fell .10 cent to 87.92 cents a pound; August lean
hogs rose .62 cent to 68.77 cents a pound; August pork bellies rose
1.10 cent to 87 cents a pound.

Supreme Court energizes interreligious abortion debate
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court ruling against a Nebraska
law that banned so-called partial birth abortion has energized
interreligious debate.
</P>
<P>
   The Religious Coalition for Reproductive Rights, representing
the pro-choice Protestant and Jewish denominations, charged that
the restrictive laws are ''part of a religious extremist political
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The group defended ''a woman's moral right to make the best
medical decision for herself, in light of her own religious
convictions.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Council on American-Islamic Relations considers the
procedures to be infanticide, which the Koran forbids. It declared,
''It is astounding that the court would allow a doctor to pull a
defenseless child from its mother's womb, pierce its skull and suck
out its brains.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's two largest Christian bodies agreed. The Rev.
Richard Land, the Southern Baptist Convention's spokesman on social
issues, said the court's ''justification for infanticide'' ignored
''the will of the American people.'' And Cardinal William Keeler of
Baltimore, chairman of the U.S. Catholic hierarchy's pro-life
activities committee, found it ''inconceivable'' that the U.S.
Constitution sanctions ''the brutal destruction of innocents almost
fully delivered.''
</P>
<P>
   A second end-of-term high court decision, allowing the Boy
Scouts to bar avowed homosexuals as leaders, was approved by
Catholic and Southern Baptist officials. They said private
organizations must be free to set their own policies, standards and
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In the United Methodist Church, two agencies took opposite
sides. The Commission of United Methodist Men agreed with the
privacy argument, but the Board of Church and Society accused the
Boy Scouts of violating the rights of homosexuals.

Preacher at marathon Pentecostal revival departs
</P>
<P>
   PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- The ''Pensacola Outpouring,'' the
nation's longest-running Pentecostal revival, marked its fifth
anniversary with the departure of the Rev. Steve Hill, who has
preached at most of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The revival began on Father's Day 1995 at Brownsville Assembly
of God, where the Rev. John Kilpatrick is pastor. The congregation
says 3.5 million people have visited to date. Meetings continue but
have been scaled back from four per week to two.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is moving to Dallas, where his Together in the Harvest
ministry plans to spread the revival's message worldwide. He
recently returned from Japan and plans to visit Singapore in a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm an evangelist, and I want to give it everything I've
got,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   In the revival, participants often swoon, sob, shake or fall
unconscious to the floor. Critics contend it distorts biblical
teachings.

Two Methodist ministers charged over same-sex rituals
</P>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Complaints have been filed against
United Methodist Church ministers in Maine and Nebraska for
conducting rituals for same-sex couples, the church news service
reports.
</P>
<P>
   In Omaha, charges are pending against the Rev. Mark Kemling for
leading a homosexual union rite June 3. Another Omaha Methodist
minister who led such a ceremony was defrocked last November.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop for New England, Susan Wolfe Hassinger, notified
Brown Memorial United Methodist Church in Clinton, Maine, that
charges were filed against its pastor, the Rev. Susan Davenport,
but have been resolved because she ''asked forgiveness and vows not
to repeat this action.''

Reform Jewish synagogues top 900 for the first time

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Reform Judaism's Union of American Hebrew
Congregations has admitted seven new synagogues for a total of 902,
the first time U.S. and Canadian affiliates have exceeded 900.
</P>
<P>
   The new member synagogues are in Florida, Kentucky, Maryland,
New York, Pennsylvania and Washington state. In all, 16
congregations have joined in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the strength of our programs and the power of our
religious philosophy are important attractions,'' said President
Eric Yoffie.
</P>
<P>
   The union, founded in 1873 by 28 liberal synagogues, reached 600
members by 1960 and passed the 800 mark in 1987.

   Executive Director Sandra Swan said ''increasingly we are coming

a prelude to development, and development as a way of preventing
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency raised a record $10.2 million last year. About half
the grants go to U.S. causes, including aid to victims of
hurricanes, floods, fires and tornadoes. Overseas, it supports

South Carolina church gives members $500 in charity gambit
</P>
<P>
   EASTSIDE, S.C. (AP) -- ''Free Money Sunday'' sounds almost too
good to be true. But members who attended worship at St. Giles
Presbyterian Church were offered $500 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation plans to give away $21,000 during the Rev.
David Wadsworth's campaign to spur ''compassionate competition''
among members. They will invest the money where they wish and
return proceeds Sept. 24 to aid Habitat for Humanity, a Christian
charity that has built 100,000 homes for the needy.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth got the idea from Jesus' parable of the talents in
Matthew 25, about a master who gives three servants money to
invest. He said members might do anything from opening a lemonade
stand to investing in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   One church member, Donna Horton, plans to buy dozens of hats,
embroider them and sell them at a profit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- It was kept under wraps by four popes,
tantalized millions of people and raised fears of doomsday
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after 83 years, the Vatican has closed its books on the
so-called Third Secret of Fatima, leading many to ask: What was the
big deal?
</P>
<P>
   ''No great mystery is revealed, nor is the future unveiled,''
said Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the Vatican's guardian of
orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   After all the speculation, he acknowledged, it ''will probably
prove disappointing or surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, the Vatican has received so many reports and
claims of visions, revelations and ''supernatural'' events like
bleeding Madonnas that it has a special office to study them.
</P>
<P>
   The Disciplinary Office of the Congregation of the Doctrine of
the Faith looks into them from a theological standpoint while its
medical-scientific committee conducts investigations ''to ensure
there is no deception,'' said Archbishop Tarcisio Bertone, an
assistant to Ratzinger.
</P>
<P>
   But none has held the public's interest like the story of the
three shepherd children who claimed the Virgin Mary appeared above
an oak tree in the Portuguese town of Fatima on May 13, 1917, and
talked to them.
</P>
<P>
   The first two secrets have long been known and were said to have
foretold the end of World War I and the outbreak of World War II
and the rise and fall of Soviet communism -- a ''prediction of the
immense damage that Russia would do to humanity by abandoning the
Christian faith and embracing communist totalitarianism,'' as the
Vatican put it.
</P>
<P>
   But the long silence over the contents of the third secret
fueled speculation that it was so horrible that no pope wanted to
reveal it.
</P>
<P>
   By the Vatican's account, it was put to paper on Jan. 3, 1944,
by the sole surviving shepherd child, Sister Lucia de Jesus dos
Santos, and entrusted to the bishop of Leiria, Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   On April 4, 1957, under the papacy of Pius XII, the bishop sent
the sealed envelope for safekeeping to the secret archives of the
Holy Office, as the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith was
then called.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Vatican, it was read by Pope John XXIII in 1959
and Paul VI in 1965, but both men decided not to reveal the
contents.
</P>
<P>
   It remained in the archives until Pope John Paul II, recovering
in the hospital from an attempt on his life in St. Peter's Square
on May 13, 1981, asked to read it, the Vatican said in its June 26
account. He was apparently struck by the coincidence of dates -- May
13 was the same date the Virgin is said to have first appeared
before the children in Fatima.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only when the pope returned to Fatima on May 13 this
year to beatify two of the Fatima children that the Vatican decided
to offer a first glimpse of the ''secret.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pope sitting behind him, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the
Vatican secretary of state, stunned the crowd by announcing that
the secret foretold the shooting of John Paul in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican promised further explanation, and this was offered
on June 26 when it released Sister Lucia's 62-line handwritten
letter. It describes a pope ''on his hands and knees at the foot of
a big cross'' who ''was killed by a group of soldiers who fired
bullets and arrows at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since John Paul survived, there would seem to be a discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   A longstanding critic of the Vatican's handling of the secret,
the Fatima Center of Fort Erie, Ontario, said on its Web site that
the latest interpretation was a ''whitewash.'' It said the account
had ''nothing to do with Pope John Paul II not being shot dead'' by
Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vatican had an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   It was inevitable that John Paul ''should see in it his own
fate,'' Ratzinger suggested in his written commentary, noting that
the pope had come very close to death and would later say that the
Virgin Mary ''guided the bullet's path'' to spare him.
</P>
<P>
   ''That here a 'mother's hand' had deflected the fateful bullet
only shows once more that there is no immutable destiny, that faith
and prayer are forces which can influence history and that in the
end prayer is more powerful than bullets and faith more powerful
than armies,'' Ratzinger wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As to why the Vatican waited so long to release the text,
Ratzinger was vaguer.
</P>
<P>
   The account, he said, was ''fuzzy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't make sense to release indecipherable information
that could only lead to confusion,'' the German cardinal said at a
news conference. ''In the light of history you can decipher the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the Vatican feared repercussions
because of the anti-Soviet tone of the Fatima phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Bertone, Ratzinger's assistant, said in a newspaper interview
that some still felt it was premature to release it ''but that the
pope had rightly believed the time had come.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the fuss its secrecy clearly helped create, the
Vatican took a further step back.
</P>
<P>
   It said such private revelations as Fatima are helpful but the
faithful are not obliged to believe them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be kept in mind that prophecy in the biblical sense
does not mean to predict the future but to explain the will of God
for the present, and therefore to show the right path to take for
the future,'' Ratzinger said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 39; Nasdaq Gains 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mostly lower Thursday as investors
remained worried about slumping corporate profits. Technology
issues, including the largest blue chips, led the decline.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 39.25 at 10,444.35.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also lower, having given up
earlier gains. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 0.80 at
1,445.43, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 1.96 at 3,865.06.
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates rising, investors have become worried that
corporate profits will suffer. In Wednesday's session, a flurry of
profit warnings sent technology stocks dramatically lower.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, technology stocks were regaining their balance, but
investors had turned negative toward blue-chips, particularly the
drug stocks that have performed well in recent weeks. Johnson &AMP;
Johnson was down $1.25 to $99.75 and Merck was down $1.563 at
$75.625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it may be difficult for the market to advance
until companies begin reporting actual numbers later this month.
Even then, argued Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at
SG Cowen Securities, investors will apply fierce standards.
Technology stocks, which are still expensive relative to many
old-economy stocks, will face the toughest scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''When an asset is expensive, very minor disappointments can
kill the stock,'' he said. ''With very high valuations, there's
very little room for error. They take them out and shoot them if
anything goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of high-profile technology stocks tumbled.
Hewlett-Packard fell $3.188 to $116.438, IBM fell $2.313 to
$101.438 and JDS Uniphase lost $6.375 to $112.625.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 419.15 million
shares, behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, breadth was much worse, with three stocks falling
for every two that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 1.98 to 516.27.

<HEADLINE> GOP Appointee Gets Clinton Case  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- After four colleagues excused
themselves from the case, a recently appointed judge says he has
not decided whether to preside over President Clinton's disbarment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The other judges -- all Democrats -- cited distant political
connections to Clinton in exercising their options to pass on the
case. The lot fell Wednesday to Pulaski County Circuit Judge Leon
Johnson, appointed June 2 to fill the term of a judge ousted by the
state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I have to make a decision right away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though appointed by a Republican governor, Johnson voted 10 days
earlier in the Democratic primary election, a state voter
registration clerk said Thursday. Johnson also voted in the
Democratic primary runoff in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Huckabee's office is unaware of Johnson's political
affiliation, spokesman Rex Nelson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we appointed him, we knew he was very qualified to handle
any case that might come up, including this,'' Nelson said. ''But
nobody had the slightest inkling that this case might come before
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's case was assigned to Johnson after Judge Chris Piazza
stepped aside. Piazza said Clinton, as governor, had once named him
to a panel that hammered out state ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed June 29 by the Supreme Court Committee on
Professional Conduct says Clinton is unfit to be a lawyer because
of his deceptive testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
case about his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The committee based its lawsuit on complaints filed by U.S.
District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the Jones
case, and by the Atlanta-based Southeastern Legal Foundation.
Wright also cited Clinton for contempt and fined him $90,000.
</P>
<P>
   The president has said the Arkansas committee was acting too
harshly and his lawyer, David Kendall, has said he would fight
''vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a Little Rock lawyer, was appointed until the end of
the year. Any decision on Clinton's disbarment at the county court
level likely would be appealed to the state Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> JFK Jr. Crash Blamed on Pilot Error  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John F. Kennedy Jr. probably became
disoriented in the night sky on his final flight, leading to the
crash that killed him, his wife and her sister, federal
investigators said Thursday in their final report on the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after the son of the late president plummeted into
the sea off Martha's Vineyard, Mass., the National Transportation
Safety Board confirmed preliminary reports and suspicions held
since the crash by concluding that pilot error was the probable
cause of the July 16, 1999 accident.
</P>
<P>
   Killed were Kennedy, 38, his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, 33,
and her 34-year-old sister, Lauren Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   The crash probably occurred because of ''the pilot's failure to
maintain control of the airplane during a descent over water at
night,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's piloting difficulties were likely to have been caused
by ''spatial disorientation,'' a problem when pilots lose track of
the position and motion of their plane relative to the earth's
surface, the report said. The night sky, a lack of visible horizon
over the open water and a haze that blanketed Kennedy's flight path
from New Jersey over Long Island Sound to the Vineyard contributed
to his disorientation.
</P>
<P>
   This type of disorientation is one of the leading causes of
fatal aircraft accidents, according to a Federal Aviation
Administration report.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators said they could not find any mechanical
problems with Kennedy's Piper Saratoga II, and autopsies on all
three victims found no abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the namesake and son of the nation's 35th president,
and his wife had been planning to drop off her sister before flying
onto Cape Cod for a family wedding the following day. Instead,
their plane mysteriously plunged out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   After an intensive search by the Coast Guard, Navy and National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, the plane -- its
passengers still strapped inside -- was found July 21 about 7&AMP;frac12; miles
off shore.

<HEADLINE> FAA Gets 'Golden Fleece' Award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The consumer group Taxpayers for Common Sense
has resurrected the Golden Fleece Awards, founded by Sen. William
Proxmire in 1975 and bestowed for ''wasteful, ridiculous or ironic
use of the taxpayers' money.''
</P>
<P>
   Proxmire presented 168 of the awards before retiring in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The Wisconsin Democrat, now 84, has Alzheimer's disease but will
be honorary chairman of an advisory committee to the taxpayer
group.
</P>
<P>
   The latest target is the Federal Aviation Administration for
''fleecing'' taxpayers out of $500 million in what the group says
is a dubious land development deal at the airport in Tampa, Fla.
The FAA will not comment on the shopping mall project because the
matter is in litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The group noted that its top three classic Golden Fleece
recipients from years past are:
</P>
<P>
   3. The Army for spending $6,000 in 1981 for a 17-page document
on how to buy a bottle of Worcestershire sauce.
</P>
<P>
   2. The Commerce Department for spending $20,000 in 1981 to
construct an 800-foot limestone replica of the Great Wall of China
in Bedford, Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   1. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism for
spending millions of dollars in 1975 to find out if drunken fish
are more aggressive than sober fish, if young rats are more likely
than adult rats to drink booze in order to reduce anxiety, and if
rats can be systematically turned into alcoholics.

<HEADLINE> Barak Unsure of Talks Sucess  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Thursday that
the chances of success at next week's Camp David summit meeting
with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat are 50 percent, ''like the
toss of a coin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians also tried to lower expectations: Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat said it is unlikely that disputes over
borders, Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlements
will be resolved in a few days at the Maryland retreat. He said
more high-level meetings may be required to reach a peace treaty by
Sept. 13, the deadline the sides have set.
</P>
<P>
   Both Barak and Arafat are heading to the summit at a time when
their popularity at home is at a low. But the Israeli leader said
he was not deterred by the weakening of his coalition government on
the eve of his departure for Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian immigrants' party -- Israel B'Aliya -- and the
National Religious Party announced Wednesday that they would leave
the coalition because they are opposed to the concessions they
expect Barak will make to the Palestinians. This leaves the
government with only 59 of the 120 seats in parliament, but Barak
said he would push on with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said the summit offers a historic
opportunity. A failure to seize it could lead to more bloodshed
between Israel and the Palestinians and they would end up in the
same position as before, if not worse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to decide whether we want the conflict to continue for
another 30 years,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Barak acknowledged that the issues to be discussed at Camp David
are the thorniest in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. They include
the permanent borders between Israel and a Palestinian state, the
future of Jerusalem and the problem of the hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian refugees who want to return to what is now Israeli
soil.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he assessed the chances of success at the summit, he
said: ''Fifty percent, like the toss of a coin.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand that Israel give up the entire West Bank
and Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, evacuate all the Jewish
settlements in those heavily Palestinian territories and withdraw
to the border that existed before the 1967 Mideast war, when Israel
captured the areas. Such a withdrawal would still leave the
Palestinians with only 22 percent of what was once the British
mandate of Palestine, the land between the Mediterranean and the
Jordan River to which both peoples lay claim, Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders want to establish their capital in east
Jerusalem, and they maintain that the Palestinian refugees from the
1948 war have the right to return home to what is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, Barak has said Israel will retain control
over the main blocs of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza, that Jerusalem must remain united under Israeli control and
that the refugees will not be allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leaders are pessimistic about the chances of success
at the summit and say Arafat will not retreat from any of his
positions. The speaker of the Palestinian parliament, Ahmed Qureia,
said there is no common ground on any of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, a close
confidant of Barak, said Thursday the gap between the two sides is
being exaggerated. ''The positions of the two sides have never been
closer,'' he told army radio.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon on Thursday rejected
suggestions that his hawkish Likud party join Barak's coalition to
strengthen the prime minister on the eve of his departure for Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think we should join a government which is willing to
give up the (West Bank's) Jordan Valley?'' Sharon said in a
reference to Barak's readiness to give up part of that area to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said the Likud is welcome to join the coalition, but only
if it accepts his government's policies.

<HEADLINE> Dow Loses 25; Nasdaq Gains 37  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday as investors remained
worried about slumping corporate profits. Technology issues showed
a dramatic rift, with blue-chip computer makers down and
semiconductor names improving.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 25.11 at 10,458.49.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators had turned higher, having recovered
from earlier losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 5.48 at
1,451.71, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 37.02 at 3,900.12.
</P>
<P>
   With interest rates rising, investors have become worried that
corporate profits will suffer. In Wednesday's session, a flurry of
profit warnings sent technology stocks dramatically lower.
</P>
<P>
   Some weakness persisted on Thursday. IBM fell for a fourth
straight session as investors worried that its second-quarter
results will miss expectations. Merrill Lynch analyst Steve
Milunovich fueled those fears with a research note indicating that
companies that do business with IBM are struggling, and may cut
back on orders.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell $2.875 to $100.875.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks that tumbled on Wednesday staged
a modest recovery. LSI Logic was up $1.188 to $51.688.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had turned negative toward blue-chips, particularly
the drug stocks that have performed well in recent weeks. Johnson &AMP;

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Gunmen Kill 2, Surrender  </HEADLINE>
By SEAN YOONG
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAUK, Malaysia (AP) -- Anti-terrorist commandos converged on an
armed gang in Malaysia's dense northern jungle Thursday and forced
the Islamic militants to surrender, ending a four-day standoff in
which two hostages were slain.
</P>
<P>
   The surrender of the 27 militants, who had raided two military
armories, brought Malaysia's worst security crisis in years to an
uneasy close amid revelations that the gunmen repeatedly shot one
captive, an army ranger, in both legs before killing him.
</P>
<P>
   A police intelligence detective also was slain. Two other other
hostages, a farmer and a detective, were freed when the gunmen
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   Two members of the armed group said the hostages were killed in
retaliation for the wounding of gunmen in firefights. Five wounded
gunmen were among those who turned themselves in to police and
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The last holdouts reluctantly laid down their arms, which
included machetes, when confronted by the government commandos,
Defense Minister Najib Tun Razak said.
</P>
<P>
   The violence raised concerns about Islamic militancy in this
predominantly Muslim Southeast Asian country, which has little
experience with sectarian strife or terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The gang belong to a group called Al-Ma'unah, or Brotherhood of
Inner Power, and were led by a former army private, identified as
Amin Razali. He was the last to surrender, Najib said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to use violence and they want to create chaos,''
Najib said. ''They were carried away by this notion of an Islamic
state. The acts were criminal in nature. This is not the face of
Islam that we want to show.''
</P>
<P>
   Najib said that all the arms -- more than 100 assault rifles,
grenade launchers and light machine guns -- seized in the raids at
two camps on Sunday -- were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Norian Mai, the national police chief, estimated that Al-Ma'unah
has a few hundred members.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Ma'unah grew out of an Indonesian martial arts group but now
had no links with overseas organizations or local political
parties, Norian said.
</P>
<P>
   Former soldiers are among its members, and three servicemen were
among the raiding band. But Norian said most of the raiders ''were
holding a gun for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kuala Lumpur, Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi
said some in the group were professionals, including engineers and
accountants.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have good jobs and good salaries,'' he said. ''I don't
know why they chose to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Ma'unah espouses holy war and promotes martial arts, the
group's Web site said, describing it as a non-governmental
organization formed in September 1998, when political turmoil
erupted in Malaysia after the sacking and arrest of Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
   It claimed the group had 1,000 members in Malaysia, Brunei,
Singapore, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Those who surrendered are in police custody in Sauk; 15 were
detained under the Internal Security Act.
</P>
<P>
   Under the act, dating from a communist insurgency in the 1950s,
simple possession of bullets is punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the gunmen would face the gallows, Najib said:
''They have committed murder. It all depends on the evidence we can
gather.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The popular anti-depressant Prozac just won a
new use: to treat women suffering a severe form of premenstrual
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But if you use Prozac to treat this ''premenstrual dysphoric
disorder,'' don't call it Prozac -- the manufacturer has come up
with a new name, Sarafem, to catch women's attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same drug, known chemically as fluoxetine, the Food and
Drug Administration stressed. But the Sarafem version of Prozac
comes with a brochure explaining PMDD and in 7-day blister packs to
help women track use of the pills.
</P>
<P>
   Premenstrual complaints range from breast tenderness and
bloating to anxiety and mood swings, occurring anytime between
ovulation and menstruation each month. They affect 3 percent to 5
percent of women of childbearing age. But doctors say some who
suffer very strong symptoms, including depression and irritability,
actually have PMDD, a more severe premenstrual syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have long prescribed Prozac -- and such competing
antidepressants as Zoloft and Celexa -- for these women, even though
the FDA had never specifically approved them as PMDD treatments. It
is legal for doctors to prescribe drugs for any purpose.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's FDA approval of fluoxetine gives Eli Lilly and
Company the bonus of being the first company allowed to advertise
the therapy directly to PMDD sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   One study concluded women who took the drug daily throughout the
menstrual cycle saw a 36 percent improvement on a test measuring
mood and other symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Side effects, including nausea, insomnia and headache, were
similar to those all Prozac users face.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly said the prescription-only Sarafem packs will be available
in August, at Prozac's price.

<HEADLINE> Germany Approves Nazi Slave Fund  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The German parliament offered a formal apology to
Nazi-era slave and forced laborers Thursday as it passed a bill
setting up a $5 billion compensation fund that should begin making
payments to aging victims this year.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing what they said was Germany's ''unmistakable
responsibility,'' lawmakers approved a resolution seeking
forgiveness from victims ''for that which the Germans did to
them,'' namely ''the taking away of their rights, displacement,
maltreatment and exploitation.''
</P>
<P>
   It called the compensation ''a long overdue humanitarian and
financial gesture'' that will help make good on a ''historic and
moral duty.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the compensation fund bill was 556-42, with 22
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those voting against the measure had complained that the
agreement sealed last month with the U.S. and eastern European
governments and Jewish groups did not provide solid enough
protection for German firms against class-action lawsuits filed by
victims in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   The German government's envoy to the talks, Otto Lambsdorff,
rejected such charges in debate before the vote and sharply
criticized firms that have not yet contributed to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ''No German firm, even if it was founded after the war, may
exclude itself from the foundation initiative,'' Lambsdorff said.
''There is no basis to evade the collective responsibility of
German trade and industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund is being financed 50-50 by German industry and the
German government. Nearly 3,000 German firms have pledged money,
but it is still almost $1 billion short of its goal.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million former laborers are expected to be eligible
for payments, mostly central and eastern Europeans. The fund will
also compensate people on whom medical experiments were performed
and some with other Holocaust-related claims.
</P>
<P>
   The final texts, including the German-U.S. agreement on legal
protection for German firms, will be signed at a ceremony July 17
in Berlin, Lambsdorff said.
</P>
<P>
   Payments to the Jewish Claims Conference and other organizations
to distribute compensation -- including ones in Poland, Russia, the
Czech Republic, Ukraine and Belarus -- would begin this year, he
said, adding that victims would have one year to apply.
</P>
<P>
   He called on the Baltic states to establish organizations to
handle payments directly, so they would not have to go through
Moscow, and said the International Organization for Migration, a
Geneva-based intergovernmental agency, would handle claims from any
other country.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of the fund, he said, ''will help keep the past from
being forgotten and to strengthen the way into a future in which
such atrocities will not be repeated.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution adopted with the fund was approved by all parties
except the main opposition Christian Democrats and their Bavarian
sister party, the Christian Social Union, which were unhappy with
leaving the question of further payments open.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives released their own apology echoing the
resolution, but adding that while Germany should never close the
books on dealing with Nazi tyranny, it can draw a line on financial
claims.

<HEADLINE> Nantucket Erosion Battle Rages  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME MINERVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. (AP) -- Al Lussier says he'll never forget the
day a nor'easter pounded the surf off his beachfront home in
Codfish Park so hard he saw waves in his toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was awful ... I had my own tides,'' said Lussier, recalling
the December 1992 storm, one so powerful meteorologists ranked it
as one that should happen only every 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Nantucket was hit by another ''40-year'' caliber
storm just a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches on the island off the southeastern Massachusetts
coast have suffered the brunt of nature's assault -- with erosion
eating away at about 14 feet of beach per year on the south shore.
</P>
<P>
   A $1.4 million system designed to lower the water table, known
as Sta-beach, was installed along a three-mile stretch of the
Siasconset shoreline six years ago. It has slowed the march of the
sea, but not stopped it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, landowners agree something more needs to be done -- but
they're at odds with environmentalists on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   A group of landowners, known as the Siasconset Beach
Preservation Fund, received permission earlier this year from the
Nantucket Conservation Commission to expand the current system and
install 8-foot-high plastic tubes in two sections at and around the
historic Sankaty Head Lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a big sausage,'' said Lussier, a 42-year resident
and a director of the Siasconset Beach Preservation Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Though supporters said the so-called Geotextile tubes would not
have been visible on the beach because of the slope of the shore,
environmentalists went to court to halt the project.
</P>
<P>
   The Nantucket Land Council Inc., in court papers filed in April,
claimed the conservation commission erred in granting permission
for the tubes.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the landowners acquiesed and eliminated the contentious
Geotube provision so they could proceed with other parts of the
erosion-easing plan. The change is subject to the approval of state
environmental policy officials and could be approved as early as
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad they dropped the Geotube,'' said Bruce Perry, an
environmentalist and property manager for the Nantucket Land Bank.
''There's still other questions about other parts of the project
and monitoring.''
</P>
<P>
   The Geotubes would have been put on a beach that is not easily
accessible to bathers because of bluffs up to 100-feet high. Still,
environmentalists didn't like the look.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm fundamentally opposed to alterations on the coastal
beach,'' said Phil Austin, an environmentalist who is also director
of Nantucket's Clean Water Alliance. ''A selective group of
affluent people are trying to preserve a small part of the island,
and not respecting the entire coastal area.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue remains in court, and Helmut Weymar, vice president of
the Siasconset Beach Preservation Fund, is negotiating with the
environmentalists to get them to drop the case. If they don't, the
project will be suspended even if the state approves the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the environmentalists) have indicated that all we need
to do is to tie up some details and then they would drop the
appeal,'' Weymar said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry says in the future something will have to give.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long term, they're going to have to move the houses,'' he
said. ''The island has been eroding for 5,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Weymar estimates that 95 homes in Siasconset, including about a
third of which are 100-years-old or more, are vulnerable to
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Erosion is a growing problem nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency estimates that over the
next 60 years, erosion may claim one out of four houses within 500
feet of the U.S. shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   That is something coastline Nantucketers are trying to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   A $1.5 million upgrade to the current dewatering system would
add collection pipes and install larger pumps. The pumps would be
changed from a gravity to a vacuum system that would enable it to
discharge seawater through its pipes five times faster, or 25,000
gallons every minute.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that if less water is returning to the sea from the
beach, less sand will be carried off with the backwash of waves.
</P>
<P>
   According to Weymar, Sta-beach is used in some 15 places around
the world, but none in conjunction with Geotubes as he was
proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists think the debate should be settled by
nature.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think they should yank all that stuff out of there,''
Austin said. ''Every action of nature has a reaction. Nature bats
last.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 10; Nasdaq Adds 61  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks turned mostly higher in volatile trading
Thursday as investors bought stocks that have fallen steeply in
recent sessions. Many investors remained worried about slumping
corporate profits, turning against blue-chip computer makers.
</P>
<P>
   With less than an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular
session, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 9.54 at 10,493.14.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators had turned higher, having recovered
from earlier losses. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.00
at 1,456.23, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 60.78 at
3,923.88.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shook off early weakness as investors began bargain
hunting, snapping up shares of companies that have been battered in
recent sessions. Oracle rose $3.188 to $75.50.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks that tumbled on Wednesday staged
a modest recovery. LSI Logic was up $1.188 to $51.688.
</P>
<P>
   Also, energy stocks recovered after a number of analysts said a
selloff on Wednesday was overdone. The sector suffered after Saudi
Arabia said it would begin pumping an additional 500,000 barrels of
crude oil per day.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil rose $1.75 to $78.688.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about corporate earnings lingered. With interest
rates rising, investors have become worried that corporate profits
will suffer, and in Wednesday's session, a flurry of profit
warnings sent technology stocks dramatically lower.
</P>
<P>
   Some weakness persisted on Thursday. IBM fell for a fourth
straight session as investors worried that its second-quarter
results will miss expectations. Merrill Lynch analyst Steve
Milunovich fueled those fears with a research note indicating that
companies that do business with IBM are struggling, and may cut
back on orders.
</P>
<P>
   IBM fell $2.188 to $101.563.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had turned negative toward blue-chips, particularly
the drug stocks that have performed well in recent weeks. Johnson &AMP;
Johnson was down $1.50 to $99.50 and Merck was down $1.563 at
$75.625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it may be difficult for the market to advance
until companies begin reporting actual numbers later this month.
Even then, argued Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at
SG Cowen Securities, investors will apply fierce standards.
Technology stocks, which are still expensive relative to many
old-economy stocks, will face the toughest scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''When an asset is expensive, very minor disappointments can
kill the stock,'' he said. ''With very high valuations, there's
very little room for error. They take them out and shoot them if
anything goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM wasn't the only high-profile technology stock to tumble.
Hewlett-Packard fell $3.188 to $116.438 and JDS Uniphase lost
$5.188 to $113.813.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-8 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 744.61 million
shares, slightly ahead of Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, breadth was much worse, with three stocks falling
for every two that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up at 519.19.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Rolls Out New Logo, Guarantee  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Weary from a 23-hour train trip from
Mississippi, Veronica Lewis arrived here Thursday less than
thrilled with Amtrak.
</P>
<P>
   ''With me being a senior citizen, they put me in a seat that I
really didn't want,'' Lewis said on arrival at Union Station. ''It
was very uncomfortable all the way back. They promised to change me
and they never did do it.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep dissatisfied customers like Lewis riding the rails,
Amtrak officials announced a new Amtrak Satisfaction Guarantee on
Thursday. Passengers who believe they did not receive a safe,
comfortable and enjoyable trip can call Amtrak (800-USA-RAIL) to
claim a certificate good for future Amtrak travel of equal cost.
Lewis, of Washington, said she planned to take them up on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know of no other passenger transportation provider that
offers anything of this kind,'' said Bill Schulz, Amtrak's vice
president for corporate communications.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad officials said the guarantee is good business and good
public relations. Every 1 percent increase in guest retention --
riders who try Amtrak again -- equates to $13 million per year in
revenue, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, formed by Congress in 1971 from a collection of failing
passenger railroads, has struggled financially over the years.
Facing a congressional deadline to wean itself from federal
operating subsidies, the railway is working to create itself anew
in image and substance.
</P>
<P>
   The company needs to counter a reputation of being ''tired, worn
out and complacent,'' Amtrak President George Warrington told
reporters before announcing the changes at a carefully staged event
inside Union Station. Simultaneous events were held in
Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the guarantee, Amtrak will soon offer a railroad version
of a frequent flier program and is replacing its 29-year-old
''pointless arrow'' logo with a new one featuring three parallel
lines winding their way to a horizon. The word ''Amtrak'' looks
different too, with a new type style and a special metallic blue
color.
</P>
<P>
   But looks aren't everything.
</P>
<P>
   The much-awaited ''Acela Express'' high-speed service between
Washington and Boston, originally scheduled to begin at the end of
1999, still is not rolling. Federal watchdogs say continuing delays
-- the latest start target is August -- threaten Amtrak's ability to
reach self-sufficiency by the end of 2002 as ordered by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Warrington predicted ''all the hand-wringing will be history''
when the Acela Express starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 17 years, I know that changing a big company like Amtrak
doesn't come easy,'' William Howell, a conductor from New York,
told hundreds of guests. ''To make the service guarantee work, we
have to change the way we do business, and make the changes
stick.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Amtrak union representatives said they support the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel George (Warrington) has given us the ability to take
our destiny in our own hands, and to prove we can be a class
railroad,'' said Joe Derillo, president of Amtrak's unit of the
American Railway Supervisors Association.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new incentive program, all 25,000 Amtrak employees will
get a bonus equal to the average fare -- currently about $50 -- for
any month in which 99.9 percent of riders do not request service
guarantee vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's Los Angeles-to-Seattle ''Coast Starlight'' service has
offered a guarantee for three years. In that time, about 17 to 20
riders -- roughly one for every 107,000 trips -- requested a voucher,
Amtrak officials said.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Leaders Urge Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli and Palestinian leaders spent Thursday
lowering expectations for next week's Mideast summit near
Washington, each saying success depends on concessions by the
other.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton invited Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to the presidential resort at Camp
David on July 11 to try to work out a framework for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides seem locked into their present positions by
internal problems, as public support for the two leaders fades.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said chances for success at the summit meeting are no more
than 50 percent, ''like the toss of a coin.'' Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat predicted a second summit would be needed,
with negotiations in between.
</P>
<P>
   The summit invitation set in motion a further splintering of
Barak's governing team. Opposing concessions to the Palestinians,
two of his six coalition parties moved toward the exit, just two
weeks after an internal crisis led to resignation of another
party's Cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed Barak's popularity at a low point, and Arafat, the
only consensus leader the Palestinians have ever had, was also
suffering in public opinion surveys. Looking over their shoulders
at their domestic opposition, the two leaders would find it
difficult to compromise at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Israeli settlers from the West Bank demonstrated
outside Barak's residence in Jerusalem, protesting his readiness to
give up significant parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are aiming for a target of Sept. 13 to complete a
peace treaty. Palestinians say they intend to declare an
independent state then, with or without a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gaps are still wide. The Palestinians want a state in all the
West Bank and Gaza Strip with the Arab section of Jerusalem as its
capital. Israel is offering most of the West Bank but wants to keep
areas where most Israeli settlers live and insists on sovereignty
over all Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   There are also significant differences over Palestinian refugees
and over release of prisoners in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's military is preparing for violence in the West Bank,
according to a senior officer. Speaking on condition of anonymity,
he warned that Israel would use tanks, planes and helicopters
against Palestinian rioters if necessary. He said settlers are
getting riot control equipment, including rifles that fire
rubber-coated steel pellets.
</P>
<P>
   Members of parliament from the National Religious Party,
identified with Israeli settlers in the West Bank, voted Thursday
to quit Barak's government, a day after Israel B'Aliya,
representing immigrants from the former Soviet Union, announced it
would resign.
</P>
<P>
   In his first political speech since Barak trounced him in
elections in May 1999, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
expressed support for the settlers and called for restraint on all
sides. ''This is a debate among brothers,'' he said, referring to
disagreements over Barak's peace policies. ''There must be no civil
war.'' Netanyahu spoke at the settlement of Ofra, celebrating 25
years since it was established.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Poles Pour Into Rome  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Poland's favorite son did not go home this
summer -- so his countrymen came to him.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 Poles poured into St. Peter's Square on
Thursday to attend a special Mass celebrated by Pope John Paul II
as part of the Vatican's millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   The pope was clearly moved as the crowd waved red and white
Polish flags and sang hymns celebrating Poland's long Roman
Catholic tradition.
</P>
<P>
   With Poland's top political leadership present, John Paul called
for measures to ease the economic pain caused by the country's
transition to a free market economy. Any economic reforms must be
just and benefit all Poles, ''especially the poorest,'' the pope
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Mass, he greeted Polish President Alexsander Kwasniewski,
Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek and the leaders of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The first buses carrying pilgrims began arriving two hours
before the Mass, which started at 8 a.m. to keep the frail
80-year-old pope out of the 90-degree-plus midday heat. They
returned in the evening for a prayer service led by John Paul.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the pilgrims came from parishes throughout Poland, but
there were also groups of Polish extraction from the United States,
Ukraine and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many believers wanted to be here absolutely because, even if
they don't say it, they are thinking that this is the last chance
to see him,'' said Tadeusz Jarzab, 47, who came from a town near
Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   There had been talk of John returning to Poland this summer, but
Holy Year commitments have kept him in Rome. He leaves Sunday for a
13-day vacation in the Italian Alps.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a volatile session with mixed
results Thursday. Most technology shares bounced back from a steep
selloff in the previous session, although worries about earnings
hurt blue-chip names, including IBM.

<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 2.48 points to close at 10,481.12.

Milunovich fueled those fears with a research note indicating that
companies that do business with IBM are struggling, and may cut
back on orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought (the second quarter) would be difficult for IBM but
it appears there may be further risk to our numbers, though we are
making no changes,'' Milunovich told clients. IBM fell $2.188 to
$101.563.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued their recent pattern of moving money from
sector to sector without showing any real conviction. Thursday, the
drug stocks that have performed well in recent weeks fell prey to
profit-taking. Johnson &AMP; Johnson was down $1.50 to $99.50 and Merck
was down $1.563 at $75.625.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it may be difficult for the market to make a solid
advance until companies begin reporting actual numbers later this
month. Even then, argued Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist at SG Cowen Securities, investors will apply fierce
standards. Technology stocks, which are still expensive relative to
many old-economy stocks, will face the toughest scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''When an asset is expensive, very minor disappointments can
kill the stock,'' he said. ''With very high valuations, there's
very little room for error. They take them out and shoot them if
anything goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM wasn't the only high-profile technology stock to tumble.
Hewlett-Packard fell $3.188 to $116.438 and JDS Uniphase lost
$5.188 to $113.813.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 943.37 million
shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, breadth was much worse, with three stocks falling
for every two that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 5.07 at 523.32.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Reviews China Plan  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- World Bank directors reviewed a contentious
loan on Thursday that would resettle poor Chinese farmers to
traditionally Tibetan lands. The United States and environmental
and human rights groups oppose the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The board of directors choices were to go ahead with the $40
million project, cancel it, or carry out further environmental and
social studies over the next 15 to 18 months before providing any
funds, bank officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision was expected later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Bank President James Wolfensohn has recommended a delay but
China opposes consultants making extensive visits to the remote
western area. China has a seat on the 24-member bank board which
makes the final decision on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters of the resettlement plan argue that if China
agrees to make public the environmental and social assessments
conducted by international experts for the project, it would be
taking another step toward political liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the loan would be used to resettle 58,000
impoverished Chinese and Hui Muslim farmers in lands in Qinghai
Province that are the traditional homeland for 4,000 Tibetan and
Mongol herders.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Tibetan groups contend resettlement would aid China's effort
to dilute its minority Tibetan population. Tibet's exiled spiritual
leader, the Dalai Lama, said last month after a meeting with
President Clinton that the bank initiative ''would be a source of
more problems'' and should not proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters from the Campaign for Tibet camped out in
front of bank headquarters for the fourth day Thursday, calling for
cancellation of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups object to the part of the plan that would
underwrite construction of dams and irrigation canals in the
resettlement area.
</P>
<P>
   China insisted last week the project is supported by those who
would be relocated and by the Tibetans living in the province. The
Beijing government said the initiative would also raise living
standards and would strictly adhered to Chinese and World Bank
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Germany voted against the funding when it
first came before the board in June 1999. Some other nations
abstained.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the controversy, the directors earlier delayed
the loan until the bank's independent inspection panel, composed of
three development experts, could conduct a review.
</P>
<P>
   That panel found that the bank repeatedly violated its own rules
for protecting the environment and consulting those affected by the
project. The group said bank managers failed to consider
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's scathing report raised the larger issue of whether
the bank is sufficiently sensitive to the social and political
ramifications of its projects.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also questioned the World Bank's evaluation of
the potential impact of an oil field and pipeline project in Chad
and Cameroon that was approved early in June, despite environmental
and congressional opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelossi, D-Calif, rounded up 59 other lawmakers to
sign a letter urging Wolfensohn to make the panel's report public.
He was ready to comply when the board, at the behest of China and
other borrowing countries, overruled him and held up publication.

<HEADLINE> Decision Near on Anthrax Vaccination  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With supplies of the anthrax vaccine
dwindling, Defense Secretary William Cohen is expected to decide
soon whether to suspend or slow the pace of soldier inoculations,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A set of options is to be presented to Cohen by aides before he
departs Monday on a trip to China, said Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a
Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we get his guidance, we will take that action and we will
announce his decisions,'' Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to discuss specific options, although other defense
officials said the options include suspending the vaccination
program. Some military members believe the government has failed to
demonstrate that the vaccine presents no substantial health risk.
</P>
<P>
   A more likely first step, some officials believe, would be to
slow the rate of inoculations to conserve supplies.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,500 doses are now administered daily. The Pentagon has
about 190,000 doses available for use, meaning that at the current
rate of inoculations it would run out in 42 days unless more
supplies are made available or Cohen orders a slowdown in
inoculations.
</P>
<P>
   A new batch of about 194,000 doses is being tested; if certified
for use, it would ease the supply crunch for at least another
month.
</P>
<P>
   A more lasting solution will come if the Food and Drug
Administration certifies the new manufacturing facility in Lansing,
Mich., of the country's lone anthrax vaccine producer, Bioport
Corp. Quigley said that might be ''many months'' away.
</P>
<P>
   Current supplies of the vaccine come from stockpiles produced by
a small laboratory attached to the University of Michigan, which
manufactured only small quantities of vaccine each year.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 19 percent of the 2.4 million Defense Department
employees have been given at least one of the series of anthrax
vaccine shots that must be administered to achieve full protection
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax typically afflicts animals, especially sheep and cattle.
Dry anthrax spores, which can be put into weapons, can be fatal to
humans when inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon began the vaccination program in response to a
growing concern in the Clinton administration that North Korea,
Iraq or other nations hostile to the United States might launch an
anthrax attack on U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   Several House members have urged Cohen to stop the vaccinations
until the Pentagon finds an improved vaccine, and some soldiers
have refused vaccinations.

<HEADLINE> Agency To Help Blind Test-Takers  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in less than a year, the
Justice Department has won agreement from a national agency that
tests social workers to provide qualified readers for blind or
vision-impaired test-takers.
</P>
<P>
   The department announced Thursday that it filed a lawsuit in
federal court in Des Moines, Iowa, alleging that the American
Association of State Social Work Boards violated the Americans with
Disabilities Act. At the same time, it filed a proposed court
order, based on its new agreement with the association, that would
resolve the lawsuit, if the court approves.
</P>
<P>
   This association of state bodies that regulate social work
offers a licensing examination used throughout the nation. The
agreement was seen by the government as a model for other national
testing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the widespread use and importance of standardized
testing, it is vital that people who are blind be given a fair
opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge and ability,'' said
Acting Assistant Attorney General Bill Lann Lee of the department's
civil rights division. ''Companies that offer standardized tests
should follow this agreement so that the examinations they offer
truly test the aptitude and achievement levels of people with
disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the department reached an out-of-court
settlement on the same issues with the association and with
Assessment Systems Inc. (ASI), which previously worked with the
association in administering the test.
</P>
<P>
   But the department said it received indications the association
was not complying with the out-of-court agreement, so it filed the
lawsuit and a new agreement to settle it.
</P>
<P>
   A court-approved settlement is easier to police than an
out-of-court settlement, because any failure to comply becomes a
violation of a court order. The government can haul suspected
violators back before the court and demand they show cause why they
should not be held in contempt. At that time, the burden of proof
is on the alleged violator, not the government.
</P>
<P>
   ASI complied fully with the earlier agreement by adopting new
policies, training more than 200 employees and informing dozens of
testing agencies of those policies, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The original investigation was triggered by a complaint from
Douglas Elliott, who was blinded in Vietnam but had been a social
worker for more than 20 years. When Elliott moved to Iowa, he had
to pass the exam to be certified there. Examination officials told
him he could not provide his own reader; instead, they assigned
one.
</P>
<P>
   The reader allegedly had never before read for a person with
impaired vision and had great difficulty. The government's
complaint alleges that the reader stumbled over technical terms,
made mistakes in recording Elliott's answers and became exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   A department official, requesting anonymity, said the case was
reopened when the association failed to pay Elliott $1,500 in
agreed upon damages and told its members that the September
agreement did not require anything not done before.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement requires the association to adopt written
policies ensuring that readers are proficient in working with the
blind, familiar with the test and have worked with the particular
test-taker before the exam. The association will pay for the reader
and test-taker to become familiar with each other.
</P>
<P>
   While denying it violated the disabilities act, the association
also agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   --Name an ADA coordinator to answer inquiries from disabled
people who want to take the test.
</P>
<P>
   --Train all employees and publicize the new policies so
test-takers know their options, including supplying their own
readers.
</P>
<P>
   --Pay Elliott $1,500.

<HEADLINE> Senator Urges More Cuba Trade  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calling a House-backed Cuba trade bill a
''legislative hoax,'' a farm-state senator vowed Thursday to push
for an alternative measure that would make it easier to export food
to the communist country.
</P>
<P>
   The House plan ''will not achieve the objective of opening
markets to our farmers,'' Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, a compromise brokered by Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., requires Cuba to pay cash for food or obtain credit from a
third country, which Dorgan calls a ''killer provision'' because
Cuba has little cash.
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan and Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., are circulating a
letter urging fellow lawmakers to support allowing the sale of food
without the bans on government or private financing. A similar bill
passed the Senate with 70 votes last year.
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan said he plans to bring his bill up for a vote within the
next two weeks. Sen. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has said
he will try to kill both the House and Senate Cuba bills because he
opposes trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., supports Dorgan and
Dodd's effort, saying ''it is virtually impossible for Cubans to
pay cash for anything at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest farm group, the American Farm Bureau
Federation, supports the House provision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good first step to opening up their markets,''
spokesman Don Lipton said.
</P>
<P>
   He disagreed with Dorgan's assessment that the ban on financing
would make agricultural sales to Cuba impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other sources of financing may come through and help Cubans
purchase our goods,'' he said, referring to the potential for
third-country financing.
</P>
<P>
   But Tom Buis, a vice president at the National Farmers Union,
said the House plan ''doesn't offer much promise to America's
farmers and ranchers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's heavy on symbolism but light on substance,'' said Buis,
whose organization represents family farmers and ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   Buis estimated that if the trade bill is broadened and American
farmers could tap just one-third of the Cuban wheat market, for
example, they could earn an additional $300 million a year.

<HEADLINE> Survivor, Regis, Jesus Win Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Amid the hype about ''Survivor'' and other
reality shows, it was Jesus Christ who quietly proved a formidable
presence in the television ratings last week.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jennings' news special, ''The Search for Jesus,'' was the
third most-watched prime-time television program last week.
</P>
<P>
   Only CBS' ''Survivor,'' which drew an audience of just under 24
million in its fifth week on the air, and a repeat episode of ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire'' drew larger audiences than ''The Search
for Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   It drew more viewers than any other Jennings special in seven
years and proved somewhat of a surprise to ABC, which postponed it
for a week because the network was concerned the show would compete
against the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ABC also had to be heartened by the continued strength of
''Millionaire.'' Each edition of the game show placed in Nielsen
Media Research's top 10 programs for the week, even though they
were all repeats.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC won with an average of 10 million viewers in
prime-time (6.9 rating, 13 share). CBS had 9.3 million viewers
(6.5, 12), NBC had 8.1 million viewers (5.9, 11) and Fox had 5.8
million (3.9, 7). UPN had 3 million viewers (2.1, 4), the WB had
2.4 million viewers (1.8, 3) and Pax TV had 1.1 million (0.8, 2)
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings race with
9.2 million viewers (7.0 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 7.9 million viewers (6.2, 14), while the ''CBS
Evening News'' had 7.7 million viewers (5.8, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. The share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of June 26 to July 2, the top 10 shows, their
networks and ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 15.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Tuesday), ABC, 12.9; ''Peter Jennings Reporting: The Search for
Jesus,'' ABC, 11.4; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Thursday-9:30 p.m.), ABC, 11.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Sunday-9:30 p.m.), ABC, 11.1; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Thursday-9 p.m.), ABC, 9.6; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 9.3;
''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Sunday-9 p.m.), ABC, 9.2; ''Law
and Order,'' NBC, 9.1; ''20/20 Downtown,'' ABC, 8.4.

<HEADLINE> Russians Brace for Chechen Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A top Chechen rebel commander said in a
video released Thursday that his forces were thriving despite
Russian claims of impending victory, while Russian officials took
stock of recent military losses.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, filmed Wednesday by Associated Press Television
News, a rebel group pitched camp under cover of a lush green
forest, joked, smiled and fingered an arsenal of machine guns,
assault rifles and rocket propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
   At least scores of fighters, many appearing tanned and healthy,
carried hiking backpacks and led horses laden with stocks of food
and ammunition. They cheered and saluted the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The video demonstrated that the rebels can muster a large force
despite Russian claims to have dispersed the guerrilla bands into
groups no larger than 10 or 15 people. It showed the rebels
apparently at ease, despite the massive Russian military presence
nearby the rebel camp, located in the foothills of the Caucasus
Mountains near the town of Bamut.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russian officials have announced worldwide that the war is
over,'' said the group's leader, prominent commander Khamzat
Gilayev said. ''We also think that their war is over. We are
starting our own war, that is my understanding of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilayev was apparently referring to recent bombings and surprise
attacks launched by rebels on Russian positions. In the most deadly
attack, suicide truck bombs killed 33 and wounded 84 soldiers in
five coordinated attacks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials on Thursday traded blame for the bombings and
laid plans to prevent further losses -- but dismissed the idea of a
rebel comeback, and said they still control the rebel republic.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov met Thursday with the pro-Moscow
civilian leader in Chechnya, Akhmed Kadyrov, to discuss economic
revival.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov said lifting the region out of poverty is necessary to
discourage armed resistance, and said his homeland is owed about
$53 million in back pension payments, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin huddled with top military commanders in
the Kremlin to discuss boosting law enforcement in Chechnya, news
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy chief of the general staff Gen. Valery Manilov said
Thursday the bombings will not mark a turning point in the war.
''There's no basis to talk of the collapse of the counter-terrorist
operation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Manilov said most of the republic is governable. He said the
rebels' the majority of important leaders are confined in a
mountain area less than 18 miles wide and 54 miles long. Attack
jets and artillery pounded the area Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of the estimated 1,500 to 2,000 rebels are also in
this area, although the band filmed by APTN was well to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Last week 61 Russian soldiers died and 153 were wounded in
Chechnya, Manilov said. He declined to give an updated total for
the war. The official figure has surpassed 2,000, though critics
estimate it is much higher.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were driven out of Chechnya by independence
fighters in a 1994-96 war. They returned in September, after
Islamic militants based there raided villages in neighboring
Dagestan, and after 300 people died in apartment bombings the
government blames on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> McCall complains of hospital-driven SUNY shortfall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A shortfall at the State University of New
York's three hospitals caused the system to end its fiscal year
$114 million in debt, and to borrow from the state to make up the
shortfall, New York's comptroller complained Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   H. Carl McCall said it is the second year SUNY has had to take a
short-term loan from the state until it could replace the money
with its own revenues from the new fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the system had to borrow $77 million. McCall said
SUNY's fiscal plan already calls for the need to get another loan,
for $207 million, in June 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're actually planning a year in advance to continue to
ignore the problem,'' McCall grumbled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY's fiscal year runs from July 1 to June 30.
</P>
<P>
   McCall faulted SUNY administrators, Gov. George Pataki and the
state Legislature for failing to address the SUNY hospital
shortfall in the 2000-01 state budget which was enacted in May.
</P>
<P>
   McCall said it is no secret that the hospitals have been in
financial trouble and to ''sweep it under the rug'' is becoming
more and more impractical as the shortfall mount.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared for SUNY trustees by PricewaterhouseCoopers
concluded earlier this year that the hospitals are operated
efficiently. But the consultants said the health centers will not
make any money if the state continues to require that they send
money to the rest of the SUNY system.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY's hospitals are in Syracuse, Brooklyn and Stony Brook.
</P>
<P>
   A SUNY spokesman had no immediate comment on McCall's
complaints.

<HEADLINE> Teen to be tried as adult in alleged plot to burn parents, brother  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - A Trumbull teen-ager will be tried as
an adult for allegedly plotting to kill her father, mother and
brother by setting fire to the family home while they slept.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Neville, 15, burst into tears Thursday when Superior
Court Judge Burton Kaplan ruled she was to face three counts of
attempted murder and one count of arson.
</P>
<P>
   Police said that shortly after 3 a.m. on June 2 the girl
splashed gasoline around the inside of her family's home, including
soaking some clothing outside the bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   When firefighters arrived at the home they found the girl's
father, Gary Neville, had managed to put out the fire, which he
said had sent flames up to 3 feet high outside the bedroom. Neville
was treated for smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, firefighters found a line of
gasoline-soaked clothing in front of the bedrooms on the second
floor of the raised ranch house. The piles of clothes culminated in
a 1-gallon container of gasoline outside the brother's door.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the fire caused $30,000 in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Neville, who denies setting the fire, said she leaped
from her window to escape the flames.
</P>
<P>
   When police arrived, they found the girl crying and limping as
she stood outside her home. She said she had injured her leg when
she leapt from her bedroom window. But police said an examination
at the hospital found no signs of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Following an investigation, police arrested Neville on June 26.
She was released on a promise to appear in court, which remains in
effect until her next hearing. Until then, she must adhere to a
9:30 p.m. curfew and wear an electronic monitoring anklet.
</P>
<P>
   The girl left the courthouse with family members, including her
father, brother and an aunt. Her case was continued until July 28.

<HEADLINE> Albright Clears Plans for Peace Talk  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
spokesman assured Japan on Thursday she was skipping a high-level
conference next week in Miyazaki only because of the urgency of
Mideast summit talks at Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Albright explained to Foreign Minister Yohei Kono in a half-hour
telephone call why she would not attend the foreign ministers
meeting and he ''expressed his understanding of the critical timing
of the Middle East peace talks,'' spokesman Richard Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and Russia are due to meet at Miyazaki next Wednesday
and Thursday to prepare for a Group of Eight summit meeting on
Okinawa July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Camp David summit opens next Tuesday, and Albright will
participate along with President Clinton and other U.S. officials.
She is sending Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott to Japan in
her place.
</P>
<P>
   The city responded by deciding not to name a 500-seat auditorium
in its new civic center after Albright.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miyazaki's junior high school students and other citizens
looked forward to the visit,'' Miyazaki City Mayor Shigemitsu
Tsumura said. ''We think this is very unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Albright regretted she could not attend the foreign
ministers meeting and speak at the civic center
</P>
<P>
   ''The Middle East peace process is at a critical juncture, and
the summit offers a real change for a historic agreement,'' the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said Albright would visit Japan later on. ''They are
strong allies and friends,'' he said of the Japanese. ''We
certainly look forward to doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no word on whether Clinton would cancel his attendance
at the G-8 summit if Mideast peace talks were still in progress.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he voiced hope for an accord within a few days,
but said there were no guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are due here this weekend
for pre-summit talks on Sunday and Monday. Boucher said Albright
would meet with them.
</P>
<P>
   The summit itself will be held in seclusion. Boucher said
Thursday that briefings for the news media will be held at a press
center yet to be selected.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't expect to get any complete and full daily readout
of the issues under discussion,'' Boucher advised reporters at the
State Department. ''We will try to make available what information
we can, but I don't want anybody to anticipate enormous amounts of
information at those briefings.''

<HEADLINE> SUNY chancellor to have heart bypass surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Robert King, chancellor of the State
University of New York system, will have elective heart bypass
surgery Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A brief statement from SUNY's central administrative office in
Albany Thursday announced King's impending surgery and promised
further updates ''as appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The chancellor is expected to be able to resume some of his
duties within a month's time and the nature of his condition
indicates that he can expect a full and complete recovery,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY spokesman Dave Henahan could not say where the surgery was
to be performed or if King has a history of heart problems
personally or in his family.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old King has been chancellor since December. He
previously was the first director of the Governor's Office of
Regulatory Reform and state budget director in the Pataki
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, King was a Republican state assemblyman - serving
with George Pataki in that chamber - and Monroe County executive.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who is close to King, issued a statement Thursday
praising King for proving himself ''a dynamic leader committed to
making SUNY, already the finest university system in America, even
better.''
</P>
<P>
   ''My best thoughts and prayers are with my friend, who I am
confident will have a full recovery,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   While King convalesces, his duties at SUNY will be handled by
Provost Peter Salins, Vice Chancellor Richard Miller and Vice
Chancellor John O'Connor, depending on the subject matter, Henahan
said.

<HEADLINE> Strong Earthquake Rattles Nicaragua  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- A strong earthquake shook Nicaragua on
Thursday, destroying more than a dozen homes. There were
unconfirmed reports of several deaths and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.9, struck at 1:30
p.m. and was centered in Laguna de Apoyo, about 30 miles east of
the capital of Managua.
</P>
<P>
   It was felt across the country as far away as Waslala, in the
northeast of the country and in the province of Jinotega, on the
border with Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   In San Juan de Oriente, 35 miles east of the capital, residents
told state Radio Nicaragua that at least 15 houses were destroyed
and that there were some deaths and injuries. The radio station
also said the quake took down a wall of a church in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue officials were en route to the scene.

<HEADLINE> CBS Reality Duo Grabs Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS' back-to-back reality shows, ''Survivor''
and ''Big Brother,'' proved hard for many television viewers to
resist Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Just under 24 million people tuned in to watch the sixth
installment of ''Survivor,'' where contestant Joel Klug was voted
out because three fellow castaways found him condescending toward
women.
</P>
<P>
   That's almost identical to the viewership ''Survivor'' drew the
previous two weeks, Nielsen Media Research said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 22.5 million people hung around to watch the
premiere of ''Big Brother,'' where 10 strangers agreed to live
together in a house for three months under the watchful eye of 28
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is airing ''Big Brother'' five nights a week into the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The show gave CBS its biggest audience in the time slot since
February's Grammy Awards. It also compares favorably with the 15.5
million people who watched the first episode of ''Survivor'' in
late May.
</P>
<P>
   ''Big Brother'' drew some scathing reviews, however, and CBS'
competitors noted that the show lost about a million and a half
viewers as the hour went on. They say the true test will come when
''Big Brother'' doesn't have ''Survivor'' as a lead-in.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows drew a large audience of young adults, which CBS
traditionally has had trouble reaching.

<HEADLINE> Tipper Gore raises money for DNC, tours youth program  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Tipper Gore was all smiles as children
crowded around her Thursday to tell of their adventures in a summer
program that teaches leadership and confidence by dangling them
from ropes 30 feet up in the treetops.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not scary,'' one student told the wife of the Democratic
presidential candidate during a stop at Hartford's Riverside Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are we on TV?'' another asked as cameras pressed around them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of scary,'' a girl said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore chimed in: ''I'm really impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one kid asked the money question: ''Who's ahead in the
polls?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore laughed and responded the polls are about even.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Edward Rendell, chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, urged supporters at two fund-raisers to sign their
friends up for the Democratic cause this election. They urged
people to pitch in with support from their pocketbooks and elbow
grease to help Vice President Al Gore beat Texas Gov. George W.
Bush in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need your resources. Thank you for coming,'' Rendell told
about 120 people who paid $50 apiece for a stand-up reception where
they munched on bagel chips, feta cheese and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   At a $500-a-plate lunch of grilled chicken, salad and
cheesecake, Gore said her husband would expand on President
Clinton's economic successes and uphold traditional party stands on
civil rights, education and support for working families.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to continue to widen the circle of opportunity,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raisers at The Hartford Club were expected to raise
about $100,000 for the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   People who attended the event included top Democrats in the
Connecticut party, lobbyists, town party leaders and interested
party members.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Wolfe, of Simsbury, came to the reception after she got
a letter in the mail notifying her about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never given $50 to a candidate before in my life, but I
feel so strongly for the issues she stands for, especially
environmental issues, and Tipper's been such a leader on mental
health issues,'' Wolfe said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting with campers at Riverside Park, Gore
visited the summer job and recreation programs offered by
Riverfront Recapture, a group that is restoring the city's access
to the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   She watched teen-agers plane wood to make a boat, and others who
rowed a boat out into the river. The youngsters on the ropes course
in the woods crowded around her to tell of their achievements
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives a kid a sense of accomplishment, I think,'' Gore
said, adding that she thinks the program should be expanded to
other cities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Rips Senate Patients' Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Saying that ''all we need is one vote,''
President Clinton opened a drive to find a Republican senator who
might bend to election-year pressure and help pass a White
House-supported patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are so close. We are one vote away,'' Clinton said
Thursday, standing on a University of Missouri stage with doctors
and nurses in white medical coats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton launched his appeal here to help Democratic Gov. Mel
Carnahan, battling to unseat Republican Sen. John Ashcroft in a
tight race. On Monday, the president will visit Philadelphia to
appear with Democratic Rep. Ron Klink, who is running against Sen.
Rick Santorum, a first-term Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also is considering visits later in Minnesota,
Michigan, Oregon and Delaware to try to make patients' rights an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ashcroft and Santorum voted for a Senate-passed Republican
measure containing limited patient protections, including a
restricted right to sue HMOs. Clinton said the GOP measure was a
patients' rights bill in name only and actually would take away
some of the protections that Missouri enacted in a patients' bill
that Carnahan signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan is challenging Ashcroft to reverse his vote against the
White House proposal. Ashcroft accuses Carnahan of playing politics
with health care and says he is committed to reaching bipartisan
compromise this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Democrats' version amounts to health
insurance run by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP bill would exclude 135 million Americans
from coverage, restrict access to specialists, emergency rooms and
clinical trials and limit the right to sue. He promised anew to
veto the Republican bill, saying it would be ''dead on arrival'' if
it reaches the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamentally, patients must be able to hold health plans
fully accountable for harmful decisions,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a real patients' bill of rights with real
accountability and real rights, not one that just provides cover
for the special interests,'' Clinton said. ''We don't need more
cover for them. We need more health care coverage for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House-backed measure, rejected by the Senate June 8,
would give Americans broad new authority to sue their HMOs for
denial of care. The vote was 51-48, with four Republicans joining
44 Democrats in support of the bill. If the Republican vote count
slipped to 50, Vice President Al Gore could step in to cast a
winning vote.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation sponsored by Reps. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.,
and John Dingell, D-Mich., cleared the House last year with the
support of most Democrats and many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited an analysis of the Republican bill, conducted by
Rutgers and George Washington universities at Dingell's request,
and said, ''The Senate bill would be even worse than the current
law. It would effectively wipe out protections that states like
Missouri have already passed and replace them with provisions that
would make it more difficult to hold plans accountable for harmful
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to Missouri from an overnight stay at his home in
Chappaqua, N.Y. Before returning to Washington, the president
stopped at a barbecue restaurant with Carnahan and his wife, Jean.

<HEADLINE> Colombia To Test Fungicide vs. Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombia has agreed to test a naturally
occurring fungicide to determine whether it is feasible for
widespread eradication of narcotics plants, the State Department
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The testing is expected to take about two years to complete,
spokesman Richard Boucher said. ''Then it will be up to the
government of Colombia to evaluate the results and determine the
next steps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The testing, funded by a $3 million U.S. contribution, will be
carried out by Colombia and the U.N. Drug Control Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian Environmental Minister Juan Mayr has been discussing
the issue with administration officials and congressional staff
aides.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want is a program of research -- and only research -- on
the use of biological controls against these crops,'' Mayr told The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the fungicide, known as fusarium oxysporum, could
be the answer in the long search for a means of reversing what has
been a steady growth in the production of coca leaf and opium poppy
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian drug cartels have been able to offset extensive
chemical spraying by opening up new areas for cultivating narcotics
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents say a big advantage of the fungus is that it
grows naturally, is safe for the environment, and that decades must
pass before a treated area is suitable again for growing narcotics
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department tests have shown that the fungus will
kill narcotics plants without harming other plants or animal life,
advocates says.
</P>
<P>
   ''These micro-organisms have the potential to cripple drug crops
before they are even harvested,'' one proponent, Republican Sen.
Mike DeWine of Ohio, has said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine was unavailable for comment on Thursday, but an aide said
the decision was ''a positive step forward.'' Efforts to reach
Colombian officials for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fl., has said all indications are that the
fungicide ''has the potential for making a big difference in the
drug war. This could be the silver bullet.'' The Colombian decision
to go ahead with testing was made with the strong encouragement of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there will be other hurdles to clear if the tests show the
product is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The next problem would be to find a way to produce the fungicide
in quantities that will yield the desired results. In addition, a
delivery mechanism has to be found, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have become increasingly alarmed about
the repeated failure of an extensive eradication program to reverse
what they call an ''explosion'' in coca production in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA estimate in January showed a substantial increase in coca
cultivation, and there is no reason to believe the next estimate,
due in January 2001, will not show another increase, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recently approved legislation to provide $1.3 billion
to Colombia to fight narcotraffickers and the insurgents who
protect the drug trade.

<HEADLINE> Three Wildwood beaches closed in fecal coliform scare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILDWOOD, N.J. (AP) - The first ocean beaches to be closed to
swimmers this season reopened Thursday after fecal coliform counts
returned to normal, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Three beaches - at Schellenger, Lincoln and Montgomery avenues -
were ordered closed Wednesday by the Cape May County Health
Department. Water sampling Monday and Tuesday showed 300 to 1,600
fecal coliforms per 100 milliliters of water.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Jersey law, any beach whose water contains more than
200 fecal coliforms per 100 milliliters of water is automatically
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Fecal coliform is bacteria that indicates the presence of sewage
or animal waste. Often found in stormwater runoff, it is normally
present in the ocean, but at lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   Left unchecked, high fecal coliform levels can cause
gastrointestinal problems, including diarrhea or vomiting, in
bathers.
</P>
<P>
   Beachgoers took the closings in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you take the time to explain to them, people are happy,''
said beach patrol Capt. Lou Cirelli. ''New Jersey has the highest
standards in the country for water quality. They say thank you, and
they'll walk a block or so. Nobody likes the negative publicity,
but we understand it. It's news.''
</P>
<P>
   City and state officials said Thursday they believe the increase
in fecal coliform counts was an isolated event caused, in part, by
heavy rain Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears to have been stormwater related,'' said David
Rosenblatt, who oversees ocean water monitoring for the state
Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not something that's happened in south Jersey for a
number of years, at least not in this particular area. It's a
reminder that we need to maintain our stormwater collection systems
as best we can,'' Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a municipality's responsibility to keep storm drains
clear, but seagull droppings and feces from domestic pets can also
contribute to the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, in a coastal area, where there's recreational
bathing and shellfishing, you have to pick up after your pets.
That's important,'' Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Duane Sloan said the city tries to clean its storm sewers
on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an isolated incident. We don't view it as a long-term
trend or something indicative of any serious problem,'' Sloan
said.

<HEADLINE> Vote Set on France Presidential Term  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- President Jacques Chirac said Thursday he would ask
French voters to approve a referendum to shorten the presidential
term from seven to five years.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast live on television and radio, Chirac said
the referendum to amend the French constitution would take place
Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The long-debated reform is likely to dim the luster of France's
most powerful office. However, Chirac said the change would help
breathe new life into France's democracy, and asked people to vote
yes. He said shortening the presidential term would give voters the
chance more often to have a say in electing the head of state.
</P>
<P>
   A strong yes vote would likely boost Chirac's popularity and
authority, but a low turnout could also damage his prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, who is expected to run for a second term in 2002, could
get a boost in popularity with a strong yes. However, a low turnout
could also damage his prestige.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac, a conservative, had long opposed proposals for the
change, but he recently bowed to political pressure, primarily from
the Socialist Party, and expressed support for the reduced mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has wide backing among the Socialists, who hold a
majority in parliament. Opinion polls show that French would easily
approve the change in a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, French presidents can serve two
consecutive terms, staying in office for 14 years. Following the
long administration of the late President Francois Mitterrand, many
French came to feel that 14 years was an excessive period for a
president to hold such a powerful office.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the new presidential term would take effect as of
the 2002 presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal could limit the length of ''cohabitation,'' the
French term to describe a situation when the president and the
prime minister come from opposing political camps, as is the case
today.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of ''cohabitation'' say the system is unwieldy, while
others say having a government from the opposition is a healthy
check on presidential powers.

<HEADLINE> Longer holiday weekend means more arrests; deaths steady  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - With an extra day for the July 4th weekend,
New York's drivers sped more, drank more and crashed more, state
police said.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of people killed stayed the same and the number
injured decreased, according to State Police Superintendent James
W. McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   From Saturday through Wednesday, troopers investigated five
crashes in which six people died and 199 crashes in which 264
people were hurt. Six people died in six fatal crashes in 1999
while 281 were injured in 218 crashes last year when the holiday
weekend lasted only four days.
</P>
<P>
   There were 548 reported property damage accidents, up from 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers wrote 299 tickets for drunken driving, up from 255 in
1999 and a total of 6,590 speeding tickets, an increase from 5,438
last year. Included in that number were 733 speeding tickets
written by patrols that targeted ''aggressive driving.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - They are the old warriors of East Harlem - whose
conquests of other worlds have filled them with sage advice and
made them a valuable asset to their community - even if they aren't
old enough to drive a car.
</P>
<P>
   So when four old warriors recently returned to their training
grounds at the East Harlem School at Exodus House, everyone came to
listen to them describe living far from the projects - at some of
the nation's more prestigious prep schools.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, that is, but David Ward.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-year-old eighth grader, sent home for arguing with a
superior, missed what is considered a sacred event. While David
could have benefited from the session, the suspension served as a
deeper lesson for one of this private middle school's gifted, yet
stubborn students.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a lot more passionate and interested student than I've
ever known,'' said teacher Laurent Alfred, who has taught David for
four years. ''But it's hard for him to focus sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools might not highlight a student's flaws. But the East
Harlem School's four core teachers and its handful of
administrators shine a scalding light on them, trying to burn away
bad traits. Education never stops for the 63 boys and girls, all
from minority groups, and the lessons are more than books,
multiplication tables and science projects.
</P>
<P>
   Students who struggled elsewhere - some are castoffs from public
schools - are challenged to be better people. They're told that
maybe, if they push themselves, they can attain the success enjoyed
by the old warriors - the term the school uses for its graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look for a much more holistic approach with the students,''
Alfred said. ''And we look for the kids that don't do so well. If
not for this school, a lot of these students would be floundering,
and I mean brilliant students.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every child succeeds. School officials say they don't have a
list of kids who dropped out or were expelled, but the numbers are
fewer these days than when the school first opened, partly because
administrators failed to make it clear how strict they planned to
be.
</P>
<P>
   The children have a dress code of white shirts, navy blue pants
or skirts, and dress shoes. They aren't supposed to date one
another. They must sit and walk with an upright posture, speak
English properly and sign a contract to skip television on school
nights. Strict punishments are doled out to those who break the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   But those are just physical lessons. The real education digs
into deeper issues of intellect and morality to create a person
with a sense of self and community, a radically different sort from
many who walk the streets of East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   When eighth graders presented their final project before the
whole school, principal and co-founder Ivan Hageman sat quietly in
the rear to hear their report on ''Science and Revolutionary Change
with Society.'' He had been pessimistic about the eight students'
chosen topic, thinking it was too much for them to understand and
describe with any true meaning.
</P>
<P>
   But after the 90-minute presentation, an impressed Hageman
praised the students for ''synthesizing'' so much information. Then
he tested them with a series of questions, ones that left younger
students shaking their heads in confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Hageman, who graduated magna cum laude from Harvard, asked about
religion's ''reductory role in society'' and about whether humans
have truly evolved as a species from 150,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want them to feel pressure, anxiety on an intellectual
level,'' Hageman explained.
</P>
<P>
   Though in their early teens, the students had answers. Hageman
beamed. The session was exactly what he and his brother, Hans, had
in mind when Exodus House evolved into a middle school seven years
ago. The four-story facility, which their parents started as a drug
rehab house in the 1980s, has become a nugget of hope hidden within
a neighborhood of despair.
</P>
<P>
   Though their now-deceased parents - their father was white and
their mother black - had modest incomes, the Hagemans attended
private schools from an early age. Hans, 42, became a defense
lawyer and Ivan, 41, a teacher. Eventually, Ivan decided he wanted
to work with youngsters before they got into trouble - when he
could still make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the school, the brothers had to confront drug
dealers working across the street, who eventually agreed to move
elsewhere, and to accomplish the more important task of raising
money.
</P>
<P>
   It was a struggle, but the Hagemans relied on ties they'd made
to the cultural elite. An old high school friend, John F. Kennedy
Jr., was a board member of the Robin Hood Foundation and prodded it
to donate seed money. The brothers also turned to the rich and
prominent to help keep the school running.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition ranges from $100 to $300 a month for parents who can
afford to pay. But because no one gets turned away for lack of
money, cash must be raised from other sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''Funding is slowly resolving itself,'' Ivan Hageman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagemans, starting to feel comfortable about the future,
want to undertake a major capital improvement plan - at a cost of
up to $7 million - which includes gutting and renovating a
neighboring building.
</P>
<P>
   But where the school truly earns its marks is in the classroom.
Each class begins with a minute of silence because ''it's a way to
get them engaged, to make a transition, so they realize it's almost
a sacred place here,'' explained Alfred.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers employ an interdisciplinary style, which for example
means mixing English with math. Classes are frequently
conversations led by teachers, and if the students latch onto
something good, the lack of a bell system allows the discussion to
continue into the next session.
</P>
<P>
   At least three times a week, students follow Ivan Hageman on a
field trip that he calls ''the warrior walk.'' At times, the
students stroll quietly, taking periods to meditate. At others,
they jog, strengthening their bodies, giving them a sense of
toughness.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of these kids are coming from war zones,'' Ivan Hageman
said. ''Some of these kids, because they come from a war zone, they
haven't allowed themselves to feel. We want them to feel the pain,
and the positives.''
</P>
<P>
   David called the warrior walk ''a driving force - it's what you
want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ''But for us, young men, it's convoluted. They
want to be sure we become men, but a warrior comes out of having a
strong man ... who is dominant. But what we want is not dominance
of others, but dominance of yourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that sort of analysis that led Peter Bidstrup, director of
admissions at the Governor Dummer Academy in Massachusetts, to
recruit David. He saw a born leader in the sleek hockey and
lacrosse star who also plays the violin. He also saw a child who
has overcome the difficulties of both being adopted and of being
black with a white mother.
</P>
<P>
   Bidstrup also saw possibilities that the East Harlem School
could benefit an institution like Governor Dummer, America's oldest
boarding school, opened in 1763.
</P>
<P>
   ''David has tremendous presence and confidence, and I see a
student who is ready to grow,'' Bidstrup said. ''We would love to
have a pipeline from a school like East Harlem. It's a school that
in many ways gives us our life's-blood.''
</P>
<P>
   That puts pressure on David to perform. If he does well, he will
cut a new path for future ''warriors.'' David says he's not even
considering the possibility of failure after his lessons at the
East Harlem School, which he graduated from last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''This school did so much for me,'' he said. ''It's the best
thing that ever happened to me, besides being adopted.''

<HEADLINE> American Express chairman denies fee scheme  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Taking the witness stand Thursday at an
antitrust trial, an American Express Co. official fended off
suggestions that his company plotted to promote inflated credit
card fees at the expense of the average consumer.
</P>
<P>
   American Express chairman Harvey Golub conceded that billions of
dollars are at stake over the rates merchants are charged when a
customer uses a credit card - costs often passed on to consumers.
But he denied trying to lure banks away from Visa and MasterCard
and into deals with American Express so that the banks would adopt
higher rates charged by his company.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, Visa's attorney pushed Golub about a
speech he made in 1996 to a credit card conference. Golub at the
time attacked the credit card associations' rules that prevent
member banks from issuing cards other than Visa and MasterCard and
urged that the banks seek ''terms that would also allow you to work
with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Golub said he was looking out for the ''best interest'' of both
the banks and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I would define that interest as doing business with us,''
he said before concluding two days of testimony at the trial in
U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department contends in its antitrust suit against
Visa USA Inc., Visa International and MasterCard International Ltd.
that the card companies violated antitrust law by limiting
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that the same group of banks control both Visa
and MasterCard, thwarting competition between the two networks. It
also accuses the card companies of adopting rules designed to
discourage banks from doing business with American Express, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.'s Discover card and others.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and MasterCard have denied the allegations. They have
accused American Express of lobbying federal authorities into suing
Visa and MasterCard as part of a ''trench warfare'' battle plan.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued after Golub's testimony, Kelly Presta,
Visa's vice president for public affairs, said that banks,
retailers and consumers ''are too smart'' to fall for American
Express' arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ''They know the real story, even if Harvey Golub continues to
deny the real cause of his company's problems: high-priced products
and even higher merchant fees,'' Presta said.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and MasterCard also claim American Express has sought to
''cherry pick'' their biggest and best bank customers at the
expense of consumers. In testimony on Wednesday, Golub said
American Express would like to partner with many banks in the
United States, not just the largest.

<HEADLINE> Germany Steps Up Border Security  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE BOEHMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany will reimpose controls along
its borders to screen out members of Iranian opposition groups who
may try to disrupt next week's visit by Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry said it has received ''serious tips'' that
Iranian opposition groups, including some based outside Germany,
are planning disturbances during Khatami's visit on July 10-12 --
the first by an Iranian leader to Germany since Iran's 1979 Islamic
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary border controls, which begin Friday, will include
passport checks. A 1995 agreement by Germany and eight other
European Union nations allows citizens to travel freely across
their borders without passports, but controls can be restored in
special circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also reportedly have placed travel restrictions on
Iranian exiles living in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A German newspaper reported that security concerns are also
prompting Iran to reconsider the trip. In a report to appear
Friday, the Die Welt newspaper cited German officials as saying
they were uncertain if the visit would even take place after
security issues were repeatedly raised by an Iranian delegation in
Berlin ahead of the president's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami apparently fears that protests during the visit may
endanger his political position at home, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A group of German writers appealed Thursday to Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder to bring up imprisonment and harassment of
Iranian writers and journalists in his talks with Khatami. In a
letter, the PEN writers club said that even though Iran had signed
the U.N. Human Rights Charter, intellectuals in the country are
imprisoned for expressing their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   A senior lawmaker from Schroeder's Social Democrats, Gernot
Erler, said the visit was meant to support Khatami's ''opening and
reform process'' in Iran, adding that ''alarming human rights
situation'' in Iran would ''of course'' also be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a moderate cleric elected in 1997, is seeking to revive
contacts with Western Europe. Relations with Germany were frozen
after a German court in 1997 ruled that the 1992 shooting death of
four Iranian dissidents in Berlin had been ordered at the highest
level in Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Second suspect pleads to helping torture disabled man  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - A second man involved in the torture of a
learning-disabled person at a party faces up to 10 years in prison
as a result.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Vistad, 24, of Middletown, pleaded guilty to conspiracy
and bias assault Wednesday in the Jan. 30, 1999, attack on Eric
Krochmaluk, 24, of Middletown.
</P>
<P>
   Eight people are charged in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Krochmaluk was bound to a chair and forced to perform several
embarrassing acts. Vistad and eight others allegedly shaved his
eyebrows, burned him with cigarettes, choked and beat him and
abandoned him in a forest. He was forced to kiss people's feet and
drink urine and warned that if he told police about the incident,
his parents' home would be burned down.
</P>
<P>
   Vistad, a former classmate of the victim's, said Wednesday he
and co-defendant William MacKay, 23, of Hazlet, plotted the attack
at a party at the home of two of the other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we came out, (the victim) was surprised to see us,''
Vistad said. Krochmaluk ''was given iced tea with (the liquor)
Everclear and told to drink it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Vistad said, he left the room and returned to find
Krochmaluk had been dressed in women's clothes and had had his head
shaved.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea agreement, Assistant Monmouth County Prosecutor
Jacquelynn Seely agreed not to seek a more severe sentence under
state bias crime statutes, which carry penalties of up to 20 years
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay pleaded guilty to the same charges. Both MacKay and
Vistad will be sentenced in October.

<HEADLINE> House Member Halts Ship Transfer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee chairman has halted the
transfer of a ship to the Dominican Republican until that Caribbean
nation extradites the accused killer of a New York City police
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government of the Dominican Republic has assured me on
several occasions that it will not allow its territory to be used
as a refuge for criminals,'' Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the
International Relations Committee, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite these assurances, the government of the Dominican
Republic has ignored the U.S. long-standing request for the
extradition of Pablo Almonte Lluberes, who is wanted for the 1988
murder of New York City police officer Michael Buczek,'' said
Gilman, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, a buoy tender valued at $3 million, was to be
transferred to the Dominican Republic this month by the U.S.
Defense Security Cooperation Agency, he said.
</P>

   As chairman of the International Relations Committee, Gilman has
the authority to halt certain types of U.S. assistance to foreign

<HEADLINE> Shape up or go hungry: Ferry's food operation cited as unsanitary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAPE MAY, N.J. (AP) - The operators of the Cape May-Lewes Ferry
have been given 30 days to fix ''very significant unsanitary
conditions'' in the food operations on two of their ships.
</P>
<P>
   The violations were spotted during routine inspections of the MV
Twin Capes and the MV Cape May by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. They included unsanitary employee food handling,
equipment problems and the serving of undercooked hot dogs and
coffee creamers that weren't adequately chilled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have complaints of illness, but the potential was
there,'' said Ray Abrahams, director of compliance for the FDA's
office in Parsippany.
</P>
<P>
   He called the problems ''very significant unsanitary
conditions'' and placed the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which
operates the ferry service between New Jersey and Delaware, on
''provisional status.'' The ships can continue to serve food in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's our goal to not only meet the expectations, but to exceed
the FDA regulations,'' said James Salmon, a spokesman for the
authority. ''(DRBA chief operating officer Jeff Lewis) has taken
immediate action on equipment, training, the warehouse operation
and cleanliness issues.''

<HEADLINE> Millions in SBA Funds Said Misspent  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An audit found the Small Business
Administration misspent millions of dollars earmarked to help
minority businesses win federal contracts. The agency has promised
to repay the money, which came from other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The findings by the SBA's inspector general prompted a strong
rebuke from Sen. Christopher Bond, chairman of the Small Business
Committee and frequent critic of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The SBA treats the funds for minorities as ''a honey pot they
can dip into to sweeten other programs,'' said Bond, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''If taxpayers ever want to see how a government agency can look
the other way while tax money is being used for everything but its
intended purpose, all they have to do is read this report,'' Bond
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   SBA officials acknowledged mistakes but said they were
inadvertent. They also said the money went to closely related
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used funds for programs we thought we could use them for,''
said James Ballentine, the SBA associate deputy administrator who
oversees the Small Disadvantaged Business program.
</P>
<P>
   The program certifies the minority status of federal contractors
and is funded by 19 federal agencies. Over the past two years, the
program spent $22 million, $13.6 million of which was reviewed by
the office of SBA Inspector General Phyllis Fong.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors questioned $6.2 million in spending, including money
for five computers, eight monitors, one scanner, one fax machine,
four cellular phones and 17 pagers that were kept in storage for
more than a year. The agency also purchased 240 desk chairs for
only 118 employees, which auditors found cost $56,758 more than
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found $3 million clearly was misspent and identified
another $3.2 million as suspect. Ballentine said the SBA would
refund $3.9 million to federal agencies from its general budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration created the Small Disadvantaged
Business program in response to a 1995 Supreme Court ruling, vowing
to ''mend not end'' affirmative action by overhauling the way in
which federal contracts are awarded to minority-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Initial estimates by the White House Affirmative Action Working
Group found that at least 160,000 businesses might be recognized as
SDBs, although the panel later revised its projection to 30,000 and
called for 122 full-time employees to run the program.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors said the agency met one-tenth of that projection,
certifying about 3,100 companies as SDBs.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we have seen, based on two years of history, is that that
number is overly optimistic, and we are doing a continuing
evaluation to see exactly what the correct number is and how we can
make improvements in the program to attract as many firms to being
certified as possible,'' Ballentine said.

<HEADLINE> Truck Hits Bus in Spain; 27 Die  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS DOYLE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SORIA, Spain (AP) -- A bus carrying teen-agers to a summer camp
crashed head-on Thursday with a truck that crossed into its lane,
killing at least 25 passengers and both drivers, officials said.
More than a dozen others were injured, several critically.
</P>
<P>
   The students, from two religious schools just outside Barcelona,
were nearing their destination when the accident occurred on a hill
near Soria, about 125 miles northeast of the capital, Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies of the victims were strewn across the road and in a steep
ditch where the bus had flipped, the officials said. The front end
of the bus was mangled in the collision and its seats scattered
around.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately known what caused the truck, which was
hauling pigs, to cross over into the oncoming lane of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Jose Lucas, president of the regional government of Castile
and Leon, described the scene as ''horrendous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a day of tremendous pain, especially when it deals with
young people who were going on holidays,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers collected the bodies in wooden coffins and
brought them to a sports complex in Soria, where parents will
identify them on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Weeping relatives seeking information about their children
gathered at the schools, where they were met by psychologists,
religious leaders and local politicians looking to try to console
them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the parents at Modolell de Viladecans were not told
whether their children were among the survivors or not as they left
Barcelona for Soria. Those who could not drive themselves were
taken on buses for the six-hour ride.
</P>
<P>
   A social worker who went on one of the buses and who identified
herself by her first name, Montse, said, ''The parents don't know
whether their children are dead or alive. We want to make the trip
with hope... The worse ride will be when they come back with the
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia expressed their ''profound
sadness'' to the crash victims' families, and French President
Jacques Chirac also sent his condolences.

<HEADLINE> Mayor asks, who's done more to fight mob than me? By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Responding to a book that claims members of his
family had ties to the mafia, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday
that his record prosecuting mobsters speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll stand on my record as having prosecuted or put in
prison more members of the mafia than probably any U.S. attorney in
history, having been threatened with death by them at least three
times - four times seriously going back to when I was an assistant
U.S. attorney, and if that's not enough to remove the mafia
prejudice than there's probably nothing you could do to remove
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''Is there anybody who's done more to end the
influence of the mafia than me?''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not dispute claims made by the book, ''Rudy! An
Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani,'' which paints an
unflattering portrait of the law-and-order mayor's family,
including descriptions of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the book's claims is that the mayor's father, Harold
Giuliani, spent a-year-and-a-half in Sing Sing for robbing a
milkman at gunpoint in the 1930s - a decade before Rudolph Giuliani
was born.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to read it, I'm not going to comment about it,''
Giuliani told reporters during a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The book, written by Village Voice reporter Wayne Barrett, says
Giuliani's cousin, Lewis D'Avanzo, was a mob associate who ran a
major car theft ring. It also says the FBI suspected that D'Avanzo
- who went to school with Giuliani and attended the mayor's wedding
to his first wife - was involved in several murders.
</P>
<P>
   D'Avanzo was killed in Brooklyn by FBI agents in 1977 when he
tried to run down an agent who had stopped him on a warrant for
transporting 100 stolen luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   The book also claims that the mayor's father, Harold Giuliani,
and uncle, Leo D'Avanzo, had ties to the mob as well. According to
the book, the two were involved in a shootout with a member of the
mob on a Brooklyn street in the early 1960s over a loansharking
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The book is scheduled to be published July 11. Excerpts were
provided to reporters this week by the publisher, Basic Books, and
portions were printed in this week's Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani died in 1981 at age 73 of prostate cancer, the
same disease that forced the mayor to drop his U.S. Senate bid this
year against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was elected mayor in 1993, Giuliani earned a
reputation as a no-nonsense federal prosecutor bent on breaking the
mob. As U.S. attorney in 1986, he successfully prosecuted the heads
of three organized crime groups - Genovese crime family boss
Anthony ''Fat Tony'' Salerno, Colombo boss Carmine ''Junior''
Persico and Lucchese boss Anthony ''Tony Ducks'' Corallo.
</P>
<P>
   All were charged with racketeering and conspiracy. They received
sentences of 100 years each.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor, Giuliani also spearheaded the effort to free the
Fulton Fish Market of mob influence.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut Baseball Hall of Fame proposed for Bridgeport  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - Local leaders are trying to build a
Connecticut Baseball Hall of Fame and museum, using the
19th-century Bridgeport home of James O'Rourke, a member of the
National Baseball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   City officials recently agreed to sell the Queen Anne style home
for $1 to Michael Hoffman, a magazine publisher from Bridgeport who
hopes to raise up to $5 million to build the museum. The 1891 house
had been slated for demolition to make way for a retail project at
Steel Point, an old industrial site.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said the Hall of Fame and museum would be devoted to
honoring Connecticut's contribution to professional baseball - both
major and minor league players and teams.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the museum would be the home of O'Rourke, who
was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945. O'Rourke
began his professional baseball career in 1872, helping the Boston
Red Stockings and Red Caps to five pennants. In 1884, he captured
the National League batting title with a .350 average. He was
nicknamed ''The Orator'' because he attended Yale Law School.
O'Rourke died in Bridgeport in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   Other honorees would include National Hall of Famers Roger
Connor and Ned Hanlon.
</P>
<P>
   Connor, a Waterbury native, played for 18 seasons in the 1800s
and held the career home run record of 136 until Babe Ruth came
along in 1921 and hit 137 on his way to a career record of 714.
</P>
<P>
   Hanlon, from Montville, was a major-league manager for 19 years,
best-known for taking the last-place 1892 Baltimore Orioles to the
pennant in 1894.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman is now negotiating with the city to buy a piece of land
on which to move the house and build the museum.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stipulations of the city's agreement to sell
O'Rourke's home for $1 is that the home remain in Bridgeport and be
used for the baseball museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the (O'Rourke) house is moved and we get a chance to look
at the plan they submitted ... then we can continue the
negotiations,'' said Joe Gresko, a spokesman for Mayor Joseph P.
Ganim.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said he first got the idea when he was doing the
play-by-play for an exhibition baseball game in Bridgeport last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was saying to anyone who would listen to me, 'Why don't we
have a baseball museum?' '' said Hoffman, who said he has loved the
game since he played as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   He said that when he learned that the O'Rourke house was slated
for demolition, he asked the city to sell it to a new company he
formed, Connecticut Baseball Hall of Fame &AMP; Museum Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman said he hopes to use the house itself as a base for the
museum, then do a major addition with a scaled-down version of a
professional baseball stadium. He hopes to include baseball
memorabilia, art galleries, lecture halls and an interactive
exhibit where visitors can pitch against Hall of Famers such as
Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman estimates the project will cost $5 million or more to
build and take five to seven years to complete. But he says he
believes the museum could become a hot tourist destination, citing
the current popularity of the city's minor league team, the
Bridgeport Bluefish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have not found anyone who is not supportive of this
venture,'' Hoffman said. ''Everyone is quite excited about it, and
this is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, who publishes Sound People, a magazine that celebrates
Long Island Sound, said he is looking for financial backing for the
project from the city and state, and from corporations and private
donors.
</P>
<P>
   Gresko said officials have not decided yet whether the city will
support the project financially.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eyes GOP Aid in Patient Bill  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) -- Saying that ''all we need is one vote,''
President Clinton opened a drive to find a Republican senator who
might bend to election-year pressure and help pass a White
House-supported patients' rights bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are so close. We are one vote away,'' Clinton said
Thursday, standing on a University of Missouri stage with doctors
and nurses in white medical coats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton launched his appeal here to help Democratic Gov. Mel
Carnahan, battling to unseat Republican Sen. John Ashcroft in a
tight race. On Monday, the president will visit Philadelphia to
appear with Democratic Rep. Ron Klink, who is running against Sen.
Rick Santorum, a first-term Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also is considering visits later in Minnesota,
Michigan, Oregon and Delaware to try to make patients' rights an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ashcroft and Santorum voted for a Senate-passed Republican
measure containing limited patient protections, including a
restricted right to sue HMOs. Clinton said the GOP measure was a
patients' rights bill in name only and actually would take away
some of the protections that Missouri enacted in a patients' bill
that Carnahan signed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan is challenging Ashcroft to reverse his vote against the
White House proposal. Ashcroft accuses Carnahan of playing politics
with health care and says he is committed to reaching bipartisan
compromise this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Democrats' version amounts to health
insurance run by the federal government and would increase health
care costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has always been my goal to send an enforceable, responsible
patients' bill of rights to the president,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., head of a bipartisan committee working on compromise
legislation. ''What I will not do is pass a bill that would cause
employers to drop health insurance, dramatically increase costs and
force millions of Americans into the ranks of the uninsured.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP bill would exclude 135 million Americans
from coverage, restrict access to specialists, emergency rooms and
clinical trials and limit the right to sue. He promised anew to
veto the Republican bill, saying it would be ''dead on arrival'' if
it reaches the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamentally, patients must be able to hold health plans
fully accountable for harmful decisions,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need a real patients' bill of rights with real
accountability and real rights, not one that just provides cover
for the special interests,'' Clinton said. ''We don't need more
cover for them. We need more health care coverage for the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House-backed measure, rejected by the Senate June 8,
would give Americans broad new authority to sue their HMOs for
denial of care. The vote was 51-48, with four Republicans joining
44 Democrats in support of the bill. If the Republican vote count
slipped to 50, Vice President Al Gore could step in to cast a
winning vote.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation sponsored by Reps. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga.,
and John Dingell, D-Mich., cleared the House last year with the
support of most Democrats and many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited an analysis of the Republican bill, conducted by
Rutgers and George Washington universities at Dingell's request,
and said, ''The Senate bill would be even worse than the current
law. It would effectively wipe out protections that states like
Missouri have already passed and replace them with provisions that
would make it more difficult to hold plans accountable for harmful
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to Missouri from an overnight stay at his home in
Chappaqua, N.Y. Before returning to Washington, the president
stopped at a barbecue restaurant with Carnahan and his wife, Jean.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Seeking $40B in Aid  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Palestinians are asking for $40 billion in
international aid to set up independent state once a peace
agreement with Israel is completed, Yasser Arafat's top economic
adviser said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Khaled Salam said the aid would be needed for Palestinian
refugees, infrastructure, budget expenditures and an early
retirement fund. Salam, also known as Mohammed Rashid, said Israel
would not be expected to come up with most of the money, but
''Israel should feel and take great responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is hosting a summit with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Arafat at Camp David on July 11 to try to
work out a framework for a peace treaty. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will also participate along with other U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides seem locked into their present positions by
internal problems, as public support for the two leaders fades.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said chances for success at the summit meeting are no more
than 50 percent, ''like the toss of a coin.'' Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat predicted a second summit would be needed,
with negotiations in between.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed Barak's popularity at a low point, and Arafat, the
only consensus leader the Palestinians have ever had, was also
suffering in public opinion surveys. Looking over their shoulders
at their domestic opposition, the two leaders would find it
difficult to compromise at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Israeli settlers from the West Bank demonstrated
outside Barak's residence in Jerusalem, protesting his readiness to
give up significant parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are aiming for a target of Sept. 13 to complete a
peace treaty. Palestinians say they intend to declare an
independent state then, with or without a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Gaps are still wide. The Palestinians want a state in all of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip with the Arab section of Jerusalem as its
capital. Israel is offering most of the West Bank, but wants to
keep areas where most Israeli settlers live and insists on
sovereignty over all of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Salam, a member of the team that is to head to Camp David, said
the main problem is that Israel thinks in terms of ''what can I
give you.'' He said that the West Bank and Gaza belong to the
Palestinians, according to United Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   However, he sounded a conciliatory note, saying the Palestinians
understand that Barak has some constraints in reaching a deal he
can sell to the Israeli public. ''The PLO and the Palestinian
delegation is seriously willing to have maximum flexibility in
dealing with Israeli needs,'' he told reporters in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's military is preparing for violence in the West Bank,
according to a senior officer. Speaking on condition of anonymity,
he warned that Israel would use tanks, planes and helicopters
against Palestinian rioters if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In his first political speech since Barak trounced him in
elections in May 1999, former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
expressed support for the settlers and called for restraint on all
sides. ''This is a debate among brothers,'' he said, referring to
disagreements over Barak's peace policies, adding, ''There must be
no civil war.'' Netanyahu spoke at the settlement of Ofra,
celebrating 25 years since it was established.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Settles FBI Lab Documents Suit  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department agreed Thursday to pay
$355,000 in legal fees to settle a lawsuit brought by defense
lawyers and a whistleblower for release of documents from its
investigation of the FBI crime lab, a government spokesman and a
plaintiff said.
</P>
<P>
   And more than 53,000 pages of documents from the department's
internal investigation of the world-renowned FBI lab will be posted
on the Internet for the public to read and defense lawyers to comb
for possible evidence of government errors that might benefit their
clients.
</P>
<P>
   The government agreed that it would not charge the plaintiffs --
the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, freelance
writer and former NACDL spokesman Jack King and FBI lab
whistleblower Frederic Whitehurst -- for the 53,000 pages of
documents already released in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual element, the government also agreed that the
Justice Department inspector general's website will provide an
Internet link to the plaintiffs' website containing the documents.
</P>
<P>
   The link will be posted within the next 90 days at the site:
http://www.usdoj.gov/oig.igspecr1.htm.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the settlement, which
was filed after hours with the U.S. District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the allegations of Whitehurst, a lab chemist,
Inspector General Michael Bromwich investigated the world-renowned
crime lab for 18 months. In 1997, Bromwich blasted the FBI facility
for flawed scientific work and inaccurate, pro-prosecution
testimony in major cases including the Oklahoma City bombing. Five
lab agents were recommended for discipline.
</P>
<P>
   King said he believed the $355,000 that the government will pay
in fees for the plaintiffs' lawyers was the largest such amount in
the history of Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Charles Miller confirmed that the
settlement agreement had been signed and was being filed with the
court, but he did not know if the fees were a record amount.
</P>
<P>
   King said the more than 53,000 pages released included all but
three documents that the plaintiffs had sought. The government
wanted to continue to withhold those three, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the end of the case, but probably only the beginning
of a long fight to right the wrongs of the past 20 years,'' King
said. ''The inspector general's 517-page report exposed rampant
problems in the lab's Explosives and Materials and Analysis Units,
but the backup materials we have obtained also document problems in
other units, such as the DNA and Serology Unit.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The 53,000 pages of supporting documents will now be available
for review by the public,'' King added. ''We hope at least a few of
the federal and state prisoners wrongfully convicted by sloppy and
forged lab work and erroneous and false testimony by the dozen
former lab examiners named in the report might get new trials, fair
trials this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has undertaken a review of cases that
might have been affected by lab errors. Some testimony and evidence
has been either withdrawn, withheld or revised and some charges
have been dropped from multiple-count indictments. But the
government maintains that no defendant charged or convicted has
been totally exonerated as result of lab improprieties.

<HEADLINE> Spitzer announces sex bias settlement at two Cipriani restaurants  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said
Thursday that his office has settled a sex discrimination lawsuit
filed against the owners of the Rainbow Room and other upscale
Manhattan restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit centered on two restaurants owned by the Cipriani
family, Harry Cipriani on the Upper East Side, and Downtown in
Soho. The businesses admittedly hired only men for lucrative
positions as waiters, captains and bussers.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the case, Spitzer said, owners of the Cipriani family
restaurants signed a consent decree calling for at least 50 percent
of new hires at the two eateries to be women over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have also agreed to change the way they recruit
serving staff. Instead of the typical word-of-mouth advertising,
they must place newspaper ads that specifically encourage men and
women to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said he sued Harry Cipriani and Downtown because his
office received complaints about them and ''it's been known for
years that this was going on at the more expensive restaurants, but
nothing had been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's investigation began in May 1999. He said it found that
women faced ''a glass ceiling'' which prevented them from getting
some of the most desirable and most lucrative jobs in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''This settlement with Cipriani is a model that will break that
ceiling,'' Spitzer said. The settlement terms could stay in effect
for more than three years if a court-ordered monitor finds
noncompliance.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the settlement, Spitzer released transcripts of
telephone conversations with two female applicants who were told at
Cipriani Wall Street that they simply did not hire women as
servers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just calling to see ... Is there any way you might
reconsider your policy on that? I'm really an excellent waitress,''
the caller said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure you are. I'm sure you are,'' replies Lucio Vanon, the
manger of the two restaurants. ''Not really. We don't have any
girls in any of our places, you see.''
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said those statements ''are about as direct an admission
of liability as you'll ever find.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani's lawyer, Christy Reuter, said her client denied doing
anything wrong but was pleased with the settlement. She said the
restaurant had begun hiring women before the settlement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Guiseppe Cipriani, president of the company and son of Harry
Cipriani, acknowledged that at the two restaurants named in
Spitzer's lawsuit, ''We actually didn't have any women. In the rest
of our company we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cipriani said he was happy with the settlement. ''I really think
we reached a fair agreement, fair to all sides,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has hired four women at Harry Cipriani and ''a
couple'' at Downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Including the Rainbow Room in Rockefeller Center, the Ciprianis
own four restaurants in New York City with a fifth scheduled to
open at Grand Central Terminal in October.
</P>
<P>
   The family also owns bar-restaurants in Europe, including
Harry's Bar in Venice.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Up 97; Dow Falls 2  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks ended a volatile session with mixed
results Thursday. Most technology shares bounced back from a steep
selloff in the previous session, although worries about earnings
hurt blue-chip names, including IBM.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.13 points to close at
10,481.47.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators recovered from earlier losses and
closed higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.44 at
1,456.67 and the Nasdaq composite index was up 97.47 at 3,960.57.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks shook off early weakness as investors began bargain
hunting, snapping up shares of companies that have been battered in
recent sessions. Oracle rose $3.313 to $75.625.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, semiconductor stocks that tumbled on Wednesday staged
a modest recovery. LSI Logic rose $2.25 to $52.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange and Altera rose $8.125 to $100.563 on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Also, energy stocks recovered after a number of analysts said a
selloff on Wednesday was overdone. The sector suffered after Saudi
Arabia said it would begin pumping an additional 500,000 barrels of
crude oil per day.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon Mobil rose $1.25 to $78.188.
</P>
<P>
   But concerns about corporate earnings lingered. With interest
rates rising, investors have become worried that corporate profits
will suffer, and in Wednesday's session, a flurry of profit
warnings sent technology stocks dramatically lower.
</P>
<P>
   Some weakness persisted on Thursday. IBM fell for a fourth
straight session as investors worried that its second-quarter
results will miss expectations. Merrill Lynch analyst Steve
Milunovich fueled those fears with a research note indicating that
companies that do business with IBM are struggling, and may cut
back on orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought (the second quarter) would be difficult for IBM but
it appears there may be further risk to our numbers, though we are
making no changes,'' Milunovich told clients. IBM fell $2.188 to
$101.563.
</P>
<P>
   Investors continued their recent pattern of moving money from
sector to sector without showing any real conviction. Thursday, the
drug stocks that have performed well in recent weeks fell prey to
profit-taking. Johnson &AMP; Johnson was down $1.313 to $99.688 and
Merck was down $1.813 at $75.375.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said it may be difficult for the market to make a solid
advance until companies begin reporting actual numbers later this
month. Even then, argued Charles Pradilla, chief investment
strategist at SG Cowen Securities, investors will apply fierce
standards. Technology stocks, which are still expensive relative to
many old-economy stocks, will face the toughest scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ''When an asset is expensive, very minor disappointments can
kill the stock,'' he said. ''With very high valuations, there's
very little room for error. They take them out and shoot them if
anything goes wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM wasn't the only high-profile technology stock to tumble.
Hewlett-Packard fell $1.25 to $118.375 and JDS Uniphase lost $5 to
$114.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.04
billion shares, slightly behind Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, the breadth was much worse, with three stocks
falling for every two that rose.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 5.07 at 523.32.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.9 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index fell 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
rose 0.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court says it will hear police killer's parole case  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Convicted police killer Thomas Trantino
will remain in prison at least until Sept. 25, the date the state
Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on a judge's order to parole
him.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Thursday it will consider an appeal by Attorney
General John J. Farmer Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The one-page order signed by Associate Justice Gary S. Stein
offered no reason why the court decided to take the case. It also
gave no details as to any vote by the justices.
</P>
<P>
   The court agreed June 16 that the lower-court order sending
Trantino to a halfway house to prepare him for release would be on
hold while an appeal is considered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am pleased that the state Supreme Court, recognizing the
gravity of this matter, has granted the state's petition for
certification,'' Farmer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I continue to believe that the decision of the state Parole
Board, which was rendered after careful review and evaluation of
Mr. Trantino's record as an inmate, was correct,'' Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino's lawyer, Roger Lowenstein, did not immediately return
calls Thursday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman, who ordered Farmer to
pursue the appeal, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's directive came after a decision published June 9
by a three-judge appeals panel. The panel said Trantino's latest
parole hearing was faulty and he deserved to be released after 37
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino, who was convicted of killing two Lodi police officers
in 1963, was denied parole at least nine times during his 37 years
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel said in a 66-page opinion that Trantino's
latest rejection by the state parole board was ''not supported by
any credible evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Trantino was sentenced to die for killing officers Gary Tedesco
and Peter Voto in a bar in August 1963. But when New Jersey's death
penalty was overturned in 1972, Trantino's sentence was changed to
life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing guidelines in effect at the time made Trantino
eligible for parole in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   After an earlier appeal, Trantino earned another chance at
release and a hearing before the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   At a June 1999 session, the board rejected Trantino's plea for
parole. Board members relied on a number of points, including
claims by prison mental health examiners that he would likely
commit another crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Trantino argued on appeal that parole board members ignored
several key points on his behalf. Trantino cited a prison record
that showed no infractions since 1970 and a report from a private
doctor and other tests that said he appeared to be a good candidate
for parole.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Lazio should rename bus ''Double-Talk Express  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON CITY, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday
charged that her Republican Senate rival, Rep. Rick Lazio, was
engaging in ''personal insults'' and should rename his ''Mainstream
Express'' campaign bus, the ''Double-Talk Express.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard for me to get this straight. I mean, last week, he
was telling New Yorkers he wasn't responsible for his voting record
and this week he's telling us that he's not responsible for his
fund-raising letters,'' the first lady told reporters after a town
hall-style meeting at a Lockheed Martin plant near Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Instead of the 'Mainstream Express,' he ought to call it the
'Double-Talk Express,''' she said. ''He's got moderate talk on the
campaign trail and extreme rhetoric in his (fund-raising) mail.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a direct mail fund-raising appeal that came to
light Wednesday in which Lazio told potential donors that ''Hillary
Clinton and her husband have embarrassed our country and disgraced
their powerful posts.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday about that language, the first lady said, ''I'm
just not going to respond to his personal insults. I'm just going
to run a campaign on issues, not insults, as I've tried to do now
for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppered by reporters for a second day with questions about his
fund-raising letter, Lazio said he had still not had a chance to
read it even though it had gone out over his signature. He also
continued to brush off its significance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand that there are many people that want to create a
smokescreen, try and divert attention from the true facts, which is
that I have a legislative record of serving the people of New York,
that we need to try and try very hard to communicate that record to
the people of New York and we're going to try and do that,'' the
congressman said during the fourth day of a five-day bus trip
across upstate New York, a key battleground in New York's U.S.
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without getting into an argument with you, the real question
is why has my opponent done six television commercials attacking me
and trying to distort my record?'' Lazio added. ''I have not had
any television commercials attacking her or distorting her record.
But she has chosen to go negative and to stay negative during this
campaign. I am trying very hard to talk about the issues that I
think New Yorkers care about.''
</P>
<P>
   During her more than one-hour meeting with employees of the
Lockheed Martin plant, Clinton was asked about the negative tenor
of American political campaigns. She used the opportunity to decry
that and to argue that she wasn't engaging in negative campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't called him any names. I will never call him names,''
Clinton said. ''As far as I know, he's nice person ... But I want
you to know where he stands on issues and where I stand on
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came as Clinton kicked off her own five-day swing
across upstate New York, a sort of anniversary tour of the trip she
took across the state last July after visiting the farm of Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan to officially begin her Senate campaign.
Democrat Moynihan is retiring at the end of this year. It is his
Senate seat that Clinton and Lazio are fighting over.
</P>
<P>
   During her news conference Thursday, Clinton also faced
questions about her support for the death penalty. While saying she
remained a death penalty supporter, the first lady also said that
''in many states today it is being asked for much too often.'' She
also said that too often mistakes were being made that led to
improper convictions and death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd better do a better job than we're doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a Democratic picnic in Endicott, Clinton told more
than 1,100 enthusiastic Democrats, ''some people say I have an
agenda. Well, I do have an agenda ... I have an agenda to keep our
national economic prosperity going.''

<HEADLINE> Germany To Host 2006 World Cup  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Germany's in, South Africa's out, and
soccer failed to make a historic step to stage the World Cup in
Africa for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   In the closest vote ever, 12-11 with one abstention, Germany on
Thursday was awarded the 2006 World Cup over South Africa even
though the president of soccer's world federation campaigned
heavily for the African nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was a little bit sad that the executive committee had not
the courage to innovate,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter said. ''We
have to trust Africa and we have to take this decision. We have to
take the risk, otherwise they will never have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a stunner even to the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Actually, I'm surprised,'' former German star Franz
Beckenbauer said after spearheading his country's campaign. ''I'm
not prepared for this because you can't be prepared for this. It
was a very close result. We'd hoped for this but we couldn't expect
it.''
</P>
<P>
   South African President Thabo Mbeki called it a ''tragic day for
Africa,'' while former English star Terry Paine was angered by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's 10 times for Europe now, and no times for Africa,''
Paine, who threw his support behind South Africa after England, as
well as Morocco, were eliminated in the first rounds of balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel particularly sorry for (bid leader) Danny Jordaan, who
has really led the fight with tremendous commitment and passion,
and for all the African people. We just wonder when Africa can
indeed get the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   A FIFA official dismissed a reported bribery attempt before the
vote as ''not to be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The BBC reported that Jack Warner, the Trinidad representative
on FIFA's executive committee, said he and several of his
colleagues woke up on Thursday to find letters under their hotel
room doors. He said the letters claimed to be from someone
supporting the German campaign and offered a cash gift in return
for their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Warner said he and the other delegates believed the letter to be
a hoax, but added that the matter was discussed before the final
ballot and that Blatter was upset and very angry at the news.
</P>
<P>
   ''The feeling of those members of the committee who received
this letter purporting to be from a member of one of the bidding
committees was that it was not to be taken seriously,'' FIFA
spokesman Keith Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup is the biggest sports event on the planet, with a
two-year-long qualifying stage that winnows almost 200 teams to a
final group of 32 nations. The final rounds last a month and
attract billions of fans watching on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Olympics, the World Cup gives the countries that stage
it unprecedented exposure and the chance to pump billions of
dollars into their economies.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic vote by FIFA's executive committee ended four years
of campaigning by the bidding countries. Down to the final four in
Thursday's vote, England and Morocco were eliminated in the first
two rounds, and Germany and South Africa were tied at 11 votes
each.
</P>
<P>
   In the final round, with 24 people voting, two voters had to
change their minds. One went for Germany; the other, New Zealand's
Charles Dempsey, chose to abstain.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had promised us that, if England were eliminated before the
final round, his vote would come to South Africa,'' said Emmanuel
Maradas, a member of the South African bidding team.
</P>
<P>
   If Dempsey voted for South Africa to make it 12-all, Blatter
would have cast the deciding vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always knew that UEFA (the European soccer union) carries
big votes, so they had a very strong starting position,'' Jordaan
said. ''This was a very transparent, very open process, and it
strengthened the whole debate on Africa's role within global
football.
</P>
<P>
   ''But Africa is one of the biggest blocs in FIFA. There is often
a reference to the FIFA membership as the 'footballing family.' You
can't have a family and feed only one child and leave the others to
starve.''
</P>
<P>
   FIFA inspectors gave top marks to Germany's plans for the
tournament, which will kick off on June 9, 2006 at Munich's Olympic
stadium, with the final to be played July 9 in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa initially was the overwhelming favorite and
apparently had been boosted by Brazil's last-minute withdrawal
Monday in its favor. Beckenbauer said on Tuesday Germany had even
considered withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   Voters were not required to explain their decision, although
David Will, a high-ranking FIFA official from Scotland, said there
may have been concerns about sending the cup to Africa so soon
after awarding it to Asia for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 World Cup was held in France, and the 2002 Cup will be
staged in South Korea and Japan. Germany last hosted the World Cup
in 1974 as West Germany.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa, long excluded from international sports because of
its apartheid regime, figured Blatter's support would be enough to
secure the World Cup. While it was shunned by the International
Olympic Committee in bidding for the 2004 Summer Games, it played
host to the Rugby World Cup in 1995. The rugby tournament is a much
smaller event.
</P>
<P>
   Before the vote, Blatter, the head of soccer's world governing
body, implored FIFA to 'Make history! Take the World Cup to
Africa!''
</P>
<P>
   When it didn't, Blatter tried to console the South African
delegation, kissing members' cheeks, patting their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sad, too,'' Blatter told them quietly. ''I did everything
I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Morocco was the first country eliminated in the voting, and
England went out after the second vote.
</P>
<P>
   England's cause was severely damaged by the violence of English
hooligans in Brussels and Charleroi last month at the European
championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're proud of the your country you have a funny way of
showing it,'' Bobby Charlton, a former English star who served on
England's bid committee, said in addressing the hooligans.

<HEADLINE> Cyclist Crash Hurts Olympic Chances  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Cyclist Johnny Bairos of
Redlands, Calif., is recovering after a serious crash during a
World Cup race, a mishap that may jeopardize his Olympic prospects.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Cycling is scheduled to announce the men's and women's
track teams for the Sydney Olympics on Friday, and it's unclear
whether Bairos can race again by September.
</P>
<P>
   Bairos, 22, was hurt while competing in match sprint at a World
Cup event June 18 in Mexico City. Racing against three others, he
was pushed off the track and fell more than 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Bairos broke his jaw in two places, broke his right kneecap and
bruised his right thigh. He also shattered his right sinus cavity
and fractured the left sinus cavity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember going over the railing and then the next thing I
remember was waking up in the ambulance,'' Bairos said. ''People
were telling me that I was lucky to be alive after the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Bairos is on U.S. Cycling's long team, a pool of elite riders
eligible for the Olympic squad. On Thursday, team officials were
culling the list to 11 men and three women.
</P>
<P>
   Bairos is one of the top American sprinters. He rode on the
three-man U.S. squad that won the gold medal in Olympic sprint at
last year's Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   He had surgery in Mexico and, after returning to California,
underwent additional surgery to insert two screws in his kneecap.
His training since then has been limited to riding a stationary
bike.

<HEADLINE> Court write-in election ruling not as expensive as first feared  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey counties will have to provide
more detailed instructions on how voters can cast write-in votes,
but won't have to invest millions of dollars in new voting machines
as a result of a recent state Supreme Court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Two lawyers who represented parties in the case, in which
write-in candidates for local office in the Camden County town of
Chesilhurst won a second bite at the apple, said the ruling will
not take a huge bite out of county election budgets as first
feared.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the justices ordered only that counties prepare and post
instructions on how voters can cast tallies for write-in
candidates, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a much smaller impact now than what it could have been,''
said lawyer David Mapp, who represented the borough in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The trial court judge, in siding with the losing write-in
candidates' call for a new tally, ordered Camden County to purchase
new modern voting machines, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That would have cost $6 million alone in the county, and untold
millions statewide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court agreed with the trial judge - to a point.
Confusing write-in instructions cast doubt on the Chesilhurst
result, and the election ought to be redone, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the Supreme Court said only that the write-in instructions
were inadequate, that all we need to change is the instructions.
It's a great savings monetarily to taxpayers statewide,'' Mapp
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chesilhurst voters were confused about how to write in
votes in the November 1999 borough election, according to the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Democratic Mayor Arland Poindexter went on to win the
election, but only by a 20-vote margin in a race in which 342 votes
were cast. He bested write-in candidate Kati Gray-Sadler.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, two incumbent councilmen defeated two write-in
hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   However, some write-in votes were ruled invalid because the
voters wrote the candidates' name on the wrong line. Others were
not counted when voters used stickers with the candidates' names on
them that the voting machines evidently stripped off.
</P>
<P>
   Gray-Sadler and her running mates filed a lawsuit complaining
they were denied a fair chance.
</P>
<P>
   In last week's decision, the court ordered counties to include
more detailed write-in instructions on sample ballots and at
polling places to prevent another botched election.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney John Kearney, who represented the mayor, said the
ruling complicates election law. On one hand, it lowers the bar to
allow voter confusion to overturn election results. On the other,
it orders counties to limit voter confusion by providing more
precise instructions to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It adds a degree of uncertainty. Will the court be satisfied
with the new instructions?'' Kearney asked.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Returns to Reds Lineup  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. was back in the Cincinnati
Reds' lineup Thursday night and answering questions about his
absence a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey denied he removed himself from the second game of a
series against the NL Central-leading St. Louis Cardinals to
protest coverage on ESPN, which telecast Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said the real reasons were a stomachache and headache,
and he also denied reports that he called ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't lie ... I made all those calls. Yeah, right! I have no
idea what ESPN's number is, let alone call ESPN,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   If there were a problem, Griffey said, he'd let his agent deal
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no control over what ESPN shows or doesn't show,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said the only ESPN reporter he regularly speaks to is
Harold Reynolds, a former teammate on the Seattle Mariners. Griffey
said ''98 percent'' of what they discuss is banter of the sort
teammates would have.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only conversations I have had with Harold, I said they
show me mess up and then show somebody making a great catch right
after that,'' Griffey said. ''That's been going on for years,
that's the way it's always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey pinch-hit in the ninth inning Wednesday, flying out to
left. It was his first pinch at-bat since Sept. 24, 1992, when he
was with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey and the Reds entered Thursday night 10 games behind the
Cardinals. Griffey was in a 2-for-23 slump and his average was down
to .236.

<HEADLINE> Corning to add union workers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) - Corning Inc. plans to add as many as 100
union workers at four plants, the first time in six years it has
added union members to its employment rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen A. Mandell Sr., president of Local 1000 of the American
Flint Glass Workers Union, said the hiring plans represent a
turnaround for the union, whose membership dwindled to about 1,600
in recent years. During the 1990s, as many as 300 workers were laid
off at one time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be up over 3,000 before too long,'' Mandell told the
Elmira Star-Gazette.
</P>
<P>
   The company needs general production and maintenance workers,
machinists, electricians and process technicians for jobs at the
Erwin Ceramics, Big Flats, Fall Brook and Sullivan Park sites.
</P>
<P>
   The new jobs are a result of growth in Corning's businesses and
expansion of some of its Corning-area facilities. Corning Inc., the
region's largest employer, has more than 5,600 on its payroll in
the Twin Tiers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the existing contract, members of the multi-plant unit
make an average of $14.55 an hour and will go to $14.99 an hour
next year.

<HEADLINE> Auburn Seeks Bowden Assets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Auburn University lawyers said Thursday an
arbitration panel will resolve the school's claim that former
football coach Terry Bowden forfeited an $825,000 home mortgage and
car benefits when he became an ABC analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden, who resigned during the 1998 season, contends his work
with the television network does not violate terms of the
resignation settlement he reached with the university.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement says disputes will be resolved by a three-member
arbitration panel, with Auburn and Bowden each picking one and the
third agreeable to both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Franklin, an attorney for Auburn, said Bowden's lawyer
agreed Thursday to settle the dispute through the arbitration
process. Franklin said the university agreed to delay any action
for seven days so Bowden can select an arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   When Bowden resigned in 1998, he reached a settlement in which
Auburn paid him $625,000, took over an $825,000 mortgage on his
home, provided him with two cars and agreed to make annual payments
to him of $10,000 for home upkeep and $4,000 for car gas and
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Bowden was restricted in the type of work he could do
in the sports world and agreed not to make any negative comments
about the university, athletics officials and trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn lawyers contend the settlement gave Bowden rights to the
house for five years and the cars for three years only if he does
not work in specific fields, including as a ''radio, television, or
newspaper commentator, spokesman, analyst or announcer.'' The
university attorneys say he broke the agreement with his work as a
studio analyst for ABC last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden contends his contract work is not the kind of employment
described in the settlement language.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have at all times complied fully with the agreement between
myself and Auburn University,'' Bowden said in a statement
Thursday. ''I do not have full-time employment with ABC sports, but
work approximately 30 days per year as a 'free-lance artist.'''
</P>
<P>
   He signed a two-year extension to continue the ABC work this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement dispute became public recently after Bowden made
remarks critical of former coach Pat Dye and Auburn trustee Bobby
Lowder, a wealthy Montgomery banker who was instrumental in the
hiring of both Dye and Bowden. Bowden said Dye should have
''retired and moved on'' and that Auburn's problems could begin to
be fixed if Lowder was removed from the board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   Lowder declined to comment. Dye told sports radio station WJOX
in Birmingham on Wednesday that he would not comment, but he did
say Bowden had ''talked enough for both of us.''

<HEADLINE> Giants 6, Rockies 5  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- After losing three of four games in
Colorado last week, the San Francisco Giants vowed to get even at
home. They did just that, making it a four-game sweep for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kent's tiebreaking RBI double in the ninth gave the Giants
a 6-5 win Thursday over the Rockies, who have lost 12 straight in
San Francisco and have never won at Pacific Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller led off the ninth with a walk. J.T. Snow appeared
to bunt into a double play, but was awarded first when the umpires
ruled that a collision with pitcher Mike Myers (0-1) prevented Snow
from reaching first.
</P>
<P>
   Kent then doubled off the left-field wall against Stan Belinda,
giving Giants manager Dusty Baker his 600th career win and giving
San Francisco its sixth straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen (3-3) pitched one inning for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies, held to three runs in 45 innings while losing their
previous five games at the Giants' new park, were held to seven
hits by four San Francisco pitchers. But the Rockies drew eight
walks, and three of them scored.
</P>
<P>
   Each team scored a run in the eighth. Tom Goodwin had a
pinch-hit RBI single to give Colorado a 5-4 lead, and Rich Aurilia
responded with an RBI single in the bottom half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 4-0, the Giants hit for the cycle in the sixth to tie
the game. Mueller led off with a double and, one out later, Kent
had an RBI single. Ellis Burks followed with an RBI triple and
Felipe Crespo -- playing because of an injury to Barry Bonds -- hit
his second homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies scored three in the first on a bases-loaded walk
earned by Darren Bragg and a two-run double by Brent Mayne.
Colorado added a run in the sixth on Brian Hunter's RBI groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies starter Rolando Arrojo allowed four runs on eight hits
in seven innings. Russ Ortiz pitched the first 5 1-3 innings for
the Giants, allowing four runs on five hits and six walks.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's Todd Helton, who leads the NL with a .385 average,
had his 11-game hitting streak snapped when he went 0-for-3 with
two walks.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Colorado's Larry Walker missed his second straight game
with a sore right elbow. ... Bonds missed his fifth straight game
for the Giants with a hairline fracture in the tip of his right
thumb. ... Helton scored his NL-leading 82nd run in the first
inning. ... The teams split the season series 6-6. ... Bragg, who
came into the game batting. 217 with 14 walks in 64 games, walked
in each of his three plate appearances. ... Arrojo, who walked just
three batters in his previous four starts, gave up three walks and
hit a batter. ... The Giants have outscored opponents 80-45 in the
sixth inning. ... Jose Jimenez had his third blown save in 18
opportunities for the Rockies.

<HEADLINE> Attorney for convicted harness racer to ask for reduced sentence  </HEADLINE>
By J.J. THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The attorney for a harness racer convicted
of conspiring to fix races said he plans to request a lighter
sentence for his client due to an appellate court decision.
</P>
<P>
   In a ruling Wednesday, a state appellate court struck down two
factors Superior Court Judge Patricia Del Bueno Cleary used when
sentencing once-prominent harness racer Richard Wojcio in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling sends the case back to Superior Court for
resentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm hopeful the court will reduce the sentence in light of the
appellate court's striking of several of the aggravating factors
(used during sentencing),'' said Wojcio's attorney, Edward Plaza.
''And in light of the impact the decision has had on Mr. Wojcio and
his family.''
</P>
<P>
   The Attorney General's Office is pleased the court upheld
Wojcio's conviction, spokesman Chuck Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Wojcio was Freehold Raceway's top harness driver in 1995, when
he won 405 races and more than $2.4 million in purse money.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators accused him of conspiring with drivers before
three races in which he had bet. They claimed he helped other
drivers place second or third in two of those races.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Wojcio in 1998 of conspiring to fix races at
Freehold Raceway. He was cleared of charges of fixing races. He was
sentenced to 180 days in Monmouth County Jail, 500 hours of
community service and five years probation.
</P>
<P>
   He was allowed to remain free during his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ten issues were raised in the appeal, including whether Cleary
should have admitted into evidence certain statements made by
William Bresnahan. Bresnahan, a harness racer, cooperated with
authorities after they confronted him with evidence of his
involvement with race fixing, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate court affirmed the admission of Bresnahan's
statements into evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But it did agree with the defense's argument that Cleary erred
when she found that four aggravating factors applied when
sentencing Wojcio.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court struck down two of the factors - that there
was a substantial likelihood Wojcio was involved in organized
criminal activities and that the offense involved fraudulent or
deceptive practices committed against state government.
</P>
<P>
   The judges ruled that the definition of organized crime was
mistakenly applied in this case, and that no fraud or deception was
committed against the New Jersey State Racing Commission.

<HEADLINE> Hijacker Hid Weapons in Kids' Bags  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- A Syrian desperate to reach Germany hid a
pistol and grenade in the bags of his children, ages 5 and 3, as he
boarded a Jordanian jetliner on which his brother was also a
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes into the Syria-bound flight, Mahmoud Rizq Deeb
walked from the economy class Wednesday night, screamed at a flight
attendant and sprayed the aircraft with gunfire, recalled passenger
Abeer Bittar, a Syrian-American housewife from New Castle, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Deeb also tossed a grenade down the aisle, wounding 15 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was an explosion and panic,'' said Bittar, wounded with
shrapnel in her right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Deeb tried to move to the cockpit, but security guards shot and
killed him, said Mohammad Asfour, 33, a passenger who was also
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal aboard Royal Jordanian Airlines flight RJ435 carrying
84 passengers lasted four minutes, Asfour and airport officials
said. Security officers routlinely staff Royal Jordanian flights.
</P>
<P>
   A senior security official said questioning of Deeb's brother,
Ayman Deeb, revealed that the would-be hijacker smuggled the
grenade and the pistol in his children's bags and planned, if
questioned, to say they were just toys.
</P>
<P>
   Information Minister Taleb Rifai said Deeb, in his mid-30s,
planned to hijack the plane to Germany, where he wanted asylum. The
German Embassy in Damascus had turned down Deeb's request for a
visa.
</P>
<P>
   Rifai said Deeb was working alone and had no political motive.
</P>
<P>
   Deeb's family in Tartous, Syria, learned of the incident from a
television report. Bahaa Deeb, the younger brother, said Deeb was
an auto body repairman and was not close to his family.
</P>
<P>
   ''He suffered from anxiety and was not well,'' Bahaa Deeb said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader Dhahabi, chairman of Royal Jordanian Airlines, said the
grenade made a hole about 12 inches deep and 10 inches wide,
exposing some wiring in the aisle floor.
</P>
<P>
   Damages were minimal because the grenade was old and not
powerful, Rifai said.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft returned safely to Amman after the shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers on the Airbus A320 included Americans, Japanese,
Syrians, Lebanese, Kuwaitis and Jordanians. The wounded came from
Arab states, though many had dual citizenship, airport officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior hospital official said that the 15 suffered light to
moderate wounds and some victims had been released.
</P>
<P>
   One Jordanian Cabinet official said Syrian security authorities
told Jordan that Deeb had served time in a Syrian jail. He declined
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, Jordanian planes were the target of
terrorist attacks by Palestinian guerrillas critical of the late
King Hussein's moderate policy toward Israel. But recent years have
seen no hijacking attempts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador William Burns, whose country last week said it
had received threats against its Amman embassy, sent a message of
appreciation on Thursday to Jordan's King Abdullah II.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jordan's actions reflect its strong commitment to continuing
to ensure safety and security in the country,'' said the message
made available to The Associated Press.

<HEADLINE> Cranberry Production Ordered Cut  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the country awash in cranberries, the
government has decided to force farmers to cut production or dump
about 15 percent of their crop this fall to winnow down the surplus
and reverse a downward spiral in prices for the tart fruit.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department is ordering the production limit at
the behest of the two biggest cranberry producers, Ocean Spray
Cranberries Inc. and Northland Cranberries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on consumer prices will be modest, USDA officials
said Thursday, and Ocean Spray, a grower cooperative that accounts
for 70 percent of cranberry production, says it even plans to
reduce prices despite the production limit.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is an orderly marketing of product, then consumers in
the long run are better off because there is a steady supply of
product and a consistent supply. There was a potential for a number
of producers to go out of business,'' said Enrique Figueroa, USDA's
deputy undersecretary for marketing and regulatory programs.
</P>
<P>
   Under USDA's new limits, growers will be allowed this year to
sell only 85 percent of their usual production, which means they
will have to dispose of about 884,000 barrels of fruit, enough to
make almost 40 million gallons of cranberry juice cocktail.
</P>
<P>
   The cranberry surplus is so big that processors expect to have
about 4.6 million barrels of cranberries on hand in September --
about 80 percent of the nation's annual production -- when growers
start harvesting this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   The growers themselves caused the problem. Strong demand and
high prices for cranberries in the early 1990s spurred new people
to get into the business and led existing operations to expand
acreage, say industry experts. Cranberries grow on perennial vines
that don't start producing for two to three years after they are
planted.
</P>
<P>
   About a quarter of the nation's cranberry acreage has been added
since 1994, primarily in Wisconsin, which has surpassed
Massachusetts to become the commodity's leading producer.
</P>
<P>
   Prices paid to growers have dropped from a peak of $65.90 per
barrel in 1996 to $38.80 per barrel for the 1998 crop, and they are
expected to drop below $30 for the 1999 crop, USDA says.
</P>
<P>
   In some areas, farmers are earning less than $10 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've done what mankind has done since day one. We found a
void and we've filled it to overflowing,'' said John Sager, a
stockbroker who also grows cranberries near Wisconsin Rapids, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Sager got into the cranberry business in 1993 when the fruit was
selling for more than $50 a barrel. He harvested his first crop two
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Demand peaked in 1994 with per capita consumption of processed
berries at 1.7 pounds. It has since declined, to 1.6 pounds in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although the berries can be given to charity under the cutback
program, most farmers are likely to use it for compost or feed it
to wildlife or livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Growers say they are also trying to reduce their potential
yields this fall by doing such things as flooding bogs, something
they ordinarily wouldn't do until the berries are ready to be
harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean Spray spokesman Chris Phillips said the company would cut
prices to help clear the surplus but he wouldn't say by how much.
The company is also changing its labeling to try to stimulate
consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ocean Spray has to market, market, market in order to pull us
out of this surplus situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Growers also are trying to get taxpayers to help. The growers
have asked USDA, which purchases food for schools and various
nutrition programs, to buy the equivalent of 1 million barrels of
cranberries in juice, sauce and other products. The department so
far has bought about 40,000 barrels, mostly for trail mix.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, growers are considering forming a national
promotional program similar to the dairy industry's ''Got Milk?''
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Mexico President-Elect Feels Snubbed  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexico's democratic revolution apparently
caught U.S. presidential candidates off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   Both had snubbed overtures from the campaign of Vicente Fox, the
first opposition candidate to win Mexico's presidency in more than
a century, Fox aides said. But they did receive representatives
from his ruling-party opponent.
</P>
<P>
   And that has the Fox campaign seething.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. candidates didn't bet on democracy in Mexico,
although U.S. society did,'' said Carlos Salazar, director of
international relations with Fox's National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Fox aides said that after Sunday's elections, Al Gore and George
W. Bush both called Fox to offer their congratulations. Both made
several calls before Fox accepted either one.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers said both U.S. candidates were friendly toward the
campaign of Francisco Labastida of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, while spurning Fox's overtures.
</P>
<P>
   Bush met with Labastida's wife and his top foreign policy
adviser during an event in Los Angeles in April. Gore's campaign
maintained close relations with Labastida's through James Carville
and Stanley Greenberg, who were advising both campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bush let Fox advisers meet with two of his top aides,
he wasn't willing to receive a visit from Fox's daughter Ana
Cristina, who will act as first lady for the divorced Fox,
according to the Fox aides.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's representatives wouldn't meet with anyone from the Fox
campaign, the Fox aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. campaigns denied they spurned Fox. Bush spokesman
Scott McClellan noted that although Bush did not meet Fox during
the campaign, he had met him previously in his function as governor
as Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush looks forward to working with him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore campaign spokesman Jano Cabrera said Gore had ''a very good
conversation with Vicente Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He congratulated him on what he thought was an historic
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabrera said that Fox told the vice president he was planning to
come to Washington in the near future, and that the two men agreed
to get together.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the United States are crucial for any Mexican
president. Millions of Mexicans live in the United States, and the
3,000-mile border between the two countries can be a source of
tremendous conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, President Clinton's call did get through on
election night.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Fox ''would be welcome here at any time if he would
come up.'' Fox plans to take him up on the offer before his
swearing-in on Dec. 1, although he hasn't set a date yet.

<HEADLINE> Rules Proposed To Fight Black Lung  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Labor Department is proposing broad new
rules aimed at reducing black lung disease, the leading killer of
U.S. coal miners.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for overhauling the system of sampling, detecting
and controlling dust in mines. It was made public Thursday and
comes after the United Mine Workers of America filed a lawsuit
seeking changes.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, mine operators are responsible for sampling dust
levels. They submit the samples to the Mine Safety Health
Administration, which determines whether miners are overexposed to
the kind of dust that can cause black lung and other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   For years, miners and their advocates have charged that
companies failed to accurately measure dust or doctored their
samples to meet government standards. Under the proposal, about 100
federal inspectors would be hired to help with the sampling.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gets away from the fox guarding the hen house problem,''
said Davitt McAteer, assistant secretary of labor for mine safety
and health.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 86,000 U.S. coal miners working mainly in
Wyoming, West Virginia and Kentucky. The government estimates about
1,400 current or former miners die annually of black lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Watzman, vice president of safety and health for the
National Mining Association, said the companies are ready to rid
themselves of sampling duties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a no-win proposition for the operators today,''
Watzman said, noting that companies are suspected of cheating
whenever the findings meet government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes adopt recommendations by an advisory
committee that included mining industry and labor representatives.
Under the plan:
</P>
<P>
   --MSHA would verify the effectiveness of mine operators'
dust-control measures. No verification now is required.
</P>
<P>
   --Dust samples, collected six times per year, will be taken
during entire shifts. Now, the samples generally are collected over
eight-hour periods, although miners often work 10 and 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   --Inspectors will analyze dust levels in each area where miners
work. Currently, sample results from different parts of a mine are
averaged and do not take into account working in a specific area
breathing extremely dusty air.
</P>
<P>
   --Miners' representatives may observe the sampling.
</P>
<P>
   The United Mine Workers reacted cautiously to the proposed
changes. Joe Main, health and safety administrator for the union,
said he wanted to review them before commenting.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lawsuit, and the actions surrounding the lawsuit, was a
catalyst for these last-minute rules we are seeing in the Clinton
administration,'' Main said.
</P>
<P>
   McAteer disagreed, saying the proposal has been in the works for
five years.
</P>
<P>
   A public comment period on the proposal is expected to last
until Aug. 24, after which the rules will be finalized.

<HEADLINE> Navy will repair damage to neighborhood  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WILLOW GROVE, Pa. (AP) - The Navy promised Thursday that it will
repair the downed trees and burned earth where two Navy pilots died
last month during an air show at the Willow Grove Naval Air
Station.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the project will begin this month and should be
completed by early September, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. William J. Dey, 30, of Hightstown, N.J., the pilot, and Lt.
David E. Bergstrom, 31, of Virginia Beach, Va., the radar intercept
officer, were killed June 18. Tens of thousands of spectators
watched in horror as their F-14 Tomcat crashed in a wooded area
just outside the base. The plane came to rest close to nearby
houses. A Navy report on the cause of the crash may take up to a
year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site, with its sheared trees and scorched earth, is
still off limits, but has attracted frequent observers.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy plans to remove the top 8 inches of topsoil from the
site to remove any remaining fuel, then level the area and replant
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The Tomcat was loaded with 1,300 gallons of fuel when it
crashed, but a Navy spokeswoman said all but 100 gallons burned or
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (neighbors) shouldn't have to worry about the ground
water,'' U.S. Environmental Protection Agency spokeswoman Pamela
Reigh said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials believe that Dey maneuvered his plane to avoid
the houses when he crashed. Despite the close call, neighbors
support the base and hope the shows will go on.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials have canceled at least one scheduled Tomcat
demonstration since the crash, saying it was too soon to resume the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ''They shouldn't just give up,'' said Barry Starry of Willow
Grove, who lives near the base. ''Maybe they should not quite do
the maneuvers with the jets so close to the houses that they did
this past time. But, please, let's have the shows.''

<HEADLINE> Alou Might Waive No-Trade Clause  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Astros outfielder Moises Alou is no longer ruling
out waiving his no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not thinking about a trade right now, not yet,'' Alou said
before Thursday night's game against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
''Maybe later next week or before July 31,'' the trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Alou said the Astros asked him last week if he'd accept a trade
and he declined. But now has decided to consider offers.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is in last place in the NL Central with the worst record
in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker doesn't want to see his hard-hitting
outfielder leave but agreed it could make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ''He could represent the end of one era and the beginning of
another,'' Dierker said. ''If we made a deal and he accepted it, it
could be good for the team. But I'm not trying to get rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to just get some young guys. But if we could get
young guys in the right places, like on the mound, that makes
sense. For him, if he could go to a contending team, that might
make sense for him too.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker said the team is trying
to decide which veteran players to move.
</P>
<P>
   Alou will earn $5.25 million this season and is signed through
the 2001 season. He leads Houston in hitting with a .345 average
and has 13 home runs and 45 RBIs despite missing 30 games with
injuries this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guys like me who can drive in runs are going for $10-$12
million. I'm fairly cheap for what I can bring to the table,'' Alou
said. ''To me, it doesn't make sense to trade a guy like me that
plays cheap for you.''

<HEADLINE> Sale of Avalanche, Nuggets Complete  </HEADLINE>
By MARY WEBB
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- St. Louis real estate developer Stanley Kroenke
completed his $450 million purchase of the Colorado Avalanche, the
Denver Nuggets and the Pepsi Center on Thursday, only 10 weeks
after the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me personally, it's an exciting day. It's something I've
wanted to do all my life, be involved in professional sports,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kroenke, a Wal-Mart heir, owns 40 percent of the NFL's St. Louis
Rams.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been fortunate to be involved for the last seven years.
But, to be able to expand our interests and be involved with
quality organizations, like the (NHL's) Avalanche and the (NBA's)
Nuggets, is certainly a dream come true,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was a quick turnaround for Kroenke as well as Liberty
Media, which acquired the sports assets when it bought Ascent
Entertainment Group in February. Liberty Media gave itself six
months to sell the teams and 9-month-old arena.
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, Kroenke edged out a bid by Denver Broncos owner Pat
Bowlen, former Broncos quarterback John Elway and New Jersey Devils
owner John McMullen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our stated goal among many things was to find a right,
long-term owner for the fans and city of Denver,'' said Gary
Howard, executive vice president and chief operating officer of
Liberty Media.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were very pleased in April when we made the announcement we
were working with Stan Kroenke and had signed a deal. And
amazingly, two months later, we were able to close that
transaction. I think that's a record onto itself,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Before turning the teams over, Howard challenged Kroenke to
extend Liberty Media's sports success, joking that both teams had
their highest winning percentages under one owner, if only for a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kroenke, a 20-year part-time resident of Steamboat Springs, and
the city narrowly missed their targeted close date of June 30 due
to what Kroenke called ''a somewhat unusual lease for a
privately-funded arena.''
</P>
<P>
   The city withheld its approval of the deal until Kroenke agreed
the teams would stay in Denver for at least 25 years, even if he
died.
</P>
<P>
   However, he denied he and the city had clashed on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only issue we had with the city is them waiting on us. We
never had any problem with them,'' Kroenke said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty Media retains 6.52 percent interest in the teams and the
arena.

<HEADLINE> Court upholds state's purchase of forest lands  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A state court has upheld the sale of nearly
140,000 acres of forest land in four counties.
</P>
<P>
   A lawsuit challenging the state's $24.9 million purchase of land
from Champion International Corp. was dismissed as being a
''procedural mess,'' untimely and in the wrong jurisdiction, state
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The state bought 29,000 acres on July 1, 1999 and negotiated the
purchase by a private, North Carolina-based company, Forestland
Group, of another 110,000 acres in conservation easements in
Franklin, St. Lawrence, Lewis and Herkimer counties.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was challenged by a group of citizens and hunting clubs
who claimed the state did not follow proper procedures in acquiring
the land.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer and Department of Environmental
Conservation Commissioner John Cahill cheered the decision to
uphold the purchase, what they termed as the largest land
conservation buy in state history.
</P>
<P>
   The Champion land acquisition gives the public access to large
tracts of forest, streams and rivers that had been in private hands
for more than a century. It also allows for continued commercial
logging on land that is covered by conservation easements, Spitzer
said.

<HEADLINE> Three plead guilty for illegal wool trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Two people and an India-based company
pleaded guilty to illegally trading woolen shawls made from an
endangered Tibetan antelope, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ho-McAfee, 49, of Hong Kong, and Janet MacKay-Benton, 42,
of New Egypt, pleaded guilty to violations of the U.S. Endangered
Species Act. Navarang Exports India pleaded guilty to smuggling in
violation of U.S. customs law.
</P>
<P>
   Ho-McAfee and MacKay-Benton, both employees of Cocoon Inc. in
Cliffwood, admitted exporting shahtoosh shawls to Paris from the
United States in March 1995 without filing proper forms with the
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, said the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Shahtoosh shawls are made from Tibetan antelopes, which are
protected under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Navarang imported about 300 shahtoosh shawls
into the United States between September 1994 and March 1995. The
company only paid about $1,000 of the import duty for the shawls
valued at $246,400.
</P>
<P>
   It still owes $31,700 in unpaid duty, said the U.S. Attorney's
Office.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer representing Navarang admitted that the company did not
obtain necessary permits from the United States or the country the
shawls originated from, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Ho-McAfee and MacKay-Benton could each face up to six months in
prison and a $25,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Navarang could face up to five years of probation and a $500,000
fine.
</P>
<P>
   They are scheduled to be sentenced in October.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Robert J. Cleary said this case is the first
criminal prosecution involving the endangered antelopes.

<HEADLINE> Money Laundering Eyed in Caribbean  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN McNAMARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANOUAN, St. Vincent (AP) -- Wrapping up a summit, Caribbean
leaders pledged to fight money laundering but refused to change tax
laws which have landed much of the region on a blacklist for
allegedly abetting financial crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the 15-nation Caribbean Community said they would
send a strongly worded protest letter to the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, which last month
cited five Caribbean nations for not cooperating in the fight
against money laundering and said 15 were hot spots for tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Sir James Mitchell, prime minister of St. Vincent and the
Grenadines and chairman of the summit, condemned the blacklists and
threatened sanctions as ''a direct threat to the region's economic
base and stability'' at a time when revenue from traditional
sources such as bananas, sugar and tourism are flat.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day summit, which concluded Wednesday night, appeared
to highlight the fundamental impotence of the region's small
countries in the face of what Antigua and Barbuda spokesman Ron
Sanders called the OECD's ''highhanded'' move.
</P>
<P>
   ''They deplored the fact that the lists were published with the
objective of tainting jurisdictions in the eyes of the investment
community and the international financial market. They condemned
the actions of the OECD in particular as contrary to the tenets of
a global market economy promoted by (rich) countries,'' said a
summit declaration.
</P>
<P>
   It said the threatened sanctions by the 26-nation OECD -- which
includes the United States and the prosperous nations of Western
Europe -- had ''no basis in international law.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominican Prime Minister Roosevelt Douglas said most of the
Caribbean countries are insistent on their right to decide on their
own tax laws, which they consider part of the free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the statement did promise ''to fight money
laundering and all other forms of financial crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean leaders dismissed claims that they aid in tax evasion
as merely a hypocritical effort to recoup revenues and business
that have shifted to the region. ''Tax competition is about whose
treasury gets the money,'' Mitchell said earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Britain estimates that it loses about $1.6 billion a year in tax
revenues hidden in offshore tax havens. There are no firm figures
for U.S. losses.
</P>
<P>
   The OECD says lax laws, little oversight and low taxes invite
some of the $600 billion in criminal funds that the United Nations
estimates is hidden from law enforcement officials every year by
such money laundering methods as moving it through offshore
accounts, with about a tenth of that passing through Caribbean
banking centers.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers re-signed right wing
Rick Tocchet to a two-year contract Thursday and signed Czech
defenseman Michael Sykora to a multiyear deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Philly was my first choice because it's a good fit for me. The
chemistry is right for me,'' said Tocchet, who was an unrestricted
free agent. ''We were two minutes from going to the Stanley Cup
finals, so I'm excited about next year's team.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet, 36, rejoined the team in a March trade with Phoenix. He

the Flyers, and five goals and six assists in 18 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   He has 426 goals and 486 assists in 16 seasons with the Flyers,

   Sykora, 27, had 11 goals and 14 assists in 48 games last season

<HEADLINE> Multiple Deaths Probed in Ontario  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Police said Thursday they discovered six homicide
victims -- a man and woman and their four young children -- at a
house in a quiet southern Ontario neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they weren't seeking any suspects, but refused
comment on speculation the killings were committed by one of the
six who then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was trauma to the bodies. I won't speak to the cause of
death at this point,'' Staff Sgt. Brent Thomlinson said.
</P>
<P>
   But few other details about the victims or what happened were
released almost 12 hours after the discovery in Kitchener, 60 miles
west of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Thomlinson said police needed to notify next of kin and figure
out what happened before providing details. Neighbors described the
victims as a young couple with children ages 6, 5, 2, and less than
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Police said autopsies would be conducted Friday in Hamilton,
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   The parents of the deceased father owned the house and lived on
the property in a trailer parked in the driveway, according to
neighbors. They said the family originally came from Eastern Europe
and moved to Canada in recent years, living in different places
until moving in with the grandparents in the last six months.
</P>
<P>
   One of the grandparents entered the house and saw the body of
one victim, then called police to report that someone was injured,
according to media reports. The grandparents left the house later
Thursday with police.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, residents of the tree-lined neighborhood
gathered outside the suburban, two-story house to console each
other and try to learn what happened.
</P>
<P>
   They spoke of a young family facing financial problems. A local
social worker confirmed his agency once visited the family because
it received concerned calls regarding how the children were living,
but found nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragedy,'' said neighbor Roberta Butler. ''They (the
children) were just our here playing last night.''

<HEADLINE> Success Stuns Harry Potter Author  </HEADLINE>
By AUDREY WOODS
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) -- J.K. Rowling, creator of the boy
wizard Harry Potter, is running a few minutes late for an interview
-- not quite five, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   A slight figure in black trousers and a trim red-suede jacket,
she slowly descends the hotel staircase, scanning the lounge for a
reporter and photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you looking for me?'' she asks, apologetic, a little
flustered and far too polite to consider the obvious -- that most
reporters would happily wait much more than five minutes to talk
with a literary phenomenon like Joanne Kathleen Rowling who up to
now has revealed so little about herself.
</P>
<P>
   After a quick trip upstairs, she drops her handbag onto the
floor outside her suite and crouches to rummage in it for the key.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I have it here!''
</P>
<P>
   And so she does -- to the door, and to the hearts and minds of
millions of children, their teachers, their parents and a lot of
other adults who like her books simply because they're fun to read.
</P>
<P>
   As the steadily growing band of fans knows, Harry Potter goes to
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and shares desperately
dangerous adventures with his friends, Ron and Hermione, and a
troupe of the most imaginative characters to find their way onto
the printed page in years.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's transformation from struggling single mother to
best-selling author is well-known, and the 34-year-old's star is
still ascending.
</P>
<P>
   Her fourth Potter book, ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,''
to be released at midnight Friday by Scholastic, isn't just flying
off the bookshelves, it's whizzing directly into millions of hot
little hands courtesy of mail order.
</P>
<P>
   Did the creator of this magic world have the slightest inkling
that so many people would take Harry to their hearts -- and in 40
languages?
</P>
<P>
   ''Never in a million years,'' she says, still a bit stunned by
it all and a little edgy in the days before publication of book
four. She is intense and serious about her work, but down-to-earth
and quick to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, according to all the publishers that turned Harry
Potter down, I was quite right in thinking that if ever it got
published it was highly unlikely it would sell very many copies,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of them felt that anything in a boarding school wouldn't
sell these days,'' she adds with a smile. ''But the one thing all
of them said was it was much too long, which is kind of scary when
you think that book four is over 600 pages. It even surprised me,
how long it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Each book is longer than the previous one. And three volumes of
the saga are yet to be written.
</P>
<P>
   The whole series -- which has sold 35 million copies worldwide --
has been plotted out since 1995, when Rowling finished book one,
''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,'' writing in Edinburgh
cafes while keeping body and soul just barely together after the
failure of her marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was incredibly skint (broke),'' she says. During a Christmas
visit to her sister in Edinburgh in 1993, she figured that the city
was small enough so she could walk anywhere with her daughter's
stroller and save the bus fare.
</P>
<P>
   She had been a storyteller as a child in western England and
never really stopped, even while studying French at Exeter
University and working as a bilingual secretary. She eventually
went to Portugal to teach English as a second language and used her
free time to work on a story about a boy wizard. Transplanted in
Edinburgh, she settled into the cafes and began bringing Harry and
his friends to life.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Potter appeal lies with the cast of characters, from
the lovable giant Hagrid and his baby dragon Norbert to the
faceless guards of Azkaban Prison, who suck the souls out of their
victims with the ''Dementors' Kiss'' and chill the very air in
which they move.
</P>
<P>
   These magic characters -- and the ordinary Muggles who dwell in
the parallel universe of life as we know it -- were not thought up
in any methodical way, Rowling explains.
</P>
<P>
   ''They normally come fully formed. Harry came very fully formed.
I knew he was a wizard and he didn't know he was a wizard. And then
it was a process of working backwards to find out how that could
be, and forwards to find out what happened next.''
</P>
<P>
   The writing is still fun, but the latest adventure was ''an
absolute killer,'' she says, especially toward the end of the year
it took to write.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to be sure that that book was right because it's the
central book of the seven and it's very important in plot terms.
... But it was an awful lot of work,'' she says. ''Now that I've
finished, it's my favorite. It won't be to some.''
</P>
<P>
   Her works are not without controversy. Some parents have
objected to frightening passages in previous books and to the
subject of witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling says she had no wish at all to upset children but she
does want to write the story her way. ''I have good reason for
doing it. There are certain things I want to explore and if it's
the last thing I do, I will not be knocked off course.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet most readers like the course she's on. Initial
U.S. and British print runs of the new book total 5.3 million
copies.
</P>
<P>
   This level of success has changed her life, but she manages to
live normally. ''I see my friends, I look after my daughter -- we do
completely ordinary stuff,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to stay in Edinburgh, although the millions of dollars
her books have brought could take her anywhere. And she considers
one of the major pluses of her success the chance to meet young
readers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meeting kids who've read the books is pure, unadulterated
pleasure,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's respect and affection for children is almost tangible,
and there is no mystery to her connection with them. But the adult
readership might be harder to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always felt that a good book is a good book. ... I never
felt there was a big gulf between children's and adults'
literature,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she write with any plan to teach moral lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I write for myself. I did not write for imaginary children:
'What would they need to learn now?'''
</P>
<P>
   That goes, too, for the humor -- one of the joys of the books.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is what I find funny,'' she says, ''not what I think
children find funny. I think it also operates on an 8-year-old
level. They can read it and not get every joke and still can find
most of it funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor, of course, does not always travel well between cultures.
And as her American readership of the books is huge, that was a
worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time I did a reading to American children ... I was
terrified,'' Rowling says. ''The passage I was reading I had read
countless times before and I always knew where the first laugh
came.''
</P>
<P>
   She knew she had no guarantee the American kids were going to
get that part of the humor. ''But the roar of laughter came ... and
it has been exactly the same every other place,'' she says. ''It's
universal in children.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what's this about changing some of the words in the U.S.
edition so American children could understand them?
</P>
<P>
   Rowling pretended to bang her head against the sofa in mock
frustration. ''SO much has been made of that,'' she groans, noting
that it was only done where words had been used that really meant
something very different to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Her American editor pointed out that the word ''jumper'' --
British for pullover sweater -- means a kind of dress in American.
She had had no idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''He asked, 'Can we change it to sweater?' which is just as
British.'' That was fine with Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling is less happy with reports that the upcoming movie of
the first book was to have been set in the United States with an
American cast until Steven Spielberg dropped out of the planning.
There's been criticism, too, of the choice of ''Home Alone''
director Chris Columbus to make the movie, and much concern that it
will be ''Hollywoodized.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Chris is as keen as I am to keep this thing as British as
possible,'' she says. ''I obviously would like the film true to the
book ... and the books are extremely British.
</P>
<P>
   ''And as American children have proved in their droves, they're
not remotely fazed. They can cope really very well. You see, it's
patronizing to assume that they wouldn't cope well with being able
to understand that things are different in Britain. Of course, they
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   The film will be made in Britain, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling also feels strongly about the witchcraft controversy
that led to some schools banning her books from class.
</P>
<P>
   ''I truly am bemused that anyone who has read the books could
think that I am a proponent of the occult in any serious way,'' she
says. ''I don't believe in witchcraft, in the sense that they're
talking about, at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm certainly not a witch myself,'' she says with a laugh,
''and you would be surprised how many otherwise intelligent people
have asked me that question.''
</P>
<P>
   She disagrees that witchcraft is off-limits in children's books.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a source of great fun, drama. Magic is going to
be a theme of children's literature as long as the human race
exists,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   What bothered her most was not that parents disapproved of their
own children reading the books, ''but that they tried to censor
them ... and I am vehemently opposed to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowling says that if she should ever write an adult novel, it
will not be because she thinks she has to do so to be taken
seriously. ''I've never seen writing for children as second-best,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am always going to be the Harry Potter author. I actually
have no problem with that. I can't imagine myself ever being
ashamed of these books.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Ecstasy Bust, Bjt,350  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The mastermind of a multi-million dollar ecstasy
ring bragged he wanted to give mob turncoat Salvatore ''Sammy the
Bull'' Gravano a taste of his own medicine and have him
''whacked,'' authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Ilan Zarger, was among 17 defendants accused in
Brooklyn of trafficking ecstasy on the East Coast and in Arizona,
where Gravano is facing designer drug-dealing charges in a separate
case.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint filed in federal court claims Zarger was caught on
tape telling an informant he ''had a problem'' with Gravano, the
ex-underboss for the Gambino crime family who admitted killing 19
people.
</P>
<P>
   Zarger said the recent dispute was over the ''selling price for
ecstasy in Arizona.'' He also boasted that he ''was prepared to
have Gravano 'whacked' ... but they were able to resolve the
dispute,'' court papers added.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano is being held on $5 million bond in Arizona, accused in
February of heading the state's largest ecstasy syndicate. He had
been living in suburban Tempe after helping authorities put away
his boss, John Gotti, for life.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Gravano, Larry Hammond, did not immediately
return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Zarger, 30, an Israeli living in Manhattan, was ordered held
without bail. His attorney, Jeffrey Rabin, said he was unaware of
the accusations involving Gravano, but added his client would
''vigorously defend himself against'' the drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities accused Zarger and five other defendants distributed
more than one million ecstasy pills - street value $25 million - in
Brooklyn, Manhattan, Long Island and Arizona. Among the alleged
customers for the psychedelic amphetamine was a violent drug and
robbery crew called the ''Brooklyn Terror Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven members of the crew were charged with dealing drugs and
illegal guns, and of robbing nightclub patrons and owners. Their
crimes allegedly spanned New York City, Philadelphia, Boston,
Washington D.C., Connecticut and New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Angels Place Belcher on DL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Angels right-hander Tim Belcher went on
the 15-day disabled list Thursday with a strained throwing elbow --
the same injury that led to surgery in December.
</P>
<P>
   The move is retroactive to Monday, a day after Belcher
surrendered seven runs in one-third of an inning against Oakland in
the worst outing of his 14-year career. In his prior outing, he was
ejected in the second inning after arguing a balk call.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the elbow surgery, Belcher didn't make his season
debut until June 17 at Baltimore. He is 2-2 in four starts and has
allowed 14 earned runs in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Ramon Ortiz will be promoted from Triple-A Edmonton
on Friday to take Belcher's turn in the rotation against the
Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   In other moves, reliever Lou Pote was recalled Thursday from
Edmonton, while right-handed starter Brian Cooper, who allowed six
runs and nine hits against Seattle on Wednesday night, was optioned
to Edmonton and is expected to return after the All-Star break.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Philadelphia Phillies minor league pitchers
Matt Beech and Ryan Nye were injured in an automobile accident
Thursday morning while driving to the team's training facility in
Clearwater, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Beech, 28, was driving and Nye, 27, was a front-seat passenger.
Beech's Ford Explorer was stopped at a traffic light when another
vehicle changed lanes and rear-ended their sport utility vehicle,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   Both were taken to Bayfront Medical Center in St. Petersburg.
Beech was removed on a backboard and head brace, and was said to be
experiencing back pain. He was scheduled to be held overnight and
undergo an MRI test.
</P>
<P>
   Nye had an X-ray taken of his neck, and was discharged later in
the day.
</P>
<P>
   Beech, a left-hander, and Nye, a right-hander, are each
rehabbing from surgeries late last season. Neither has pitched in
the majors since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Colts' Lane Found Shot To Death  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Indianapolis Colts running back Fred
Lane, whose brushes with the law increased as his once solid career
faded, was found shot to death Thursday in his Charlotte home.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's wife, Deidra, was being questioned and ''it does appear
to be a case of domestic violence,'' police spokesman Keith Bridges
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing should be read into it at this time,'' Bridges said.
''Right now we're looking into what took place prior to the
shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane, 24, was pronounced dead at 3:15 p.m. at the house in a
newer neighborhood south of town, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police
Capt. Chuck Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was ''a homicide,'' Johnson said. ''At this point
there's no arrest, there's no nothing. It's just an
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A 7-day-old infant was with Deidra Lane at the police station.
Their house was decorated with pink balloons and a pink stork. The
Lanes also have a 5-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was traded by Carolina to Indianapolis in April.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts released a statement that said the team was ''shocked
and saddened'' by news of Lane's death.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's father, Fred Lane Sr., said his son and daughter-in-law
had been having difficulties recently. Lane had spent the past
couple of weeks at the family home in Nashville, Tenn., but visited
Charlotte briefly a week ago, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   He had left Tennessee on a flight to Charlotte about two hours
before he was shot, the elder Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane filed a complaint against her husband in March,
saying he snatched a necklace from around her neck during an
argument, causing her to fall. She did not press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lane also had a case pending against him related to his Feb. 3
arrest in Tennessee. A grand jury in Jackson, Tenn., indicted him
Monday on the misdemeanor drug charges, but prosecutors dropped
weapons charges against him, saying there wasn't enough evidence to
support it.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers suspended Lane for one game in 1998 when he made a
lewd gesture to fans at Giants Stadium after scoring a touchdown
against the New York Jets. The same season, he was demoted to
special teams duty after missing a team flight to Dallas, and later
apologized for refusing to stand for the national anthem at a game
in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 205-pound Lane was the leading career rusher for
the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his trade, Carolina coach George Seifert said
team owner Jerry Richardson never ordered him to drop Lane, but he
knew the Panthers had to cut their ties with troublesome players.
</P>
<P>
   Lane spent three seasons with Carolina and finished with 2,004
yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Sr. said his son had been training in Indianapolis before
visiting Tennessee. ''Everything was going great,'' in his son's
life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane is one of two former Panthers to face legal troubles in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Carruth, the Panthers' top 1997 draft pick, was charged last
fall with fatally shooting his pregnant girlfriend, Cherica Adams.
Carruth is being held without bond in Charlotte, while he awaits
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers re-signed Lane before the 1999 season to a
two-year, $1.276 million contract with a $300,000 signing bonus.
Lane shared rushing duties with Tshimanga Biakabutuka but played
largely as a backup late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   In what would be his last game for Carolina, Lane started for an
injured Biakabutuka and rushed for a season-high 90 yards and his
only touchdown of the season in a loss at Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 9, Padres 3  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- All-Star Kevin Brown matched his career high
with 12 strikeouts and allowed only four hits in eight innings, and
the Dodgers hit three more home runs -- by Adrian Beltre, Shawn
Green and Todd Hundley -- as Los Angeles beat the San Diego Padres
9-3 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (8-2), the Padres' ace during their 1998 World Series
season, retired 16 of 17 from the last out of the first inning
through the sixth, including striking out the side in the fourth
and fifth innings.
</P>
<P>
   He walked just one and matched the strikeout high he set May 25,
1999, at Cincinnati. His previous best this season was 10 on June
15 in a 4-0 victory over Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Padres' four hits off Brown were a two-run,
opposite-field homer by slumping Phil Nevin with two outs in the
first, and Wiki Gonzalez's solo homer with two outs in the seventh
that pulled the Padres to 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers broke it open with four runs in the eighth,
including three that scored on left fielder Al Martin's error.
Martin got a late jump on Green's bases-loaded fly ball, and the
ball bounced out of Martin's glove as he hit the fence. Mark
Grudzielanek hit an RBI double in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the eighth, Beltre was thrown out at home on a
one-hopper by rookie right fielder Kory DeHaan on Brown's fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre hit a two-run homer in the fourth inning to give the
Dodgers a 3-2 lead and Green hit a solo shot in the fifth, his
first in two weeks. Beltre missed the bag rounding first and had to
come back and touch it after coach John Shelby hollered at him. It
was Green's 13th homer and Beltre's eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley homered leading off the ninth, his 17th of the season
and second in as many games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers hit four homers to provide all their runs in a 7-5
comeback win Wednesday night, including Hundley's tying three-run
shot. The Dodgers, second to St. Louis in homers in the NL, went
deep eight times total in taking two of three from the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Padres starter Brian Meadows (7-6) saw his personal three-game
winning streak snapped as he allowed four runs on 11 hits in five
innings, including both homers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin, who came in hitting just .197 since June 1, gave the
Padres a 2-0 lead when he homered to right on a 1-0 pitch, his
18th. Ryan Klesko was aboard on a single.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut the lead to 2-1 in the second when Green hit a
bloop double that shortstop Kevin Nicholson misplayed, and scored
on Hundley's single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Hundley's bat shattered during his fifth-inning at-bat and
a long splinter stuck in a fan's arm. The fan appeared to be OK as
he left with a security guard to be treated. ... Brown has allowed
three or fewer earned runs in 16 of 17 starts. ... Eric Owens, the
Padres' RF and leadoff hitter, missed his third straight game with
a sore right hand. ... It was the first time in the Padres' last
seven losses that a starter has been tagged with the decision. ...
Gonzalez's homer was his third.

<HEADLINE> Hershiser Retires From Baseball  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The moment Orel Hershiser will remember most
from his playing days was being mobbed on the mound on Oct. 20,
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have the ball in my hand for the last pitch of the World
Series and to be the one being mobbed, that was special,''
Hershiser said Thursday as he announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait for old-timers day, so we can talk about what we
did as a group. The individual awards, they get dust on them. The
championship team things, that multiplies.''
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old Hershiser, nicknamed ''Bulldog,'' was one of
baseball's dominant pitchers for the Dodgers in the 1980s, and had
a particularly memorable year in 1988. He pitched a major league
record 59 consecutive scoreless innings, finishing with a 23-8
record and 2.26 ERA. He won the NL Cy Young and World Series MVP
awards as Los Angeles beat favored Oakland in five games for the
championship, with Hershiser winning twice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think you work hard to get somewhere if you're not the best
at the beginning,'' Hershiser said during a conference call
Thursday. ''When you're a 17th round draft pick, you listen to the
coaches, hang out around successful guys, figure out why they're
successful and emulate them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just have a complete desire to learn and to work hard. I
believe my faith keeps me humble,'' said Hershiser, a deeply
religious individual. ''There's always something to learn, from the
man sweeping the floors to the man running the company, there's
always something to learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who still will be paid $2 million this year and also
is due a $500,000 buyout of next year's $2 million option, plans to
learn baseball from the business side now, including traveling to
the Dodgers' minor league affiliates and working with general
manager Kevin Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers chairman Bob Daly predicts a bright off-the-field future
for Hershiser. Daly said the first things the pitcher told him
after retiring was that he intended to spend time with his family
and, ''You're paying me, how can I help, what can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Daly said, ''He has great potential to be anywhere he wants to
be in baseball. He's in a new capacity where I think he will be
even more successful than he was in his role of the past 21
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser decided to retire after the Dodgers waived him last
week. He struggled after rejoining the club as a free agent last
winter. His ERA was 13.14 in 10 appearances, including six starts,
but totaled just 24 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   In what was to be his final appearance on the mound, he was
battered for eight runs in the second inning of a 9-5 loss to San
Diego on June 26. Even as he walked off the field then, Hershiser
received a standing ovation from the Dodger Stadium crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing to happen to me is that I got hit with a sharp
knife and not a dull knife,'' Hershiser said, referring to the
rapid deterioration of his command on the mound. ''I always knew
that you ultimately face this transition as an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who pitched 353 career games in Los Angeles, briefly
recaptured some of his former glory when he won the Dodgers' home
opener this season, beating Cincinnati 8-1. But he went into a
severe tailspin and lost his last five decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He developed control problems and didn't won after the home
opener. Hershiser matched a modern major league record, hitting
four batters in a 10-3 loss to Houston on April 19, in just 1 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time All-Star, Hershiser has a career record of 204-150
with a 3.48 ERA. He was with Cleveland, San Francisco and the New
York Mets before returning to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a tremendous competitor. He did so much for the Dodgers
and the entire organization. He was a real role model,'' said Tommy
Lasorda, the team executive who was the manager during Hershiser's
glory years with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's done a great job in his career and now it's time for him
to start looking in different directions.''

<HEADLINE> Blair Son Arrested for Drunkenness  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police arrested Prime Minister Tony Blair's
16-year-old son after finding him drunk and vomiting in central
London -- a major embarrassment for Blair, who days earlier vowed to
toughen laws against drunken hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   Euan Blair was celebrating the end of school exams when he was
arrested Wednesday night, according to the prime minister's
spokesman, Alastair Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Though police did not suggest Euan's behavior constituted any
form of hooliganism, the timing was unfortunate, coming on the
heels of his father's unpopular proposal to issue on-the-spot fines
to violent drunks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Campbell insisted Thursday that the incident would not
deter the prime minister's political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is how he lives his life and how he brings up his
children, but that does not mean his children will not misbehave,''
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   In his first public appearance since the news broke -- a speech
to religious leaders in Brighton -- Blair only alluded to his son's
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being a prime minister is a tough job, but I think being a
parent is probably tougher. Sometimes we don't always succeed, but
family to me is more important than anything else,'' he said to
warm applause.
</P>
<P>
   During a question-and-answer session on the British Broadcasting
Corp. Thursday evening, Blair said that his son must face the
consequences of being arrested while drunk, but was still
''basically a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if anyone breaks the law, they should suffer the
penalty of the law, whether they are my son or anyone else's son,''
Blair told the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is important that we take action against violent or
aggressive or disorderly conduct and I'm afraid that applies to my
family and my son as much as it applies to anyone else's ... I
don't ask for any special preferences for my kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair admitted that ''it's not been the greatest day, let's put
it like that, but my son is basically a good kid and we will get
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard said an ambulance was called to the scene at
Leicester Square about 11 p.m. Wednesday because officers were
concerned about Euan's condition, but that he was not hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   One witness, 23-year-old Julie MacDonald, said Euan was ''out
cold'' on the pavement for a short time, lying in the popular
square where hordes of tourists gather each night.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the youth originally told police his name was Euan
John and provided an old address and a false birth date to indicate
he was the legal drinking age of 18.
</P>
<P>
   Special Branch officers were called in after police searched him
and established his correct identity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he saw the inside of a cell,'' said Campbell, adding
that Euan was not charged but ordered to return to the police
station at a future date to face either a reprimand, a final
warning or a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard said drunken minors usually are dealt with on the
spot, but that the decision on how to handle each case is left up
to the arresting officers.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister was working late on a speech Wednesday night
and had been ''a bit worried'' that his son had not come home,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Euan was very sorry for the inconvenience he caused the
police, the state he was in and for the false statement he made,''
the spokesman said. ''He is in no doubt of the seriousness of it
and the views his parents take.''
</P>
<P>
   Rival politicians tread gently Thursday on the subject of Euan's
arrest, with Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy calling the
incident ''a slight domestic setback of a type which probably
affects just about every home in the land.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody in the country will have every sympathy with
the Blair family,'' Kennedy told Sky News.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and his wife, Cherie, have gone to great lengths to
protect the privacy of their children -- Euan, Nicky, 14, Kathryn,
12, and baby Leo, born May 20.
</P>
<P>
   The children are shielded under Press Complaints Commission
guidelines governing minors, but Lord Wakeham, chairman of the
press watchdog, noted Thursday that the incident involving Euan was
a legitimate news story.
</P>
<P>
   ''As Euan is over 16 and was not at school at the time of the
incident, there is no restriction in the code on the use of
photographs of him relating to the incident or reports about the
incident itself, as the prime minister and Mrs. Blair themselves
recognize,'' Wakeham said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that editors should ''take into account the
prime minister and Mrs. Blair's clear commitment to do all they can
to protect the privacy of their children.''

<HEADLINE> Barak Ready To Offer Concessions  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is ready to
offer concessions on Jerusalem, refugees and other contested
issues, contingent on matching moves by the Palestinians at next
week's Mideast summit, two Israeli officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem's future remains the thorniest of all the issues
facing Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the talks in
Camp David, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is prepared to consider expanding areas of the city
already under day-to-day Arab control in exchange for absorbing
nearby Jewish settlements into the predominantly Jewish area of the
city, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   On refugees, Barak is willing to consider permitting tens of
thousands of Palestinians to settle in Israel if they have family
members there, but he will not accept the idea they have a legal
right to return, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The precedent is Israel's acceptance of 60,000 to 70,000
Palestinian Arabs in a program of reuniting families that was in
force between Israel's founding in 1948 and the Mideast war of
1967, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues, they said, Barak will insist that:
</P>
<P>
   --The Palestinian state likely to emerge from the summit have no
army or air force. The Palestinians understood this demand, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   --Israel maintain a security presence in the Jordan Valley. They
left open the possibility he was willing to relinquish the land to
the Palestinians, and that Israeli might eventually phase out the
security presence.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is insisting on taking control of East Jerusalem as the
capital of a Palestinian state. The area was under Jordanian
occupation until it was captured by Israel in the 1967 war and
reunited with the predominantly Jewish Western part.
</P>
<P>
   In Arab neighborhoods, Palestinians already run their day-to-day
affairs. This area can be expanded beyond Jerusalem's current
boundaries to incorporate predominantly Arab areas, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   But they stressed that was contingent on Israel absorbing into
the city some of the nearby suburbs now on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything about Jerusalem is on the table, everything is
discussable,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable Barak and Arafat will agree on most of the key
issues at the summit but not on the city's future, one Israeli
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about Barak's possible concessions led two Israeli
political parties to announce this week they were quitting Barak's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright continued her
campaign to rally Arab and Jewish support for the summit, where
President Clinton will serve as host.
</P>
<P>
   She met with Foreign Minister Habib ben Yahia of Tunisia and
spoke on the telephone with King Mohammed of Morocco, the State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said. Also, Albright met with
a coalition of American Arab groups and, separately, with members
of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said he hopes the summit could conclude in a few
days. Palestinian officials said Thursday a two-stage summit was
under consideration, with the second round in August.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli officials said that approach had been discussed with
the Palestinians and the U.S. hosts. But a U.S. official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, denied that and said Washington wants to
reach an accord in one stage.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are due in Washington this
weekend for pre-summit talks on Sunday and Monday, and Albright
plans to meet with them, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Boucher assured Tokyo that Albright was skipping
a high-level conference next week in Japan only because of the
urgency of Mideast talks.
</P>
<P>
   Albright explained to Foreign Minister Yohei Kono in a half-hour
telephone call why she would not attend the foreign ministers
meeting and he ''expressed his understanding of the critical timing
of the Middle East peace talks,'' Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign ministers of Britain, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan and Russia are due to meet at Miyazaki on July 12-13
to prepare for a Group of Eight summit meeting on Okinawa July
21-23.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Giuliani-Book, 1st-Ld Writethru,0580  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Responding to a book that claims members of his
family had ties to the mafia, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday
that his record prosecuting mobsters speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll stand on my record as having prosecuted or put in
prison more members of the mafia than probably any U.S. attorney in
history, having been threatened with death by them at least three
times - four times seriously going back to when I was an assistant
U.S. attorney, and if that's not enough to remove the mafia
prejudice than there's probably nothing you could do to remove
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''Is there anybody who's done more to end the
influence of the mafia than me?''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor did not dispute individual claims in the book, ''Rudy!
An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani,'' which paints an
unflattering portrait of the law-and-order mayor's family,
including descriptions of violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of it is accurate. Some of it is inaccurate,'' Giuliani
said on his ''Ask the Mayor'' radio show Thursday evening on WCBS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some is true. Some is false. Some of it is interpretation and
I'd like my opportunity to explain what I did, why I did it, and
the effect and the impact I think it's had on the city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said he may write a book of his own in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Among the claims in Barrett's biography is that the mayor's
father, Harold Giuliani, spent a-year-and-a-half in Sing Sing for
robbing a milkman at gunpoint in the 1930s - a decade before
Rudolph Giuliani was born.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to read it, I'm not going to comment about it,''
Giuliani told reporters during a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The book, written by Village Voice reporter Wayne Barrett, says
Giuliani's cousin, Lewis D'Avanzo, was a mob associate who ran a
major car theft ring. It also says the FBI suspected that D'Avanzo
- who went to school with Giuliani and attended the mayor's wedding
to his first wife - was involved in several murders.
</P>
<P>
   D'Avanzo was killed in Brooklyn by FBI agents in 1977 when he
tried to run down an agent who had stopped him on a warrant for
transporting 100 stolen luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   The book also claims that the mayor's father, Harold Giuliani,
and uncle, Leo D'Avanzo, had ties to the mob as well. According to
the book, the two were involved in a shootout with a member of the
mob on a Brooklyn street in the early 1960s over a loansharking
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The book is scheduled to be published July 11. Excerpts were
provided to reporters this week by the publisher, Basic Books, and
portions were printed in this week's Voice.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Giuliani died in 1981 at age 73 of prostate cancer, the
same disease that forced the mayor to drop his U.S. Senate bid this
year against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was elected mayor in 1993, Giuliani earned a
reputation as a no-nonsense federal prosecutor bent on breaking the
mob. As U.S. attorney in 1986, he successfully prosecuted the heads
of three organized crime groups - Genovese crime family boss
Anthony ''Fat Tony'' Salerno, Colombo boss Carmine ''Junior''
Persico and Lucchese boss Anthony ''Tony Ducks'' Corallo.
</P>
<P>
   All were charged with racketeering and conspiracy. They received
sentences of 100 years each.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor, Giuliani also spearheaded the effort to free the
Fulton Fish Market of mob influence.

   KEMPTEN, Germany (AP) -- A gondola carrying hikers to the top of
the 7,218-foot Nebelhorn peak crashed into a guide rail Thursday,
injuring 16 people, some seriously, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the injured were taken to hospitals by helicopter,
and other helicopters were helping to evacuate 500 climbers from
the top of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   The accident was the first for the gondola company in its 70

operators. The accident was at the second of three stations along
the 4-mile gondola line.
</P>

   It was not immediately clear if the accident was caused by
mechanical failure or human error.

<HEADLINE> Texas millionaire guilty in murder-for-hire of ex-wife  </HEADLINE>
By SUZANNE GAMBOA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A Texas millionaire was convicted Thursday of
arranging the murder of his ex-wife, who was found shot in her
kitchen with her throat slit as her 2-year-old quadruplets crawled
in her blood.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Blackthorne, 45, was the last of four people suspected in
the murder-for-hire of Sheila Bellush to be convicted or to plead
guilty. He faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without
parole.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict came hours after the hit man pleaded guilty in
Florida. Jose Luis Del Toro Jr., 24, then sang a song in court
asking for forgiveness. He was given two consecutive life
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush, 35, was slain in Sarasota, Fla., in 1997. Her body was
discovered by her 13-year-old daughter from her marriage to
Blackthorne. Her quadruplets from her second marriage were crawling
around unharmed, wearing their life jackets for use in the backyard
swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors portrayed Blackthorne as a man who hated his ex-wife
and who, after a string of custody battles, offered up to $54,000
to have her killed, with a bonus if he regained custody of his two
daughters, who had been adopted by Bellush's second husband.
Prosecutors said he had used private investigators to track down
Bellush after she moved from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Blackthorne took the stand and admitted he
once threatened to kill Bellush because he thought she was a
negligent mother. But he denied arranging her murder.
</P>
<P>
   The federal jury took 33 hours to find Blackthorne guilty of
interstate conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and interstate
domestic violence. He faces sentencing Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom was silent as the verdict was read because
marshals had warned against any outbursts. But once her elevator
reached the ground floor, Gene Smith, Bellush's mother, spread her
arms and yelled, ''Hallelujah!'' as the doors opened.
</P>
<P>
   ''God bless all of these people who stood up for my daughter,''
she said. ''God bless these wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Lubin, with Blackthorne's wife at his
side, said: ''We felt that there was more than reasonable doubt. A
great injustice has been done.'' The lawyer said he will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne retired after making a fortune selling medical
devices. His Vancouver, Wash.-based business, International
Rehabilitative Sciences, sells muscle stimulators under the name RS
Medical.
</P>
<P>
   The two middlemen in the plot are already in prison: The man who
hired Del Toro, his cousin Sammy Gonzales, got 19 years behind
bars. And Daniel Rocha, Blackthorne's golfing buddy and the man who
asked Gonzales to find someone to kill Bellush, is serving life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sarasota courtroom, Bellush's widower, Jamie Bellush,
held up pictures of his wife's bloody, disfigured face for Del Toro
to see.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro looked away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Del Toro, you're a worthless coward with no remorse in
your heart!'' he bellowed. He added: ''It's unfortunate that I
could not stand and watch you take your last breath with a needle
in your arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Del Toro said he, too, wanted to make a statement. His eyes
red as he fought to hold back tears, he told Bellush in a soft,
slow voice: ''I do deserve to die. I am what you said of me. I can
now admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Del Toro broke into a gospel song by Calvin Hunt:
''Beautiful. That's how mercy saw me. I was broken and so lost.
Mercy looked past all my faults.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Bellush, who has moved to Sussex County, N.J. since the
murder, later called Blackthorne's verdict ''a bittersweet thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a tragic story for everyone involved,'' he said, ''but
certainly our family is going to have closure.''

<HEADLINE> BC-NJ--Ecstasy Bust, Bjt,350  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The mastermind of a multimillion dollar ecstasy
ring bragged he wanted to give mob turncoat Salvatore ''Sammy the
Bull'' Gravano a taste of his own medicine and have him
''whacked,'' authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Ilan Zarger, was among 17 defendants accused in
Brooklyn of trafficking ecstasy on the East Coast and in Arizona,
where Gravano is facing designer drug-dealing charges in a separate
case.
</P>
<P>
   A complaint filed in federal court claims Zarger was caught on
tape telling an informant he ''had a problem'' with Gravano, the
ex-underboss for the Gambino crime family who admitted killing 19
people.
</P>
<P>
   Zarger said the recent dispute was over the ''selling price for
ecstasy in Arizona.'' He also boasted that he ''was prepared to
have Gravano 'whacked' ... but they were able to resolve the
dispute,'' court papers added.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano is being held on $5 million bond in Arizona, accused in
February of heading the state's largest ecstasy syndicate. He had
been living in suburban Tempe after helping authorities put away
his boss, John Gotti, for life.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for Gravano, Larry Hammond, did not immediately
return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Zarger, 30, an Israeli living in Manhattan, was ordered held
without bail. His attorney, Jeffrey Rabin, said he was unaware of
the accusations involving Gravano, but added his client would
''vigorously defend himself against'' the drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities accused Zarger and five other defendants distributed
more than one million ecstasy pills - street value $25 million - in
Brooklyn, Manhattan, Long Island and Arizona. Among the alleged
customers for the psychedelic amphetamine was a violent drug and
robbery crew called the ''Brooklyn Terror Squad.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven members of the crew were charged with dealing drugs and
illegal guns, and of robbing nightclub patrons and owners. Their
crimes allegedly spanned New York City, Philadelphia, Boston,
Washington D.C., Connecticut and New Jersey.

Tragedy, Romance in 'Winter's Tale'   
An AP Entertainment Review
By MICHAEL KUCHWARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''The Winter's Tale'' is Shakespeare's most
schizophrenic play -- the two faces of Will, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   The first half is tragedy; the second a romance, or at least a
heartfelt reconciliation sweeping away the sorrow and turbulence
that have gone before.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult making the two halves connect, but director
Brian Kulick has found a way in the intriguing, clearly thought-out
revival the Public Theater opened Thursday in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   The park setting actually helps, giving the play's bucolic
second half a natural backdrop that helps one forgive, if not
exactly forget, the slackening of dramatic fireworks once the play
has moved on from the intrigues in the Sicilian court.
</P>
<P>
   It is in these corridors of power that Kulick's production has
its most success. That's because actor Keith David, playing the
madly jealous King Leontes, commands the stage with force. He's a
tough, charismatic actor, vocally as well as physically imposing.
</P>
<P>
   Leontes suspects his wife, Hermione, of having a fling with
Polixenes, the ruler of Bohemia. This Othello-in-training stalks
the stage, spying as the flirtatious Hermione dances with the
smitten Polixenes. Leontes surmises -- incorrectly -- that Polixenes
is the father of Hermione's impending child.
</P>
<P>
   The king's thunder is unjustified, but theatrically it crackles,
as does Hermione's defiant response, particularly in the haughty
persona of Aunjanue Ellis. The actress makes a worthy opponent,
even after she is publicly condemned and then apparently dies.
</P>
<P>
   This being a fantasy, there is a great deal beyond reason that
has to be taken for granted. Hermione, of course, isn't dead. She
has merely been transformed into a statue -- although here the queen
is more disdainful diva than regal royal.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn babe is condemned, too, packed off to the wilds of
Bohemia where the king's courtier has been ordered to abandon her.
The servant gets eaten by a bear, a scene usually so impossible to
play that most directors just put an actor in a bear's suit and
have him chase the hapless servant.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the director drapes Leontes in a bear skin, and has the
king slowly stalk the servant until they are both offstage. In a
strange way, it frees the play -- and the monarch -- from the tragedy
that has come before.
</P>
<P>
   When the second half picks up, 16 years have gone by, and the
baby is now a young girl, Perdita. This being Shakespeare, she will
fall in love with the son of her father's old rival. It's a way of
bringing everyone together at the end of the play.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of time also allows the introduction of a trio of
rustics: the Old Shepherd and his son, who find the baby, and an
opportunistic scoundrel named Autolycus.
</P>
<P>
   It's here where the evening slows down, despite the valiant
efforts of three accomplished clowns, Bill Buell, Michael Stuhlbarg
and Bronson Pinchot. The actors work hard, getting a few laughs
from the dense, almost esoteric wordplay. Pinchot, in particular,
as the thievish Autolycus, is an adept comedian, comfortable with
the language as well as the strenuous physicality of the role.
</P>
<P>
   Besides David, top acting honors go to Randy Danson, as Paulina,
the queen's most loyal and vocal handmaiden. Danson's robust
delivery is straightforward and commanding, yet filled with a
warmth that ''The Winter's Tale'' needs if its fantasy is to be
made fully human.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the court action, by the way, is played out in front of
four long rectangles on wheels, designed by Riccardo Hernandez.
Each depicts a segment of what looks like a painting by the
Renaissance master, Sandro Botticelli. The painting seems to deal
with the stresses and strains of love, something this revival makes
clear can produce some very satisfying otherworldly experiences.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Accuses Panel of Bias in Probe  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl flashed his temper
during a hearing on his party's financing scandal Thursday,
shouting at parliament members when pressed to reveal the names of
donors he has vowed to keep secret in breach of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The clash erupted during Kohl's second day of defiant testimony
to the parliamentary committee when a member repeatedly asked Kohl
in sharp tones how he would react if an ordinary citizen took such
an attitude toward the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not going to shut me up with your shouting,'' Kohl
barked at Frank Hofmann, a lawmaker for the governing Social
Democrats who triggered several minutes of tumult with the
question.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're not supposed to be silent, you're supposed to talk,''
Hofmann fired back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to talk in a situation where people are
shouting,'' Kohl parried.
</P>
<P>
   Bristling, Kohl charged that it was the Social Democrats, who
hold the panel majority, who ''trampled on the constitution'' by
questioning German unification when he pushed it through in 1990 --
Kohl's proudest achievement in office.
</P>
<P>
   Later, though, he acknowledged that he broke the law by
accepting some $1 million in anonymous donations for his Christian
Democratic party while he was chancellor in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mistake was that I accepted donations that were not
declared, and that I disregarded the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-month-old scandal centers on Kohl's steadfast refusal to
name the sources of the illegal donations. Kohl refused to budge
during his first appearance before the committee last week and
again during seven hours of testimony Thursday, where he said he
would talk about party financing only to Bonn prosecutors
investigating possible criminal charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   That stance has prompted the parliamentary investigation into
whether his 1982-98 government traded favors for money, something
Kohl denies. He says he promised the donors anonymity and won't
break his word.
</P>
<P>
   True to his view that the committee is an instrument of
political foes who want to wreck his legacy as ''unity
chancellor,'' the 70-year-old Kohl accused the panel of bias as it
probes the allegations of bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl strode into the hearing room with a confident smile,
looking relaxed and amused as photographers swarmed around him at
the witness table. Once questioning began, he quickly showed his
combative side again when snickers greeted one of his answers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is that you don't want to recognize the truth,''
he declared to the committee. ''That's why you have to sit through
this now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohl had been asked about the privatization of a major oil
refinery in former East Germany, which was sold in 1994 to French
concern Elf Aquitaine.
</P>
<P>
   As he has in the past, Kohl said charges that the French paid
millions in bribes to his party for the refinery were ridiculous
because Elf Aquitaine had to be persuaded to buy it. He said he
made several personal appeals to then-French President Francois
Mitterrand to clinch the deal, saving thousands of east German jobs
when west German competitors wanted the refinery closed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, two former Siemens executives testified they had no
knowledge of illegal donations by the German industrial giant to
Kohl's party during the 1980s. The allegation had been made by one
of the party's former financial officers, Uwe Luethje.

<HEADLINE> Martin Wants Cart Issue Resolved  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- At least Casey Martin will finally know,
once and for all, whether he can use a cart during tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday to review
a lower court ruling that allows Martin to use a cart. Martin, who
has a rare circulatory disease in his right leg, sued the PGA Tour
in 1998 under the Americans With Disabilities Act, a federal
anti-bias act.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's carried on about three years too far. But it's
their right to pursue it as far as they want to,'' Martin said
Thursday afternoon after shooting a 5-over-par 77 in the first
round of the Western Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the last straw. So we'll have the final word someday
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, now in summer recess, probably won't decide
until late October whether to take up the case.
</P>
<P>
   Martin earned his tour card in October by finishing in the top
15 on the Nike Tour, but he has struggled in his rookie season. He
has made the cut in only eight of 15 tournaments, and his only
finish in the top 30 was a tie for 17th in the Tucson Open, the
same week the top players were competing in the Match Play
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The court battle, Martin said, hasn't been a distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It never enters my mind when I'm playing,'' he said. ''It's a
long way away and it's out of my hands. I keep playing golf until
they tell me otherwise.''

<HEADLINE> Man gets 50 years for slashing woman  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELIZABETHTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - A 28-year-old man convicted of
robbing, slashing and trying to kill a woman in the apartment they
shared was sentenced to 50 years in prison Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Rouse faced a minimum of 10 years in prison for the Nov.
21, 1998 attack on the now-66 year old woman, but the judge noted
his violent past in meting out the stiffer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   He was given a maximum 25-year prison term each for
second-degree attempted murder and first-degree assault, along with
3&AMP;frac12; to seven years for a weapon charge. All three sentences are to
be served at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   For the robbery conviction, Rouse was given a sentence of 25
years, to be served after the other sentences. He also was ordered
to stay away from his victim for the next 43 years and pay a $155
crime-victim assistance fee from his prison wages.
</P>
<P>
   The victim testified that Rouse threatened to kill her and to
cut off her finger to get her rings. The victim also said Rouse
sexually assaulted her, but Essex County Court Judge Andrew
Halloran dropped charges of first-degree rape, first-degree
attempted rape and first-degree sexual abuse because the victim's
testimony contradicted what she told the grand jury.

<HEADLINE> General Challenge Draws No. 7 Slot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- General Challenge, the early 9-5
favorite for Sunday's $1 million Gold Cup at Hollywood Park, drew
the No. 7 post position Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That slot has been lucky, with the most Gold Cup winners -- 13 --
starting from No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   A field of nine is set to go in the 1&AMP;frac14;-mile test for 3-year-olds
and up.
</P>
<P>
   Trained by Bob Baffert, General Challenge will be racing for the
first time since finishing third as the 1-5 favorite in the San
Bernardino Handicap at Santa Anita on April 9. The 4-year-old
gelding came out of that race with a throat problem and missed a
month of training.
</P>
<P>
   Corey Nakatani will be aboard General Challenge, who has a 9-2-1
record in 16 career starts.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief got the inside spot during Thursday's draw, with
David, Pleasant Breeze and Early Pioneer in the next three spots.
Chester House will start from the No. 5 slot, with Big Ten at No.
6. Flanking General Challenge to the outside will be Blueprint and
Out Of Mind, the 5-2 second choice in the early line.

<HEADLINE> Mother, son charged after plotting son's prison escape with dynamite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WOODBURY, N.J. (AP) - A Thorofare woman bought what she thought
was dynamite for her son to use to escape from a Pennsylvania
prison, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Marshall Vickers, 51, and her son, Kerry Marshall, 29,
were indicted Thursday in federal court in Philadelphia. Each faces
a charge of conspiracy to receive explosives.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment, which was announced at the
Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office here, Marshall, a prisoner in
the Pennsylvania State Correctional Institution at Graterford,
planned to escape using guns and dynamite. He asked his mother to
buy the dynamite for him.
</P>
<P>
   In her efforts in October she met with an undercover agent who
was posing as one of Marshall's friends. The agent offered to sell
Vickers five sticks of dynamite and a Glock 9 mm semiautomatic
pistol, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.
</P>
<P>
   Vickers bought what she thought was the dynamite and gun from
the agent, wrapped the simulated dynamite in birthday wrapping
paper and took it to her home, where she planned to store it until
she visited her son, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Marshall and Vickers each face up to 20 years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is serving a life term for the 1988 murder of a woman
in Philadelphia. Marshall tried to rob the woman at gunpoint as she
sat in a truck selling fish with her 4-year-old son. When the woman
pulled out a gun, Marshall shot and killed her.

<HEADLINE> Mother gets 25 to life in baby slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A 24-year-old woman convicted of killing her
baby by slamming her head against a wall up to 60 times was
sentenced to 25 years to life in prison Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Mitchell was found guilty in late May of killing
3-month-old Ana Marie in July 1999 when the girl would not stop
crying. The baby, injured so badly a pathologist could not count
the number of fractures she received, died the day after the
beating.
</P>
<P>
   The little girl suffered brain injuries consistent with those
caused by a high-speed car crash - not with falling off a couch,
the first explanation Mitchell gave police.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, Mitchell changed her story, saying her statement to
police was coerced and the baby must have been killed by either her
boyfriend or her 2-year-old son. Police ruled out the boyfriend and
son as suspects.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire' Has 6 Big Winners  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- They're writing checks furiously over at ''Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC's hit game show has two million-dollar winners -- the fifth
and sixth since its debut last August -- in programs airing over the
next week. Both shows were taped last month.
</P>
<P>
   The winners come at a key time for ''Millionaire.'' While it
still draws a formidable audience, landing in Nielsen Media
Research's top 10 even in repeats last week, the show has been
eclipsed in attention by the CBS reality shows ''Survivor'' and
''Big Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday's show, a high school math teacher from
Collierville, Tenn., won $1 million by correctly identifying
Lesotho as a landlocked country entirely contained within another
country. Kim Hunt's other choices were Burkina Faso, Mongolia and
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, 41, answered the question without a lifeline left. He said
he was certain the correct country was in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He used two lifelines on the $500,000 question before
identifying Marni Nixon as the singer whose voice was dubbed in for
the character Eliza Doolittle in the 1964 movie, ''My Fair Lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, who had made dozens of calls trying to get on the show,
said he wants to buy a laptop computer with his winnings and donate
money to help build Baptist churches. He'll invest the remainder,
and plans to quit his part-time jobs driving a school bus and
working in a coffee shop.
</P>
<P>
   He said he almost gave up his attempts to get on the show, but
his students kept reminding him of his admonition to never give up
on a dream.
</P>
<P>
   ABC wouldn't say who the sixth winner is.
</P>
<P>
   The two winners aren't an indication the show is getting easier,
said executive producer Michael Davies. The British version of
''Millionaire,'' on the air two years, has never crowned a big
winner.
</P>
<P>
   Davies said he tries to challenge contestants with tough
questions in different subjects if they reach the final four
questions, but he doesn't want to make the job impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowing the effort our contestants have to go through to make
it on the program, I have to give them a fighting chance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in one of the ''Millionaire'' shows to be aired over the
next week, a player missed the usually easy $100 question,
something only three of the show's approximately 250 contestants
have done.
</P>
<P>
   Since its special celebrity series in May, ''Millionaire'' has
become more a television institution than an event -- a mantle it
has passed to ''Survivor,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   He saluted the CBS rival, which beat ''Millionaire''
head-to-head in the ratings its second week on the air in early
June.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are fantastic days to be a reality television
producer,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. (AP) - William Labrador's three-week Caribbean
holiday has stretched on for six months. But he's hardly enjoying
the pleasures of the island of Tortola - he's in jail charged with
a murder he says he knows nothing about.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador, 36, a Manhattan public relations man, went to the
island about 60 miles east of Puerto Rico in late December to surf
and celebrate the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 15, days before his planned return, Labrador and three
friends were arrested and charged with the death of Lois McMillen,
a 34-year-old abstract artist and feminist from Middlebury, Conn.,
who was visiting her parents at their island villa.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador and his friends have been in a mountaintop jail since
as his mother, who is from Southampton, spearheads a campaign for
his freedom, contacting political figures, the State Department and
the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all a big mess,'' a soft-spoken Labrador said in a
telephone interview from jail. ''I can't help but imagine that this
is what purgatory is like.
</P>
<P>
   ''But,'' he added, ''I have faith. I know in my heart I am
innocent. I just keeping saying to myself I have to let the process
find me not guilty. I am powerless to do anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   When arrested, Labrador was staying with a friend, Michael
Spicer, 36. Over the past 10 years, he has made numerous visits to
a home owned by Spicer's family on Tortola, part of the British
Virgin chain.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador said McMillen stopped by Spicer's house on Thursday,
Jan. 13. Then he, McMillen, Spicer and a friend of Spicer, Evan
George, 22, of Washington, D.C., had drinks and chicken wings at a
bar. Labrador said he returned alone to Spicer's house about 7 p.m.
while the others visited another nightspot. That was the last time
he saw McMillen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, the three men and another Spicer house guest,
Alex Benedetto, 34, of Manhattan, hiked all day and had an evening
barbecue. Labrador said he then went to bed and the three others
headed off to a nearby bar. He heard them come back around 2:30
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the police came to Spicer's and arrested the four
men, charging them with murdering McMillen, whose fully clothed
body had been found that morning near the shore.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the men were seen with McMillen in the days before
her death and quoted a witness as saying he saw the victim walking
alone on the beach Friday night, followed by three shadowy figures
whom he could not identify.
</P>
<P>
   McMillen's parents said she drove to the Jolly Roger nightclub
by herself that Friday, and the club's bartender said McMillen left
alone about 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''To us, this is a mystery, but I'm sure they will find out who
did this to my daughter,'' McMillen's mother, Josephine, said by
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador says he hardly knew McMillen, having met her only
twice. One of the men arrested with him, Benedetto, admitted to
having an affair with the woman several years ago but said it ended
amicably.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland Yard is conducting DNA tests on a stained shirt and a
sneaker seized from the defendants to determine if the stains are
blood and, if so, whose blood, said prosecutor Terrence Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The results are to be presented at a hearing set for July 25. If
there is evidence linking any of the men to the death, a trial
would not be held until at least October when the high court sits.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Gonsalves, an attorney representing Labrador, said that
the case is dragging on because ''the prosecution has been tardy in
sending out the items for testing.''
</P>
<P>
   He said tests were done in Barbados and Jamaica before the
seized items were sent to London. A hearing to examine the evidence
has been postponed several times.
</P>
<P>
   Labrador's mother, Barbara, chairwoman of the Southampton Town
Zoning Board of Appeals, visits him as often as she can. ''I think
it has been a horrendous mistake from the beginning, and
unfortunately police did not investigate her death properly,'' Mrs.
Labrador said. ''The initial coroner's report stated she drowned.
Her bruises probably came from hitting the rocks. This was a tragic
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Williams disagrees. ''We are confident that this was
certainly a homicide,'' he said. The victim was beaten but there
was no sign of robbery or rape, he said. ''We have a theory but I
am not going to try this in the press.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Labrador remains in a 6- by 12-foot cell in her
Majesty's Prison at Balsam Ghut. Labrador says he spends his days
in prayer and meditation, or he writes in a diary and reads under
the single lightbulb dangling from the ceiling. He says the guards
treat him well but the food is not very appetizing. He's lost 20
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   During his hour exercise period, he jogs in a small fenced area
overlooking the glistening sea. ''It is so beautiful. That's the
irony,'' he said. ''I am trying to live my life as it is now. I
won't get these days back.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ledge of the tiny window in his cell, he is growing a
garden in three plastic cups from seeds his mother sent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The flowers are doing quite well,'' he said. ''They are
morning glories and forget-me-nots.''

electric chair since Virginia gave death row inmates a choice
between electrocution and lethal injection in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Clagett was convicted of shooting the owner of the Witchduck
Inn, two employees and a customer. Each was shot once in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Clagett's girlfriend, who had been fired from her job as a
waitress at the tavern before the killings, also was convicted and
is serving five life sentences. Among those killed was her
replacement, Karen Sue Rounds, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Also killed were Lam Van Son, 41, the bar owner; Wendel G.
''J.R.'' Parrish Jr., 32, a cook; and Abdelaziz Gren, 34, a patron.
</P>
<P>
   In a final statement before his execution, a weeping Clagett
apologized to the victim's families.
</P>
<P>
   He had written to Son's widow, the couple's 11-year-old son and
other victims' relatives asking for forgiveness. The boy had been
asleep in a room at the inn when the killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Son's widow said the letters only convinced her that execution
was just.
</P>
<P>
   Clagett's mother, Iris Etter, said she understands the contempt
people have for her son, but she said: ''I'd like for people to
know that he is not the murderer they think he is. Michael has
found peace and he knows what he's done.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Drug Plan Disputed  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombia has agreed to test a naturally
occurring fungicide to determine whether it is feasible for
widespread eradication of narcotics plants, says the State
Department. But at least one senior Colombian official disputed
that claim.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the fungicide is
expected be tested in Colombia over a two-year period and then ''it
will be up to the government of Colombia to evaluate the results
and determine the next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The testing, funded by a $3 million U.S. contribution, would be
carried out by Colombian officials and the U.N. Drug Control
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bogota, Colombia's environmental minister, Juan Mayr,
denied that his country had agreed to the tests, saying that the
fungus might threaten the country's ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government of Colombia, after consulting with experts on
the matter, did not accept the proposal for conducting tests of the
fungus ... because any agent foreign to the native ecosystems of
our country could present grave risks to the environment and human
health,'' insisted Mayr.
</P>
<P>
   The statement was in a letter to the New York Times, which first
reported the planned tests in Thursday's edition.
</P>
<P>
   Mayr was quoted by the Times as saying in an interview: ''What
we want is a program of research -- and only research -- on the use
of biological controls against these crops.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mayr in his letter, a copy of which was circulated Thursday
by Mayr's office in Bogota, claimed his remark had been
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the fungicide, known as fusarium oxysporum, could
be the answer in the long search for a means of reversing what has
been a steady growth in the production of coca leaf and opium poppy
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian drug cartels have been able to offset extensive
chemical spraying by opening up new areas for cultivating narcotics
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents say a big advantage of the fungus is that it
grows naturally, is safe for the environment, and that decades must
pass before a treated area is suitable again for growing narcotics
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department tests have shown that the fungus will
kill narcotics plants without harming other plants or animal life,
advocates says.
</P>
<P>
   ''These micro-organisms have the potential to cripple drug crops
before they are even harvested,'' one proponent, Republican Sen.
Mike DeWine of Ohio, has said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine was unavailable for comment on Thursday, but an aide said
the decision was ''a positive step forward.'' Efforts to reach
Colombian officials for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fl., has said all indications are that the
fungicide ''has the potential for making a big difference in the
drug war. This could be the silver bullet.'' The Colombian decision
to go ahead with testing was made with the strong encouragement of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there will be other hurdles to clear if the tests show the
product is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The next problem would be to find a way to produce the fungicide
in quantities that will yield the desired results. In addition, a
delivery mechanism has to be found, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have become increasingly alarmed about
the repeated failure of an extensive eradication program to reverse
what they call an ''explosion'' in coca production in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA estimate in January showed a substantial increase in coca
cultivation, and there is no reason to believe the next estimate,
due in January 2001, will not show another increase, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recently approved legislation to provide $1.3 billion
to Colombia to fight narcotraffickers and the insurgents who
protect the drug trade.

<HEADLINE> Protests, Power Outages Plague Fiji  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL ALEXANDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Hundreds of protesters massed at the entrance
to Fiji's main military base Thursday, demanding the resignation of
the civilian government selected after gunmen took the country's
leaders hostage in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The capital, Suva, was hit by a power outage that lasted more
than five hours. Fijian television reported that the water to the
main power station was cut by supporters of coup leader George
Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders met into the night Thursday inside the base
with 12 chiefs representing the protesters. One chief from the
district housing the hydroelectric plant said the power went out
because some workers at the plant were taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Civil unrest appeared to be spreading a day after Fiji's
military leaders said they would isolate rebels who have been
holding 27 hostages in Parliament since May 19.
</P>
<P>
   But the tribal chiefs on Friday were reportedly called to
mediate in talks between the military and Speight aimed at
resolving Fiji's 7-week government hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and military commander Commodore Frank Bainimarama were
expected to meet face-to-face Friday afternoon for the first time
in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has scorned Tuesday's installation of an all-Fijian
government that promised to start rewriting the 1997 multiracial
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military met his demand to depose Prime Minister
Mahendra Chaudhry, the first Fijian of Indian ancestry to lead the
country, Speight wanted his own choice for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people identifying themselves as indigenous landowners
and coup supporters gathered Thursday outside the military's
headquarters in Suva.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are here to protest the new government,'' spokesman Jah
Senikudra said. ''We don't know these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidents elsewhere in the country underscored the sensitivities
involved in resolving the crisis that has divided the South Pacific
nation along ethnic lines -- 51 percent of the people are indigenous
Fijians and many resent the clout of ethnic Indians who account for
44 percent and dominated the ousted government.
</P>
<P>
   A sit-in by a few dozen villagers forced a two-hour closure
Thursday of the airport terminal in Labasa, a town on the northern
island of Vanua Levu and site of a brief military mutiny two days
earlier. And about a dozen people briefly blocked a side road off
the main highway between Suva and Nata, where the country's
international airport is located.
</P>
<P>
   At Parliament, three men in skirts of palm fronds raised an
ornate flag of pounded tree bark in defiance of the military.
</P>
<P>
   The military had said it would stop people from entering the
Parliament complex at midnight Wednesday. But enforcement of the
roughly one-square-mile exclusion zone was lax with supporters of
Speight allowed in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Speight has warned the hostages could be harmed if the military
stops the free access or cuts utilities.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Osman Siddique, who lives just outside the
exclusion zone, said Thursday he had no plans to leave. ''The U.S.
ambassador doesn't move, whether it is Kuwait or Lebanon. Under the
Geneva Conventions they have to protect us,'' Siddique said.
</P>
<P>
   Commodore Frank Bainimarama, who assumed power 10 days after the
coup, has been reluctant to take strong action as long as no harm
came to any of the hostages, who include Chaudhry.

<HEADLINE> Police: Colts' Lane Killed by Wife  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Indianapolis Colts running back Fred
Lane, whose brushes with the law increased as his career faded, was
shot to death Thursday by his wife, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was pronounced dead at his Charlotte home at 3:15 p.m.
after an argument with his wife, 25-year-old Deidra. No charges
were immediately filed.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, a 5-foot-10, 205-pound running back, was the leading
career rusher for the Carolina Panthers, who traded him to the
Colts in April.
</P>
<P>
   Police questioned Deidra Lane, along with family members and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The investigation to this point has revealed that Deidra Lane
shot her husband during a domestic dispute,'' the police said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   A 7-day-old infant was with Deidra Lane at the police station.
Their house was decorated with pink balloons and a pink stork. The
Lanes also have a 5-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   The Colts released a statement that said the team was ''shocked
and saddened'' by news of Lane's death.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's father, Fred Lane Sr., said his son and daughter-in-law
had been having difficulties recently. Lane had spent the past
couple of weeks at the family home in Nashville, Tenn., but visited
Charlotte briefly a week ago, his father said.
</P>
<P>
   He had left Tennessee on a flight to Charlotte about two hours
before he was shot, the elder Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   Deidra Lane filed a complaint against her husband in March,
saying he snatched a necklace from around her neck during an
argument, causing her to fall. She did not press charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, 24, also had a case pending against him related to his
Feb. 3 arrest in Tennessee. A grand jury in Jackson, Tenn.,
indicted him Monday on the misdemeanor drug charges, but
prosecutors dropped weapons charges against him, saying there
wasn't enough evidence to support it.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers suspended Lane for one game in 1998 when he made a
lewd gesture to fans at Giants Stadium after scoring a touchdown
against the New York Jets. The same season, he was demoted to
special teams duty after missing a team flight to Dallas, and later
apologized for refusing to stand for the national anthem at a game
in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-10, 205-pound Lane was the leading career rusher for
the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his trade, Carolina coach George Seifert said
team owner Jerry Richardson never ordered him to drop Lane, but he
knew the Panthers had to cut their ties with troublesome players.
</P>
<P>
   Lane spent three seasons with Carolina and finished with 2,004
yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Lane Sr. said his son had been training in Indianapolis before
visiting Tennessee. ''Everything was going great,'' in his son's
life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane is one of two former Panthers to face legal troubles in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Rae Carruth, the Panthers' top 1997 draft pick, was charged last
fall with fatally shooting his pregnant girlfriend, Cherica Adams.
Carruth is being held without bond in Charlotte, while he awaits
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers re-signed Lane before the 1999 season to a
two-year, $1.276 million contract with a $300,000 signing bonus.
Lane shared rushing duties with Tshimanga Biakabutuka but played
largely as a backup late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   In what would be his last game for Carolina, Lane started for an
injured Biakabutuka and rushed for a season-high 90 yards and his
only touchdown of the season in a loss at Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Gymnast Miller Injures Knee  </HEADLINE>
By DANNY BOYD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Olympic gold medalist Shannon Miller injured
her right knee Thursday when she fell during practice for a meet,
and her coach said she ''most likely'' won't compete this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Miller could put weight on the knee and was walking after the
mishap. X-rays showed there wasn't any structural damage or
ligament damage, said Steve Nunno, Miller's longtime coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's basically a sprained knee,'' Nunno said. ''After the
prognosis of no structural damage, I think everybody took a deep
sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller also will have an MRI exam, and Nunno said they'll make a
final determination about Saturday's U.S. Classic after they get
those results. The U.S. Classic is a qualifier for the national
championships, which will be held July 26-29 in St. Louis, but
Miller could petition for a spot at nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never can tell with this kind of an injury. It may look
worse than it was. Hopefully that's the case,'' Nunno said. ''Right
now it looks like she will not (compete).''
</P>
<P>
   Miller got hurt as she was working on a new vault at the end of
practice. Her hand slipped as she pushed off the vault, and she
didn't get as high into the air as she normally does.
</P>
<P>
   She slammed into the mat, landing awkwardly on both of her
knees. Her right knee appeared to take the worst of the fall, Nunno
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's a very tough individual and didn't cry a tear,'' he
said. ''The whole time we were driving home, she was very positive.
Up spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the most decorated American gymnast ever, retired after
the 1996 Olympics, where she won two gold medals. She went to
college and got married during her time off, but she decided in
January she wanted a shot at a third Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gymnastics is such a part of my life,'' she told reporters
Thursday. ''It has been for 17 years now and I'm just not ready to
give it up.''

<HEADLINE> Price Shoots 63 at Western Open  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- That dominating, near-perfect game Tiger
Woods had at the U.S. Open wasn't there. This time it was Nick
Price who was doing everything right.
</P>
<P>
   Price tied the tournament record with a 9-under-par 63 Thursday
and took a three-stroke lead in the first round of the Western
Open. Woods, playing for the first time since his record 15-stroke
victory at the U.S. Open three weeks ago, was seven shots back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was ready to go,'' said Woods, the defending Western
champion. ''It's just that the score didn't reflect how hard I
played today, and a lot of that was just the putts didn't fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything was falling for Price, who birdied eight of the first
11 holes. Jim Furyk was at 66, and Carl Paulson, Steve Stricker,
Fred Couples and Stuart Appleby were another stroke back in the
tournament sponsored by Advil.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got off to such a good start, I just kept going. That was
what was fun,'' Price said. ''When I birdied 11, I thought I may
have an outside shot at 59. But once again, if you get too far
ahead of yourself, it comes up and kicks you in the backside.''
</P>
<P>
   Price, who won the Western Open in 1993 and 1994, picked up
another stroke with a birdie on the par-4 16th. Hitting his second
shot from about 170 yards, Price put it just a foot from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded as he walked toward the green, and Price
touched the bill of his hat in acknowledgment. As he walked to the
17th tee, someone yelled, ''Third time's the charm, Nick! Third
time's the charm!'' Price just smiled.
</P>
<P>
   He had a chance to pick up another stroke on 17 and get the
tournament record all to himself, but his birdie putt from about
five feet rolled around the left edge of the cup. The crowd gasped,
and a frustrated Price swung his putter like a baseball bat before
tapping in for par.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the easiest putt I had all day -- uphill, left to right
on the right edge -- and I just pulled it,'' he said. ''That was a
little annoying because I had holed a lot of putts that were
tougher than that with more break. But hey, it all evens out in the
wash.''
</P>
<P>
   After his frustration of the last few months, Price isn't about
to quibble over a missed shot or two. The 1994 PGA champion began
the season strong, finishing second at the South African Open and
third at the Doral-Ryder Open. He also tied for third at The
Players Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But he missed the cut at the BellSouth Classic after shooting a
77 in the second round. He tied for 11th at the Masters despite
shooting only one sub-70 round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I needed something like that because the last five, six, seven
weeks, I've been floundering a little bit,'' he said. ''Golf is
like life. Sometimes things happen and you just can't explain them.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I really felt like I got back on track today. I had some
good memories, some good thoughts about things that happened in
times gone by.''
</P>
<P>
   While Price might have been thinking about 1993 and 1994, most
in the crowd were thinking of a much more recent tournament. It
will be three weeks on Sunday that Woods shattered records no one
ever dreamed would be broken as he won the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't play poorly Thursday, but he didn't have that edge he
had at Pebble Beach, either. The ball wouldn't fall the way it
usually does for him, and he missed putts he normally makes with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   On the par-3 2nd, his tee shot was short and to the right. He
chipped on and the ball headed right for the pin -- only to scoot
right by and roll four feet past. He still had a chance for par,
but his putt hit the back edge of the cup and spun out.
</P>
<P>
   On the next hole, a par-4, his birdie putt from 10 feet curled
around the very edge of the hole and didn't drop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just didn't hit the ball very close, and when I did, I
didn't make the putts,'' he said. ''I hit a lot of putts that
lipped out, and that's just the way it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Though disappointed in his round, Woods isn't exactly sweating
his seven-stroke deficit. After all, this is the guy who came from
seven strokes back with seven holes to go to win at Pebble Beach in
February. He also came back from eight strokes down to beat Ernie
Els in a playoff at the 1998 Johnnie Walker Classic in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked for his name on the leaderboard a couple of times and
didn't see it. I was kind of surprised,'' Price said. ''But I don't
know how you come back off a U.S. Open like that. It must be pretty
hard to tee it up this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll wake up just now,'' Price added. ''Probably just having
a little snooze at the moment.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Price tied the course record of 63 set by Jeff Sluman in
1992 and matched by John Adams in 1993 and Dudley Hart in 1998. ...
Curtis Strange withdrew from the tournament Thursday morning with
flu like symptoms. ... Franklin Langham had a hole-in-one on No. 2.
... Phil Mickelson's Western Open woes continued. Mickelson, whose
best finish at the Western is a tie for 26th, shot a 2-over 74.

violence,'' police spokesman Keith Bridges said. A former Carolina Panther,
Lane, 24, was traded to the Colts in April.

<HEADLINE> Pathmark bondholders to vote on bond debt agreement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARTERET, N.J. (AP) - Pathmark Stores Inc.'s bondholders have
until Friday to vote on an agreement that would eliminate $960
million in bond debt and give them full ownership of the company.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the Carteret subsidiary of Supermarkets General
Holding Corp. will file a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy and
begin the transfer of Pathmark to the bondholders, company
officials told The Philadelphia Inquirer Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pathmark would then be a publicly traded company, with almost
all shares held by the bondholders. The company would still have
$600 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   A prepackaged bankruptcy allows for a faster Chapter 11 process
because creditors agree in advance on the company's future.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said the result of the bondholders' vote will
be announced next week. They said they don't expect any layoffs or
store closings.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Pathmark reported that it lost $21.2 million in its
first quarter, which ended April 29. That was more than double its
net loss of $9.2 million a year earlier. Sales for the first
quarter, however, were up 2.8 percent to $919.2 million, primarily
because of new stores.
</P>
<P>
   Pathmark operates 136 supermarkets, mostly in the Philadelphia
and New York-New Jersey metropolitan areas.

<HEADLINE> Farrakhan: US Imposes Its Will  </HEADLINE>
By HARMONIE TOROS
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan on
Thursday charged that the U.S. government was imposing its will on
the world and he criticized the United Nations, calling it the
''extended arm'' of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Farrakhan condemned the United States, claiming it attempted to
interfere in the internal affairs of Cuba, Iran and Libya. He also
charged that it was using the world body to punish those countries
that do not agree with it.
</P>
<P>
   The Nation of Islam billed Farrakhan's appearance as an address
to ''the world body of the United Nations.'' But the event just
drew diplomats from countries at odds with the United States,
including Cuba, Libya, and Iraq. He spoke on invitation fo Libya's
U.N. Mission and the Family Federation of World Peace and
Unification International, founded by Rev. Sung Myung Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking without notes in a U.N. conference room, Farrakhan
called for brotherhood among men and women, and people of different
countries and religions, to achieve world peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order for the United Nations to be an instrument for peace,
it must not be the extended arm of America's foreign policy
objectives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also indicated opposition to U.N. sanctions against Iraq,
accusing the world body of giving in to ''America's fetish with
Saddam Hussein.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council -- where the United States is a
veto-wielding permanent member -- imposed sanctions on Iraq after
its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   ''America must not take away the right of self determination
from any nation on this earth, or any people on this earth,''
Farrakhan said, calling on the American people to pressure the
government into changing its foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   America is also spending money in the wrong places, Farrakhan
hinted, stating that the government had spent billions of dollars
in aid to Israel but hasn't paid reparations for slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Reparations are needed, he said, but are not enough and must be
accompanied with land and ''with support in that land for enough
years to give us the chance to come up out of slavery and determine
a way for ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Settlement Reached in R.I. Oil Spill  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL MELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- A barge owner and others responsible for
a 1996 oil spill that killed millions of lobsters and other
wildlife off the Rhode Island coast, agreed Thursday to pay about
$16 million to restore the Block Island Sound environment.
</P>
<P>
   In a civil settlement announced by the U.S. Department of
Justice, the company, its insurer and other parties agreed to pay
more than $8 million to restore ponds, replenish shellfish and
protect habitat for loons, sea birds and piping plovers.
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed to buy 1.25 million female lobsters to restock
Block Island Sound over the next three to five years, a projected
expected to cost at least $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement still must be approved by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   The barge North Cape, owned by Eklof Marine Corp. of Staten
Island, N.Y., ran aground during a storm Jan. 19, 1996, spilling
828,000 gallons of home heating oil in Block Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's filing is the final chapter in a four-year struggle to
restore the resources damaged during the North Cape oil spill,''
Gov. Lincoln Almond said in a statement. ''It means we can finally
begin to see tangible restoration projects.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, Eklof and other responsible parties have agreed to pay
more than $50 million in criminal penalties and other spill-related
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Eklof has since been taken over by K-Sea Transportation Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Deming Sherman, a lawyer representing K-Sea, said Thursday the
company was pleased with the agreement. He said the company still
faces a lawsuit by lobstermen and other claims it is trying to
resolve privately.

<HEADLINE> Thursday's Canada News Briefs  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressConvicted New Brunswick Pedophile Toft Refused Parole
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Karl Toft, a convicted pedophile who
sodomized dozens of boys at a New Brunswick reform school, was
refused release into the community Thursday following a National
Parole Board hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the two-person board panel could not agree on whether
Toft still poses a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because your case has been very difficult to assess, we as
board members were not able to unanimously conclude that your risk
is manageable for full parole release,'' Patricia Gutwald said.
</P>
<P>
   Toft will face another parole hearing next month before two
different board members. Both must agree before he can be freed.
</P>
<P>
   Toft was a staff member at the Youth Training Center in
Kingsclear, New Brunswick. In 1992, he was sentenced to 13 years in
prison for 34 sex crimes against boys in his care committed over a
period of three decades.
Kingston's Notorious Prison for Women Shuts Down
</P>
<P>
   KINGSTON, Ontario (AP) -- Kingston's infamous Prison for Women
closed its doors Thursday in a private ceremony marking the end of
a turbulent history at the 66-year-old institution.
</P>
<P>
   Solicitor General Lawrence MacAulay and Corrections Canada head
Ole Ingstrup joined former inmates and employees at the dreary
stone facility, which has been the subject of at least 13 inquiries
and commissions.
</P>
<P>
   The Prison For Women gained notoriety in 1994 when six women
were strip searched and shackled by mostly male guards. Four years
later, each of the women was awarded $50,000 after an investigation
provided the public with a shocking picture of life inside the
maximum-security prison.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation in 1998, conducted by Correctional Service of
Canada, confirmed that 23 women were given the hallucinogen LSD in
a pilot project in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   There had also been several escapes at the prison, and five
suicides between 1988 and 1991.
Imperial Tobacco Launches Lawsuit Against Federal Labeling Law
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Imperial Tobacco filed a lawsuit Thursday that
aims to strike down new federal legislation requiring larger health
warnings on cigarette packages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Quebec Superior Court, asks for an
immediate halt to the law's requirement that the warnings be big
enough to cover half of a cigarette package.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Canada's largest manufacturer of tobacco, contends
the labeling law is unconstitutional because it infringes on the
corporation's freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
   ''These packages belong to us,'' said Michel Descoteaux, an
Imperial Tobacco spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   He said the firm, whose brands include Du Maurier and Players,
doesn't object to warning labels but requiring half the package to
contain health messages is excessive.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the government has not produced any credible
evidence that large warning notices would lead to a reduction in
the number of Canadians who smoke.
Human Rights Laws Toward Seniors Called Discriminatory
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Human rights laws that don't protect people who
choose to keep working after age 65 are discriminatory and will
likely be challenged in court as the population ages, Ontario's
chief human rights commissioner said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While releasing the commission's statistics for last year, Keith
Norton said Ontario policy makers will likely have to extend the
age of protection for workers as the average age of Canadians
continues to grow older.
</P>
<P>
   Although no laws state when Canadians must retire, workers are
only protected from discrimination on the basis of age up to 65,
Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the type of job, mandatory retirement age in Canada
varies depending on the employer, collective agreements and
professions.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Haiti To Probe Vote Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council urged Haitian
authorities Thursday to investigate reports of irregularities in
May's national and local elections, stating that free and fair
elections are ''crucial to democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties charge that the count from May 21 elections
was rigged to ensure a massive victory for the Lavalas Family
party, of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is favored
to win November presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-member council, in a statement after a briefing by Angela
Kane of the U.N. Department of Political Affairs, ''expressed
concern with the violence during the electoral period and reports
of irregularities in electoral procedures and the changes occurring
in'' the electoral council.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the electoral council fled Haiti for the United
States, saying he feared for his life because he refused to sign
off on erroneous results. Two other members of the nine-member
council resigned over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council urged ''the Haitian government to
investigate reports of irregularities,'' the statement read.
</P>
<P>
   But Haitian President Rene Preval called the protests
''secondary'' and warned Haitians would be giving up on democracy
if the election results were not upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti has been without a Parliament since Preval dismissed
legislators to resolve a longstanding power struggle in 1999, and
then named a government by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Under Haitian law, candidates must win a majority void to avoid
a second round of balloting. But officials counted the votes of
only the top four contenders in each race, creating erroneous
winning percentages that observers say gave first-round victories
to several Lavalas candidates.
</P>
<P>
   A second vote is set for July 9.

<HEADLINE> 'Titanic' Clothes Suppliers Slain  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW BARAKAT
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARMVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Mother and daughter antiques dealers who
supplied vintage clothes for movies such as ''Titanic'' were found
slain at their homes, and the daughter's ex-husband was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Varner, 50, was found dead in the kitchen of her home
around 7 p.m. Wednesday, shortly after her mother, Suzanne Arena,
79, was found slain in her home in a neighboring county.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Varner, 53, who was divorced from Susan Varner in 1998
after 20 years of marriage, was arrested after a police officer
stopped him for speeding and saw blood and an ax in the car, police
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Police gave few details of the slayings but did say Susan Varner
apparently had been struck with a blunt instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Varner was being held without bond, and a hearing was set for
Monday. Calls to two attorneys who were appointed Thursday to
represent him were not immediately returned late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The victims owned Suzi's Antiques in this south-central Virginia
town, which supplied vintage clothing for movies with historical
themes.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something this town won't get over any time soon,''
said Irene Flowers, co-owner of the Wooden Heart gift shop across
the street from the antiques store. ''It's not just a murder. It's
something out of a Stephen King movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Varner and Arena did extensive work for ''Titanic,'' which
won an Academy Award for best costumes. Among the many items they
provided were the black beaded dress that Kate Winslet wore when
she threatened to jump off the stern of the ship early in the movie
and the jacket that Leonardo DiCaprio threw to the deck as he
rushed to save her.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw the movie -- I'm so jaded, because I'm so overworked
-- it was like my heart skipped a beat, I could not believe how
beautiful they were,'' Varner said in 1998. ''We were just
stunned.''
</P>
<P>
   The women spent about half their time traveling around the
country in a van buying clothes. Celebrity clients included Johnny
Cash and his wife, June Carter, who bought a collection of
Victorian clothing from the women for $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of our customers don't treat the shop like a store,''
Varner said in 1998. ''Those who know about us or who have been
here before treat it like a museum.''

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 2, Astros 1  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Geraldo Guzman scattered four hits over eight
innings in his major league debut to lead the Arizona Diamondbacks
to a 2-1 victory and a three-game sweep of the Houston Astros on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman (1-0), who left baseball in 1990 and worked seven years
as a carpenter in the Dominican Republic before resuming his
playing career, struck out three and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mantei pitched the ninth for his third save to send the
Astros to their 11th loss in 13 games. Houston was swept for the
fifth time this season in a three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Steve Finley made a wall-crashing catch with two
outs and a runner on second to help preserve the lead for Guzman to
end the eighth inning. Finley fell on the warning track, remained
there for several minutes, but then walked off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman, 27, took up carpentry after he was released by the
Montreal Expos in 1990. He signed a minor league contract with the
Diamondbacks on Nov. 12, started the season in Double-A and worked
his way to his first major league game.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman gave up two hits in the first inning and then retired the
next 10 batters until Moises Alou started the fifth with a single
to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Following Richard Hidalgo's single, a double-play grounder by
Chris Truby to get the Astros within 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks took a 2-0 lead off Chris Holt (3-10), who lost
his fourth straight decision.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Womack led off the game with a single, went to third on
center fielder Hidalgo's fielding error on a single by Luis
Gonzalez and scored on Finley's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Conti hit a triple in the fourth and scored on Damian
Miller's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Holt (3-10) struck out six and allowed four hits.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jeff Bagwell played in his 1,400th major league game,
becoming the sixth player in franchise history to play in that many
games. First-base coach Jose Cruz holds the team record with 1,870
games. ... Gonzalez hit for the cycle on Wednesday and went
7-for-14 in the series. ... The game marked only the third without
a homer at Enron Field this season. ... The teams combined for just
eight hits, the lowest total at Enron Field. The previous low was
nine hits when Houston played Colorado on May 8. ... The Astros are
0-for-49 when trailing after eight innings.

<HEADLINE> Williams Decides To Stay at Kansas  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) -- Roy Williams will remain at Kansas, ending
his week of agonizing over whether to return to North Carolina to
become its basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   His decision Thursday set off a celebration among Jayhawks fans
who had pleaded with Williams not to take the job at his alma
mater, succeeding Bill Guthridge who retired last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm staying. If that's OK, why don't we just end this press
conference right now,'' said Williams, who was misty-eyed as he
talked and at times choked up. ''I guess I could have just called
from the beach and said I'm staying, but that didn't seem the right
way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision here I've made came after the toughest seven days
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd estimated at 16,300 watched the news conference on a
giant video screen in the football stadium and cheered almost every
word.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made the best decision for me. As long as I can do what's
right for my players, that's all that matters,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina has been without a coach since Guthridge
unexpectedly retired.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in the Carolina family are tremendously disappointed,''
North Carolina athletic director Dick Baddour said at a news
conference in Chapel Hill on Thursday night. ''We are the
University of North Carolina and we will move forward. I know our
fans are disappointed because of their love for Roy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Roy never told us in a definite way he was coming,'' Baddour
said.
</P>
<P>
   Baddour said Guthridge would act as interim coach of the Tar
Heels and that there was timetable for hiring his replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Williams, who had been an assistant to Dean
Smith at North Carolina for 10 years, was strolling alone across
campus, wearing the haggard look of a man who had no job, not a man
struggling to pick between two great ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''My decision, as I said, is the most difficult time period I've
ever had,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has a 329-82 record in 12 seasons at Kansas, the
winningest record for a coach in that many seasons. He has taken
the Jayhawks to two Final Fours.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' wait gripped both states for a week. Kansas officials
said almost 2,000 e-mails had arrived addressed to Williams urging
him to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ''My mentors taught me that loyalty is most important. I
couldn't leave my players,'' said Williams, who mingled with crowd
after the news conference. ''I couldn't trade my players. That
became more important than my dream of being at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still want to win it all, that hasn't changed.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as a throng of journalists waited outside Allen
Fieldhouse for word Thursday, Williams walked alone across the
grounds, silently and unsuccessfully groping for his own answer.
</P>
<P>
   He finally left the campus Thursday afternoon, driving off alone
after telling reporters that he was going to his Lawrence home to
''do some thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the day before summer recruiting begins, was Williams'
self-imposed deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Baddour ''recruited me harder than I've ever been
recruited.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I sincerely apologize to him ... just those words aren't
enough,'' Williams said. ''The phone conversation I had with Coach
Smith was again as painful an experience as I could have. Coach
Guthridge was another hard call. He and Coach Smith are the reasons
I'm here today. ... And I can't help but think in some way I've let
him down.''
</P>
<P>
   After flying back from the Carolinas on Wednesday evening,
Williams met for several hours Thursday with athletic director Bob
Frederick, Chancellor Robert Hemenway and members of his coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Williams returned from a vacation at his South Carolina beach
home Wednesday night, denying reports that he had accepted a
multiyear contract to coach North Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 4, Phillies 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Jose Hernandez and Tyler Houston each hit solo
homers as the Milwaukee Brewers snapped the Philadelphia Phillies'
five-game winning streak with a 4-2 victory Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff D'Amico (4-4) breezed through the first and second innings,
but struggled the rest of the way. He worked out of a bases-loaded
jam in the third, then stranded two in the fourth after
surrendering Brian Hunter's solo shot.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amico left after giving up two-out singles to Bobby Abreu and
Scott Rolen in the seventh. He gave up eight hits and two walks,
but struck out three to help the Brewers snap their three-game
losing streak and avoid being swept.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Leskanic relieved in the seventh, and after giving up a
single to Mike Lieberthal to load the bases, retired Ron Gant on a
flyball to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Bob Wickman got three outs for his 12th save in 15
chances, giving up Rolen's RBI single with two outs in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies starter Paul Byrd (2-7) held the Brewers to six hits
through 6 1-3 innings, but two of the hits were two-out solo
homers.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's 10th homer made it 1-0 in the second, and Houston's
sixth made it 2-0 an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, who struck out four and walked two, stopped the Brewers
from padding their 2-1 lead in the fourth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Colombia Eyes Drug Plant Eradication  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Colombia has agreed to work with a United
Nations agency on testing a naturally occurring fungus to determine
whether it can be used for widespread eradication of narcotics
plants, the State Department said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A top Colombian official said no tests would be carried out on
Colombian territory out of concern over possible ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the fungicide is
expected be tested over a two-year period and then ''it will be up
to the government of Colombia to evaluate the results and determine
the next steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The testing, funded by a $3 million U.S. contribution, would be
carried out by Colombian officials and the U.N. Drug Control
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's environmental minister, Juan Mayr, clarifying
published reports about the issue, said in a statement: ''The
government of Colombia, after consulting with experts on the
matter, did not accept the proposal for conducting tests of the
fungus ... because any agent foreign to the native ecosystems of
our country could present grave risks to the environment and human
health.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was in a letter to the New York Times, which first
reported the planned tests in Thursday's edition.
</P>
<P>
   Mayr was quoted by the Times as saying in an interview: ''What
we want is a program of research -- and only research -- on the use
of biological controls against these crops.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayr claimed in his letter, a copy of which was circulated
Thursday by his office in Bogota, that his remarks had been
misinterpreted.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say the fungus, known as fusarium oxysporum, could be
the answer in the long search for a means of reversing what has
been a steady growth in the production of coca leaf and opium poppy
in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian drug cartels have been able to offset extensive
chemical spraying by opening up new areas for cultivating narcotics
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents say a big advantage of the fungus is that it
grows naturally, is safe for the environment, and that decades must
pass before a treated area is suitable again for growing narcotics
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department tests have shown that the fungus will
kill narcotics plants without harming other plants or animal life,
advocates says.
</P>
<P>
   ''These micro-organisms have the potential to cripple drug crops
before they are even harvested,'' one proponent, Republican Sen.
Mike DeWine of Ohio, has said.
</P>
<P>
   DeWine was unavailable for comment on Thursday, but an aide said
the decision was ''a positive step forward.'' Efforts to reach
Colombian officials for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fl., has said all indications are that the
fungicide ''has the potential for making a big difference in the
drug war. This could be the silver bullet.'' The Colombian decision
to go ahead with testing was made with the strong encouragement of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said there will be other hurdles to clear if the tests show the
product is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   The next problem would be to find a way to produce the fungicide
in quantities that will yield the desired results. In addition, a
delivery mechanism has to be found, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have become increasingly alarmed about
the repeated failure of an extensive eradication program to reverse
what they call an ''explosion'' in coca production in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   A CIA estimate in January showed a substantial increase in coca
cultivation, and there is no reason to believe the next estimate,
due in January 2001, will not show another increase, the State
Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recently approved legislation to provide $1.3 billion
to Colombia to fight narcotraffickers and the insurgents who
protect the drug trade.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chided on Clean-Water Plan  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID A. LIEB
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- Two senators accused the Clinton
administration Thursday of rushing proposed environmental rules in
an attempt to circumvent Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to regulate
runoff from farms and businesses in an effort to clean up an
estimated 20,000 streams and lakes that do not meet water-quality
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Congress on June 30 passed budget legislation that included
language barring the use of federal money for the new EPA
regulations -- effectively delaying the rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Sens. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., and Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark.,
said Thursday the Clinton administration had ordered the EPA to
rush the rules to completion.
</P>
<P>
   If the rules are finalized before Clinton's July 13 deadline to
sign the bill, then Congress's prohibition against money for the
new rules may have no effect, they said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jake Siewart declined to say whether the
administration had directed the rules to be speedily implemented.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're examining a number of options to deal with this rider
which we think is ill-advised and undermines some of the
protections for clean water,'' Siewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln said attorneys are studying whether an early imposition
of the rules would negate the spending ban that she and Hutchinson
had inserted into a military appropriations bill.
</P>
<P>
   The senators contend the EPA is overstepping its authority in
attempting to regulate runoff from farms and other agricultural
interests.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA's proposal would require states to submit plans within
15 years to clean up every waterway that fails to meet water
quality standards. Landowners would be required to get a pollution
discharge permit if the EPA found they were contributing to water
quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA has estimated that the program would cost governments
and the private sector less than $100 million. But the General
Accounting Office has disputed that.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, Twins 7  </HEADLINE>
By JASON WOLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Nomar Garciaparra hit two two-run homers and
Paxton Crawford, in just his second major league start, outpitched
Minnesota's Brad Radke as Boston beat the Twins 8-7 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford (1-1) gave up one run on six hits through seven innings
to help the Red Sox complete a four-game sweep. Boston scored 44
runs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Radke (5-10) was making his first start since agreeing Monday to
a four-year, $36 million contract, the richest deal in the Twins'
history. He pitched seven innings and gave up eight runs on seven
hits in his worst outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Radke allowed two-run homers in the first, third and sixth
innings. He had gone four starts without giving up a homer.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was 2-for-4 with four RBIs in his first two-homer
game this season and the 12th of his career. He's hitting .404
(19-for-47) in his last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Daubach was also 2-for-4 with four RBIs for the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fifth straight loss for the Twins, who have lost 12
of their last 19.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett walked in the sixth and Garciaparra hit the next
pitch for his second homer of the game, his 10th this year, into
the left-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's home run in the first inning, which gave Boston a
2-0 lead, was the first homer given up by Radke since June 16
against the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins cut the lead to 2-1 in the first, when Midre Cummings,
who led off the game with a single, scored on Ron Coomer's
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota scored four runs in the bottom of the ninth, including
a two-run shot by David Ortiz, his second home run in as many
nights.
</P>
<P>
   Cristian Guzman was 4-for-5 for Minnesota with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Red Sox outfielder Troy O'Leary left the game with one out
in the eighth after colliding with Garciaparra while trying to
field a fly ball. Garciaparra's shoulder smashed into O'Leary's
chest and both were on the ground for a few moments before O'Leary
walked off. ... It was the first time this season Radke gave up
more than two homers in a start. ... The Red Sox improved to 7-0
against the Twins this season. ... Guzman got thrown out at second
base by about four steps in the third when he tried tagging up on
Matt Lawton's fly ball to center field. ... Crawford, who spent all
of 1998 and 1999 at Double A Trenton, spent just over a month at
Triple-A Pawtucket this season before being promoted to the majors
July 1, the day he made his major league debut in a 7-2 loss to the
White Sox.

   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- A heat wave baking southeastern Europe sent
temperatures rocketing to 113 degrees in some places Thursday, killing 25
people, melting roads in Turkey and driving hundreds to seek medical help.
Firefighters battled hundreds of blazes sparked by arid conditions in Bulgaria,
Croatia, Greece, Italy and Romania. In Turkey, the heat killed 5,200 chickens
and led camel drivers to wet down their animals to cool them down. In Athens,
sweltering residents snapped up air conditioners and set a record for electric

<HEADLINE> Israel Accuses Lebanon of Violations  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Israel accused Lebanon Thursday of giving
''free rein'' to nearly 50 cross-border attacks on Israeli soldiers
and civilians and demanded an immediate end to the violations.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Israel's U.N.
Ambassador Yehuda Lancry called on the Lebanese government ''at
long last'' to deploy its army in the area, disarm the militia
groups, and ''bring peace and security to our common border.''
</P>
<P>
   An annex attached to the letter listed 48 incidents between June
28 and July 4 in which stones or objects were hurled across the
border from the Lebanese side, usually by a few individuals, but on
one occasion by at least 450 people.
</P>
<P>
   Lancry called on the authorities in Beirut to end the violations
and abide by U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and occupied part of southern
Lebanon as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on northern Israel
from 1985 until its withdrawal on May 24. The U.N. Security Council
endorsed the Israeli pullout on June 18.
</P>
<P>
   On June 26, the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon reported half
a dozen Israeli border violations and on July 3, it reported a
dozen. Diplomats described the violations as minor, involving
Israeli use of roads, installations and equipment now in Lebanese
territory.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. peacekeepers have not yet reported on any Lebanese
violations of the temporary border between the two nations which
was drawn by U.N. cartographers to verify the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is pressing for the Lebanese army to deploy to the south
because since the Israeli pullout, Shiite Muslim Hezbollah
guerrillas who fought the Israeli troops for years have moved into
the former occupied zone and taken de facto control. Lancry said
Hezbollah ''participated in some of the attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Lebanese government wants to be sure there are no more
violations of the withdrawal line before giving ''a green light''
for the deployment of its army.
</P>
<P>
   Under 1978 Security Council resolutions, U.N. peacekeeping
troops who verified the Israeli pullout were supposed to deploy to
the border area to help the Lebanese army restore security and
authority in the border zone. But their deployment has also been
delayed.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays 9, Indians 6  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Carlos Delgado had four RBIs and Shannon
Stewart went 4-for-5 with two RBIs Thursday night as the Toronto
Blue Jays avoided a sweep and stayed atop the AL East with a 9-6
victory over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado, who will make his first All-Star appearance next week,
singled in two runs in the third and added a two-run double in the
sixth for Toronto. The Blue Jays, who have been in first place
since June 23, maintained their half-game lead over the New York
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart hit four singles, scored twice and delivered a key
sacrifice fly in the seventh that put the Blue Jays up 7-5. Jose
Cruz Jr. homered in the ninth to make it 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, who has 19 homers, needs one more before Monday to make
the Blue Jays the first team in history to have four players with
at least 20 homers at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramirez hit a two-run homer and Richie Sexson had a pinch
homer for the Indians, who were 0-5-1 in six series before taking
the first two games against Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carpenter (7-7), who had pitched just 10 innings combined
in his previous three starts, managed to stay around for 5 2-3 this
time. He allowed five runs and 11 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Koch put two runners on in the eighth and pitched a
perfect ninth for his 19th save in 22 tries. It was the fifth time
this season Koch has pitched two innings for a save.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Burba (8-4) gave up six runs and 10 hits in a shaky 5 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson's pinch-hit homer in the seventh off John Frascatore
brought the Indians within 7-6. But the Blue Jays added a run in
the eighth when Brad Fullmer singled home Raul Mondesi, who scored
three runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays, who didn't put the Indians away early and ended
up losing on Wednesday after leading 5-0, went up 3-0 in the third
on Mondesi's RBI double and Delgado's two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive RBI doubles by Ricky Ledee and Thome in the bottom
of the inning made it 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   But Toronto continued to knock around Burba in the fourth,
loading the bases and taking a 4-2 lead on Stewart's run-scoring
single. Burba avoided more damage with a pair of strikeouts and got
out of the inning by getting Mondesi to hit into a force.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians closed to 4-3 in the fifth when Jim Thome doubled
and scored on Travis Fryman's single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Indians RF Manny Ramirez began a rehab stint at Triple-A
Buffalo and went 2-for-5 with a double, homer and three RBIs as the
designated hitter during a doubleheader for the Bisons. Ramirez,
out since May 28 with a strained left hamstring, could be back
right after the All-Star break. ...... Toronto SS Alex Gonzalez
left in the fourth with tightness in his right groin. It was just
his second game since June 24 after missing nine games. ...
Sexson's 15th homer this season was also the first pinch-shot of
his career, and the first by an Indians pinch-hitter this season.
... Stewart has 12 career four-hit games.

<HEADLINE> Vieques Protesters Choose Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Two Independence Party leaders
chose jail over fines Thursday in a protest over the Navy's
practice bombing on Vieques island.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Martin, vice president of the party, and Vance Thomas,
the party's candidate for mayor of San Juan, were ordered to pay
fines of $1,000 and $700 respectively for trespassing when they
invaded the Navy's Vieques training ground on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   They were trying to stop the biggest exercises since an April
1999 bombing accident killed a civilian security guard on the
range.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have the key to get out,'' Judge Hector Lafitte told the
men, inviting them to pay the fines. He did not say how long the
men would have to stay in jail if they chose not to. The maximum
penalty for the offense is $5,000 or six months' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Martin and Thomas are among 123 Independence Party members
ordered arrested for breaking into the ground last week. Eight-six
are in jail waiting to go to court. The others haven't been
arrested since warrants were issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders say 50 years of bomb testing has damaged their health
and environment and stunted tourism on Vieques, an island of 9,400
people where 25 percent of workers are unemployed.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Ramirez Homers in Minors  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Manny Ramirez was back in the minors
Thursday, hitting a home run to start another rehab stint. Now the
question is how long he'll be with the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, a free agent at the end of the season, went 2-for-5 and
drove in three runs in a doubleheader as the designated hitter for
the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star outfielder was playing for the first time in 19
days because of a pulled hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez's agent, Jeff Moorad, said Thursday he has had no new
negotiations with Indians general manager John Hart and isn't
expecting the team to make a contract offer before the July 31
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''John has made it clear that so long as the team is in
contention he's not going to disrupt the chemistry of the club,''
Moorad told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''July 31 isn't much of a deadline at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ramirez wants to stay in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Moorad, who negotiated Shawn Green's $84 million deal with the
Dodgers, said he knows the Indians can't afford to make Ramirez the
highest-paid player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We understand the team can only pay Manny what it can pay
him,'' Moorad said, ''and still meet the payroll for the rest of
the team. I think it's fair to say Manny will be the highest-paid
player on the Indians or whomever he plays with. Is enough enough
at a certain level? Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Moorad addressed some recent reports that the Indians were
displeased with how long it has taken Ramirez to return from his
injury, and that Moorad might be urging him not to rush.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hamstrings, as I have learned, are very difficult injuries to
gauge, and Manny is as frustrated as anyone that he's been unable
to help the Indians,'' Moorad said. ''My counsel to him has been,
straight from the beginning, 'Take care of yourself and get back on
the field as soon as possible.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez homered in his second at-bat in Game 1. When he doubled
in two runs in his first at-bat in Game 2, he ran the bases slowly.
Ramirez was lifted for a pinch-hitter in the fourth inning and left
the stadium before the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Bisons manager Joel Skinner said pulling Ramirez had nothing to
do with his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had five at-bats and that was plenty,'' Skinner said. ''He
was fine. For his first game back ... he got his work done.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who was elected to start next week's All-Star game but
won't play, was assigned to the Bisons earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He went on the disabled list June 2, retroactive to May 30. An
initial comeback attempt was cut short when he reaggravated the
hamstring injury in the seventh inning of his first game back with
Double-A Akron on June 17.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting hurt, Ramirez was hitting .322 with 13 home runs
and 47 RBIs in 47 games with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The four-time All-Star finished tied for third in the American
League MVP voting last year.

<HEADLINE> Williams Says 'No' to Tar Heels  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- A sign at the Smith Center this week
read: ''Please come home Roy.'' By late Thursday night, the placard
was down and reality had set in on the North Carolina campus.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of returning to his alma mater, Roy Williams decided to
remain at Kansas, turning down former boss and good friend Dean
Smith and what many believed was a dream job for the winningest
coach of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe his devotion to his players impacted his decision
more than anything else,'' North Carolina athletic director Dick
Baddour said. ''If it weren't for that factor we would probably be
having a different press conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers reported Thursday that Williams had said
''yes'' to coach one of basketball's more storied programs. Baddour
said that wasn't the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Roy never told us in a definite way he was coming,'' Baddour
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels had formed no search committee after Bill
Guthridge retired last week following three highly successful years
as Smith's replacement.
</P>
<P>
   They felt they didn't need one. Williams, 49, was the
hand-picked replacement by Smith and many believe there was no way
he could say no to the game's all-time winningest coach.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he did.
</P>
<P>
   Smith did not attend the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Chewning, the chairman of the Educational Foundation, the
school's influential athletic fund-raising organization, said he
wasn't surprised Williams took almost a week to decide on the job
offer from the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was between him, his heart and his family. People forget
that sometimes,'' Chewning said. ''He's nobody's puppet.''
</P>
<P>
   Baddour said money wasn't a factor. Although he refused to be
specific on contract terms offered Williams, he said Williams had a
great visit to campus over the July 4 holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I even told Coach Smith one time, 'We're not going to leave
any stone unturned. We're going to do everything we can. It's like
Roy Williams doesn't know us,''' Baddour said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't good enough, though, as Williams called Baddour, Smith
and Guthridge about 7 p.m. Thursday to inform each of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were emotional conversations,'' Baddour said.
</P>
<P>
   What now for the Tar Heels, who went to two Final Fours under
Guthridge? Speculation will turn to Eddie Fogler at South Carolina
and two NBA coaches -- Larry Brown of the Philadelphia 76ers and
George Karl of the Milwaukee Bucks. All three are former Tar Heels
who have remained close to Smith and the program.
</P>
<P>
   Baddour said the school would not limit its search to coaches
with North Carolina ties and had no real timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as possible,'' Baddour said of a replacement.
''Anybody who wants to be a candidate can be a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthridge will return from a beach vacation Monday and remain
the school's interim coach until a replacement is found, Baddour
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to identify candidates, but we've got a B plan, a
C plan and a D plan,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Worries Environmentalists  </HEADLINE>
By GILLIAN FLYNN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIDDLETOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Environmentalists said Thursday they
were worried about the effects of a large oil spill that has killed
several birds and led to a ban on fishing in one of the most
fertile areas of Narragansett Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard said 14,000 gallons of oil has spilled out of a
barge that collided with a tug on Wednesday. Five swans died and 50
Canada geese were found blackened with oil.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is becoming more and more of a serious spill. There may
be quite a few injured birds and ailing wildlife around the bay,''
said John Torgan, Narragansett Bay keeper for the environmental
group Save The Bay. ''This is the most heavily fished area for
lobsters in Narragansett Bay. This will have a serious impact,
there's no way around it.''
</P>
<P>
   The 460-foot-long barge was carrying 3.8 million gallons of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials thought the oil would remain near the
barge, but there have been reports of oil sheens and tar balls four
miles south of the spill. Lobstermen were asked not to pull up
their traps; oil has coated many of the buoys that mark the traps.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Morin, a state Department of Environmental Management
administrator, said the bay will remain closed for at least a week,
which means losses of $100,000 a day for lobstermen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anytime oil hits the water we have a disaster both
environmentally and economically,'' Morin said.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials hoped light wind would lessen the spread
of the oil, and crews used vacuum trucks and oil-skimming vessels
to contain the spill.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Maritime Inc., which owns the boats that collided, took
full responsibility for the spill and dispatched 50 workers to
clean the shorelines on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The worst oil spill in Rhode Island history came in 1996, when
828,000 gallons fouled the water, killing more than 9 million
lobsters and leading to a five-month ban on fishing. A $16 million
settlement to restore the Block Island Sound environment damaged by
the spill was announced Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Edgar Cardoso, Portugal's leading civil
engineer of the past century who built bridges his critics said
would never stand, died Wednesday of a stroke. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso built more than 500 bridges in Portugal, famously
boasting that he sketched the designs first and later did the math
to prove they were feasible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, large crowds gathered for the completion of the
Arrabida bridge in Oporto, the country's second-largest city, after
Cardoso's detractors said the bridge would collapse. It still
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso also built acclaimed bridges in Brazil, Venezuela, Costa
Rica, Nigeria, Angola and Mozambique, and the landmark Taipei
bridge in Macau.
</P>
<P>
   His projects were renowned for budget overruns and missed
deadlines.
Raymond L. Clark:
</P>
<P>
   ST. ALBANS, Maine (AP) -- Raymond L. Clark, who entertained
people for seven decades by singing and yodeling authentic cowboy
songs, died Wednesday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, known as ''Yodeling Slim'' Clark, began recording in New
York in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   He made more than 100 recordings throughout his career and long
remained active as a solo performer at concerts, festivals and
rodeos with just a guitar to accompany him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Clark was inducted into the Walkway of Stars at the
Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tenn., and in the
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine country music halls of fame.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is to be inducted into the Cowboy Music Hall of Fame in
Tucson, Ariz., in November.
</P>
<P>
   Among his best-known songs were ''The Strawberry Roan,'' ''The
Cat Comes Back,'' ''Rocky Mountain Yodeler'' and ''When You're Blue
Just Yodel.''
Pete Echeverria:
</P>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Pete Echeverria, who worked to keep the mob
out of Nevada casinos during a four-year stint as chairman of the
powerful state Gaming Commission, died Wednesday. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the state Senate from 1959 to 1963, and had been on
the state Planning Board for 10 years when then-Gov. Mike
O'Callaghan named him Gaming Commission chairman in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   While on the commission, he opposed the licensing of Frank
''Lefty'' Rosenthal in Nevada's casino industry which led to a
major court battle. Rosenthal wound up being listed in Nevada's
''black book'' of unsavory types banned from the state's casinos.

<P>
   MOUNT PROSPECT, Ill. (AP) -- A woman lost the toes on her right
foot after she crawled under a commuter railcar in an attempt to
cross the tracks and catch the train.
</P>
<P>
   When the Metra train pulled into the Mount Prospect station in
suburban Chicago on Monday, Jennifer Padulo, 25, and her friend
Danielle Huculak found they were on the wrong side of the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Huculak ducked underneath the train and Padulo followed. She
scampered to the other side as the train started moving but her
foot didn't clear the steel wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was lucky it was only my foot under there, or it could have
been a huge disaster,'' Padulo said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Huculak was not hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, spokesman for Union Pacific, which runs Metra's
Northwest line, said there have been a number of injuries and
deaths caused by people crawling under, over and around trains.

<HEADLINE> Reds 12, Cardinals 6  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Alex Ochoa had three hits and a career-high
four RBIs to lead a 13-hit attack as the Cincinnati Reds beat the
St. Louis Cardinals 12-6 Thursday night to avoid a three-game
sweep.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, missing their two biggest stars most of the game,
had their NL Central lead shaved to nine games. Jim Edmonds was out
for the second straight start due to illness and Mark McGwire left
after three innings due to irritation in his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis catcher Keith McDonald became only the second player
in major league history to homer in his first two at-bats when he
connected in the second against Osvaldo Fernandez. The only other
player to accomplish the feat was Bob Nieman of the St. Louis
Browns on Sept. 14, 1951 at Boston against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald walked in his third at-bat, in the third inning, and
had a run-scoring groundout in the fifth to give him three RBIs in
his first three at-bats. His first career at-bat was a pinch-homer
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa, 3-for-5, had an RBI single in the second and a three-run
double in the ninth for the Reds, who had Ken Griffey Jr. back in
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who missed Wednesday's game due to a stomachache and
headache, was 1-for-5 with a single and two strikeouts. He was
1-for-10 in the three-game series and 2-for-22 on the Reds'
seven-game trip with two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who leads the majors with 30 home runs, was 1-for-2 --
including an RBI single in the first. He has been bothered by
patella tendinitis since spring training and the problem has
worsened the last six or seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Dessens (1-0) allowed two runs -- one earned -- on five hits
in 4 2-3 innings after Fernandez lasted only 1 1-3 innings in the
shortest start of his career. Fernandez gave up six hits and three
runs, two earned.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ankiel (6-4) lasted five innings for St. Louis, giving up
six runs -- five earned -- on five hits. He struck out seven, walked
one and threw three wild pitches, including one that handed the
Reds a run in a three-run second.
</P>
<P>
   He lost for the first time at Busch Stadium, where he had been
5-0 with a 2.48 ERA this year. Ankiel was moved up a day after
Garrett Stephenson was scratched Wednesday night due to flu.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young had three hits and two RBIs, and Chris Stynes had
three hits, including a home run in the fifth for the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Lankford homered in the sixth and ninth for the Cardinals,
who lead the majors with 145. Lankford's homers tied him with
McGwire for the most home runs hit at Busch Stadium with 105.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-game lead the Cardinals carried into the game was their
largest since Sept. 21, 1968. St. Louis and Cincinnati have three
more games, closing the season at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Cardinals outscored the Reds 8-0 in the first inning in
the series and St. Louis is 97-44 for the season in that inning.
... The Reds' Dante Bichette was removed after being hit by a pitch
on his left shin in the second. X-rays were negative. ... With his
second homer, Lankford passed Rogers Hornsby for third on the
Cardinals' career homer list with 198. ... The Cardinals haven't
swept the Reds since Sept. 15-17, 1996, at Cincinnati, and their
last sweep at home was May 15-17, 1987.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- An executive who helped launch the city's
newest newspaper, distributed free at city transit stations, has
resigned, six months after its first edition.
</P>
<P>
   Managing director Jack Roberts, who helped launch Metro in
January, said Thursday he will step down next week to teach at a
university. He didn't identify where. Roberts, 51, also cited
family reasons for leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid, owned by Sweden-based Metro International, is
published five days a week and is distributed free at bus, train
and subway stops and on buses.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority permits
distribution in those places in return for $30,000 a month in ad
revenue and one page in each paper to communicate with its riders.
</P>
<P>
   A federal lawsuit filed by the owners of The Philadelphia
Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News, USA Today and The New York
Times argues that the contract is an unconstitutional infringement
on press freedoms because other publications cannot be sold in the
same areas.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court in February refused to issue an
injunction to block distribution of Metro. It has not yet heard
arguments on the merits of the case.
